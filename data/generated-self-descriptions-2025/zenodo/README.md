## Dataset Description

**Point of Contact:** anonymous until publication

### Dataset Summary

This dataset was created to facilitate research on representational alignment between real-world human individuals and their digital representations. It extends the profiles from the [German Credit Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data) with synthetic self-descriptions regarding the creditworthiness of each individual. All self-descriptions were generated using different LLMs to create a diverse set of natural language texts.

#### Files
The dataset is divided into three parts: 

- **`prompts with profiles`**: Each sample is a text file that contains a natural language prompt with instructions for a LLM to generate 5 self-descriptions based on a specific entry from the German Credit Dataset.
  - filenames provide profile ids to match with the original German Credit Dataset entries (profiles) as follows: \<profile-id\>.txt
- **`self-descriptions`**: Each sample is a text file with 5 synthetic self-descriptions generated by either one of the models gpt-4.1, gpt-4o, llama-3.3-70b-versatile, kimi-k2-instruct, o3, or qwen-3-32b. 
  - filenames encode the model that generated the file and the profile-id to match with the respective prompt and entry from the German Credit Dataset as follows: \<model-name\>-\<profile-id\>.txt
- **`annotations`**: Each sample is a .jsonl-file with human annotations on semantic units within each natural language self-description sampled from the full dataset. The tokens were labeled using POS-tagging with the following classes:
  - `GCD_FEATURE`: The token provides information on one of the features from the German Credit Dataset
  - `ASPECT`: The token provides an additional aspect, not known from the German Credit Dataset.
  - `SPECIFICATION`: The token provides information on a feature in the German Credit Dataset, but adds specificity. 
  - `NEW_FEATURE`: The token provide a new ASPECT, that appeared more often over different letters and can be grouped into a new category named FEATURE.

Each category has files associated with it:
 - **`prompts`** (`\<profile-id\>.txt`, e.g. `2.txt`) contains the prompt that:
    - produced the outputs in `\<modelname\>_\<profile-id\>.txt` 
    - corresponds to entry number `\<profile-id\>` in the German Credit Dataset
 - **`self-descriptions`** (`\<modelname\>_\<profile-id\>.txt` e.g. `o3_2.txt`) contains self-descriptions generated by model `\<modelname\>` for the profile with line number `\<profile-id\>` in the German Credit Dataset using prompt `\<profile-id\>.txt`.
 - **`annotations`** contains ground truth labels for each token in sampled self-descriptions.


#### Collection process

Self-descriptions were generated by one-shot role prompts to each of the LLMs gpt-4.1, gpt-4o, llama-3.3-70b-versatile, kimi-k2-instruct, o3, or qwen-3-32b to create a broad spectrum of writing styles and instruction following among the generated texts. The broad spectrum of writing styles and instruction following was chosen over "best-quality" self-descriptions, because it generates most diverse qualities of representational mismatches between German Credit Dataset profiles and self-descriptions (e.g. missing features vs. only known features, or multiple additional aspects vs no additional aspects).

### Supported Tasks

The dataset supports two tasks related to representational alignment between human self-descriptions and their unified representations:

1. Binary Classification self-descriptions: Given a self-description and profile, classify if describes the profile or not.
2. Span Detection: Given a self-description and a profile, predict the character spans of 
  - (a) the profile, or
  - (b) additional informational units.

Moreover this dataset is intended to support open research to support agency of human decision targets in algorithmic decision making, e.g.:
  - finding a solution for the detection of representational misalignment (i.e. identify profiles that are no faithful copies of the real human with respect to a decision task)
  - increase transparency for humans and their digital representations

This dataset is not intended to draw statistical conclusions about the real world or any factual knowledge from the letters, as all self-descriptions are generated by LLMs.


### Languages

The dataset is in English, but a few self-descriptions are generated in other languages (German, Russian), but considered glitches.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset extends the 1000 entries of the German Credit Dataset (GCD), where each entry represents a human with respect to their creditworthiness, by synthetic self-descriptions generated by 6 LLMs. Additionally, one prompt per model did not include a profile (feature values), but only the feature names of each GCD feature to generate self-descriptions that do not correspond to a specific human ("excl GCD profile" in the table). In total, the dataset is composed of:

model                     | generated self-descriptions incl GCD profile | prompts incl GCD profile

### Data Instances
#### Prompts with Profiles

This is an example data point from the `prompts` containing the profiles from the German Credit Dataset
```
Write 5 motivation letters for a bank loan application. Each letter should be written from the perspective of a different person that could be described in the following profile. The letters should explain why the person is applying for the loan, what their financial situation is, and why they are a trustworthy candidate. Invent specific instances of all generic attributes from the profile (e.g. "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee", "8 years" instead of ">= 7 years", etc.). Keep the letters short and concise. Do not cut off the letter - be sure to write a proper ending! Do not use any formatting on the letter.

Letter 1 – Anna Richter  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Richter, 41, divorced, and the owner of “Richter Language Services”, a small translation agency I have run in Stuttgart since 2015. I am requesting a loan of 3 868 € to purchase a 2019 Volkswagen Polo (74 000 km). The car I currently own, a 2005 model, can no longer pass inspection, yet reliable transport is essential for daily client visits and for taking my eight-year-old daughter to school.

Financially, my agency has produced a stable average net income of 3 200 € per month over the last three fiscal years, verified by the tax adviser Dr. Klein. Fixed monthly expenses—including rent—amount to roughly 2 100 €, leaving more than enough room to cover the planned 24-month instalments of about 170 €. Although I do not maintain a checking account with your bank, the two small equipment credits I took in 2021 and 2022 (current combined balance 1 450 €) are serviced automatically from my savings account at Volksbank and have never been in arrears.

My eight years of impeccable self-employment, consistent turnover, and punctual repayment history demonstrate reliability. I am willing to have the new instalment collected by the same standing order and to open a current account with you to further simplify our cooperation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing any additional information you may need.

Sincerely,
Anna Richter

Letter 2 – Dr. Katharina Müller  

To the Credit Department,

I am Dr. Katharina Müller, 41, married, and senior research chemist at NovaPharm AG in Mainz, where I have been employed for nine years. I am applying for a 3 868 € loan to replace my fifteen-year-old car with a 2018 Ford Focus that will allow me to commute safely and visit trial sites across Rhineland-Palatinate.

My net salary is 4 100 € per month; my husband’s income covers household basics, so my personal outlays (insurance, rent share, childcare for our six-year-old son) are 2 600 € in total. I have maintained two standing instalment loans with your bank since 2020—both paid on time, present remaining balance 3 100 €. All other liabilities, including a small study loan at Sparkasse, are current and never in default.

Though I presently keep my day-to-day banking with Sparkasse and hold only a savings passbook (<100 € balance) at your branch, I value the professionalism your institution has shown. I am prepared to consolidate my salary payments into a newly opened checking account with you, which will directly service the requested 24-month repayment schedule of roughly 170 €.

My long, uninterrupted employment, scientific career track, and spotless payment record affirm that I am a trustworthy borrower. I would welcome the opportunity to meet and answer any questions.

Kind regards,
Dr. Katharina Müller

Letter 3 – Captain Miriam Schneider  

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

I am Captain Miriam Schneider, 41, separated, and a commissioned officer with the Federal Police, salary grade A11, stationed in Hamburg for the past twelve years. I respectfully request a loan of 3 868 € to purchase a 2020 Skoda Fabia Combi. My present vehicle has exceeded 270 000 km and is unreliable for duty travel and transporting my ten-year-old son.

My secure monthly net income stands at 3 600 €. After rent and other fixed costs of approximately 2 200 €, I retain ample disposable income to meet the projected 24-month instalment of 170 €. I hold two existing loans with your bank obtained for postgraduate study and household appliances; both are up-to-date with a punctual payment history exceeding five years.

Although I operate without a checking account at your institution, I have authorised direct debit from my salary account at Deutsche Bundesbank, ensuring timely repayment. My professional status as a federal civil servant, combined with a blemish-free credit record apart from the noted external education loan, underscores my reliability.

I would appreciate your favourable consideration and am willing to provide my service contract, payslips, and any further documentation.

Respectfully,
Captain Miriam Schneider
Tel. 040-77 19 68


Letter 4 – Elena Hofmann  

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Elena Hofmann, 41, divorced, and I have worked as a self-employed graphic designer in Munich since 2013. I seek a 3 868 € loan to acquire a 2017 Renault Kangoo, which will be adapted for transporting both design equipment and my eleven-year-old daughter.

Average monthly net earnings from my studio over the last three years are 3 000 €, confirmed by Steuerberater Herr Lorenz. Outgoings, including rented flat and business workspace, total 2 050 €. The proposed 24-month repayment at around 170 € therefore fits comfortably into my budget. Your bank currently services two earlier credits (office renovation and a colour printer) whose balances are 1 200 € and 400 €; every instalment has been remitted punctually via standing order.

Despite not yet holding a checking account with you, I am willing to migrate my business account here, bundling all obligations under one roof. Apart from a modest overdraft line at GLS-Bank, I carry no other debt, and my studio’s five-year client contracts provide predictable cash flow.

My consistent entrepreneurial record, spotless payment behaviour, and readiness to deepen my banking relationship support my suitability for this loan. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Elena Hofmann
Tel. 089-54 33 28


Letter 5 – Sandra Becker  

To whom it may concern,

I am Sandra Becker, 41, married, and have served as operations manager at Hansa Logistics GmbH in Bremen since 2016. I am applying for a 3 868 € loan to purchase a 2018 Toyota Auris Hybrid. The vehicle will replace the high-mileage company pool car I currently rely on for site inspections and for transporting my nine-year-old son.

My regular net income is 3 800 € per month. Household expenses, including rent, utilities, and insurance, reach 2 300 €, giving enough headroom for the envisaged 170 € monthly repayment over 24 months. I have maintained two small consumer loans with your bank (home furniture and laptop) since 2021, each consistently paid on schedule; remaining combined balance is 1 760 €.

While I do not yet hold a checking account with your institution, I will open one and arrange for my salary to be deposited there, permitting automatic debit for all three loans. I possess a fully owned 2011 motor scooter valued at approximately 1 200 €, offering additional collateral alongside a strong employment contract and positive credit track record—my only other commitment is a modest credit card balance cleared monthly.

I trust these facts illustrate my reliability and ability to repay. I look forward to your positive response and am available for further clarification at any time.

Best regards,
Sandra Becker

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The dataset was created to support research on representational aligment between human self-descriptions and their digital representations with respect to an algorithmic decision task. All self-descriptions are generated by LLMs, to compensate for the lack of real world data and protect privacy of real world humans, that self-descriptions would typically entail. We believe that algorithmic decision making about humans should be open to contestation, and fostering transparency and user agency in this area seems necessary to us.

### Source Data
The dataset was created semi-automatically by prompting a large variety of LLMs (gpt-4.1, gpt-4o, llama-3.3-70b-versatile, kimi-k2-instruct, o3, or qwen-3-32b) to generate self-descriptions based on entries from the German Credit Dataset, were each entry represents a different human loan applicant.
All models were prompted with all 1000 profiles from the German Credit Dataset and each model generated five letters per profile in response. The resulting dataset contains 6*5*1001 self-descriptions, with the first generation being a free profile based only on the header of the profile dataset.

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

The annotations were obtained manually, as a result from an expert annotation in a Part-of-Speech-tagging like setting. The author of the paper is the single annotator of this initial dataset.

### Personal and Sensitive Information

All personal and sensitive information from the German Credit Dataset (were real humans are represented) are also present in our dataset. Additional personal and sensitive information could only leak from the LLMs prompted to generate the self-descriptions with respect to these profiles. Even if all generated data in out dataset is intended to be fictional, exclusion of resemblence to or leakage of real-world data through the generative models cannot be guaranteed.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

This dataset can help foster human agency and transparency over representations of humans in algorithmic decision making in tasks were humans are the decision targets.

### Discussion of Biases

Since the data was generated semi-automatically by prompting different LLMs to generate self-descriptions of real-world humans given their representation in the German Credit Dataset, it is likely to contain any biases present in these models and in the German Credit Dataset.
We did not make an investigation to quantify this content.

### Other Known Limitations

The self-descriptions were generated by LLMs and mimic (fictional) real world humans. Any statistical information drawn from these self-descriptions does not relate to the distribution in the real world and should not be used to infer any factual knowledge.
Apart from differences between profiles, no supposed information, fact or claim in the generated texts can be used to generate knowledge about the real world.
