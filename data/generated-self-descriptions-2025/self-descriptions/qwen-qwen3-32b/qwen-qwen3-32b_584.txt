Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person is a foreign worker, female, 26 years old, married/divorced/separated, with one dependent. She's a skilled employee or official, has been in her current job for 1-3 years, has no checking account, but has a savings account under 100 DM. She's been in her residence for 2 years, rents housing, has real estate as property, and has a credit history of paying back existing credits. The loan purpose is furniture/equipment, amount 1388 DM, installment rate 4.

Each letter needs to be unique, with specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant" or "nurse" etc. Let me brainstorm different jobs that fit the "skilled employee" category. Maybe teacher, nurse, IT technician, administrative officer, and something else.

Also, each person should have different reasons for needing furniture. Maybe a new apartment, home office setup, child's room, renovation after an incident, or upgrading old furniture. Let me make sure each letter includes why they need the loan, their financial situation (stable job, existing credit paid back, real estate as collateral), and why they're trustworthy (steady income, good credit history, responsibility).

Need to avoid formatting, keep letters concise, proper endings. Let me outline each person:

1. Maria, 26, foreign worker from Spain, scientific research assistant in Berlin for 2.5 years. Recently moved into a new apartment, needs furniture. Has real estate in her home country. Trustworthy because she's paid back previous credit for a laptop.

2. Amina, 26, nurse from Nigeria, working in Hamburg for 3 years. Needs furniture for her daughter's room. Has a small savings bond. Trustworthy due to steady income and timely payments on her existing loan.

3. Li, 26, IT technician from China, in Munich for 1.5 years. Needs office furniture for home workspace. Real estate as collateral. Has a history of repaying a previous credit for a car.

4. Elena, 26, administrative officer from Romania, in Frankfurt for 2 years. Needs to replace old furniture after a flood. Has real estate and a good credit history. No checking account but manages savings.

5. Fatima, 26, teacher from Morocco, in Cologne for 3 years. Needs to furnish a new rental apartment. Has real estate and has repaid a previous loan for educational materials.

Each letter should mention specific details like job title, duration, reason for loan, existing credit, and collateral. Also, address the bank formally, state the purpose, financial stability, and trustworthiness. Make sure each ends politely, thanking the bank and expressing willingness to provide more info.

I need to check that each letter doesn't repeat the same reasons and jobs. Also, ensure that all profile attributes are covered: no checking account, savings <100 DM, current job 1-3 years, etc. Each person has a dependent, so maybe a child, spouse, or relative. Since personal status is female, divorced/separated/married, maybe mention being a single parent or married with a dependent.

Also, since they have real estate, maybe in their home country or another place. Since they're foreign workers, perhaps the real estate is in their home country. Need to clarify that in the letters as collateral.

Now, draft each letter with these specifics, keeping them concise, no markdown, proper closing.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Maria Alvarez and I am a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute for Environmental Sciences where I have worked for 2 years and 9 months. I am 26 years old and currently renting a two-bedroom apartment which I moved into 8 months ago. I am applying for a loan of 1388 DM to purchase essential furniture including a sofa and dining set to complete my new living space.  

I have no checking account but maintain a savings bond worth 80 DM which I have contributed to consistently for the past year. I have repaid a previous credit for laboratory equipment training in full and on time over the last 18 months. My monthly income is 2400 DM and I currently have no other installment plans. As a foreign worker from Spain I have lived in Germany for 4 years and own real estate in my hometown which I can provide as collateral. I am married with one daughter who is 3 years old and I believe this loan will allow me to create a more stable home environment for our family. I assure you of my reliability through my steady employment and punctual repayment history.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any additional information or documentation required.  

Sincerely  
Maria Alvarez
