Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the provided profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully to ensure each letter includes all required attributes with specific instances.

The profile mentions a foreign worker, male, single, 40 years old, with a savings account between 500-1000 DM, no checking account, existing credit paid back, employment for at least 7 years, residence since 4 years, housing in own, job as skilled employee or official, purpose for radio/television, credit amount 2675, installment rate 3, no other debts, one existing credit at the bank, no telephone. 

I need to invent specific instances for generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "scientific research assistant," "electrician," etc. Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They must be concise, not cut off, and properly ended. No formatting, so just plain text with line breaks.

First, I'll brainstorm five different job roles that fit "skilled employee / official." Maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, IT technician, civil servant, and a mechanical engineer. Each person's purpose for the loan is radio/television, but I can vary it slightly—like upgrading equipment, buying a new TV for a home office, etc.

Next, each letter should mention their savings, existing credit history, employment duration, residence, and other specifics. Since they have one existing credit at the bank, I'll note that they've been paying it back on time. They need to emphasize trustworthiness through their credit history and stable job.

I need to make sure each letter is unique. Vary the reasons for the loan within the purpose, different savings amounts (between 500-1000 DM), different job roles, and maybe different aspects of their situation. Also, since they are foreign workers, maybe mention their country of origin or how long they've been in the country if relevant.

Check for the required elements: no checking account, existing credit paid back, savings in specified range, employment duration >=7 years, residence since 4 years, etc. Each letter must include these without being repetitive.

Now, structure each letter with a proper salutation, body paragraphs explaining the purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and a polite closing. Keep them short but complete. Avoid any markdown, just plain text with line breaks.

Let me start drafting the first one. For example, a scientific research assistant applying for a loan to purchase a radio for his home office. Mention his 8 years at the job, savings of 750 DM, existing credit paid back, living in the same residence for 4 years, etc. Then proceed similarly for the others with different roles and slight variations in details.
