Okay, I need to create five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account balance under 0 DM, which is negative. The person has had their checking account for 36 months (3 years). Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The loan purpose is a new car, amount 3249 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employment duration between 4-7 years. Installment rate 2 (maybe 2 DM per month?), but not sure. Personal status: male, single, with 2 dependents. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 4 months. No property. Age 39. Other installment plans with the bank. Housing is free. One existing credit at the bank. Job in management, self-employed, or similar. Has a telephone and is a registered foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique. Let me think of different jobs within the job category. The job can be management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, or officer. Let me pick different roles: maybe a project manager, a self-employed consultant, a research scientist, a mid-level manager, and a freelance graphic designer. Each person will have their own reason for needing the car, their employment situation, and how they're trustworthy.

For each letter, they need to explain why they need the loan (car), their financial situation (negative checking account but paid back credits, low savings, existing credit), and why they're trustworthy (steady job, good credit history, dependents, etc.).

Let me start with the first person. Maybe a project manager at a construction company. He needs a car for work commutes. He has been employed for 5 years, has a stable job, and is paying back an existing loan. He mentions his dependents, which shows responsibility. He'll explain that even though his checking account is negative now, it's due to recent car repairs, but he's managed to pay back previous loans.

Second person: self-employed IT consultant. He needs a car for client visits. He's been in business for 6 years, has a good client base. His savings are low because he invested in equipment, but he's repaid past loans. He mentions his residence is new because he moved closer to clients, but that's why he needs the car.

Third: a research scientist at a university. His checking account is negative due to paying for conference travel, but he's paid all previous credits. He needs a car for commuting since public transport is unreliable. He's been employed for 4 years, has dependents, and has a stable salary.

Fourth: a mid-level manager in retail. Needs a car for long commutes. Employed for 6 years, has a good track record. His savings are low because he's saving for a house, but he's managing current expenses and has no delinquencies.

Fifth: a freelance graphic designer. Needs a car for meeting clients. Self-employed for 5 years, has contracts and invoices to show income. His checking account is negative due to paying for software licenses, but he's repaid past bank loans. He mentions his dependents and stable work.

Each letter should be concise, mention specific numbers from the profile (like 39 years old, 2 dependents, 36 months checking account, etc.), and tie in why they are trustworthy. Make sure each has a unique scenario but fits the profile. Also, check that all profile elements are addressed: existing credit paid back, savings under 100 DM, no other debtors, etc.

Now, draft each letter step by step, ensuring they are distinct and include the necessary details without being too long. Avoid formatting, just plain text with proper endings.

**Letter 1: Project Manager**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am writing to request a loan of 3,249 DM to purchase a new car. As a project manager at a construction firm for the past 5 years, I require reliable transportation to visit job sites and meet clients. My current checking account balance is temporarily negative due to recent emergency vehicle repairs, but I have consistently repaid my existing bank credit for the past 36 months. I have two dependents and reside in my current home for free, which reduces household expenses. My stable income, combined with a proven track record of timely repayments, assures you of my ability to meet installment obligations. I kindly ask for your trust in my financial responsibility.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Reinhardt

**Letter 2: Self-Employed IT Consultant**  
Dear Bank Manager,  
I seek a loan to purchase a new car, essential for traveling to client sites as a self-employed IT consultant. With 6 years in business, I have maintained steady income and repaid a prior bank credit fully. My checking account is currently overdrawn due to recent software investments, but my savings account reflects minimal balances as I prioritize business growth. I have lived at my current residence for 4 months after relocating for work, and my 39-year-old household includes two dependents. I am committed to repaying this loan, as demonstrated by my punctual payments on existing obligations.  

Respectfully,  
Lars Müller

**Letter 3: Research Scientist**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am applying for a car loan to ease my daily commute, as public transport is unreliable in my area. As a scientific research assistant at a university, I have worked for 4 years and consistently repaid my existing credit. My checking account is currently negative due to recent conference travel expenses, but my monthly income remains stable. I have no property but contribute to a household of two dependents. My 36-month account history and adherence to repayment schedules underscore my reliability. I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling this loan’s terms.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Thomas Becker

**Letter 4: Retail Manager**  
Dear Bank Representative,  
I request 3,249 DM to replace my aging car, which is critical for commuting to my role as a retail store manager. Employed for 6 years, I have no delinquencies on my existing credit and maintain a good relationship with the bank. My savings account holds less than 100 DM due to recent home repairs, but I manage expenses responsibly. At 39, I support two dependents and reside in a free housing arrangement, allowing me to allocate funds toward repayments. My job stability and history of timely payments make me a trustworthy candidate.  

Gratefully,  
Andreas Fischer

**Letter 5: Freelance Graphic Designer**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am applying for a car loan to facilitate client meetings as a freelance graphic designer. With 5 years of self-employment, I have generated consistent income and repaid prior debts without issue. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to software subscription costs, but my financial situation is stable. I have two dependents and live in my current residence for 4 months; I own no property but prioritize savings for the future. My existing credit history and dedication to meeting obligations assure you of my reliability. I appreciate your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Weber
