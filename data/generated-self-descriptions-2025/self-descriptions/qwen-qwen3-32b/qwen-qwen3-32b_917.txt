Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM with a duration of 48 months. Credit history is clean—no issues. The purpose is "others," so I need to come up with different purposes for each letter. The credit amount is 18,424 DM. Savings account is less than 100 DM. Employment duration is 1-4 years. Personal status is female, divorced/separated/married, with one dependent. They have a telephone and are a registered foreign worker. Property is a building society savings agreement or life insurance. Housing is own. Existing credits at the bank: 1. Job is management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/officer. Other installment plans: bank.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different job roles first. The job category includes management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, officer. Let me pick specific roles: maybe a project manager, a freelance graphic designer, a nurse, a small business owner, and a teacher. Each with different purposes for the loan—maybe home improvements, starting a business, education, medical expenses, and a car purchase? Wait, the purpose is "others," so I can't use standard ones. Maybe home renovation, purchasing equipment for a business, paying for a course, covering an emergency fund, or expanding a business.

Let me outline each person:

1. Project Manager: Purpose could be home renovation. She's been working for 3 years, has a savings agreement, divorced with one child. She needs the loan to fix her house to increase its value. Trustworthy because she has a stable job and paid back previous credit.

2. Freelance Graphic Designer: Maybe she wants to buy a new computer and software. She's self-employed for 2 years, has a life insurance policy. She's reliable, has a good credit history, and uses the loan to grow her business.

3. Nurse: Purpose could be to cover medical bills for her family. She's been employed for 3 years, has a savings agreement. She needs the loan for an emergency and can repay through her stable income.

4. Small Business Owner (Café Owner): Expanding her café. She's been in business for 3 years, has a life insurance policy. Needs funds for new equipment. Trustworthy with a good credit history.

5. Teacher: Taking a course to advance her career. She's been teaching for 2 years, has a savings agreement. Needs the loan for tuition fees, which will increase her earning potential.

Now, each letter needs to include specific numbers: checking account duration 48 months (4 years), savings <100 DM, employment since 1-4 years (so 2, 3, etc.), age 32, dependents 1, etc. Each letter should explain why they're trustworthy—stable job, paid back previous credits, savings plan, etc.

Let me check the example given in the user's instruction: "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee", "8 years" instead of ">=7 years". So I need to make all attributes specific.

Also, each letter must be short and concise, not cut off, proper ending. No formatting. Let me start drafting each one, making sure to vary the purposes and jobs, include specific numbers, and address the bank properly.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Anna Müller and I am a project manager at a construction firm in Munich. I have been employed in this role for 3 years and have a stable income that allows me to manage my monthly expenses. I am applying for a loan of 18,424 DM to renovate my kitchen which requires urgent repairs to meet safety standards. Although my checking account balance is currently 150 DM and my savings account holds 80 DM I have maintained a good credit history with no delinquencies. My 32 years of experience in project management and my consistent payments on my existing car loan demonstrate my reliability. I reside in my own home and have lived in the same neighborhood for 2 years. I believe this loan will help me improve my living conditions and I am committed to repaying it promptly.  

Sincerely  
Anna Müller
