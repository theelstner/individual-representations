Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand all the requirements.

First, the profile has several key points: the applicant has a checking account with less than 200 DM, has had it for 12 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 2762. Savings account is unknown or none. Employment for at least 7 years. Installment rate 1. Female, divorced/separated/married, no other debtors. Residence for 2 years. Property: building society savings or life insurance. Age 25. Other installment plans with bank. Housing is own. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. One dependent. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I should vary the specific details. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different jobs (scientific research assistant, teacher, nurse, office manager, etc.), different reasons for furniture (new apartment, home office, child's room, etc.), and different personal situations (divorced, separated, married). Also, mention the existing credit, like a car loan or student loan paid back. Need to ensure each letter explains why they need the loan, their financial stability, and trustworthiness.

Let me start with the first person. Let's pick a scientific research assistant. She's 25, married, has a dependent. She needs furniture for a new home office. She's had a stable job for 8 years. She has a building society savings. She mentions her existing credit for a car, paid back. She can mention her steady income and residence for 2 years. Also, she has a telephone and foreign worker registered.

Second person: maybe a teacher. Separated, needs furniture for a child's room. Employment for 7 years. Existing credit for a laptop. She can mention her stable job and own housing.

Third: a nurse, divorced, needs to furnish a living room. 9 years in job. Paid back a student loan. Has a life insurance as property.

Fourth: office manager, married, needs kitchen equipment. 7 years employed. Existing credit for a vacation. Has a building society.

Fifth: maybe a civil servant, separated, needs to buy a sofa. 10 years in job. Paid back a previous furniture loan. Has savings bond.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, mentions specific numbers (like 8 years, 7 years), specific job titles, and specific purposes. Also, include the elements from the profile: checking account duration, credit history, installment plans, residence, etc. Avoid generic terms. Each letter should end properly with a closing. Let me check each point is covered in each letter. Also, ensure that each applicant has a different scenario but fits the profile. Let me start drafting each one, keeping them short and to the point.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Anna Müller and I am applying for a loan of 2762 DM to purchase new furniture for my home office. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin I have worked in my current position for 8 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2400 DM. I have already repaid a car loan through this bank and currently have no other outstanding debts. Though my checking account balance is modest I consistently pay my bills on time and have maintained my account for 12 months. I own a two-bedroom apartment in Spandau and have lived there for 2 years. My husband and I have one child and I am confident my income will allow me to meet the monthly installment of 1 DM. I have attached proof of employment and my building society savings agreement for your review. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Anna Müller

Dear Bank Manager  

I am writing to request a loan of 2762 DM to furnish my daughter’s bedroom. My name is Sabine Hartmann and I work as a primary school teacher in Dresden. I have been employed at the same school for 7 years and receive a monthly salary of 2200 DM. I am currently separated and live in my own home which I have owned for 5 years. I have fully repaid a previous loan for a laptop through this bank and have no other debts. My checking account has been active for 12 months though my balance is low due to recent educational expenses. I have a life insurance policy valued at 15000 DM and can provide documentation of my stable income. With one dependent and a reliable payment history I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to your positive response.  

Yours faithfully  
Sabine Hartmann
