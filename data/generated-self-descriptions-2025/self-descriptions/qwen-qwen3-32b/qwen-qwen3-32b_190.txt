Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile thoroughly. 

First, the profile says the person has a checking account with less than 0 DM, so they might be in a tight financial situation. The duration of the checking account is 12 months. Credit history is good—existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is for radio/television, which is a specific need. The credit amount is 674 DM. Savings account is between 100-500 DM. Present employment since 4-7 years. Installment rate is 4. Personal status is male, married or widowed. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 1 month. Property is building society savings or life insurance. Age 20. No other installment plans. Housing is own. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

Each letter needs to be from a different person with specific instances. So I need to vary the roles, maybe different jobs within skilled employees or officials. Also, different reasons for needing the loan (radio/television), but perhaps different contexts. Also, since they are foreign workers, maybe from different countries. Let me think of five different scenarios.

First person: Maybe a scientific research assistant from India, working in Germany. He needs a TV to stay connected with family. He's been employed for 5 years. His savings are 300 DM. He's married with a child. Lives in own housing. Has a building society savings. 

Second person: Maybe an electrician from Poland. Needs a radio for his business to get updates. Employed for 6 years. Savings 200 DM. Widowed, has a dependent child. 

Third: A nurse from Spain. Needs a TV for language learning. Employed 4 years. Savings 400 DM. Married, one child. 

Fourth: A mechanic from Morocco. Needs a radio for his workshop. Employed 5 years. Savings 150 DM. Widowed. 

Fifth: An IT technician from Vietnam. Needs a TV for his child's education. Employed 6 years. Savings 350 DM. Married, one child. 

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation (mention checking account negative, savings amount, employment duration, existing credit paid back), and why they're trustworthy. They all have one existing credit at the bank, which they've paid back. Also, they are foreign workers, so maybe mention their commitment to Germany, stable job, etc.

Make sure each letter is concise, starts with their name, address, date, then to the bank. Then body explaining purpose, financials, trustworthiness. End with thanks and signature.

Check for specific numbers: age 20? Wait, age in the profile is 20. Wait, that's a problem. The age is 20, but they are married or widowed with dependents. That seems young. Maybe the age in the profile is a typo? Or maybe it's in another context. Wait, maybe the age is 20 years old? But being a married 20-year-old with a dependent? That's unusual. Maybe it's a mistake. The original data might have age as 20-29 or similar. But according to the profile, age is 20. Hmm. Maybe the person is 20 years old, married, has a dependent. Maybe in some cultures, that's possible. I'll proceed as given.

But in the letters, maybe adjust the age to make it plausible. Wait, the user says to invent specific instances of all generic attributes. The profile says age is 20. So I have to use that. So each applicant is 20 years old, married or widowed, with one dependent. That's challenging. Maybe they are part of a community where early marriage is common. Or perhaps the age is in error, but I have to follow the profile. So I need to write letters where each applicant is 20, married or widowed, with one dependent. Let me think how to present that.

For example, a 20-year-old foreign worker from a country where early marriage is common. Maybe in some regions, young marriages happen. So the person is a skilled employee, 20 years old, married with a child. They have been in their current job for 5 years. They have a residence since 1 month, maybe they just moved to Germany. They have a building society savings. Their checking account is negative, but they have a savings account between 100-500. 

Each letter needs to address the loan purpose (radio/television), explain their financial situation (current checking account status, savings, employment duration, existing credit history), and trustworthiness. Also, mention no other debts, own housing, etc.

Let me start drafting the first letter.

Name: Mr. Rajesh Kumar, Scientific Research Assistant from India. Age 20, married, one child. Employed 5 years at a university lab. Savings 300 DM. Needs TV to stay connected with family. Existing credit paid back. Trustworthy because of stable job, good credit history, savings, own housing.

Second letter: Mr. Adam Nowak, Electrician from Poland. 20 years old, widowed, one child. Employed 6 years. Savings 200 DM. Needs radio for business. Trustworthy because of timely payments, stable job, own home.

Third: Maria Garcia, nurse from Spain. 20, married, one child. 4 years employed. Savings 400. TV for language courses. Reliable.

Fourth: Youssef El Amrani, mechanic from Morocco. 20, widowed, child. 5 years job. Radio for workshop. Savings 150. Trustworthy.

Fifth: Mr. Minh Tran, IT technician from Vietnam. 20, married, child. 6 years employed. TV for child's education. Savings 350.

Each letter should have specific details. Also, mention the existing credit at the bank, paid back. Check that each letter includes all required elements. Make sure they are concise, not too long. Avoid formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Also, no telephone, so maybe mention that they don't have a phone, but that's part of the profile. Not sure if relevant. Maybe not necessary to include unless it's part of contact info. But in the letters, maybe not mention unless it's relevant. Since they need to be concise.

Also, the loan amount is 674 DM. Each letter should mention the purpose (radio/TV) and the amount. Maybe specify that the installment rate is 4, which is manageable given their income.

Now, let me draft each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered.

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 674 DM to purchase a television. As a 20-year-old scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute for Environmental Science, I have been employed for 5 years and have consistently repaid my existing bank credit for laboratory equipment. My savings account holds 300 DM, and I own a building society savings agreement. Though my current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent medical expenses for my 1-year-old daughter, my stable income ensures timely repayment. I reside in my own apartment and, as a foreign worker from India, value financial responsibility. I am confident in my ability to meet the 4 DM installment rate monthly.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar
