Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a foreign worker, age 23, married with one dependent, employed as a skilled employee or official for 1-4 years, existing checking account for 12 months with less than 0 DM, credit history of existing credits paid back, purpose is a new car, credit amount 900, no savings account, housing is own, no other debts, etc.

I need to create five different people. Let me brainstorm different job roles for skilled employees. Maybe a mechanic, a lab technician, IT technician, electrician, and a scientific research assistant. Each should have a unique reason for needing the car. For example, commuting to work, transporting family, work requirements, etc.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their job, duration, dependents, housing, and repayment ability. Also, since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their legal status or work visa.

Let me check the example given in the prompt. It says "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee". So I need to make sure each person has specific job titles and numbers. For instance, instead of saying "employed for 1-4 years", pick specific years like 2 years, 3 years, etc.

Also, the letters should be concise, no formatting, proper ending. Let me outline each person:

1. Automotive Mechanic: Needs a car for commuting to work, maybe works at a repair shop. Has been employed for 2 years. Married with a child. Lives in own housing. Paid back previous credit.

2. Lab Technician: Needs a car to transport samples. Employed for 3 years. Maybe mentions that the car is necessary for work duties.

3. IT Technician: Requires a reliable car for client visits. Employed for 1.5 years. Could mention that the job requires travel.

4. Electrician: Needs a van for tools and job site travel. Employed for 3 years. Married, one dependent.

5. Research Assistant: Needs a car to commute between campus locations. Employed for 2 years. Might mention that the university requires a vehicle for fieldwork.

Each should mention their stable job, current employment duration, existing credit history, and ability to repay with the installment rate (4 DM). Also, since they have no savings account, maybe they have other savings or assets like a car (property: car or other). They have an existing credit paid back, so maybe a previous loan for something else.

Make sure each letter has specific numbers: e.g., "employed for 2.5 years", "living at current residence for 2 months", "checking account for 12 months".

Avoid generic terms. Use specific instances. Also, since they're foreign workers, maybe mention they have a work visa or are legally employed.

Now, let me draft each letter step by step, ensuring they meet all the criteria and are distinct from each other.

Dear Bank Loan Committee  

My name is Daniel Kim, 23, a foreign worker from South Korea employed as an automotive mechanic at AutoFix GmbH since March 2021. I am married with one child and reside in my own apartment in Munich. I seek a 900 DM loan to purchase a reliable car for daily commuting, as my current vehicle is beyond repair. I have consistently repaid my previous credit for vocational training, and my monthly income of 2,200 DM allows me to allocate 4 DM toward installments. Though I have no savings account, my employer confirms my stable employment and direct salary deposits. I assure timely repayments and appreciate your consideration.  

Sincerely  
Daniel Kim

Dear Sir/Madam  

I am Luisa Mendes, 23, a Portuguese national working as a laboratory technician at BioMed Labs since June 2022. I am married with one dependent and own a small apartment in Frankfurt. The loan is necessary to acquire a new car for transporting medical samples between facilities. My current vehicle lacks insurance due to repair costs. With a monthly salary of 2,400 DM and a clean credit history—including a repaid student loan—I can commit to 4 DM installments. My employer guarantees continued employment, and I have no outstanding debts. Your support would greatly enhance my professional efficiency.  

Yours faithfully  
Luisa Mendes

Dear Bank Committee  

As a 23-year-old IT technician from India, employed at TechSolutions since January 2023, I request a 900 DM loan for a new car. I am married, living in my own home in Berlin, and have one child. My current job requires frequent client visits, which my aging motorcycle cannot accommodate. I have fully repaid a prior credit for certification courses and maintain a steady income of 2,100 DM. Though I lack a savings account, my 12-month checking history and employer’s confirmation of my 3-year contract assure my repayment capacity. I pledge to meet all obligations.  

Respectfully  
Raj Patel

The loan is essential to purchase a van for carrying tools and equipment to job sites. My previous credit for safety gear was repaid in full, and my monthly earnings of 2,300 DM allow 4 DM installments.

Sincerely
