Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile details: The person has a checking account with at least 200 DM and a salary assigned there for at least a year. The loan duration is 18 months, credit history shows all past credits were paid back. The purpose is for radio/television, amount is 2100 DM. Savings account is less than 100 DM. Employment duration is between 1 to 4 years. Installment rate is 4. They're a single male, have a co-applicant, residence since 2 years, property is real estate, age 37, other installment plans at stores, housing is own, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, and foreign worker.

I need to create five different people with specific roles instead of generic terms. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe a "scientific research assistant," "electrician," "tax clerk," "mechanic," and "IT support technician." Each should have unique details but fit the profile.

Each letter must explain why they need the loan (radio/television), their financial situation (checking account, savings, employment, etc.), and why they're trustworthy (credit history, co-applicant, residence, etc.). They need to be concise, not cut off, and properly ended.

Let me start with the first person. Maybe a scientific research assistant with 8 years of experience. He's been in Germany for 3 years, has a co-applicant (maybe his sister), and needs the TV for his family. Mention his stable job, timely payments, residence for 2 years, and real estate. Make sure to include all the numbers from the profile.

Second, an electrician. He's been working for a company for 3 years. His wife is the co-applicant. He needs a TV for his child's education. Mention his savings are low but he has real estate. Highlight his timely repayments and stable job.

Third, a tax clerk. Maybe she's been employed for 2.5 years. Her spouse is co-applicant. Needs TV for home entertainment. Mention her credit history, residence duration, and existing credit at the bank.

Fourth, a mechanic. He's been in his job for 2 years, has a co-applicant (partner). TV for family use. Emphasize his steady income and property ownership.

Fifth, IT support technician. Employed for 1.5 years. Co-applicant is his brother. TV for relaxation. Highlight his timely payments and real estate.

I need to ensure each letter has specific numbers: 8 years in job (but present employment is 1-4 years), wait, the profile says present employment since 1 <= ... <4 years. So current job is between 1 to 4 years. Maybe each person has different employment duration within that range. For example, 2 years, 3 years, etc. Also, age is 37, so each applicant is 37. Dependents: 1. Housing is own. Property: real estate. So each has their own real estate, maybe a apartment or house.

Also, savings account less than 100 DM. So they don't have much savings. Installment rate is 4 DM? Or 4%? Probably 4 DM per month? Maybe the installment rate is 4 DM per month. But the credit amount is 2100, over 18 months, so monthly payment would be around 116.66 DM. Maybe the installment rate refers to something else. Maybe the rate is 4% interest? Not sure, but maybe it's better to not overcomplicate. Just mention the monthly payment is manageable.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then a subject line. Then the body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. End with thanks and signature.

Need to avoid generic terms. Use specific job titles. Also, foreign worker: yes. So each applicant is a foreign worker. Maybe mention their legal status or years in the country.

Let me draft the first one:

Name: Ahmed Mohamed, Scientific Research Assistant at a university. Employed for 2.5 years. Checking account for over a year. Co-applicant is his sister. Needs TV for family. Paid back previous loans. Lives in own apartment for 2 years. Has real estate (maybe he owns a property already? Or the housing is own, meaning he owns his home? The profile says housing: own, so property is real estate. So he owns his home. Maybe mention that.

Check each letter for all profile attributes. Make sure each has:

- Checking account >=200 DM, salary there for 1 year.

- Credit history: existing credits paid back.

- Purpose: radio/TV.

- Savings <100 DM.

- Employment 1-4 years.

- Male, single, but wait the profile says personal status and sex: male: single. So each is a single male? Or maybe the profile says male or single? Let me check the original: "Personal status and sex:male   : single" – probably male and single. So each applicant is a single male. So in the letters, they are single, with one dependent (maybe a child or parent). Co-applicant is someone else, maybe a family member.

Dependents: 1. So each has one dependent, maybe a child or parent they support.

Telephone: none. So they don't have a phone, which might be a detail to mention? Maybe not necessary, but the profile includes it, so perhaps include that they don't have a telephone, but focus on other aspects.

Foreign worker: yes. So each is a foreign worker, maybe mention their legal status or years in the country.

Let me try writing the first letter.

Ahmed Mohamed, 37, scientific research assistant at a university, employed for 3 years. Checking account with 250 DM, salary there for 15 months. Savings: 80 DM. Credit history: paid back. Needs TV for family. Co-applicant is sister. Owns apartment. Dependents: one daughter. No phone. Foreign worker from Egypt, living in Germany for 5 years. Installment rate manageable with his salary.

Second letter: Electrician, maybe Carlos Fernandez, 37, employed at a construction company for 2 years. Checking account 220 DM, salary there for 13 months. Savings 50 DM. Credit history good. Needs TV for his son's educational programs. Co-applicant is wife. Owns a house. One dependent (son). No phone. Foreign worker from Spain, in Germany 4 years.

Third: Tax clerk, maybe Rajesh Patel, 37, employed at a accounting firm for 2.5 years. Checking account 210 DM, salary there for 14 months. Savings 90 DM. Needs TV for family. Co-applicant is spouse. Owns property. One dependent. No phone. Foreign worker from India, in Germany 3 years.

Fourth: Mechanic, maybe Lars Müller, but he's German? Wait, foreign worker. Maybe Lars is a foreigner. Let me think. Maybe Lars is from Poland, working in Germany. 37, employed at a garage for 2 years. Checking account 230 DM, salary there for 12 months. Savings 70 DM. Needs TV. Co-applicant is his brother. Owns apartment. One dependent. No phone. Foreign worker from Poland, in Germany 2 years.

Fifth: IT support technician, maybe Yuki Tanaka, 37, employed at a tech company for 1.5 years. Checking account 240 DM, salary there for 11 months. Savings 60 DM. Needs TV. Co-applicant is brother. Owns property. One dependent. No phone. Foreign worker from Japan, in Germany 3 years.

Each letter should mention their job, employment duration, checking account details, savings, purpose, co-applicant, property, dependents, foreign worker status, and credit history.

Now, write each letter with these details, making sure to vary the specifics and keep it concise. Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan (TV for family, for educational use, entertainment, etc.). Each letter should have a slightly different angle but same purpose.

Also, ensure that each has the correct numbers: 18 months, 2100 DM, etc. Mention the installment is manageable with their income.

Check that each letter is properly ended with a closing and signature.

Okay, I think that's a solid plan. Now, time to draft each letter.
