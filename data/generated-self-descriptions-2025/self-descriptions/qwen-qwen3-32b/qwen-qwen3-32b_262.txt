Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on a given profile. First, I need to parse the profile carefully to make sure each letter includes all the specific details. 

The profile mentions a foreign worker, male, single, 27 years old, with a skilled job (like scientific research assistant), existing credit paid back, checking account under 0 DM, savings under 100 DM, etc. Each letter needs to be unique but still fit these parameters. 

I need to invent specific instances for generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs. Let me brainstorm different jobs that fit: maybe a lab technician, IT support specialist, electrician, teacher, and a mechanic. Each of these is a skilled position.

Next, each person's purpose is furniture/equipment. I should vary the specific items. Maybe a desk for a home office, a sofa, kitchen appliances, a bedroom set, and a dining table. That adds variety.

Financial situation: They all have a similar profile, but I need to present it differently. Mention their stable employment, duration, credit history, savings, etc. Also, highlight trustworthiness through timely repayments and stable residence.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank details. Then explain their purpose, financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Make sure each letter is concise but covers all points. Avoid repetition in reasons for the loan and personal circumstances.

Check for the specific numbers: 8 years of employment? Wait, the profile says present employment since 1 <= ... <4 years. So each person has between 1 to 4 years in their current job. Maybe 2.5 years for one, 3 years for another, etc. Also, age is 27, so maybe vary slightly? Wait, the profile says age 27, so all applicants are 27. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Maybe they're all 27 but have different job durations within 1-4 years.

Also, they have one existing credit at the bank. Maybe mention that they already have a loan (like a car loan) paid back duly. Savings under 100 DM, checking account negative. But they have real estate as property, own housing. Dependents: 1, so maybe a child or a parent? Since they're single, perhaps a child.

Need to make sure each letter is unique. Let me outline each person:

1. Lab Technician: Needs furniture for a home office. Employed at a university lab for 3 years. Has a dependent child. Already repaid a previous loan for equipment.

2. IT Support Specialist: Applying for a sofa. Works at a tech company for 2.5 years. Has a sister to care for, hence dependents. Previous credit for a laptop.

3. Electrician: Wants kitchen appliances. Self-employed for 3 years. Lives in own apartment. Previous credit for tools.

4. Teacher: Needs a bedroom set. Works at a school for 1 year. Has a young child. Previous student loan repaid.

5. Mechanic: Applying for a dining table. Works at a garage for 4 years (wait, profile says present employment since 1 <= ... <4, so up to less than 4. Maybe 3.5 years). Dependent parent living with him. Previous credit for a workshop setup.

Wait, the employment duration is 1 to 4 years, so each person's employment duration should be within that range. Let me adjust the examples to fit. Also, the existing credit at the bank is 1, so each has one existing credit, which they paid back. Need to specify what each credit was for, varying per person.

Make sure each letter ends properly with a closing statement expressing willingness to provide more info and thanking the bank. Avoid formatting, just plain text with line breaks.

Check for the foreign worker aspect. Each is a foreign worker, so maybe mention their legal status or long-term plans in the country.

Also, no telephone, so they might not have a phone, but that's part of the profile. Maybe not necessary to mention unless it's relevant. Probably better to focus on positive aspects.

Need to ensure that each letter is distinct in the purpose, job, and personal circumstances but still adheres to the profile. Let me draft each one step by step, making sure all parameters are included without being redundant.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Mr. Ahmed Khan

To the Loan Committee,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,657 DM to purchase a new desk and chair for my home office. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin for the past 3 years, I require ergonomic furniture to support my 40-hour workweek. Though my checking account is currently in deficit due to recent medical expenses, I have consistently paid my existing car loan (1,200 DM, 24 months remaining) on time. I reside in my own apartment, purchased with my savings of 80 DM, and have lived here for 2 years. My 1-year-old son and I rely on my stable income, and I am committed to repaying this loan through my monthly budget. I kindly request your consideration and am prepared to provide additional documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a loan to furnish my living room, as my current sofa is beyond repair. Working as an IT support specialist at TechNova since 2022, I earn a monthly salary of 2,200 DM. While my savings account holds 50 DM, I have no debts aside from my 1,800 DM equipment loan, which I repay at 150 DM/month. I have lived at my current address for 2 years and own a small apartment. As a foreign worker with plans to naturalize, I prioritize financial responsibility. My dependent sister, who lives with me, requires no financial support from me. I assure you of timely repayments and appreciate your trust.  

Respectfully,  
Luis Fernandez

To Whom It May Concern,  

I require 1,657 DM to replace my kitchen appliances, which have failed after years of use. As an electrician employed by UrbanPower for 3.5 years, I maintain a steady income but have minimal savings (30 DM) due to my recent marriage. My existing credit for a toolset (1,500 DM, 18 months remaining) is paid punctually. I own property and have resided at my current home for 2 years. Though I lack a phone, I am reachable via my employer’s contact. I guarantee repayment through my salary deductions and request your approval.  

Yours faithfully,  
Rajesh Patel

I apply for a loan to purchase a bedroom set for my expanding family. As a primary school teacher at Green Valley School since 2023, I earn 2,000 DM/month.

I own a home and have lived there for 2 years. My dependent 3-year-old daughter and I value financial discipline. I am confident in repaying this loan and thank you for your time.  

Sincerely,

My checking account is currently overdrawn due to seasonal business losses, but my income remains stable. I assure you of my commitment to repayment and welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.  

Respectfully,
