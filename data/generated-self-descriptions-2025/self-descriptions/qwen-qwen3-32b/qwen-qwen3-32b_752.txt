Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The duration is 6 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 428 DM. Savings account under 100 DM. Employment since at least 7 years. Installment rate 2. Female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence for 1 year. Property is building society savings or life insurance. Age 49. Other installment plans with the bank. Housing is own. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe a scientific research assistant, a school counselor, a nurse, a government office manager, and a technical draftsman. Each should have unique details but fit the profile.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let me start with the first one: a scientific research assistant. She's 49, married with one child, has been working at a university for 8 years. She needs furniture for a new home office. She mentions her stable job, existing credit paid back, and her savings. She has a building society savings plan. She'll mention her residence for one year, and that she has a phone. She'll end by asking for the loan.

Second person: school counselor. Maybe she's divorced, 49, has a dependent child. She needs to buy kitchen equipment after a flood. She's worked at the school for 7 years. She has an existing credit for a car, paid back. She mentions her stable income and the emergency need. She also has a life insurance policy as property. She'll ask for the loan to replace essentials.

Third person: nurse. Maybe separated, 49, living in own home. Needs to replace old furniture. Worked at the hospital for 9 years. Has a savings plan. She mentions her long-term employment and previous credit repayment. She has one dependent, maybe a child. She has a phone and is a registered foreign worker.

Fourth person: government office manager. Married, 49, needs office equipment for her home workspace. Employed for 8 years. Existing credit for a loan paid back. She has a building society agreement. She'll mention her stable job and ability to make installments. She has a dependent, maybe a daughter.

Fifth person: technical draftsman. Maybe married, 49, needs furniture for a new apartment. Employed at an engineering firm for 7 years. Has a life insurance policy. She has a dependent, perhaps a son. She has a phone and is a registered foreign worker. She mentions her steady income and repayment history.

I need to make sure each letter includes all the required elements: checking account negative, duration 6 months, credit history, purpose, amount, savings under 100 DM, employment over 7 years, installment rate 2, personal status, no debtors, residence 1 year, property type, age, other installment plans, housing, existing credit, job, dependents, phone, foreign worker. Each letter should be concise, not too long, and properly end. Avoid any formatting, just plain text.

Let me check each letter to ensure they don't repeat the same scenarios. Different jobs, different purposes (home office, kitchen, furniture replacement, home workspace, new apartment). Different personal statuses: married, divorced, separated. Each has a unique situation but fits the profile. Make sure the numbers are specific: 8 years, 7 years, etc. Each mentions their savings, employment duration, existing credit paid back, and why they need the loan. Also, mention the installment rate and how they can manage it with their income. Emphasize trustworthiness through repayment history and stable job. Each ends with gratitude and a request for approval.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Anna Müller, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have worked for 8 years. I am applying for a loan of 428 DM to purchase a new desk and chair for my home office, which I use exclusively for work. My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent medical expenses, but my stable salary ensures I can manage the 2 DM installment rate. I have always repaid my previous credit for a laptop on time and currently hold a building society savings agreement. Though my savings account holds less than 100 DM, my 8-year employment and ownership of my residence provide financial security. I am married with one child and have resided at my current address for 1 year. I kindly request your approval, confident in my ability to fulfill repayment obligations.  

Sincerely  
Anna Müller

Dear Sir/Madam  

I am Maria Schmidt, a school counselor at the Berlin Technical School, employed there for 7 years. I seek a 428 DM loan to replace kitchen furniture damaged during a recent flood. My checking account is currently negative due to emergency repairs, but my consistent income allows me to meet the 2 DM installment rate. I have no outstanding debts and fully repaid a prior car loan. My property includes a life insurance policy, and I live in my own home with my 12-year-old daughter. Though my savings are minimal, my stable job and timely credit history at this bank assure me of my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and trust in my commitment to repay.  

Yours faithfully  
Maria Schmidt
