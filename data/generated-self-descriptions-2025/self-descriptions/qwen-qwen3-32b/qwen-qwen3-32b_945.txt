Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile.

First, the profile details: The person is a 42-year-old foreign worker, male, single, with two dependents. He's employed as an unskilled resident worker, has been in his current job for 4 to 7 years (let me pick specific numbers, maybe 5 years). He doesn't have a checking account but has a savings account with less than 100 DM. He's had his current residence for 1 year. He owns real estate and lives in his own home. He has three existing credits at this bank. The loan purpose is a new car, amount 1455 DM, with an installment rate of 2. He has no other installment plans, no other debtors or guarantors, no telephone.

Now, I need to create five different people fitting this profile. Let me think about varying their backgrounds. Maybe different countries of origin, different jobs within "unskilled resident worker," different specifics about their real estate, etc.

First person: Let's say he's from Mexico, works as a construction laborer. He's in Germany for 5 years. His dependents are his parents. He wants a car to commute to work, which is 45 minutes away. He mentions his savings are low but he's responsible. He has three existing credits here, all paid on time. He owns a condo. He's a foreign worker, so maybe he mentions sending money home but wants stability with a car.

Second person: From the Philippines, works as a warehouse worker. Has been employed for 6 years. Dependents are his children. Needs a car for his job that requires early mornings. Emphasizes punctuality and reliability. Owns a small apartment. No checking account but manages savings. Credits here are for household items, paid promptly.

Third person: From Poland, works as a janitor. Employed for 4 years. Dependents are his sister and niece. Needs a car to transport them to school and work. Owns a house. Highlights his stable job and property as security. Credits here for furniture, all settled. Wants to avoid public transport costs.

Fourth person: From Ecuador, works as a maintenance worker. Employed for 5 years. Dependents are his wife and child. Needs a car for family emergencies. Owns a duplex. Credits for appliances. Emphasizes his real estate and commitment to repayments.

Fifth person: From Vietnam, works as a factory worker. Employed for 6 years. Dependents are his elderly mother and brother. Needs a car for medical appointments. Owns a villa. Credits for electronics. Stresses his savings discipline and job stability.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation (checking account duration 4 months, savings <100 DM, existing credits at the bank), and trustworthiness (punctual payments, property ownership, stable job). Make sure each has specific details, no generic terms. Also, each letter should be concise, not too long, and properly end with a closing.

Check for each letter: name, job, duration in job, dependents, residence, savings, existing credits, purpose, why trustworthy. Avoid repetition in the examples. Make sure each person's situation is distinct but fits the profile. Also, note that the profile says "unskilled - resident," so maybe clarify if they are residents in Germany or another country? Probably Germany since it's a bank loan there.

Make sure to mention the loan amount (1455 DM) and installment rate (2). Maybe explain how the car will help their situation. Also, since they don't have a checking account, maybe they manage finances differently. Maybe they have a savings account but minimal. Also, they have critical credit history but existing credits not at this bank. Wait, the profile says "Credit history: critical account/ other credits existing (not at this bank)". But in the profile, "Number of existing credits at this bank:3". So they have three credits at this bank, but other credits elsewhere that are critical. So in the letters, maybe mention that their other credits are with other institutions but they have a good track record with this bank's three credits.

So each applicant should mention that they have three existing credits at the bank, paid on time, while other credits (not at this bank) are in critical status. But they are applying for another loan here. They need to explain why they're trustworthy despite the critical credit history. Maybe emphasize their punctuality with the bank's existing credits, stable job, property ownership, etc.

Also, the purpose is a new car. Each applicant should explain why they need a car. Maybe for work commute, family needs, reliability, etc.

I need to make sure each letter is unique. Let me outline each person:

1. Mexican construction worker, 5 years employed, parents as dependents, condo owner, needs car for commute.

2. Filipino warehouse worker, 6 years, children dependents, apartment owner, car for early morning work.

3. Polish janitor, 4 years, sister and niece, owns house, car for transportation.

4. Ecuadorian maintenance, 5 years, wife and child, owns duplex, car for emergencies.

5. Vietnamese factory worker, 6 years, mother and brother, owns villa, car for medical needs.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, then to the bank. Then explain their situation, purpose of loan, financial status, trustworthiness. Conclude with thanks and willingness to provide more info.

Check for specific numbers: age 42, duration in current job between 4-7 years (so 5, 6, 4, 5, 6), existing credits at the bank 3, savings <100 DM, no checking account, 4 months, etc.

Make sure each letter includes these points. Avoid using any formatting, just plain text. Also, the letters should be in English but from the perspective of non-native speakers? Probably not necessary, just clear and concise.

Let me start drafting each letter with these points.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Luis Ramirez from Mexico. I am 42 years old and have worked as a construction laborer in Germany for the past 5 years. I currently reside in a condominium I own and have lived here for 1 year. I am a single father supporting my two young children.  

I apply for a 1455 DM loan to purchase a reliable car. My job requires frequent travel to construction sites, and public transport is insufficient for my schedule. While my savings account holds less than 100 DM, I have consistently repaid three existing credits at this bank without delay. My stable employment and ownership of real estate demonstrate my ability to manage financial responsibilities. I request your support to improve my mobility and work efficiency.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for further discussion.  

Sincerely  
Luis Ramirez

Dear Sir/Madam  

I am Tito Santos, 42, a warehouse worker in Berlin for 6 years. I am a foreign worker from the Philippines and currently support my two children living with me. I own a small apartment and have resided here for 1 year.  

The purpose of my loan is to buy a car for work-related travel. My shifts start at 4 AM, and owning a vehicle will ensure punctuality. I have no checking account but maintain a savings account with minimal funds. I have repaid three previous loans at this bank on time, despite challenges with other credits outside this institution. My real estate and steady income confirm my reliability.  

I kindly ask for approval of the 1455 DM loan. I am committed to fulfilling all installments.  

Respectfully  
Tito Santos

To Whom It May Concern  

My name is Adam Nowak, 42, employed as a janitor in Hamburg for 4 years. I am a Polish national living in my own apartment, supporting my sister and her child, who depend on me financially.  

I seek a 1455 DM loan to purchase a car for daily transportation. My job requires traveling between multiple sites, and public transport is impractical. Though my savings are under 100 DM, I have maintained three active credits at this bank with no missed payments. My ownership of real estate and stable employment history prove my commitment to financial obligations.  

I assure you of my dedication to repaying this loan. Your trust would greatly improve my ability to support my family.  

Yours faithfully  
Adam Nowak

I request a 1455 DM loan to buy a car for emergency family use. My wife’s health requires frequent hospital visits, and public transport is unreliable. I have three existing credits at this bank, all paid punctually. My real estate and steady income make me a responsible candidate.  

I am confident in my ability to meet repayment terms. Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards  
Carlos Mendoza
