Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM with a duration of 12 months. The credit history is either no credits taken or all paid back duly. The purpose is furniture or equipment, credit amount 2969 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Present employment less than a year. Installment rate 4. Female, divorced/separated/married, no other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 3 months. Property is building society savings or life insurance. Age 25. No other installment plans. Renting. Two existing credits at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. One dependent. No telephone. Foreign worker yes.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different nationalities, jobs, reasons for needing furniture. Let me brainstorm:

1. A scientific research assistant from another country, working in Germany, needs furniture for a new apartment. She has a stable job but just moved, hence short employment and residence duration. She has some savings but less than 100 DM. Maybe she's divorced with a child.

2. A nurse from another country, recently employed in a clinic, needs to furnish her apartment. She has a good credit history, two existing credits, and wants to buy a sofa and dining set for her family.

3. An office administrator who's a foreign worker, married with a child, needs to replace old furniture. She has been in her job for less than a year but has a steady income. She has a life insurance policy as property.

4. A teacher's assistant, foreign, recently moved, needs to furnish her rental apartment. She's separated, has a daughter, and wants to create a comfortable home environment. She has a savings bond but less than 100 DM.

5. A technical drafter from another country, employed in Germany, needs to buy furniture for her new apartment. She's married, has a son, and has been in her current job for 11 months. She has a building society savings agreement.

Each letter should mention their specific job, duration of employment (less than a year), residence since 3 months, existing credits (2), purpose (furniture), savings less than 100 DM, and why they're trustworthy. They should also mention being foreign workers, having no telephone (maybe they use a mobile or contact through someone else?), and the installment rate.

Let me start drafting the first one. Make sure each has a unique job and specific details. Avoid repetition. Check that all profile attributes are addressed. Also, keep the letters concise, not too long. End with a proper closing.

For example, the first letter could be from a research assistant at a university. She's been employed for 10 months, has a savings bond, and needs furniture for her new apartment. She has two existing credits paid back duly. She's divorced with a child. She's a foreign worker, lives in Germany, and wants to establish a stable home.

Second letter: Nurse working in a clinic. Employed for 11 months, needs furniture for her family. She's married with one dependent, has a life insurance policy. She emphasizes her steady income and good credit history.

Third: Office administrator, separated, has a daughter. Needs to buy a sofa and desk. She's been in her job for 8 months, has a building society savings. She mentions her responsibility in repaying past credits.

Fourth: Teacher's assistant, recently moved, needs to furnish her rental. She has a savings account under 100 DM, has been in Germany for 3 months. She's a foreign worker with a stable job and good references.

Fifth: Technical drafter, married with a son, employed for 10 months. Needs to replace old furniture. She has a life insurance policy and has always paid her credits on time.

Each letter should start with sender's info, date, bank address, subject, then the body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and closing with thanks and signature. But since the user said not to use formatting, maybe just the text without the actual letter structure? Wait, the user says "do not use any formatting on the letter," so maybe just the body paragraphs without addresses, etc. Let me check the example they provided in the initial prompt. The example letters they gave in the problem don't include addresses, just the body. So I'll follow that.

Make sure each letter is from a different person with unique jobs and specific instances. Let me proceed to write each one, ensuring all profile attributes are covered with specific numbers and roles.

**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 2969 DM to purchase furniture for my new apartment in Munich. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past 10 months, I earn a stable monthly income of 2800 DM. Though I have only been employed here since June 2023, I have a strong credit history, having repaid two prior loans for textbooks and a laptop. I currently reside in a rental apartment and have lived here since January 2024. My savings account holds 80 DM, but I maintain a building society savings agreement. As a divorced mother of one, I prioritize financial responsibility. I assure you of timely repayments at 4% installment rates. Your support would greatly improve my living conditions. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Anika Müller

Dear Bank Manager,  
I seek a 2969 DM loan to furnish my home, as I recently relocated to Frankfurt as a nurse at St. Anna Clinic. Employed since September 2023, I earn 3200 DM monthly and have no overdue debts.

I pledge to honor the 4% installment plan. This loan will create a better environment for my family. Thank you for your trust.  

Best regards,  
Katarzyna Nowak
