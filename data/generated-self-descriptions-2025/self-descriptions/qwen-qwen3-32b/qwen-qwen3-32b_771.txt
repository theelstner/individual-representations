Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the profile says the person has no checking account but has been in their current job for at least 7 years. The purpose of the loan is for radio/television. The credit amount is 1655 DM. They have less than 100 DM in savings. They've been in their current residence for 4 years, own their home, and are 63 years old. They have existing credits not at this bank, and two existing credits at this bank. Their job is listed as "unskilled - resident," but maybe I can find different roles that fit under that category. Also, they have one dependent, a telephone, and are a registered foreign worker.

Wait, the job is "unskilled - resident." So I need to think of specific unskilled jobs that a resident might have. Maybe something like a cleaner, maintenance worker, or maybe a security guard. Since they have been in their job for 8 years, maybe they have some experience in that role. Also, they own real estate, so perhaps they have a stable residence.

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I need to vary the specific details. Let me brainstorm some different scenarios. For example, one could be a cleaner, another a maintenance worker, another a security guard, maybe a gardener, or a warehouse worker. Each of these would have different reasons for needing a TV or radio—maybe for staying informed, entertainment, educational purposes for the dependent, etc.

Now, considering the credit history is critical with other credits existing not at this bank. They need to explain why they're trustworthy. Maybe they mention their long-term residence, their stable job, owning property, or their existing credits at this bank (two of them). Also, they have a dependent, so maybe they need the TV for the dependent's education or for staying connected.

Each letter should be concise, so I need to make sure they don't get too long. Start with the purpose, explain their financial situation (stable job, own home, existing credits at the bank), and why they are trustworthy (responsibility, timely payments, etc.). Also, mention the specific instances like 8 years in the job, 4 years in residence, etc.

Let me outline each letter:

1. Person 1: Maintenance worker. Needs TV for family entertainment. Has stable job, owns home, two existing credits paid on time. Emphasizes responsibility.

2. Person 2: Security guard. Wants to stay updated with news via radio/TV. Long-term residence, steady income, dependent child. Highlights existing credits at the bank.

3. Person 3: Cleaner. Needs TV for educational programs for dependent. Owns property, has savings (though less than 100 DM), and has been in job for 8 years.

4. Person 4: Warehouse worker. Applying for TV to replace old one. Stable employment, own home, references from current bank credits.

5. Person 5: Gardener. Wants to use TV for language learning (since they're a registered foreign worker). Emphasizes commitment to integration and repayment.

Now, I need to make sure each letter includes all the required elements: purpose, financial situation (job duration, residence, property, existing credits), trustworthiness. Also, specific numbers: 8 years in job, 4 years residence, 63 years old, etc. Also, mention the installment rate of 2 DM, but maybe that's part of their current payments?

Wait, the installment rate is 2 DM, which might refer to their ability to pay. But in the letters, they need to explain their ability to repay. So maybe mention their income is sufficient to handle the installment.

Also, each person has a dependent, so maybe they mention supporting a family member.

I need to avoid generic terms. Instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs. Also, make sure each letter has a unique angle. For example, one might focus on the need for news, another on education for the dependent, another on entertainment, etc.

Let me start drafting each letter with these points in mind, ensuring they are concise and include all necessary details without being too wordy. Also, no formatting, just plain text with proper endings.

Dear Bank Manager,  

My name is Hans Müller, and I am writing to request a loan of 1655 DM to purchase a television. I have worked as a maintenance worker at a local hospital for 8 years, ensuring stable income to manage monthly installments of 2 DM. Though I do not currently hold a checking account, I have resided at my current address for 4 years and own my home. I already have two small credits with your bank for household repairs, which I repay punctually. My 63-year-old age and long-term employment reflect my responsibility. I have one dependent, my mother, whom I support financially. While my savings are limited (<100 DM), my property and steady job assure timely repayment. I kindly ask for your trust in my reliability.  

Sincerely,  
Hans Müller

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am Karl Dietrich, a security guard at a logistics company for the past 7 years. I seek 1655 DM to acquire a radio/television to stay informed about global news in my free time. I own real estate and live in my current residence since 2019. Though my savings account holds less than 100 DM, I manage two existing credits at your bank for home maintenance. My job provides consistent income, and I have no other debts. At 63, I prioritize financial discipline, as evidenced by my punctual payments for prior loans. Supporting my daughter, who lives with me, requires careful budgeting, but I am confident in covering the installment rate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Karl Dietrich

Dear Bank Committee,  

As a cleaner at a primary school for 8 years, I request a 1655 DM loan to buy a television for my son’s educational programs. I have no checking account but reside in my own home, purchased 4 years ago. My current employer confirms my steady income, and I already hold two small credits at your bank for school supplies, which I repay without issue. At 63, I value stability—my job, residence, and commitment to my 16-year-old dependent reflect this. While my savings are minimal (<100 DM), my property and employment history demonstrate reliability. I assure you of my ability to meet the 2 DM installment rate.  

Respectfully,  
Eva Fischer

Dear Bank Representative,  

My name is Thomas Weber, a warehouse worker employed for 7 years. I apply for 1655 DM to replace my broken television, which is essential for evening relaxation after work. I own my home and have lived at my address since 2020. Though I lack a checking account, I maintain two active credits at your bank for appliance purchases, both repaid on time. My income suffices for the proposed installment rate, and I have no other debts. At 63, I support my nephew, who lives with me, yet manage expenses prudently. My property and job stability confirm my trustworthiness. I hope for your approval.  

Kind regards,  
Thomas Weber

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Lena Schmidt, a gardener employed at a community center for 8 years. I request a 1655 DM loan to buy a television for language-learning programs, as I am a registered foreign worker aiming to improve my German. I own real estate and reside in my home for 4 years. Though my savings are under 100 DM, I have two existing credits at your bank for gardening tools, which I repay diligently. My stable job and no other debts ensure I can handle the 2 DM installment rate. At 63, I support my sister, who lives with me, and take pride in my financial responsibility. Your support would greatly aid my integration and growth.  

Sincerely,  
Lena Schmidt
