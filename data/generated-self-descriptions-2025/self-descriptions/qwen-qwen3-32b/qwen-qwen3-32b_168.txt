Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, duration 18 months. Credit history is good, existing credits paid back. Purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 1131 DM. Savings under 100 DM. Unemployed currently. Installment rate 4. Female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors. Residence since 2 years. Property: car or other. Age 33. No other installment plans. Own housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job: skilled employee/official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each letter needs to have these elements but with specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant," "teacher," etc. Each person should have a unique job, maybe different reasons for needing furniture, different personal situations.

Let me brainstorm five different scenarios. Maybe a teacher, a nurse, a graphic designer, a social worker, and a mechanic. Each has different reasons for needing furniture. Since they're unemployed now, perhaps they're transitioning jobs or between contracts. They need to explain their financial situation, trustworthiness, and why they need the loan.

First person: Let's say a former teacher who is now between jobs, looking to set up a home office to find remote work. She has a dependent child. She mentions her previous job, the savings are low, but she has a car as collateral. She emphasizes her credit history and ability to make installments.

Second person: Maybe a nurse who lost her job due to relocation. She needs furniture for her new home. She has a car and owns her house. She's confident in finding a new job soon.

Third person: A graphic designer who is self-employed but currently unemployed due to a project gap. Needs equipment (laptop, desk) to restart work. She has a good credit history and expects income soon.

Fourth person: A social worker who is temporarily unemployed between positions. Needs furniture for her apartment to create a stable environment for her child. She has a car and owns her home.

Fifth person: A mechanic who was laid off due to garage closure. Now seeking retraining but needs furniture. He has savings under 100 DM, owns a car, and is confident in getting a new job.

Each letter should be concise, mention specific job roles, reasons for loan, trustworthiness (good credit, existing credit paid back), and their plans to repay. Also, note their foreign worker status, residence duration, etc.

I need to make sure each letter is distinct, uses specific details, and adheres to the profile. Also, check that they don't have a telephone, are female, have dependents, etc. Also, mention the existing credit at the bank. Each letter should start with their name and address, then the bank's address, date, subject, body, and closing.

Wait, the user didn't specify including addresses or dates. The example response didn't have them. The user wants the letters to be short and not cut off. So maybe just the body of the letter. The example response had [Your Name], [Your Address], [City, Date], etc. But since the user said "do not use any formatting," maybe just the text without placeholders. But the example included placeholders. Let me check the example again.

Looking back, the example letters have placeholders like [Your Name], [Your Address], etc. So I should follow that structure. But since the user wants each letter to be from a different person, each with specific instances, I need to vary the details accordingly.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one, ensuring all profile attributes are covered with specific details.

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to request a loan of 1,131 DM to purchase essential furniture for my home office. As a former scientific research assistant with eight years of experience, I recently became unemployed due to laboratory restructuring. Currently, I am seeking remote research opportunities and require a reliable workspace to apply for freelance projects.  

Though my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have maintained a 18-month account without defaults. I have consistently repaid my existing credit with your bank and hold a car as collateral. My savings are limited (<100 DM), but I reside in my own housing and have a stable background as a skilled employee. With one dependent, I manage expenses carefully and am confident in securing income through upcoming contracts.  

I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan through my upcoming freelance work. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 1,131 DM loan to replace worn-out furniture after relocating to Germany as a foreign nurse. Having worked in a clinic for five years, I was temporarily unemployed due to visa processing delays but am now actively seeking employment locally.  

My credit history includes timely repayments of a prior loan with your bank. While my current checking account is inactive, I own a car and live in my own apartment. With one dependent child, I prioritize financial responsibility and have no other debts. My residence in Germany is stable, and I am confident in securing nursing positions soon to cover monthly installments.  

I kindly request your support to establish a comfortable home environment. Thank you for your trust.  

Respectfully,  
[Your Name]

To Whom It May Concern,  

As a self-employed graphic designer, I require 1,131 DM to upgrade my workspace equipment after a six-month project hiatus. Though unemployed temporarily, I have a steady client base and expect new contracts by month’s end.  

I have no savings (<100 DM) and an overdrawn checking account, but I have repaid all prior credits, including my existing loan with your bank. I own a vehicle and reside in my own home. With one dependent, I manage finances prudently and am confident in repaying installments once work resumes.  

Your support would enable me to restart operations efficiently. I appreciate your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,

I am confident in securing income through upcoming job applications and will prioritize loan repayments.  

Your assistance would greatly improve my living conditions. Thank you for your understanding.
