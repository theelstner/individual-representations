Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully.

The profile includes specific attributes like a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, a 6-month duration, good credit history, purpose for radio/television, credit amount 368, no savings account, employment for at least 7 years, single male, no other debtors, 4 years at residence, property as building society savings or life insurance, 38 years old, own housing, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I should vary the specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "scientific research assistant," "electrician," etc. Also, need to mention the purpose as radio/television but can specify different types, like a satellite dish, home theater system, etc.

I need to ensure each letter explains why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should be concise, not cut off, and have proper endings. No formatting, just plain text.

First, I'll create five different personas. Let's think of different jobs: scientific research assistant, electrician, teacher, IT technician, and mechanic. Each with unique details. For the purpose, maybe one wants a satellite dish, another a TV for a small business, another a radio for a hobby, etc.

Check credit history: existing credits paid back duly. So each letter should mention that. Also, they have a building society savings agreement or life insurance. Maybe mention specific types like a life insurance policy or savings plan.

Each person's situation should reflect the profile: 38 years old, foreign worker, single with one dependent, living in their own home, employed for over 7 years, etc. Need to make sure all these points are covered in each letter but phrased differently.

Also, the loan amount is 368 DM with an installment rate of 4. Maybe mention the monthly payment they can handle. Since they have one existing credit at the bank, perhaps mention that they're already managing a loan responsibly.

Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan. Each purpose should be distinct. Also, vary the trustworthiness elements: maybe one emphasizes punctual payments, another their stable job, another their property as collateral, etc.

Make sure each letter starts with a proper salutation, states the purpose, explains their situation, and ends with a polite request. Keep them short but cover all necessary points.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all profile attributes are translated into specific examples without using generic terms. Check for consistency in the numbers: 8 years employment, 4 years residence, age 38, etc. Also, since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their legal status or contribution to the community.

Need to ensure that each letter is unique enough so they don't sound like the same person. Different jobs, different purposes, different aspects of trustworthiness highlighted. Also, maybe different angles on how the loan will benefit them, like educational purposes, business, family, etc.

Once drafted, review each letter to confirm they meet all the profile's requirements and are concise. No markdown, just plain text with paragraphs separated by line breaks. Proper endings with names and positions.

Dear Bank Manager  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 368 DM to purchase a satellite dish for my home. As a 38-year-old scientific research assistant at the municipal environmental institute, I have been employed for 8 years and earn a stable monthly income of 1,200 DM. I currently reside in my own apartment, which I have occupied for 4 years, and hold a building society savings agreement. Though my checking account balance is modest (150 DM), I have always repaid previous credits on time, including my existing small loan for a bicycle, which I am paying off at 50 DM monthly. As a foreign worker with legal residency, I prioritize financial responsibility. The satellite dish will allow me to access international scientific broadcasts to enhance my research. I assure you my disciplined budgeting and steady employment make me a reliable candidate.  

Sincerely,
