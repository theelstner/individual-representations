Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM with a duration of 12 months. The credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 951 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Present employment less than 1 year. Installment rate 4. Female, divorced/separated/married, no other debtors/guarantors. Residence since 4 months. Property: car or other. Age 27. Other installment plans with the bank. Housing is rent. 4 existing credits at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I should vary the specifics. Let me think of different scenarios. For example, different reasons for needing furniture/equipment. Maybe a teacher needing classroom supplies, a nurse buying home office equipment, a graphic designer upgrading workstations, a chef purchasing kitchen equipment, and a translator buying a desk and chair.

Now, for each person, I need to mention their job, how long they've been employed (less than a year), their savings, existing credits paid on time, residence duration, dependents, etc. Also, they are foreign workers, so maybe mention their immigration status or work visa. Since they have a car, perhaps mention that as collateral.

Wait, the profile says "Property: car or other." So each person has a car or other property. Let me include that. Also, they have 4 existing credits at the bank, so they should mention that they've managed those well.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan (furniture/equipment), their ability to repay (installment rate 4 DM), and their trustworthiness based on credit history.

Let me outline each letter:

1. Teacher: Needs furniture for a home classroom. Skilled employee at a school. Savings of 300 DM. Has a car. Divorced with one child. Employed for 10 months.

2. Nurse: Buying home office equipment. Works at a clinic. Savings of 400 DM. Car. Married, separated, one dependent. Employed for 8 months.

3. Graphic Designer: Upgrading workstations. Freelance official. Savings 250 DM. Car. Single mother. Employed for 11 months.

4. Chef: Purchasing kitchen equipment. Works at a restaurant. Savings 150 DM. Car. Married, separated, one child. Employed for 9 months.

5. Translator: Buying a desk and chair. Works as an official translator. Savings 350 DM. Car. Divorced, one dependent. Employed for 10 months.

Now, I need to write each letter concisely, making sure all the profile attributes are included with specific numbers and roles. Each should start with the person's name, address, date, bank address, and proper closing. Avoid formatting, just plain text.

Check for each letter: mention the purpose, current job and duration, savings, residence since 4 months, existing credits (4), installment rate, marital status, dependents, car as property, foreign worker status, and why they are trustworthy (credit history).

Make sure each letter is unique in their profession and specific reasons for the loan. Also, ensure the employment duration is less than a year (e.g., 10 months, 8 months, etc.), savings between 100-500, and other details.

I need to be careful not to use generic terms. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like teacher, nurse, etc. Also, the foreign worker aspect should be mentioned in each, perhaps stating they have a valid work visa or residency permit.

Let me start drafting each letter now, keeping them short and to the point, with proper structure and ending.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Anna Müller and I am applying for a loan of 951 DM to purchase essential furniture for my new apartment. I currently work as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin and have been employed in this position for 10 months. Although my employment duration is relatively short, I have maintained a consistent income and have already repaid four previous credits at your bank without issue. I currently hold a savings account with 300 DM and have resided at my current address for 4 months. As a divorced mother of one, I prioritize financial responsibility and have always met my installment obligations. I own a car valued at 4,500 DM and am a foreign worker with a valid residency permit. I believe this loan will allow me to create a stable living environment for my child and myself. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Anna Müller
