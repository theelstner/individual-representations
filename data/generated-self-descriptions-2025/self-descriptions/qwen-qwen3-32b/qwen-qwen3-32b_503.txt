Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile mentions a foreign worker who is a skilled employee or official, has been in their current job for at least 7 years, and is applying for a used car loan of 5493 DM. They have a checking account less than 0 DM, a savings account under 100 DM, and have lived in their current residence for 4 years. They are 42 years old, single, male, with two dependents, and no other installment plans or debts. They have a credit history of paying back previous credits and have one existing credit at the bank. Housing is "for free," which might mean they live with someone else, maybe family. No property, no telephone.

Now, I need to create five different people. Let me think of different job roles for the "skilled employee / official" – maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a teacher, a nurse, and an IT technician. Each person should have unique details but fit the profile.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying for the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let me start with the first one: a scientific research assistant. He's been at his job for 8 years. His dependents are his parents, maybe? Since he's single and has two dependents. He could be supporting his aging parents. His current residence is 4 years, and he's a foreign worker from, say, India. He needs the car for commuting to work, which is 50 km away. His previous credit was a laptop loan paid back. The bank already has one credit with him. He has no savings but is reliable.

Second person: a mechanic. Let's say he's from the Philippines, has been working at a garage for 7 years. His dependents are his two children. He needs a car to get to work and for his job, maybe to visit clients. He's been paying his previous credit (maybe a tool loan) on time. Lives with his sister, hence housing is for free. No savings, but steady income.

Third: a teacher. From Nigeria, working as a primary school teacher for 9 years. Dependents are his wife and child. Wait, but the profile says male, single, with two dependents. So maybe his parents? Or siblings? Maybe he's supporting his sister and her child. Needs a car to commute 30 km each way. His existing credit is a home improvement loan. He's been in residence for 4 years.

Fourth: a nurse. From Brazil, working in a hospital for 7 years. Dependents could be his elderly mother and a brother. Needs a car for shifts and to take his mother to doctor appointments. Previous credit was for medical equipment. Lives in a shared apartment, hence housing for free. No savings but consistent income.

Fifth: IT technician from Vietnam, 8 years at current job. Dependents are his two young children. Wait, but he's single. Maybe he's the sole provider for his siblings back home? Or maybe his parents. Needs a car for his job that requires visiting clients. Existing credit was for a laptop. Has been in Germany for 4 years, stable job.

Each letter should start with their personal details, explain the purpose of the loan, their ability to repay based on their job and income, mention their good credit history, and why they need the car. Also, address their current financial situation (low savings but steady income) and how the car will help their situation. Make sure each is concise, no formatting, proper ending.

I need to check that each letter has specific numbers: 8 years, 7 years, etc., and the purpose is a used car. Also, mention the installment rate of 2, but maybe not necessary if it's part of the bank's terms. The key is to show trustworthiness through past payments and stable employment. Each person's situation is unique but fits the profile. Avoid generic terms, use specific job titles and reasons for dependents. Make sure they are foreign workers from different countries, different jobs, different dependents (parents, siblings, etc.), and different reasons for needing the car (commute, job requirements, family needs).

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered and each is distinct.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5493 DM to purchase a used car. As a scientific research assistant at the Munich Institute for Biotechnology, I have worked for 8 years with a stable monthly income of 2800 DM. My current position requires frequent travel to collaborate with colleagues 50 km away, and a reliable vehicle is essential to maintain my productivity.  

Though my checking and savings accounts hold minimal balances due to recent equipment purchases, I have consistently repaid my previous credit for laboratory software over 24 months without delay. I reside in my apartment, which I have occupied for 4 years, and support my two elderly parents in my hometown through monthly transfers.  

As a foreign worker from India with no other debts, I prioritize financial responsibility. I am confident my steady employment and punctual repayment history demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I seek a 5493 DM loan to purchase a used car, which is vital for my work as a mechanic at Berlin Auto Repairs.

As a foreign worker, I value stability. My job security and history of timely repayments underscore my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your time.  

Respectfully,
