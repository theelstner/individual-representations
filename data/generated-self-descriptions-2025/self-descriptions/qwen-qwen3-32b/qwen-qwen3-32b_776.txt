Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to understand the profile details thoroughly. 

The profile includes specific attributes like an existing checking account with at least 200 DM, a salary assigned for at least a year, a 12-month duration, critical credit history with other existing credits not at this bank, purpose is a new car, credit amount 1480 DM, savings between 500-1000 DM, unemployed currently, installment rate 2, male single, no other debtors, residence since 4 years, no property, age 66, other installment plans with bank, housing for free, 3 existing credits at the bank, job as unemployed/unskilled non-resident, 1 dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be unique, with specific instances of generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant," and specify durations like "8 years" instead of ">=7 years." The letters should be short, concise, not cut off, and have proper endings. No formatting, just plain text.

First, I need to create five different personas based on the profile. Let me think about different scenarios for unemployed foreign workers over 60 with dependents. Maybe some have part-time work, others might be in different fields, or have different reasons for needing a car. Each person's situation should be distinct but fit the profile.

For example, one could be a former factory worker, another a retired teacher, maybe a self-employed artisan, a domestic helper, or someone in agriculture. Each would have different reasons for needing a car—like finding a job, transporting goods, medical needs, etc.

I need to make sure each letter addresses their financial situation, why they need the loan, and why they're trustworthy. They all have critical credit history and existing credits elsewhere, so they need to acknowledge that but show they can manage payments. They have savings between 500-1000 DM, so mention specific amounts. Also, they're unemployed but might have part-time income or other sources.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then explain their situation, purpose of loan, their ability to repay (mentioning savings, existing credits at the bank, installment plans), and why they're trustworthy. End with thanks and signature.

Let me check if all profile attributes are covered in each letter. For example, age 66, unemployed, foreign worker, 1 dependent, residence since 4 years, etc. Each letter must include these specifics but vary the job, reason for car, and other details.

Make sure not to use generic terms. Instead of "unskilled worker," use specific roles. Also, the purpose of the car should vary: job hunting, starting a business, medical reasons, transporting goods, family needs.

Need to avoid formatting, keep paragraphs short. Each letter should be concise but complete. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they meet all criteria and are distinct.

Dear [Bank Name]  
I am writing to request a loan of 1480 DM to purchase a new car. As a 66-year-old foreign worker who has lived in Germany for 12 years, I currently work part-time as a warehouse assistant in Frankfurt, earning a stable monthly income of 1200 DM. Though I was unemployed for two years prior, I have maintained my checking account with a minimum balance of 200 DM for over a year and hold a savings account with 750 DM. My residence in the same apartment for four years and my three existing credits with this bank reflect my reliability. The car will enable me to commute to work efficiently and support my family of two. I assure you that my disciplined financial habits and current employment will allow me to manage the 2 DM installment rate responsibly. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed K.

Dear [Bank Name]  
I seek a 1480 DM loan to replace my aging vehicle, which is essential for my work as a freelance construction laborer. At 66, I have lived in Germany for eight years and have a savings account with 600 DM. Though my credit history includes past challenges, I have consistently repaid my three existing credits with this bank without issue. I reside in my current home for four years and support my daughter, who lives with me. My part-time job at a local factory provides 1100 DM monthly, and I am committed to fulfilling the 2 DM installment plan. This car will ensure my mobility to job sites and improve my income stability. I appreciate your trust in my responsibility.  

Respectfully,  
Luis M.

Dear [Bank Name]  
I am applying for a 1480 DM loan to purchase a van to start a small delivery business. As a 66-year-old foreign worker with four years of residency, I previously worked as a mechanic but was unemployed for 18 months due to health reasons. I now have a part-time contract at a repair shop, earning 1000 DM monthly, and maintain a checking account with consistent salary assignments for one year. My savings account holds 900 DM, and I have no property but carefully manage my finances. The loan will generate income to support my son, who depends on me. I have already repaid three credits with this bank and will prioritize the 2 DM installments. Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Rajesh P.

Dear [Bank Name]  
I need a 1480 DM loan for a car to transport goods as a self-employed vendor. At 66, I have lived in Germany for five years and worked in agriculture until last year when seasonal work declined. I currently earn 950 DM monthly through occasional farm labor and have a savings bond worth 550 DM. My checking account has remained active for over a year, and I have repaid three prior credits with this bank. Though my credit history is not perfect, I have always prioritized payments. This vehicle will allow me to expand my sales of fresh produce, ensuring income for my family. I am confident in my ability to meet the 2 DM installment rate.  

Sincerely,  
Mohammed A.
