Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me list them out:

- No checking account
- Duration in months: 12 (so 1 year)
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly
- Purpose: business
- Credit amount: 1076 (probably DM)
- Savings account/bonds: less than 100 DM
- Present employment since: 1 to 4 years (so maybe 2 years for one person, 3 for another, etc.)
- Installment rate: 2 (maybe 2% or DM 2? Probably 2%)
- Personal status: male, married/widowed
- No other debtors/guarantors
- Present residence since: 2 years
- Property: real estate
- Age: 26
- No other installment plans
- Housing: own
- Existing credits at this bank: 1
- Job: skilled employee or official
- Dependents: 1
- Telephone: yes
- Foreign worker: registered under their name

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So I need to vary the specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "scientific research assistant," "mechanic," etc. Also, vary the employment duration (1-4 years), maybe 2, 3, 1, etc. Same with other attributes where possible.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan (business purpose), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should be concise, not too long. Let me think of different business purposes. Maybe a bakery, a repair shop, a small tech business, a catering service, and a consulting firm.

Also, since they have real estate, maybe mention owning a property. They have a telephone, which might indicate stability. They have a good credit history, so emphasize that. Each person is 26, married/widowed with one dependent. Let me vary the job titles and specific business purposes.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one, making sure to include all required elements without being repetitive. Need to check that each letter has unique specifics. Also, ensure that the letters are properly ended without any formatting.

**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,076 DM to expand my bakery, "Sweet Loaf," which I established two years ago. As a 26-year-old skilled confectioner employed full-time at a local patisserie, I have worked 3 years in my current job and own a small apartment in my name. Though I do not currently hold a checking account, I have consistently repaid my existing car loan through this bank without default. My wife and I reside in our own housing and have maintained this address for two years. With this loan, I aim to purchase new ovens to meet rising demand. I assure you of my reliability through my steady income, real estate ownership, and punctual repayment history. I look forward to your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Heinrich

**Letter 2**  
Dear Banking Team,  

I seek a 1,076 DM loan to launch a mobile phone repair service, "TechFix," targeting my neighborhood. At 26, I have worked as an electronics technician for 2 years and own a registered repair shop space. Though I lack a checking account, my savings bond of 80 DM and my history of repaying a prior student loan demonstrate my financial responsibility. I have lived at my current residence since 2021 and am married with a young child. My stable employment, combined with owning property, ensures I can manage monthly installments. I kindly request your trust in my ability to succeed.  

Best regards,  
Lars Müller

**Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

As a 26-year-old scientific research assistant at the City Institute, I apply for a 1,076 DM loan to start a lab-supply delivery service. Employed for 4 years, I have no existing debts beyond the one research grant I fully repaid. While my savings are below 100 DM, I own a condominium and have resided at my address for two years. My business plan is backed by my technical expertise and stable income. I am married with one dependent and value reliability highly, as reflected in my flawless credit history. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Tobias Fischer

**Letter 4**  
Dear Bank Officials,  

I request a 1,076 DM loan to open a catering business, "Urban Bites," serving local offices. At 26, I have worked as a certified chef for 3 years and own a registered food truck. Though I do not have a checking account, I have consistently paid my car loan on time. My wife and I live in our own home, and I have no other debts. My prior credit for kitchen equipment was repaid in full. With this funding, I will purchase ingredients and marketing materials. My steady income and property ownership underscore my trustworthiness.  

Sincerely,  
Janine Becker

**Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 1,076 DM loan to establish a freelance IT consulting firm, "CodeCraft," leveraging my 2 years of experience as a systems analyst. I have no checking account but have repaid my previous equipment loan through this bank. At 26, I own a small apartment and have lived at my current address for two years. Married with one child, I prioritize financial discipline, as evidenced by my punctual payments. This loan will cover software licenses and client acquisition. I am confident in my ability to repay, given my stable job and real estate assets.  

Thank you for your time.  
Sincerely,  
Nico Schulz
