Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person has no checking account but has been in their current job for at least 7 years. The purpose is a used car loan of 2670 DM. They have a savings account with less than 100 DM. They’re single, male, 35 years old, live in their own house, have one dependent, and have a telephone. They’re a foreign worker registered under their name.

I need to create five different people with specific jobs. The job category includes management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, or officer. Let me brainstorm different roles. Maybe a project manager, a self-employed consultant, a scientific research assistant, a school principal, and a software development team leader. Each should have unique details.

For each person, the letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they’re trustworthy. They all have a good credit history, so that's a common point. Each should mention their stable employment (at least 7 years), current residence (4 years), and existing credit paid back. Also, they need to mention the car as property and their housing situation.

Let me start with the first person: a project manager at a construction company. He needs a car for commuting. He’s been in his job for 8 years, has a stable income. His savings are low because he’s been saving for a down payment on a house. He’s a foreign worker registered here. He’s single with a dependent, maybe a child. He’ll mention his good credit history and ability to make installments.

Second, a self-employed IT consultant. She’s been in business for 7 years, needs a car for client visits. She might have irregular income but can show consistent earnings. She’s been in her residence for 4 years, has a car as property. She’ll emphasize her business stability and timely payments.

Third, a scientific research assistant at a university. He’s been working there for 9 years. Needs a car to commute longer distances. His savings are low because he’s funding a sibling’s education. He mentions his stable employment and existing credit paid back.

Fourth, a school principal. She’s been in her role for 7 years, needs a car for school duties. She has a steady salary, lives in her own home. She’ll highlight her position’s stability and responsibility.

Fifth, a software development team leader. He’s been employed for 10 years, needs a car for daily commute. He’s been in his residence for 4 years, has a car as property. He mentions his high income and ability to manage installments.

Each letter needs to be concise, no formatting, proper ending. Make sure to avoid generic terms and use specific instances. Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Also, ensure that each person’s situation is unique enough to differentiate them from each other.

**Letter 1: Project Manager**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,670 DM to purchase a used car. As a project manager at a construction firm for the past 8 years, my job requires frequent travel to job sites, and a reliable vehicle is essential for punctuality. I have no checking account but maintain a savings account with 80 DM. My current residence in Munich has been my home for 4 years, and I own a 2012 sedan valued at 3,500 DM.  

I have consistently repaid my existing credit (a 2019 home improvement loan) without default. My monthly income of 4,200 DM, after housing and living expenses, allows me to comfortably manage a 4 DM installment. I am a registered foreign worker with legal employment status and support one dependent, my 6-year-old daughter. My stable employment and repayment history reflect my trustworthiness. I request your approval to secure this loan.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

**Letter 2: Self-Employed IT Consultant**  
Dear Bank Manager,  
I seek a 2,670 DM loan to acquire a used car for client visits and project management. As a self-employed IT consultant for 7 years, my income averages 5,000 DM monthly, though I prefer cash transactions, hence no checking account. My savings account holds 50 DM, but I have consistently repaid my 2021 equipment loan.  

I reside in Hamburg for 4 years, own a 2015 hatchback, and live in my own apartment. My business, registered under my name since 2016, has grown steadily. With no other debts, I can allocate 4 DM monthly toward repayments. I am single, support my elderly mother indirectly, and own a landline. My financial discipline and professional reputation assure timely repayment.  

I kindly request your approval.  
Best regards,  
Ahmad Khan

**Letter 3: Scientific Research Assistant**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I apply for a car loan to commute between my home and the university lab where I work as a research assistant. Employed at the Technical University of Berlin for 9 years, my 3,800 DM monthly salary is deposited directly, but I lack a checking account. My savings account holds 30 DM, as I’ve been funding my younger brother’s education.  

I have a 2013 car valued at 2,800 DM and have repaid a prior 2020 credit for lab equipment. My 4-year residency in Leipzig and stable employment confirm my reliability. With no other debts, I can manage a 4 DM installment. As a registered foreign worker, I support my 4-year-old son and prioritize financial responsibility.  

Please consider my application.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Rajesh Patel

**Letter 4: School Principal**  
Dear Bank Manager,  
I request a 2,670 DM loan for a used car to manage school logistics efficiently. As the principal of a primary school in Düsseldorf for 7 years, my 5,500 DM monthly income is crucial for maintaining operations. I have no checking account but maintain a savings account with 90 DM.  

My 4-year residence in the same home and repayment of a 2018 credit for school supplies demonstrate my trustworthiness. I own a 2014 station wagon and live in my own house. With one dependent, my daughter (aged 8), and no other debts, I can comfortably afford a 4 DM installment. My position’s stability and 24-month employment history assure timely repayment.  

Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Michael Berger

**Letter 5: Software Development Team Leader**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am applying for a car loan to support my daily commute as a team leader at a Berlin-based tech startup. Employed for 10 years, my 6,200 DM monthly salary is sufficient to cover expenses and repayments. I have no checking account but hold a savings account with 70 DM.  

I have repaid a 2020 credit for office equipment and own a 2016 compact car. My 4-year residency in Frankfurt and ownership of my home reflect stability. With no other debts and one dependent (my 3-year-old son), I can allocate 4 DM monthly. As a registered foreign worker, I value financial responsibility and have no history of defaults.  

I request your approval to proceed.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tomasz Wójcik
