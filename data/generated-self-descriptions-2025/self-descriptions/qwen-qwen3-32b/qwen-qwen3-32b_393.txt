Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM with a duration of 12 months. The credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 983 DM. Savings account/bonds >= 1000 DM. Present employment less than 1 year. Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors/guarantors. Residence since 4 months. Property: real estate. Age 19. No other installment plans. Housing: rent. One existing credit at the bank. Job: unskilled resident. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

I need to create five different scenarios. Let me think of different angles. Maybe vary the reasons for needing furniture/equipment. For example, a student needing a desk, a worker needing tools, a single mother needing furniture for a new apartment, someone starting a small business from home, and someone replacing old appliances. Each person should have a unique situation but fit the profile.

Each letter must include specific details. Let me check each attribute:

- Checking account: 0-200 DM. Maybe some have a small balance, others maybe close to 200.
- Duration: 12 months. All have had the account for exactly 12 months?
- Credit history: paid back previous loans. Each has a good history.
- Purpose: furniture/equipment. Need to specify what exactly, like a sofa, kitchen appliances, etc.
- Credit amount: 983 DM. All letters request the same amount, but maybe different items.
- Savings: >=1000 DM. Each has savings, maybe different amounts or types (savings account, bonds).
- Employment: less than 1 year. Maybe different jobs, like part-time, recent move, etc.
- Personal status: female, married/separated. Maybe different marital statuses.
- No other debtors. Each is applying individually.
- Residence since 4 months. Maybe different cities or reasons for moving.
- Property: real estate. Do they own property? Maybe inherited, or a small plot? Wait, the profile says "real estate" but they are renting housing. Maybe they own a property elsewhere? Maybe inherited, or a small property. Need to clarify that in the letters.
- Age 19. All applicants are 19 years old. That's quite young, so maybe students or young workers.
- No other installment plans. No other loans.
- Housing: rent. They are renting their current residence.
- One existing credit at the bank. They already have a loan, maybe a smaller one, and now need another.
- Job: unskilled resident. Jobs like retail, service, etc.
- Dependents: 1. Each has one dependent, maybe a child or a relative.
- No telephone. Maybe they use a family phone or public phones.
- Foreign worker: yes. They are foreign workers, maybe in different countries, different reasons for moving.

Now, for each letter, I need to create a unique person. Let me start with the first one:

1. A young foreign worker in Germany, 19 years old, married with a child. She works part-time in retail, has a savings account with 1200 DM. Needs furniture for a new apartment. Already has a small loan from the bank. Lives in a rented place for 4 months. Owns a small inherited property in her home country.

Second letter: Maybe a student. But wait, she's 19, maybe a student needing a computer. But the job is unskilled. Maybe she works in a café and is studying part-time. Needs a desk and chair for studying. Has savings from family support.

Third: A single mother working in a restaurant, needs kitchen equipment for her home-based catering business. She has savings from her part-time job and wants to expand.

Fourth: A young woman who moved to a new city for work, needs furniture for her new rented apartment. She has a savings bond worth 1500 DM.

Fifth: Maybe someone needing to replace old appliances because of a flood or accident. She has a savings account, works in a factory, and needs a new fridge and stove.

Each letter must mention all the profile points. Let me check each attribute as I go. Make sure the employment duration is less than a year, savings over 1000 DM, etc. Also, ensure that each letter is concise, not too long, and ends properly.

I need to avoid generic terms. Instead of "scientific research assistant", the profile says "unskilled - resident". So jobs like retail clerk, factory worker, etc.

Also, the existing credit at the bank: each has one. Maybe different types: previous loan for initial furniture, a small appliance loan, etc.

Make sure each letter is from a different perspective, with unique scenarios but all fitting the profile. Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan. Use different purposes under furniture/equipment.

Now, draft each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered. Check for the specific numbers and terms. For example, duration in months is 12, so exactly one year. Savings account amount specified. Each letter should have a proper salutation, body explaining the purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and a closing.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Maria Lopez, and I am a 19-year-old foreign worker from Mexico currently employed as a retail sales associate in Frankfurt. I have lived in Germany for three years and have been working at my current job for eight months. My husband and I, who are separated, share custody of our 3-year-old daughter. We recently moved into a rented apartment and need essential furniture such as a bed, dining table, and wardrobe to create a stable home environment.  

I already have a small loan with your bank for a used car, which I am repaying on time. My savings account holds 1,200 DM, and I own a small inherited property in Mexico valued at approximately 5,000 DM. Although my current employment duration is under a year, I have a steady schedule and have consistently met my financial obligations. I kindly request a loan of 983 DM to cover the furniture costs. My punctual repayment history and savings demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,
