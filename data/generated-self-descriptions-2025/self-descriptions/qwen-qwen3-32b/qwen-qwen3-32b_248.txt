Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on a specific profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully. 

The profile has several key points: no checking account, 12 months duration, critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, purpose is radio/television, credit amount 717 DM, savings less than 100 DM, employed for over 7 years, single male, no other debtors, residence for 4 years, property is real estate, age 52, own housing, three existing credits at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, no phone, foreign worker.

First, I need to create five distinct individuals. Each should have specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "scientific research assistant," "electrician," etc. Also, need to vary the reasons for the loan within the radio/TV category. Maybe one needs a TV for their child's education, another for a small business, etc.

Each letter must explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Since they have a critical credit history, I should address that by showing responsibility, like repaying existing credits on time. They have three existing credits at the bank, so mentioning timely payments there would help.

Also, they have no checking account, so maybe they use savings or other methods. Savings are less than 100 DM, so they can't contribute much, but they can emphasize their stable job and residence. Age 52, foreign worker, single with one dependent. Need to make sure each letter has unique scenarios but fits the profile.

I need to avoid formatting, keep letters concise, and ensure each ends properly. Let me brainstorm different angles: maybe one is a teacher wanting a TV for educational resources, another is a technician needing a radio for work, a third is a caregiver needing entertainment for a child, etc. Each should have a unique story but adhere to the profile's constraints.

Also, since they have real estate, mentioning ownership of property can show stability. The foreign worker aspect could be tied to their employment history. Make sure each letter addresses their credit history by showing they've managed other debts responsibly. Each letter should start with their personal details, state the purpose, explain financials, and conclude with commitment to repayment.

Check for each profile attribute in every letter. For example, duration in residence is 4 years, so each applicant has lived there 4 years. Employment since >=7 years, so jobs should be at least 7 years. Each has 3 existing credits at the bank, so mention those. Also, no phone, so maybe they prefer in-person communication or have another way to stay reachable.

Need to vary the job titles: scientific research assistant, electrician, public administration official, etc. Each with specific employers or contexts. Make sure the purpose of the loan is different but fits under radio/TV. Maybe one is for a business, another for a child's education, another for health reasons, etc. Each should have a unique angle but still fit the given profile.

Also, ensure that the letters are short and concise. Avoid repetition. Each should start with the applicant's name, address, date, then to the bank. Then body paragraphs explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. End with thanks and contact info. Since no phone, maybe just address.

Now, draft each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered and each is distinct.

Dear Bank Manager  
I am writing to request a loan of 717 DM to purchase a television for my household. As a 52-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Dresden, I have been employed for 8 years and currently hold three existing credits with your bank, all of which I repay punctually. Though I do not maintain a checking account, I own real estate in my name and have resided at my current address for 4 years. My monthly installment capacity is 4 DM, and I am committed to ensuring timely repayments. I have one dependent, my daughter, and we reside in our own housing. Despite my critical credit history, I assure you of my dedication to financial responsibility. I kindly ask for your consideration and can be reached at the university’s contact address.  

Sincerely

Dear Loan Committee  
I seek a 717 DM loan to acquire a radio for my small auto repair business. As an electrician with a 7-year tenure at TechnoMech Werkstatt, I have no checking account but manage savings of 90 DM. My current residence in Leipzig is stable, and I own property there. Though my credit history has challenges, I have consistently repaid my three existing loans at this bank without default. At 52, I support my mother as my sole dependent and live in my own home. My foreign worker status does not detract from my reliability; I have worked uninterrupted in Germany for over a decade. I request your trust in my ability to meet monthly installments of 4 DM.  

Respectfully

Dear Sir/Madam  
I am applying for a 717 DM television to aid my son’s education. Working as a public administration official in Munich for 9 years, I earn a steady income but do not hold a checking account. My savings amount to 80 DM, and I own real estate in my name. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and live in my own housing. While my past credit experiences have been less than ideal, I have prioritized repaying my three active loans with your bank. At 52, I am single with one dependent and view this purchase as essential for our household. I guarantee timely 4-DM installments and appreciate your support.  

Yours faithfully

Dear Bank Officials  
I need a 717 DM loan to replace our nonfunctional radio. As a foreign worker employed as a chemical plant technician for 10 years, I lack a checking account but own property in Bremen. My current residence is stable, and I have no dependents besides myself. Though my credit history includes past difficulties, I have maintained three active credits with this bank for over a year, all repaid on time. My monthly installment capacity is 4 DM, and I value this opportunity to demonstrate my reliability. I kindly request approval and am available for further discussion at my workplace.  

Best regards
