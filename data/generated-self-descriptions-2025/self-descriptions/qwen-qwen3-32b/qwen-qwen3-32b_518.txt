Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

The profile has several key points: the applicant has a checking account with less than 0 DM, has had it for 6 months. Credit history is critical with other credits not at this bank. The purpose is a new car, loan amount 1361 DM. Savings under 100 DM. Employment for less than a year. Installment rate 2. Single male, no other debtors. Residence for 4 years, property is real estate, age 40, no other installment plans, housing is own, one existing credit at the bank, job is unskilled resident, 2 dependents, no phone, not a foreign worker.

First, I need to create five different people with specific jobs instead of "unskilled - resident". Maybe jobs like construction worker, warehouse technician, maintenance helper, etc. Each should have a unique reason for the car loan. For example, needing a reliable car for work commute, to transport dependents, for job-related purposes, etc.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their stable residence (4 years), real estate, existing credit at the bank, and employment, even though it's less than a year. Also, they have dependents, so maybe emphasize responsibility.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, no formatting, proper ending. Avoid generic terms. Use specific instances: instead of "skilled employee", use "construction laborer", etc. Also, note that they have a critical credit history but are seeking to improve it with this loan. They have another credit elsewhere but not at this bank. Maybe mention that they are managing existing debts and want to establish a good relationship with the bank.

Let me outline each person:

1. Construction Laborer: Needs a car for long commutes to job sites. Lives in own home, has real estate. Employed for 11 months. Dependents: wife and child. Existing credit is a small personal loan. Trustworthy because of stable residence and employment.

2. Warehouse Technician: Needs a car to transport tools and attend training. Has real estate, employed for 10 months. Dependents: two children. Existing credit is a bicycle loan. Trustworthy because of timely payments on current credit.

3. Maintenance Helper: Needs a car for job requirements and to transport family. Employed for 10 months, owns home. Dependents: two. Existing credit is a furniture loan. Trustworthy due to real estate and commitment to repay.

4. Delivery Assistant: Needs reliable car for job (deliveries). Employed for 11 months. Dependents: two. Owns home. Existing credit for a motorcycle. Trustworthy because of steady income and property.

5. Janitorial Staff: Needs car for work and family needs. Employed for 10 months. Owns home. Dependents: two. Existing credit for appliances. Trustworthy due to residence duration and real estate.

Each letter should start with sender's info, date, bank address, subject. Then body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Conclude with thanks and contact info.

Make sure to mention specific numbers: 4 years at residence, 1 existing credit, 2 dependents, etc. Also note the critical credit history but show responsibility. Maybe each person has a slightly different angle on why they need the car.

Check for conciseness, avoid repetition, use proper structure without markdown. Each letter should be self-contained and unique.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
[Your Name]  
[Your Address]  
[City, Date]  

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,361 DM to purchase a reliable vehicle. As a construction laborer with 11 months of employment at [Company Name], I require a car to commute to job sites, which are often 40 kilometers from my residence. I have lived at my current address for four years and own the property. Though my checking account balance is currently negative due to recent equipment repairs, I have consistently paid my existing furniture loan (150 DM monthly) on time through [Other Bank]. My stable income (850 DM/month) and property ownership demonstrate my commitment to financial responsibility. I kindly request this loan to improve my work efficiency and support my wife and daughter. I am available for further discussion at [Phone Number].  

Sincerely,

I seek a 1,361 DM loan to purchase a vehicle for transporting tools and attending vocational training.
