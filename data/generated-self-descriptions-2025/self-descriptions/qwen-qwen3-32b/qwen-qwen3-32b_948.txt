Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account balance under 0 DM, which is negative. The person has had their checking account for 24 months. Credit history shows all past credits at the bank were paid back. The loan purpose is furniture/equipment, amount 3349 DM. Savings are between 500-1000 DM. Employment duration is less than a year, installment rate 4, male, single, no other debtors, residence since 4 months, no property, age 30, no other installment plans, housing for free, one existing credit at the bank, job as a skilled employee or official, two dependents, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different jobs first. The profile says "skilled employee / official." Let me pick specific jobs: scientific research assistant, electrician, IT technician, teacher, and maybe a nurse. Each should have unique scenarios but fit the profile.

For each letter, they need to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let me start with the first one.

First person: Scientific research assistant. He's been at his job for less than a year, maybe transferred from another institution. His savings are 700 DM. He needs furniture for a new apartment since moving four months ago. He has two dependents. Emphasize his good credit history and existing credit paid back.

Second person: Electrician. Maybe he's self-employed? Wait, the profile says present employment since less than a year. Maybe he changed jobs. Needs equipment for his business. Has savings of 600 DM. Trustworthy because of past credit repayment.

Third: IT technician. Recently relocated, so residence since four months. Needs furniture for a new home. Has a dependent child and a parent. Highlight his stable employment despite recent move.

Fourth: Teacher. Maybe part-time? Or a new position? Needs to furnish a rental apartment. Savings 800 DM. Emphasize timely payments on existing credit.

Fifth: Nurse working night shifts. Needs to buy equipment for home setup. Maybe she's a registered foreign worker, has been in the country a while. Two dependents, living with family (housing for free). Show her responsibility with past loans.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific numbers: 3349 DM loan amount, 4 DM installment, 24 months checking account, 4 years residence (wait, present residence since is 4 months, not years. Wait, in the profile it says "Present residence since:4" which is 4 months. So each person has lived at current address for 4 months. Also, age 30, single, male, no other credits except one at the bank. Savings between 500-1000 DM. Each should mention their savings, existing credit paid back, current job duration less than a year, etc.

Let me check each attribute again to make sure I don't miss anything. Also, each letter must be concise, not too long, proper ending, no formatting.

Now, drafting each letter with unique scenarios. Let me start with the first one.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to request a loan of 3349 DM to purchase essential furniture for my newly rented apartment. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for 11 months and earn a stable monthly income of 2800 DM. Despite my recent relocation, I have maintained a good credit history, having fully repaid my previous car loan through this bank. My savings account currently holds 700 DM, and I reside with my two young children in a furnished room provided free of charge by my sister. While my checking account has occasionally dipped below zero due to upfront school fees for my children, I am confident my disciplined budgeting and existing savings will allow me to manage the 4 DM monthly installment. I kindly ask for your trust in my ability to repay, as I value my decade-long relationship with this bank.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 3349 DM loan to replace outdated tools for my electrical contracting business. I have worked as a certified electrician at Wagner & Co. for 8 months, earning 3100 DM monthly. Though I relocated to Hamburg 4 months ago and opened a new checking account, I have consistently paid my sole existing credit (a student loan) on time. My savings account holds 600 DM, and I live rent-free with my mother, who cares for my 5-year-old son. My current employer has assured me of continued employment, and I am committed to repaying this loan through my stable income. I am a registered foreign worker with a 10-year work history in Germany and believe this bank’s support will help me grow my trade.  

Respectfully,  
Tarek Özdemir

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 3349 DM loan to furnish my rental home, which I moved into 4 months ago. As a full-time IT technician at TechNova since July 2023, I earn 2950 DM monthly. My savings account contains 900 DM, and I have no outstanding debts beyond my existing personal loan of 1500 DM, which I repay punctually. I am a single father raising my daughter and my elderly father-in-law, who resides with me in a no-cost housing arrangement. While my checking account has faced temporary overdrafts due to medical expenses, I have resolved these promptly. My 8-year track record of timely repayments with this bank underscores my reliability.  

Yours faithfully,  
Markus Fischer

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I request a loan to equip my new part-time teaching job at a language school. As a certified English teacher hired 9 months ago, I earn 2400 DM monthly, supplemented by freelance tutoring. My savings of 800 DM and my history of repaying a prior student credit at this bank demonstrate my financial responsibility. I have lived at my current address for 4 months and care for my 3-year-old daughter alone. Though my checking account occasionally dips below zero due to irregular income, my budgeting and secondary income streams ensure I can manage the proposed installment. I am a registered foreign worker with 6 years of local employment and deeply value this bank’s role in my journey.  

Sincerely,  
Ali Rezaei

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I need 3349 DM to purchase medical equipment for my home-based nursing business. As a licensed nurse at St. Anna Hospital since March 2024, I earn 3000 DM monthly and have 500 DM in savings. I currently live rent-free with my aunt while caring for my infant son and elderly mother. My sole existing credit, a 5000 DM equipment loan, was repaid in full in 2022. While my checking account has faced minor overdrafts due to maternity leave expenses, I have always covered these swiftly. My 7 years of nursing experience and dedication to my clients assure you of my ability to meet repayment obligations.  

Gratefully,  
Jens Weber
