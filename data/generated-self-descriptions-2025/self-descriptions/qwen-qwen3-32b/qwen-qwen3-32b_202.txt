Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile says the person has no checking account but has been with the bank for 9 months. Their credit history is critical with existing credits not at this bank. The loan purpose is education, amount 936 DM. Savings are between 500-1000 DM. They've been employed for at least 7 years, are single males, no dependents except one, have a car or other property, own their housing, two existing credits at the bank, job is skilled employee or official, have a phone, and are registered foreign workers.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different jobs that fit "skilled employee / official." Maybe a scientific research assistant, a teacher, an electrician, a civil servant, and a mechanic. Each should have unique details.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let me start with the first one.

First person: Scientific Research Assistant. He's 52, has been working at a university for 8 years. His savings are 750 DM. He needs the loan for his son's technical education. He has a critical credit history but is repaying other loans. He owns a car and lives in his own house. He has two existing credits at the bank for equipment. He's a single father with one dependent. He mentions his stable job and savings as trustworthiness.

Second person: Maybe a teacher. Let's say he's a high school physics teacher with 7 years of experience. Savings 600 DM. Purpose is his daughter's education. He has a critical credit from another bank for a car loan. He owns his home, has a car. Two existing credits here for classroom supplies. He emphasizes his steady income and savings.

Third person: Electrician. 52 years old, self-employed for 7 years. Savings 900 DM. Loan for his nephew's vocational training. Critical credit history due to a previous business loan. Owns tools and a van. Lives in owned housing. Two credits here for equipment. He highlights his steady contracts and savings.

Fourth person: Civil servant. Maybe a municipal office worker with 10 years of service. Savings 800 DM. Loan for his brother's education (since he's single with no children). Critical credit from another bank for a personal loan. Owns a car. Two credits here for office upgrades. Emphasizes job security and savings.

Fifth person: Car mechanic. 52, owns a repair shop, 9 years in business. Savings 550 DM. Loan for his son's college. Critical credit history from a equipment loan elsewhere. Owns tools and a workshop. Two credits here for parts. Highlights steady income from the shop and savings.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific numbers and details from the profile. Also, check that each has a unique job and situation. Avoid repetition in reasons for the loan, but since the purpose is education, maybe vary the relation (son, daughter, nephew, brother, son). Each should mention their savings amount, employment duration, existing credits, assets, and why they're trustworthy despite critical credit history. Also, mention the installment rate of 4 DM, but maybe not necessary if it's covered in the context.

Now, structure each letter with proper salutation, body paragraphs explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and a polite closing. Keep them concise. Make sure not to use any formatting and end each properly. Let me draft each one step by step.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 936 DM to fund my son’s technical education. As a 52-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, I have worked in my role for 8 years, providing a stable income of 2,200 DM monthly. Though I currently lack a checking account, I maintain a savings account with 750 DM at this bank. My existing credits—two small equipment loans at this bank—are repaid punctually. I own a used car and reside in a home I have occupied for 2 years. Despite a past critical credit history with a private lender, my disciplined savings and steady employment make me a reliable candidate. I kindly request your support to invest in my son’s future.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Henning

Dear Sir/Madam,  
I seek a 936 DM loan to cover my daughter’s vocational training in nursing. At 52, I have served as a high school physics teacher in Dresden for 7 years, earning 2,000 DM monthly. I hold no checking account but have 600 DM in savings bonds. My current housing is owned, and I own a reliable used car. I have two outstanding credits at this bank for classroom supplies, both managed responsibly. While my credit history includes a critical auto loan from another institution, my 7-year employment and consistent savings demonstrate my ability to meet obligations. This loan will secure my daughter’s career prospects.  

Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Lars Müller
