Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile mentions a foreign worker, male, married/widowed, 20 years old, with a checking account under 0 DM, 24 months duration. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 2996. Savings account unknown/no, employment since 1-4 years, installment rate 2. Property: car or other. Own housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job as skilled employee/official. Dependents: 1. No telephone.

First, I need to create five distinct individuals. Let me brainstorm different scenarios. Maybe different nationalities, jobs, reasons for furniture purchase. Each person should have specific details. Let me think of jobs first. The profile says "skilled employee / official." So maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, teacher, nurse, IT technician. Each with specific instances.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Also, mention their existing credit paid back, employment duration (between 1-4 years), own home, car, etc. Since they have a dependent, maybe a spouse or child. Also, they are foreign workers, so maybe from different countries.

Let me start with the first one. A scientific research assistant from India, working at a university lab. He's been employed for 2.5 years. Needs furniture for a new apartment after moving. Has a car. Existing credit for a laptop paid off. Married with a dependent child. Emphasize timely payments, stable job, own home.

Second, maybe a electrician from Mexico, working for a construction company. Employed for 3 years. Needs to buy tools/equipment for his job. Has a motorcycle. Existing credit for a tools purchase. Married, no children yet, but a dependent spouse. Highlight his punctual payments and steady income.

Third, a nurse from the Philippines working in a hospital. Employed for 1.5 years. Needs furniture for their home since they had a baby. They have a car. Existing credit for medical equipment. Married with a dependent infant. Stress the need for better furniture for the child and reliable payment history.

Fourth, an IT technician from Vietnam. Employed for 3.5 years at a tech firm. Wants to upgrade home office equipment. Has a car. Existing credit for a laptop. Married, dependent spouse. Emphasize technical job stability and timely repayments.

Fifth, a teacher's assistant from Colombia, working in a school for 2 years. Needs to furnish a new living room after renovation. Owns a car. Existing credit for a classroom supplies purchase. Married with a dependent. Highlight educational role and responsibility.

Each letter should be concise, mention specific numbers (like 2996 DM for furniture), employment duration, existing credit history, assets (car, own home), dependents. Also, since they are foreign workers, maybe mention their legal status or duration in the country. But the profile says "foreign worker: yes," so maybe just state that they are legally employed.

I need to make sure each letter is unique in the person's job, specific instances, and reasons for the loan. Also, avoid using generic terms, use specifics as per the example. Also, check that all profile attributes are addressed in each letter. For example, each should mention their checking account is under 0 DM, but maybe explain it as a temporary situation due to recent expenses. Also, no savings account, but maybe they are building one or planning to. However, the profile says savings account is unknown/no, so maybe just don't mention it or state they don't have one yet.

Also, the installment rate is 2, which might refer to the percentage or the number of installments. Not sure, but maybe mention the ability to manage installments based on their income. Since they have an existing credit at the bank, maybe reference that as a positive factor.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then a salutation. Then the body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Conclude with thanks and signature.

Let me draft the first one:

Name: Rajesh Kumar, Scientific Research Assistant from India, employed 2.5 years, existing credit for laptop, paid back. Needs furniture for new apartment. Married with child. Owns a car, lives in own home. Mention checking account is temporary negative due to moving costs. Emphasize stable job and timely payments.

Second: Carlos Mendez, Electrician from Mexico, 3 years employed, needs tools for job, existing credit for tools. Married, dependent spouse. Owns motorcycle, own home. Checking account negative due to tool purchases. Reliable payments.

Third: Maria Santos, Nurse from the Philippines, 1.5 years employed, needs furniture for new baby. Car owner, own home. Existing credit for medical equipment. Married with infant.

Fourth: Minh Tran, IT Technician from Vietnam, 3.5 years employed, needs home office equipment upgrade. Car, own house. Existing credit for laptop. Dependent spouse.

Fifth: Sofia Ramirez, Teacher's Assistant from Colombia, 2 years employed, furnishing living room after renovation. Car, own home. Existing credit for classroom supplies. Dependent spouse.

Each letter should have these elements but phrased differently. Make sure to mention the loan amount (2996 DM) and purpose. Also, the installment rate is 2, which might mean 2% or 2 installments, but since it's unclear, maybe just state that they can manage the installments with their income.

Check for each profile attribute: checking account <0 DM, duration 24 months (so 2 years?), credit history, purpose, amount, savings unknown/no, employment 1-4 years, installment rate 2, male married/widowed, no debtors, residence since 4 years, property car, age 20, no other plans, housing own, 1 credit at bank, job skilled, dependents 1, no telephone, foreign worker.

Each letter must address these. For example, mention residence since 4 years (so living in current home for 4 years?), property (car), age 20, etc. Also, since they are male and married/widowed, maybe some are married, others widowed. But the profile says "male: married/widowed," so each applicant is either married or widowed. Maybe vary between married and widowed in the letters. However, the user example uses "married with a dependent child," so maybe for the first letters, assume married. But need to check if widowed is possible. However, being 20 and widowed is less common, but possible. Maybe stick with married for all, given the age.

Also, telephone: none. So they don't have a telephone, but that's part of the profile. Maybe mention that they prefer written communication or don't have a landline, but since it's a motivation letter, perhaps not necessary unless it's relevant. Maybe omit unless it's part of the profile. Since it's part of the profile, but the user says to invent specific instances. However, since they don't have a telephone, maybe just not include it in the letters unless it's relevant. Since it's not directly related to trustworthiness, maybe skip.

Now, drafting each letter with these points. Make sure each is unique and addresses all aspects. Keep them short, so maybe 3-4 paragraphs each. Start with purpose, then financial situation, then trustworthiness, and a conclusion.

Let me start writing each one step by step.

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2996 DM to purchase essential furniture for my new apartment in Frankfurt. As a scientific research assistant at the Goethe University for 2.5 years, I have a stable monthly income of 2400 DM. My current checking account balance is temporarily negative due to recent relocation costs, but my employment and housing in my own home provide long-term financial security. I have already repaid a prior loan for a laptop through this bank and consistently meet payment deadlines. My wife and I, who have a 1-year-old child, rely on my income, and I own a car valued at 6000 DM. I kindly request your approval for this loan, confident in my ability to manage installments responsibly.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,
