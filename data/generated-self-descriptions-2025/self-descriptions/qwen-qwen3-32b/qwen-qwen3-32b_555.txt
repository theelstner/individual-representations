Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, duration of 12 months. Credit history is critical with existing credits not at this bank. The purpose is a new car, loan amount 1995 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Employment for less than a year, installment rate 4. Single male, no debtors/guarantors, residence since 1 month, property is a car or other. Age 27, no other installment plans, housing is own, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

I need to create five different people with these specifics. Let me think of different job roles for the "skilled employee / official" part. Maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, IT technician, teacher, and a mechanic. Each should have unique circumstances but fit the profile.

For each letter, they need to explain why they need the loan (car purchase), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Since their credit history is critical and they have existing credits elsewhere, they should address that. Also, they’re foreign workers, so maybe mention their stable job or residence.

Let me start with the first one. A scientific research assistant. He's been working for 8 years but moved recently. His existing credit is a small personal loan. He has savings of 300 DM. He needs a car for commuting. Emphasize his stable job and savings.

Second, an electrician. Maybe he's been in his job for 9 months. His existing credit is a bike loan. He has 200 DM in savings. Needs a car for work. Highlight his trade and ability to repay.

Third, IT technician. He's been employed for 10 months. Existing credit for a laptop. Savings of 450 DM. Car needed for client visits. Stress his technical skills and savings.

Fourth, a teacher. Wait, but the job is listed as skilled employee. Maybe a substitute teacher? He has a critical credit history due to a past medical bill. Savings of 150 DM. Needs a car for commuting. Emphasize steady income and residence.

Fifth, a mechanic. He has an existing credit for tools. Savings of 350 DM. Needs a car for work. Mention his trade and home ownership.

Each letter should be concise, start with their name and address, then state purpose, financial situation, and trustworthiness. Make sure not to use formatting, just plain text. Also, ensure each has unique details as per the profile. Check that all attributes from the profile are covered in each letter. Avoid generic terms, use specifics like exact job titles, amounts, durations. Make sure each ends properly with a closing. Let me draft each one now.

Dear [Bank Name]  

My name is Ahmed Khan, and I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, where I have worked for 8 years. Due to recent relocation for work, I have resided in my current home for only 1 month. I am applying for a loan of 1995 DM to purchase a new car, essential for commuting to my laboratory. I currently maintain a checking account with 150 DM and a savings account with 300 DM. Though I have an existing motorcycle loan from another institution, my stable income of 2800 DM monthly, combined with my 10 years of experience in scientific research, ensures I can manage repayments. I own a home and have one dependent, my daughter. I request your trust in my ability to fulfill this obligation responsibly.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khan
