Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on a given profile. First, I need to parse the profile to understand the specifics. The profile includes details like age 26, divorced, skilled employee, savings between 500-1000 DM, existing credit paid back, etc. 

I need to make sure each letter is unique. The generic attributes need specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant," "IT technician," etc. Each person should have a different job, purpose (though the profile says radio/television, but maybe each can have a slight variation?), but wait, the purpose is fixed as radio/television. Hmm, but the user says to invent specific instances of all generic attributes. Wait, the original profile's purpose is radio/television, but maybe each letter can have a different purpose? Wait, no, the profile says the purpose is radio/television. But maybe the user wants each letter to have a different purpose? Wait, the instruction says "invent specific instances of all generic attributes from the profile." So the generic attributes in the profile include "Purpose: radio/television," so maybe that's fixed? Or is that a generic attribute that needs to be specified? Wait, the original profile says "Purpose: radio/television," but the instruction says to replace generic attributes with specific instances. So maybe "radio/television" is generic, and needs to be made specific. For example, instead of just radio/television, maybe "purchase of a professional broadcasting setup for a home studio." But the original purpose is for the loan, so maybe each person is applying for a different purpose under the umbrella of radio/television? Or maybe the user wants to vary the purpose? The instruction is a bit unclear here.

Wait, looking back: the user says "Invent specific instances of all generic attributes from the profile (e.g. "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee", "8 years" instead of ">= 7 years", etc.)". So the purpose is listed as radio/television, which is a generic attribute. Therefore, each letter should have a specific instance of that. For example, instead of just radio/television, maybe "upgrading my home television setup for remote work," or "purchasing a radio communication device for my small business." Each letter can have a different specific purpose under the radio/television category. But I need to be careful to stay within the original purpose. Alternatively, maybe the original purpose is fixed as radio/television, but the user wants each letter to have a different angle. Hmm.

Also, each person has the same profile parameters, but different specific instances. For example, each has a different job (scientific research assistant, IT technician, etc.), different durations (e.g., 8 years instead of >=7), etc. So for each of the five letters, I need to vary the specific details while keeping the same profile structure.

Let me outline the parameters:

- Status of existing checking account: 0 <= ... < 200 DM. So each person's checking account is in that range. Maybe different amounts, e.g., 150 DM, 50 DM, etc.

- Duration in month: 12. So each has had the account for 12 months.

- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly till now. So each has a good history.

- Purpose: radio/television. Need specific instances.

- Credit amount: 1158 DM. Fixed.

- Savings account/bonds: 500 <= ... < 1000 DM. Different amounts here.

- Present employment since: 1 <= ... < 4 years. So each has between 1 to 4 years at current job. Maybe 2 years, 3 years, etc.

- Installment rate: 3. Not sure what this refers to, but maybe the rate they can pay back? Or the number of installments? Maybe each letter mentions a 3% rate or something.

- Personal status and sex: male, divorced/separated. Each person is a male, divorced or separated.

- Other debtors / guarantors: none.

- Present residence since: 1 year. So each has lived there 1 year.

- Property: car or other. Maybe each has a car, or one has other property.

- Age: 26. All 26 years old.

- Other installment plans: none.

- Housing: own. All own their housing.

- Number of existing credits at this bank: 1.

- Job: skilled employee / official. Each has a different skilled job.

- Dependents: 1. Each has one dependent.

- Telephone: yes.

- Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name. So each is a registered foreign worker.

So, for each letter, I need to vary the specific instances of these attributes. Let's start with the first person.

First person: Job as scientific research assistant, savings 700 DM, employment since 2 years, purpose: purchasing a professional television for remote work setup. Checking account 120 DM. Maybe he's divorced with a child. He works at a research institute. He has a car. He wants the loan to buy a TV for his home office since he works remotely. He's been paying back previous credits on time. His savings are 700 DM. He owns his home. He has a telephone. He's a registered foreign worker.

Second person: Job as IT technician, savings 600 DM, employment since 3 years, purpose: buying a radio communication device for his small IT business. Checking account 180 DM. Divorced, one child. Has a car. Owns home. Existing credit paid. Wants loan for business equipment to expand services. Installment rate 3%. 

Third person: Job as public administration official, savings 900 DM, employment since 1 year (but the profile says present employment since 1 <= ... <4, so 1 year is okay), purpose: upgrading home television for elderly parent (dependent). Checking account 80 DM. Divorced, one dependent. Car owned. Owns housing. Needs better TV for parent's health. 

Fourth person: Job as mechanical engineer, savings 500 DM, employment since 3.5 years, purpose: purchasing a high-quality radio for emergency preparedness. Checking account 150 DM. Divorced, one child. Owns a car. Has a good credit history. 

Fifth person: Job as teacher, savings 800 DM, employment since 2.5 years, purpose: buying a television to support remote teaching. Checking account 200 DM (but the checking account is 0-200, so 200 is the upper limit, but the profile says <200, so maybe 190 DM). Divorced, one dependent. Car. Owns home. Needs TV for teaching during school closures. 

Each letter should be concise, explain why they need the loan, their financial situation (checking, savings, job, etc.), and why they're trustworthy (good credit history, stable job, etc.). Make sure each has a unique job and purpose. Avoid repetition. Also, ensure all parameters are covered. Check that each has the same profile structure but with specific instances. Also, the letters should not be formatted, just plain text. Proper ending with a sign-off. Let me draft each one now.
