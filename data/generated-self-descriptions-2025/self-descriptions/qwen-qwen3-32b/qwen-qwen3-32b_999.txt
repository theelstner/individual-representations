Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person has no checking account, has been in their current job for at least 7 years, and is a skilled employee. The purpose is for radio/television, credit amount is 804, savings less than 100 DM. They are a single male, 38 years old, foreign worker, own a car or other property, live in their own housing, have one existing credit paid back, and have been in their residence for 4 years. No telephone, no other installment plans, no debtors/guarantors, one dependent.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different job roles under "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, an IT technician, a teacher, and a chef. Each should have specific details.

First person: Scientific research assistant. Let's say he works at a university. He needs the loan for a radio telescope project. He's been there 8 years. His savings are 80 DM. He has a car. Lives in own house. Paid back previous loans. Needs the loan for equipment. Trustworthy because of steady job and good credit history.

Second person: Auto mechanic. Maybe he owns a garage. Needs TV for customer waiting area. Been in business 7 years. Savings 50 DM. Has a van as property. Reliable because of consistent income and timely payments.

Third person: IT technician. Works for a company, needs to buy a TV for home entertainment. Has been employed 9 years. Savings 30 DM. Owns a car. Has a good track record with previous credit.

Fourth person: High school teacher. Needs a radio for a school project. Employed 10 years. Savings 90 DM. Owns a car. Has a stable job and pays back loans on time.

Fifth person: Chef in a restaurant. Needs a radio for kitchen communication. Employed 7 years. Savings 20 DM. Owns a motorcycle. Has a steady income and good credit history.

Now, each letter should include their specific job, duration, savings, purpose, property, and reasons for trustworthiness. Make sure each is concise, starts with their name and address, date, bank address, subject line, body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and a polite closing.

Check for each letter: no checking account, duration in job >=7 years, savings <100 DM, own residence, one existing credit paid, no other debts, foreign worker, single with one dependent. Also, mention installment rate of 4, which is the monthly payment they can handle.

Avoid using formatting, keep paragraphs short. Make sure each letter ends properly. Let me draft each one now.

Subject: Loan Application for Radio Telescope Equipment  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 804 DM to purchase specialized radio equipment for a research project at the University of Berlin. As a scientific research assistant in astrophysics, I have worked at the university for 8 years, earning a stable monthly income of 1,200 DM.

My savings amount to 80 DM, and I own a used car valued at 3,000 DM. I reside in my own apartment, having lived there for 4 years, and support one dependent. While I do not own a telephone, my employment history and foreign worker status through the university ensure my reliability. I propose an installment rate of 4 DM per month, aligning with my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan responsibly.  

Sincerely,
