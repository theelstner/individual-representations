Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to understand the profile details.

The profile has specific attributes: checking account between 0-200 DM, 20 months duration. Credit history includes past delays. Purpose is "others", credit amount 2629 DM. Savings <100 DM. Employment since 1-4 years. Installment rate 2. Male, single, no other debtors. Residence since 3 years. Property is car or other. Age 29, other installment plans with bank, housing is own, 2 existing credits at the bank, job is skilled employee/official, 1 dependent, has a telephone, foreign worker registered.

I need to create five different people fitting these specifics. Each letter must explain the loan purpose, financial situation, and trustworthiness. They should be concise, no formatting, proper endings.

First, think of different professions for skilled employees. Maybe a lab technician, IT support, electrician, teacher, or mechanic. Each person's purpose is "others", so I need to invent plausible reasons: maybe medical expenses, home repairs, starting a side business, education, or urgent travel.

For each letter, start with the person's name and address, date, bank address. Then explain their situation. Mention their job, tenure (within 1-4 years), savings, existing credits. Address past credit issues by showing improvement. Highlight stability like owning a home, having a dependent, telephone, etc. Emphasize ability to repay with current income and existing installment plans.

Check each letter for unique scenarios. Make sure each has specific numbers: e.g., 8 years at job (but profile says employment since 1-4 years? Wait, the profile says "Present employment since:1 <= ... <4 years", so employment duration is between 1 to 4 years. So each person should have been in their job for, say, 2, 3, 1.5, etc. years. Also, age is 29, so maybe different birth dates but same age.

Wait, the profile says "Duration in month:20" which is about 1.6 years. But the employment duration is 1-4 years. Maybe the checking account is 20 months old, but employment is longer? Wait, the profile lists "Duration in month:20" which refers to the checking account's duration. The employment duration is "Present employment since:1 <= ... <4 years". So each person has been employed between 1 to 4 years. So when writing, specify employment duration as 2 years, 3 years, etc.

Also, each person has 2 existing credits at the bank. Need to mention that they've managed those responsibly now.

Each letter should address past delays but show improvement. Maybe explain that past issues were due to unforeseen circumstances and now they're stable.

Make sure each letter has a unique purpose. For example:

1. Medical emergency for dependent
2. Home repairs to maintain property
3. Starting a small business on the side
4. Vocational training to advance career
5. Urgent family travel

Each person's name and job should vary. Let's start drafting.

First person: Maybe a lab technician at a clinic, employed for 2 years, needs funds for medical bills. Has a dependent child. Emphasize stable job, own home, and existing credits managed.

Second: IT support technician, 3 years at job, needs to repair roof. Mention savings are low but have home equity.

Third: Electrician, self-employed, needs equipment for side business. Highlight steady income and another credit for tools.

Fourth: Teacher's aide, vocational training to become a teacher. Existing education loan, need to cover tuition.

Fifth: Automotive mechanic, need funds for a family emergency trip. Emphasize steady income and responsibility.

Each letter should start with sender's info, date, bank address, subject. Then body paragraphs explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. End with thanks and contact info.

Need to avoid generic terms. Use specific job titles, exact durations (e.g., 2 years, 3.5 years), specific reasons for loan.

Check for each profile attribute in every letter: checking account <200 DM, savings <100, credit history with past delays, etc.

Also, each letter must not be cut off, so ensure complete ending. No markdown, plain text with line breaks.

Now, let me draft each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered and each is unique.

Subject: Application for a Loan of 2,629 DM  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,629 DM to cover urgent medical expenses for my 5-year-old daughter, who requires specialized treatment. As a scientific research assistant at the Charité Hospital for the past 2.5 years, I earn a stable monthly income of 2,400 DM. My current checking account balance is 150 DM, and my savings account holds 80 DM, though I have consistently improved my financial discipline since a minor payment delay two years ago.  

I reside in my own apartment in Berlin and have lived there for three years. I already manage two small credits with this bank for laboratory equipment, which I repay punctually. My employer confirms my job security, and my role as a research assistant ensures long-term stability. With my current income and existing repayment plans, I am confident in meeting future installments.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for further discussion and can be reached at the provided telephone number.  

Sincerely,
