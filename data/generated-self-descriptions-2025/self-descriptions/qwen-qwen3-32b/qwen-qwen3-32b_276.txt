Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The duration is 30 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is repairs, credit amount 11998 DM. Savings account under 100 DM. Present employment less than a year. Installment rate 1. Male, divorced. No other debtors. Residence since 1 month. No property. Age 34. No other installment plans. Own housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job is unskilled, resident. One dependent. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

So, each letter needs to be from a different person. I need to invent specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe a scientific research assistant, but in the profile, the job is unskilled. Wait, the job is listed as "unskilled - resident." So the person is an unskilled worker. Hmm. Let me make sure I get the job right. The profile says "Job:unskilled - resident." So each person is an unskilled worker, but maybe different roles? Like construction worker, factory worker, etc. Also, each has a different purpose for repairs. The profile says repairs, but maybe specify types of repairs, like home repairs, roof repairs, plumbing, etc.

Also, each person has a different name and specific situation. Let me think about the other attributes. They all have a divorced status, one dependent, own housing, etc. But maybe different reasons for divorce, different dependents (child, parent?), different employment situations (maybe recently moved, foreign worker status). The foreign worker is registered under their name, so perhaps they are immigrants.

I need to make sure each letter is unique. Let me brainstorm five different scenarios:

1. A construction worker needing repairs on his own home after a storm damaged it. He has a steady job but recently moved to the area, hence the short employment and residence duration. He's divorced with a child.

2. A factory worker whose home has electrical issues needing urgent repair. He has a good credit history but low savings. He's from another country, registered as a foreign worker.

3. A maintenance worker needing plumbing repairs. He's been working in the same job for 8 years but recently relocated, hence the short residence. His ex-spouse has custody of the child.

4. A warehouse worker needing roof repairs to prevent further damage. He's been employed for 11 months, has a dependent parent to care for, and has no property.

5. A janitor requiring structural repairs on his house. He's divorced, has a child, and works part-time, hence the unskilled job. He's been in the country for a year under foreign worker status.

Each letter should include the purpose, financial situation (negative checking account, low savings, existing credit paid back), trustworthiness (credit history, existing credit at the bank, telephone as a contact), and why they need the loan. Make sure to mention the specific numbers: 11998 DM, 30 months, etc.

Also, each letter should start with the person's name, address, date, bank address, and then the body. The body should explain the situation, the need for the loan, their ability to repay, and their trustworthiness. End with a polite thank you and sign off.

Let me check the profile again to ensure all attributes are covered. Each person has a checking account <0 DM, duration 30 months (maybe 2.5 years?), savings <100 DM, employment <1 year, residence since 1 month, age 34, male, divorced, one dependent, own housing, existing credit at the bank, no other credits, no property, telephone, foreign worker.

Now, let me draft each letter with these specifics, making sure each person has unique details but fits the profile.

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to request a loan of 11,998 DM to cover urgent repairs on my home following storm damage last month. As a construction worker employed at [Company Name] for 8 years, I earn a stable monthly income of 2,200 DM. Despite this, my checking account currently shows a deficit due to recent medical expenses for my 7-year-old daughter, whom I support alone after my divorce in 2021. I have maintained a good credit history, repaying my existing car loan (1,500 DM balance) on time for 18 months. Though I relocated to [City] three months ago for work, I own my home here and have no property elsewhere. My savings are minimal (80 DM) as I prioritized my daughter’s needs. I am a registered foreign worker under my name and own a mobile phone for consistent communication. I assure timely repayment of this loan through my monthly earnings, allocating 1,200 DM toward installments. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 11,998 DM loan to repair electrical hazards in my home, which a recent inspection deemed unsafe. Working as a factory operator at [Factory Name] for 6 years, I earn 2,000 DM monthly. My current checking account is overdrawn due to a family emergency in [Country] last year, but I have consistently repaid my existing 5,000 DM loan here. I am divorced, with sole custody of my son, and we reside in our owned home. I moved to [City] one month ago under foreign worker registration and have no local property beyond this residence. My savings are low (50 DM) as I prioritize my son’s education. I have no other debts and own a landline telephone. I propose a 1,000 DM monthly installment, feasible given my stable income. Your trust would mean securing my family’s safety.  

Gratefully,  
[Your Name]

To [Bank Name],  

I apply for a 11,998 DM loan to fix critical plumbing leaks preventing water supply. As a maintenance technician at [Company] for 5 years, I earn 1,900 DM monthly.
