Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, duration of 48 months (which is 4 years). Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is for radio/television, credit amount 6999 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Present employment since 4 to 7 years. The person is a male, married or widowed, with a guarantor. Residence since 1 month, property is real estate, age 34, no other installment plans, housing is own, two existing credits at the bank, job is skilled employee or official, one dependent, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

Wait, the profile mentions "Duration in month:48" which is 4 years, but under present employment since it's 4 <= ... <7 years. So employment duration is between 4 to 7 years. So each person should have specific job roles, like scientific research assistant, teacher, etc., with exact years. Also, each person's purpose is radio/television, but I need to make that specific. Maybe they need equipment for a specific purpose, like a home studio or educational content.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They all have a guarantor, real estate, and existing credits paid back. Let me brainstorm different scenarios.

First person: Maybe a teacher needing equipment for an online school. Second: A scientist needing gear for research. Third: A journalist needing recording equipment. Fourth: A musician needing studio equipment. Fifth: A small business owner needing advertising via radio/TV.

Each should have specific job titles, exact employment duration (e.g., 5 years), specific purpose (like buying a camera, microphone, etc.), mention the guarantor, existing credits, real estate, and dependents. Also, mention the telephone as yes, foreign worker status.

Need to make sure each letter is unique but fits the profile. Avoid generic terms. Let me start drafting each one, keeping them concise and proper.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to request a loan of 6999 DM to purchase professional audio equipment for my online language school. As a certified German teacher with 5 years of experience at the municipal education department, I have built a stable income stream. My current position, held for 5 years, provides a monthly salary of 3200 DM, from which I consistently meet my existing two loans (a car loan and student debt) totaling 800 DM in installments. Though my checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent equipment repairs, I have maintained a 4-year relationship with your bank and have always repaid credits responsibly. My wife and I own a condominium valued at 250,000 DM, and my uncle, a retired engineer, has agreed to act as a guarantor. This loan will enable me to expand my classes, ensuring my 12-year-old daughter’s future educational stability. I look forward to your support.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Reinhardt

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Bank Manager,  

I seek a 6999 DM loan to invest in a high-definition camera and editing software for my freelance documentary work. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for 6 years, I earn 3400 DM monthly and have diligently repaid two prior loans for fieldwork expenses. My current savings are low due to recent medical bills for my mother, whom I care for full-time. However, my stable employment, 4-year residence in my owned apartment, and guarantor (my colleague, Dr. Fischer) attest to my reliability. The loan will directly fund tools to generate higher-income projects, ensuring timely repayments. I value your trust in my history with the bank and commit to fulfilling this obligation.  

Respectfully,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 3**  
To Whom It May Concern,  

I am applying for 6999 DM to establish a local radio station promoting cultural integration, targeting my community of foreign workers. As a 34-year-old registered foreign worker employed as a civil service officer in Hamburg for 4 years, I earn 3100 DM monthly. My wife and I own a home worth 300,000 DM, and my brother, a licensed accountant, will guarantee this loan. Though my savings are minimal due to recent home repairs, I have no overdue payments on my existing credit cards or my 2-year car loan. This initiative aligns with my job’s mission to support migrant communities, and I am confident in my ability to repay through advertising revenue. Thank you for considering my proposal.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I require 6999 DM to upgrade my podcasting equipment, which will allow me to secure higher-paying corporate clients. As a technical draftsman at a construction firm for 6 years, I earn 3300 DM monthly and have consistently repaid my previous loans for software licenses. My current checking account balance is temporarily negative due to a family emergency, but my stable income and ownership of a rental property (valued at 400,000 DM) ensure repayment capacity. My father-in-law, a retired bank manager, has agreed to co-sign. This investment will directly increase my earnings, benefiting my son and me. I appreciate your continued trust in my financial responsibility.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Schmitt

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Bank Loan Committee,  

I am requesting 6999 DM to launch a TV repair service, leveraging my 7-year career as a certified electronics technician. Employed at a municipal technical office for 5 years, I earn 3000 DM monthly and have no late payments on my existing bank credits. My guarantor, Herr Weber, a local business owner, confirms my reliability. While my savings are currently low due to my wife’s recent unemployment, our owned home (250,000 DM) and my steady income provide security. This venture will generate additional income to support my daughter’s education and fulfill my repayment obligations. I am committed to honoring this loan as I have all previous commitments.  

Respectfully,  
Jan Novak
