Okay, I need to create five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM with a duration of 45 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is for radio/television, credit amount 3031 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Employment duration 1-4 years. Installment rate 4. Male, single, with a guarantor. Residence since 4 months. Property: building society savings agreement or life insurance. Age 21. No other installment plans. Housing is rent. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. One dependent. No telephone. Foreign worker yes.

So each letter needs to have these specifics. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different nationalities, different jobs (scientific research assistant, electrician, etc.), different reasons for needing the loan (television for a dependent, radio for work, etc.), different guarantors (family members). Also, different savings amounts and employment specifics.

First person: Let's say a foreign worker from India, working as a scientific research assistant in Germany. He has a guarantor, maybe his sister. He wants a TV for his family. He's been in Germany for 2 years, has some savings. He mentions his steady income and the guarantor.

Second person: Maybe a foreign worker from Mexico, working as an electrician. He needs a radio for his work. Guarantor is his father. He's been in the job for 3 years, has savings. Emphasizes his punctual payments and the guarantor's support.

Third person: A young man from Nigeria working as a public official. He needs a TV for his family. Guarantor is his uncle. He's been in residence for 4 months, has savings. He mentions his stable job and the guarantor.

Fourth person: A foreign worker from Vietnam working as a mechanic. Needs a radio for his work. Guarantor is his brother. He's been employed for 1.5 years. Highlights his savings and timely repayments.

Fifth person: A young worker from Poland as an IT technician. Needs a TV for his dependent. Guarantor is his cousin. He's been in Germany for 2.5 years. Emphasizes his savings and stable job.

Each letter should mention checking account duration, savings, employment duration, guarantor, purpose, and why they're trustworthy. Make sure to vary the specifics and avoid repetition. Also, keep each letter concise, starting with personal info, purpose, financial situation, and a proper closing.

Let me check if I covered all attributes: checking account duration 45 months (3 years and 9 months?), savings between 100-500, employment 1-4 years, age 21, single male, guarantor, residence since 4 months, property as building society, etc. Each letter needs to include these. Also, the purpose is radio/television, so maybe vary between the two.

I need to ensure each letter is unique in the person's background and specifics. Also, avoid any formatting and keep them short. Let me draft each one step by step, making sure all points are covered.

**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Raj Patel, a 21-year-old foreign worker from India employed as a scientific research assistant at the Munich Institute for Biotechnology.

My employer confirms my reliability, and I possess a building society savings agreement. With an installment rate of 4 DM per month, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan responsibly.
