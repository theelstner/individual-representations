Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the profile attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with 0 to less than 200 DM, duration of 18 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is business, credit amount 1913 DM. Savings account/bonds over 1000 DM. Present employment less than a year. Installment rate 3. Male, married/widowed. No other debtors/guarantors. Residence since 3 years. Property: real estate. Age 36. Other installment plans with bank. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: skilled employee or official. One dependent. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the specifics. Let me think of different professions that fit "skilled employee / official." Maybe a scientific research assistant, a teacher, a mechanic, a civil servant, and an IT technician. Each should have different business purposes for the loan. For example, expanding a business, purchasing equipment, starting a service, etc.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say a scientific research assistant. They need a loan for their business. They have a savings account over 1000 DM. They've been employed for less than a year but have a stable job. They own real estate. They are married with one child. They have a good credit history. They should mention their steady income, existing savings, and responsibility in repaying past credits.

Second person could be a teacher. Wait, teacher might be a civil servant, but the job category is skilled employee. Maybe a vocational trainer? Their business purpose could be starting a training workshop. They need equipment. They have been in their residence for 3 years, own a house. They have another installment plan with the bank, showing reliability.

Third person: a mechanic. They want to buy a specialized tool for their auto repair shop. They have a savings bond. They are married with a dependent. They have a good credit history and own property. They’ve been employed for under a year but have a stable job. They mention their steady income and ability to make installments.

Fourth person: maybe a civil servant, like a municipal official. They want to start a small consulting business. They have savings, own a home, and have a reliable income. They emphasize their job security and past credit responsibility.

Fifth person: IT technician. They need funds to start a tech support service. They have a savings account, own property, and have a stable job. They mention their technical skills and how the loan will help generate income to repay.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then a salutation. They need to state the purpose, their financial situation (checking account, savings, employment, residence, property), their repayment ability (installment rate, existing credits paid), and trustworthiness (credit history, job stability, personal circumstances). End with thanks and signature.

I need to make sure each letter uses specific numbers and roles instead of generic terms. Also, check that each has unique business purposes and personal details. Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan. Each should have a distinct profession and business idea. Make sure to mention the exact credit amount (1913 DM) and installment rate (3). Also, include the foreign worker registered under their name as part of their financial stability.

Let me check each attribute against the profile to ensure nothing is missed. For example, each letter should mention checking account balance in the specified range, duration of 18 months, credit history, savings over 1000 DM, employment under a year, residence 3 years, real estate, age 36, etc. Also, personal status as married/widowed with one dependent, telephone, and foreign worker registered.

I need to vary the specific instances: for example, different types of real estate (apartment, house), different savings amounts (1200 DM, 1500 DM), different jobs (researcher, trainer, mechanic, official, IT), different business purposes (expanding lab, workshop equipment, auto tools, consulting, tech support). Each should have unique personal circumstances but fit the profile.

Make sure each letter is concise, not too long. Start with the purpose, then financial situation, repayment ability, trustworthiness, and a polite closing. Avoid any formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Ensure each letter is properly ended without being cut off. Also, use the exact credit amount and installment rate as specified.

Let me draft each one step by step, making sure all points are covered and each is distinct.

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1913 DM to expand my small laboratory equipment maintenance business. As a scientific research assistant with 8 years of experience at the Max Planck Institute, I have a stable income and a strong understanding of the scientific community’s needs. My current checking account, held for 18 months, has a balance of 150 DM, and I maintain a savings account with 1200 DM.  

Though I have been in my current role for 10 months, my prior employment history and recent promotion to lead technician demonstrate my reliability. I own a real estate property in Munich, purchased 5 years ago, and have lived at my current residence for 3 years. My credit history includes fully repaid loans for lab certification courses, and I currently have one active credit with your bank for office supplies, paid punctually.  

With a monthly installment capacity of 3 DM, I am confident in repaying this loan. My marriage to my wife, Anna, and our 4-year-old son provide additional motivation to manage finances responsibly. I own a home, have a registered foreign worker assisting in my business, and maintain a telephone for business communication.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how this loan will help me serve more researchers and contribute to scientific progress.  

Sincerely,

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I request a 1913 DM loan to purchase welding equipment for my metalwork workshop. As a certified industrial mechanic with 9 years of experience at Siemens, I have the technical expertise to deliver high-quality custom metal products. My savings account holds 1500 DM, and I own a two-bedroom apartment in Hamburg, valued at 120,000 DM.  

I have held my current job for 11 months after transitioning from a similar role at ThyssenKrupp. My residence in Bahrenfeld has lasted 3 years, and I have no outstanding debts beyond my 18-month-old checking account (currently at 80 DM). My credit history includes a fully repaid car loan, and I currently manage a bank installment plan for my son’s piano lessons.  

Married with one child, I prioritize financial responsibility. My stable income, combined with a registered foreign worker handling workshop logistics, ensures timely repayments. The proposed equipment will increase my workshop’s capacity by 40%, generating sufficient revenue to cover the 3 DM monthly installment.  

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide any further documentation.  

Respectfully,
