Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has no checking account, but they have a savings account/bonds between 500-1000 DM. The person is a skilled employee or official, has been in their current job 4-7 years, and has a credit history of paying back existing credits. The loan purpose is for domestic appliances, amount 1262 DM. They are male, single, have one dependent, own their housing, and have a telephone. Also, they are a registered foreign worker. The letters need to be concise, each from a different perspective, with specific details.

Let me think of different professions within "skilled employee/official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a teacher, a nurse, and an IT technician. Each should have unique situations but fit the profile. For example, the first one could be a research assistant needing appliances for a new lab setup. The second could be a mechanic wanting to upgrade home appliances after a promotion. Third, a teacher needing a new kitchen appliance for hosting students. Fourth, a nurse needing a reliable washing machine for shift work. Fifth, an IT technician needing a new fridge for a home office setup.

Each letter should mention their job role, duration in current job (4-7 years), savings account amount (within 500-1000 DM), existing credits paid back, residence since 3 years, own housing, dependents, and why they're trustworthy. They should also explain the loan purpose specifically. Need to make sure each letter is distinct in their reasoning and examples. Avoid generic terms, use specific instances. Also, check that each ends properly without formatting. Let me start drafting each one step by step, ensuring all profile attributes are covered with specific numbers and roles.

Dear Sir or Madam  
My name is Thomas Müller and I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Biotechnology. I have been employed in this role for 6 years and earn a stable monthly income of 3200 DM. I am applying for a loan of 1262 DM to purchase a high-efficiency refrigerator for my home laboratory where I conduct personal experiments on sustainable food preservation. I currently maintain a savings account with 850 DM and have successfully repaid two previous loans with this bank for a laptop and a workbench. I reside in my own apartment in Heidelberg and have lived there for 3 years. As a registered foreign worker with a dependent child, I prioritize financial responsibility and ensure timely payments. I kindly request your approval for this loan to support my research endeavors.  

Sincerely  
Thomas Müller
