Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 200 DM, which is pretty low. The duration of the account is 6 months. Credit history includes past delays in payments. The loan purpose is business, amount 1449 DM. Savings account is between 100-500 DM. Employment for at least 7 years. Installment rate is 1. Personal status: male, divorced or separated. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence for 2 years. Property: car or other. Age 31. Other installment plans with the bank. Housing is own. Two existing credits at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Two dependents. No telephone. Foreign worker yes.

So, each letter needs to reflect these specifics. Let me break down the components:

Each person should have a unique job (since the profile says "skilled employee / official" – maybe different roles). For example, electrician, mechanic, etc. They need to explain their financial situation, why they need the loan for business, and why they're trustworthy despite past credit issues.

Let me think of five different professions. Maybe 1. Electrician, 2. Carpenter, 3. IT technician, 4. Plumber, 5. Teacher (though teacher might be civil servant, but maybe in some countries they are considered skilled employees). Wait, the profile says "skilled employee / official", so maybe official could be administrative roles. Let me pick five distinct ones.

Also, each person has been employed for at least 7 years. Let me assign specific durations, e.g., 8 years, 7.5 years, etc. They are foreign workers, so maybe from different countries. They are divorced or separated, with two dependents. Need to mention their current residence for 2 years. They have existing credits at the bank (two), and other installment plans with the bank. Their savings are between 100-500 DM. The loan is for business purposes. They have a car or other property. Their checking account is low, but maybe they have some savings.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan. For example, expanding a business, purchasing equipment, starting a new service, etc. They need to address past credit issues, showing that they've learned from mistakes and are now responsible. They have a steady job, own housing, and have dependents, which shows responsibility.

Let me outline each person:

1. Electrician (8 years employed, from Mexico, divorced, two kids, needs loan to buy tools)
2. Carpenter (7.5 years, from Vietnam, separated, wants to expand workshop)
3. IT technician (7 years, from India, divorced, needs funds for tech startup)
4. Plumber (8 years, from Philippines, separated, wants to buy a van for business)
5. Administrative official (8 years, from Brazil, divorced, needs to start a small office supply business)

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then a subject line. Then the body explaining their situation, the purpose of the loan, their financial stability, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their employment, existing credits, savings, residence, and dependents. They need to address past credit issues by showing they've improved. Each letter should be concise but cover all points.

Let me check if I missed any profile attributes. Checking account <200 DM, duration 6 months. Savings 100-500 DM. Present residence since 2 years. Property: car. Age 31. Housing: own. Other installment plans: bank. Number of credits: 2. Job: skilled employee. Dependents: 2. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

Each letter must include these. For example, mention owning a car, living in their own house, having two dependents, existing credits, etc. Also, the loan amount is 1449 DM, so they need to specify the exact amount. They should explain the business purpose clearly.

Now, let me draft each letter with these points, ensuring each has unique details and professions. Make sure to avoid generic terms and use specific instances as per the profile. Also, keep the letters short and concise, not too long. Proper ending without any formatting.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Mr. Ahmed Hassan  
123 Maple Street  
Frankfurt  
October 5, 2023  

To the Management of Frankfurt Bank,  

I am writing to request a loan of 1,449 DM to purchase advanced electrical testing equipment for my independent electrical contracting business. As a licensed electrician with eight years of experience working in Germany, I have steadily built my client base, but outdated tools are limiting my capacity. My current checking account (6 months old) holds 150 DM, while my savings account has 400 DM. I reside in my own apartment in Frankfurt, having lived there for two years, and own a used car for business travel.  

Though I had a brief delay in repaying a previous loan due to unexpected medical expenses, I have since prioritized timely payments, managing two existing bank credits for my tools and utilities. My stable job at a local construction firm has provided a steady income for 7.5 years, and I support my two children from my divorce. I am committed to repaying this loan in full, as evidenced by my consistent income and savings. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

Mr. Luca Moretti  
456 Birch Lane  
Munich

Dear Frankfurt Bank Team,  

I seek a 1,449 DM loan to expand my carpentry workshop, which I run from my garage. As a certified carpenter employed at a furniture factory for seven years, I have saved 300 DM and maintain a checking account with 120 DM. My wife and I divorced two years ago, and I now care for our two sons alone. I relocated to Germany from Italy eight years ago and have since owned my home in Munich.  

My credit history includes a late payment during a period of reduced hours at work, but I have resolved this by automating payments for my two existing bank loans. This loan will fund a second workbench, increasing my capacity to fulfill orders. I guarantee repayment through my steady employment and additional freelance work. Your support would allow me to grow my business and provide for my children. Thank you for your trust.  

Respectfully,  
Luca Moretti

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Mr. Rajesh Patel  
789 Cedar Road  
Berlin  
October 5, 2023  

To the Loan Committee of Frankfurt Bank,  

I am applying for 1,449 DM to launch a small IT repair service. With seven years of experience as an IT technician at a Berlin school, I have saved 200 DM and maintain a checking account with 180 DM. I am separated from my wife and have custody of our two daughters. I have lived in my Berlin apartment for two years and own a car for transportation.  

A past delay in paying my credit card was due to a temporary project pay cut, but I now manage my two bank installments diligently. My stable job, combined with my savings and residence in Germany for over eight years, assures me of repayment. This loan will cover initial advertising and software licenses. I am committed to rebuilding my creditworthiness and supporting my family. Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Rajesh Patel

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Mr. Hiroshi Tanaka  
101 Pine Avenue  
Hamburg  
October 5, 2023  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I request a 1,449 DM loan to purchase a delivery van for my plumbing business. As a licensed plumber employed at a Hamburg construction company for 7.5 years, I have saved 500 DM and hold a checking account with 190 DM. After my divorce three years ago, I have raised my two daughters independently. I own a home and have resided in Hamburg for two years.  

A previous late payment occurred during a family emergency, but I have since ensured timely payments for my two existing bank credits. My income, combined with my savings and ownership of tools, guarantees repayment. This van will allow me to take on more clients efficiently. I appreciate your support in helping me provide for my children and grow my business.  

Sincerely,  
Hiroshi Tanaka
