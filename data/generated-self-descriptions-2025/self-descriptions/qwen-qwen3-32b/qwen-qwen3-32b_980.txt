Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the required elements.

First, the profile details are: no checking account, 24 months duration, credit history with past delays, purpose is a new car, loan amount 2538, savings under 100 DM, employed for at least 7 years, installment rate 4, single male, no other debtors, residence for 4 years, property (car or other), age 47, no other installment plans, own housing, two existing credits at the bank, job is unskilled resident, two dependents, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the specifics. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different reasons for the car purchase, different employment contexts, maybe different aspects of their financial situation they can highlight.

For example, one could be a delivery worker needing a reliable car for work, another might be a construction worker needing a vehicle for commuting and tools. Each person's job should be specific (unskilled jobs like delivery helper, construction laborer, warehouse worker, etc.). Also, since they have a foreign worker status, maybe they have ties to their home country but are established here.

I need to address the past credit delay. Each applicant should explain that they've learned from past mistakes and are now more responsible. They can mention steps they've taken to improve their financial management, even if they don't have a checking account now.

Since they have two existing credits at the bank, they might mention their history with the bank and their consistent payments on those credits. Also, they have two dependents, so maybe they need the car for family reasons like school runs or work commutes.

Each letter should be concise, so I need to keep paragraphs short. Start with addressing the bank, state the purpose, explain their situation, show responsibility, and conclude with gratitude.

Let me outline each letter:

1. Delivery Worker: Needs a new car for work. Emphasize steady income from job, reliable payments on existing credits, car needed for job performance. Mention dependents needing reliable transport.

2. Construction Laborer: Car needed for commuting long distances. Highlight employment stability, residence in area for 4 years, existing credits managed well. Explain past delay was due to medical emergency but now stable.

3. Warehouse Worker: Car for family needs, dependents. Mention foreign worker status but have roots in community. Emphasize savings plan to build up funds, show commitment to repay.

4. Maintenance Technician: Upgrading old car for safety. Mention own housing, steady job, existing credits. Past delay due to unexpected repairs, now more cautious.

5. Janitorial Staff: Car needed for second job to support family. Highlight multiple income streams, residence stability, commitment to repayments.

Each letter should include specific numbers: loan amount 2538, installment rate 4, duration 24 months. Also, mention savings under 100 DM but willingness to set up a plan. No checking account, but maybe they use the bank for existing credits.

I need to ensure that each letter is distinct in the reasons for the loan and the personal circumstances. Avoid repetition in the explanations for past credit issues. Also, make sure each person's job is a specific unskilled role.

Now, let me draft each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered and the language is formal but sincere.

Dear Bank Manager  
My name is Ahmed Mohamed and I am applying for a loan of 2538 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a delivery helper working 8 hours daily for a logistics company I have been employed with for 7 years I rely on a reliable car to transport goods efficiently. Though I once delayed payments due to a family medical emergency I have since prioritized financial discipline and consistently repaid my two existing credits at this bank. I reside in my own home and support my two children who are in school. While my savings are currently below 100 DM I am committed to allocating 4 DM monthly toward this loan. I request your trust in my stability and dedication.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Mohamed  

Dear Sir or Madam  
I am Karim Das writing to request 2538 DM for a car to commute between my construction labor job and home. I have worked at the same site for 8 years earning a steady income but previously missed payments when I had to cover my mother’s emergency surgery costs abroad. Since then I have managed my two current bank credits without issue and live in my own residence for the past 4 years. My wife and daughter depend on me for transportation to medical appointments. I assure you this loan will be repaid promptly with my 4 DM monthly installment. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully  
Karim Das  

Dear Bank Officer  
My name is Rajesh Kumar and I work as a warehouse packer at a retail company where I have been for 7 years. I need a new car to safely transport my son to school and myself to work as I live 60 km from the facility. I once had a payment delay due to a flooded home damaging my savings but have since rebuilt my finances. Though I do not have a checking account I use this bank for my two active credits which I pay on time. I own property in my home country and have lived here for 4 years. I can only afford 4 DM monthly installments but promise to budget strictly. Your support would greatly ease my family’s daily life.  

Yours faithfully  
Rajesh Kumar  

Dear Banking Department  
I am Hassan Ali an unskilled maintenance worker at a factory for 8 years. My current vehicle is unsafe and I require 2538 DM to replace it. A prior payment lapse occurred when I covered a friend’s urgent debt but have since focused on my own financial responsibilities. I reside in my own apartment and have two children relying on me. While my savings are minimal I have consistently met payments on my two existing loans here. I propose a 4 DM monthly plan and appreciate your consideration of my stable employment and commitment.  

Kind regards  
Hassan Ali  

Dear Bank Representative  
As a full-time janitor at a hospital for 7 years I need a new car to manage my shifts and assist my elderly father who lives with me. I once missed payments during a period of illness but have recovered and now prioritize timely repayments. I have lived in my current home for 4 years and hold two active credits with this bank. Though my savings are under 100 DM I earn steadily and can dedicate 4 DM monthly to this loan. I am a foreign worker committed to this community and my family’s well-being. Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely  
Yusuf Rahman
