Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a foreign worker who is a skilled employee or official, has been employed for at least 7 years, has a credit history of paying back existing credits, and wants a loan for furniture/equipment. The person is male, single, 41 years old, has a building society savings agreement or life insurance, owns their home, has two dependents, and has one existing credit at the bank. Their checking account is below 0 DM, savings under 100 DM, and they don't have a telephone. They've been in their residence for 2 months.

I need to create five different people with specific jobs instead of generic terms. Let me brainstorm some specific job roles under "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, IT support specialist, teacher, and a mechanical engineer. Each should have unique circumstances but fit the profile.

For each letter, I need to explain why they're applying for the loan (furniture/equipment), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their stable employment (8 years or more), existing credit paid back, and their property. Also, since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their relocation or work visa.

Let me start with the first person: a scientific research assistant. He's been working at a university for 8 years. His checking account is negative due to recent medical expenses for his mother. He wants to buy a new desk and chair for his home office. He has a building society savings agreement. He's reliable because he's paid back his previous loan for lab equipment.

Second, an electrician. He's worked at a construction company for 7 years. His savings are low because he's been saving for a workshop upgrade, but now needs furniture after a client reimbursed him late. He has a life insurance policy. Trustworthy because he's always paid his installments.

Third, IT support specialist. Worked at a tech firm for 9 years. Checking account is negative due to his daughter's school fees. Needs a new computer and office chair. Has a savings agreement. Trustworthy with previous credit for software licenses.

Fourth, a teacher. Worked at a secondary school for 8 years. Savings are low because he's funding a sibling's education. Needs classroom supplies. Trustworthy with a previous loan for a classroom projector.

Fifth, mechanical engineer. Employed at a manufacturing plant for 7 years. Checking account negative due to car repairs. Needs workshop equipment. Has life insurance. Trustworthy with a prior loan for tools.

Each letter should be concise, mention specific numbers (like 8 years, 2 dependents, etc.), and avoid formatting. Make sure each ends properly without being cut off. Check that all profile attributes are addressed: existing credit paid back, duration in months (36 months for checking account), foreign worker status, residence since 2 months, etc.

Wait, the profile says "Duration in month:36" for the checking account. So each person's checking account has been open for 36 months. Also, "Present residence since:2" months. So they've lived in their current residence for 2 months. Maybe mention moving recently but stable employment.

Also, "Other installment plans:bank" – they have other installment plans with the bank, so maybe mention existing loans they're managing.

Need to ensure each letter includes all these elements without being too verbose. Let me draft each one step by step, making sure the specific instances are there and the letters are distinct.

**Letter 1: Scientific Research Assistant**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2712 DM to purchase essential furniture for my home office. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, I have worked for 8 years, ensuring a stable income of 2800 DM monthly. My current checking account, open for 36 months, has a temporary negative balance due to recent medical expenses for my mother, whom I support. However, my savings account holds 80 DM, and I maintain a building society savings agreement valued at 1500 DM.  

Though I relocated to Germany 3 months ago under a work visa, I have resided at my current address for 2 months and own my home. I am a responsible borrower, having fully repaid a prior credit for laboratory equipment. With two dependents and a consistent repayment capacity of 2 DM installments, I assure timely loan servicing. Your trust would be deeply appreciated.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

My savings account contains 30 DM, and I hold a building society savings plan.  

I have lived at my current residence for 2 months and own my home. My existing credit for software licenses is fully repaid, reflecting my reliability. As a single father to two children, I am committed to meeting installment obligations. This loan will directly improve my work efficiency, ensuring timely repayments.

With two dependents and a stable income, I assure you of my commitment to repayments. This loan will directly benefit my professional duties and financial discipline.  

Respectfully,
