Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully. The profile has specific attributes that need to be converted into real instances. For example, "skilled employee" becomes something like "scientific research assistant," and numbers like ">=7 years" should be specific, such as "8 years."

Each letter needs to explain why they're applying for the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. The purpose is furniture/equipment, so each person should have a unique angle for that. The credit history is critical, so they might need to address that. They have existing credits not at this bank, so maybe they mention managing those responsibly.

The user also specified not to use formatting, so just plain text. Each letter should be concise but complete, with proper endings. Let me brainstorm different scenarios. Maybe a student needing furniture for a new apartment, a technician buying tools for a side job, a nurse upgrading home office equipment, a teacher buying a desk for a child's study space, and a chef purchasing kitchen equipment. Each has a different angle but fits the profile.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific details: job title, duration of employment (at least 7 years), age 20, single, foreign worker, co-applicant, etc. Also, mention the loan amount (3617 DM) and the 24-month term. Since they have no savings account, maybe they mention alternative savings methods. Addressing the critical credit history is important; perhaps they explain past issues and how they've improved. Each letter should end with a polite thank you and a sign-off.

Wait, the age is 20? That seems young for 8 years of employment. Maybe they started working early? Or perhaps there's a typo in the original profile. But I have to stick to the given data. So, a 20-year-old with 8 years of work experience—maybe they started at 12? That doesn't make sense. Hmm. Maybe the profile is in another country where people start working earlier. Or perhaps it's a mistake. Since I have to follow the profile, I'll proceed as given. Maybe the person is a skilled worker who started apprenticeship early.

Also, each letter should have a co-applicant. Maybe a family member or partner. For the 20-year-old, perhaps a parent as co-applicant. Need to mention that in each letter. Also, housing is rent, so they don't own property. Dependents: 1, so each has a child or relative dependent. 

Let me outline each letter:

1. Student needing furniture for a new apartment. Co-applicant is parent. Emphasize stable income from part-time job and scholarship. Trustworthy by mentioning timely payments for existing credits.

2. Technician buying tools for freelance work. Co-applicant is sibling. Highlight steady employment and additional income from freelance to ensure repayment.

3. Nurse upgrading home office. Co-applicant is partner. Mention existing credits managed well, and how new furniture will help career growth.

4. Teacher buying study desk for child. Co-applicant is spouse. Stress financial stability from job and spouse's income, and responsible financial habits.

5. Chef purchasing kitchen equipment. Co-applicant is parent. Note that the equipment will generate income through a food business, ensuring repayment.

Each needs to address the critical credit history by showing past issues are resolved, current ability to repay, and trustworthiness. Also, include the loan specifics: 3617 DM over 24 months, installment rate 4. Make sure each letter is unique but fits the profile. Avoid repetition in scenarios. Check for all required attributes in each letter. Ensure they are concise but cover all necessary points. No markdown, just plain text with line breaks. Proper ending with thanks and sign-off. Let me draft each one now.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Ahmed Khan, and I am a 20-year-old foreign worker employed as a scientific research assistant at the City Biotechnology Institute. I have been in this role for 8 years, earning a stable monthly salary of 1,200 DM, and I maintain a checking account with a minimum balance of 250 DM. I am applying for a 3,617 DM loan to purchase a new desk and chair for my home office, as my current equipment is worn and hinders my productivity.  

Though my credit history includes a past late payment due to a temporary medical emergency, I have since prioritized timely payments for my existing credit (a bicycle loan and a mobile phone installment plan). My co-applicant, my elder sister Farheen, who works as a schoolteacher, guarantees the loan. We reside in a rented apartment and have lived at our current address for 4 years. With my steady income and my sister’s support, I am confident in repaying 150 DM monthly over 24 months.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Loan Committee  

I am Lucas Mendes, a 20-year-old single father and skilled automotive technician at AutoFix Garage, where I have worked for 7 years. My monthly salary is 1,100 DM, and I have held my checking account for over a year. I need 3,617 DM to replace my son’s damaged study table and buy a new laptop for his online classes.  

My credit history includes a small unpaid utility bill last year, resolved after a family financial setback. I currently have two active credits with another bank—a car loan and a textbook loan—both paid punctually for 12 months. My co-applicant is my mother, Maria Mendes, who provides financial support as I care for my 5-year-old son. Though I lack a savings account, I allocate 200 DM monthly to a cash fund for emergencies.  

With my stable job and co-applicant’s backing, I can manage 150 DM installments. I kindly request approval to secure my son’s education.  

Yours faithfully,  
Lucas Mendes

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am Yuki Tanaka, a 20-year-old foreign worker employed as a medical equipment technician at HealthCare Solutions. I have worked here for 9 years, earning 1,050 DM monthly, and hold a checking account with consistent salary deposits. I seek a 3,617 DM loan to furnish my rented apartment, as my current furniture is deteriorating and poses safety risks.  

My credit history includes a brief overdraft last year due to unexpected dental surgery costs. Since then, I have repaid the debt and maintained a disciplined budget. I have two existing credits with a local cooperative bank—a tool purchase loan and a bicycle loan—both in good standing. My co-applicant is my cousin, Hiroshi, who works as an IT specialist.  

I reside in my current rental home with my 3-year-old niece, whom I support financially. I can commit 150 DM monthly for 24 months, given my stable income. Your support would greatly improve my living conditions.  

Thank you for your time.  

Respectfully,  
Yuki Tanaka

Dear Bank Officer,  

My name is Carlos Rivera, a 20-year-old factory supervisor at GreenTech Manufacturing, where I have worked for 8 years. I earn 1,150 DM monthly and need 3,617 DM to replace my broken kitchen appliances, which are essential for preparing meals for my elderly grandmother, whom I care for full-time.  

My credit history includes a late payment on a previous phone contract, resolved immediately. I currently have two active credits—a motorcycle loan and a tool kit loan—with timely repayments for the past year. My co-applicant is my uncle, Javier, a construction worker who guarantees this loan.  

I have no savings account but save 100 DM monthly in a community savings group. My stable employment and co-applicant’s support ensure I can repay 150 DM monthly. This loan will allow me to maintain proper nutrition for my grandmother and myself.  

I appreciate your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Rivera

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Rajesh Patel, a 20-year-old foreign worker and certified welding technician at SteelForge Industries, employed for 7 years. I apply for a 3,617 DM loan to purchase a new bed frame and wardrobe, as my current furniture is unsanitary and affects my health.  

My credit history includes a missed payment on a prior appliance loan due to a machinery breakdown at work, followed by a three-month income drop. Since recovering, I have paid all bills on time and now have no outstanding debts from that incident. My co-applicant is my brother, Vikram, who works in logistics.  

I reside in a rented flat with my 6-year-old cousin, whom I support as his legal guardian. With my 1,100 DM salary and my brother’s guarantee, I can manage 150 DM monthly installments. This loan will significantly improve my living standards and allow me to focus better at work.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Best regards,  
Rajesh Patel
