Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the points.

First, the profile mentions an existing checking account with less than 0 DM, which is overdrawn. The duration is 12 months. Credit history is good, with existing credits paid back. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 2578 DM. Savings account under 100 DM. Unemployed currently. Installment rate 3. Female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors/guarantors. Residence since 4 months. No property. Age 55. No other installment plans. Housing is free. One existing credit at the bank. Job in management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/officer. One dependent. No telephone. Foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So I need to vary the job roles, maybe different reasons for unemployment, different contexts for needing furniture. Let me think of five distinct scenarios.

First person: Maybe a self-employed graphic designer who had to take a break due to health issues, leading to unemployment. She could need a new computer and office setup to restart her business. She has a dependent child, lives with family, hence housing for free. She has a management/office job background.

Second person: A former manager in a factory, laid off due to automation. Now seeking retraining, needs furniture for a home office. She's a divorced mother with a dependent child, living in a residence for 4 years. She might have a savings bond under 100 DM.

Third person: A foreign worker in hospitality, maybe a hotel manager who lost her job when the hotel closed. Now looking to start a small catering business, needs equipment. She has been in Germany for a few years, has no property, but has a good credit history.

Fourth person: A highly qualified employee in a non-profit organization, let go due to budget cuts. Now volunteering and looking to set up a home office for freelance consulting. Needs furniture, has been unemployed for a year but has prior savings account issues.

Fifth person: A foreign officer in the military, now retired and moved to civilian life, needs furniture for a new home. She has dependents, no property, and is adjusting to civilian employment.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific details from the profile. Each should explain the loan purpose, financial situation (overdrawn account, no savings, unemployment), and trustworthiness (good credit history, existing credit paid back, etc.). Also, mention the installment rate, residence duration, housing situation, and other specifics.

Let me start drafting each letter, ensuring they are concise, proper, and end well without formatting. Avoid generic terms, use specific job titles and situations. Check that each has a unique angle and personal circumstances.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Anika Müller and I am a 55-year-old self-employed graphic designer who has been managing my own creative studio for 8 years. Unfortunately I had to suspend operations for 6 months due to a serious back injury which required surgery and rehabilitation. During this time my income ceased completely and I accumulated a small overdraft in my checking account. Now that I am recovering I am eager to restart my business and need to replace my outdated computer and purchase new design software.  

I currently live with my 18-year-old daughter in a rented apartment that I have occupied for 4 years. My housing is provided free of charge by my sister while I regain stability. Though unemployed for the past year I have consistently repaid my existing loan with your bank for office supplies. I have no savings but maintain a good credit history and am confident I can manage the 3 DM installment rate with my projected freelance income.  

As a certified professional with a strong client base I assure you this equipment will enable me to resume work immediately. I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and would appreciate your support in this critical transition.  

Sincerely  
Anika Müller

Dear Sir/Madam  

I am writing to request a loan of 2578 DM to furnish a home office as I prepare for vocational retraining in bookkeeping. At 55 years old I was laid off from my position as a production manager at a textile factory after 12 years of service when automation reduced staffing needs. Since then I have been studying part-time to qualify for administrative roles.  

I have lived in my current apartment for 4 years and currently reside alone with my 12-year-old son who is in boarding school. My checking account is slightly overdrawn due to tuition costs but I have no debts beyond the 1200 DM loan I took from your bank last year for retraining materials which I repaid in full.  

Though unemployed I maintain my professional network and have been offered a mentorship position starting next month. The 3 DM installment fits within my budget and I am confident in my ability to repay. As a responsible borrower with no prior delinquencies I ask for your trust in this final step toward stable employment.  

Respectfully  
Lena Hoffmann

Dear Loan Committee  

As a former hotel operations manager from India I am seeking 2578 DM to establish a small catering business here in Germany. I have lived in Frankfurt for 7 years and have been unemployed since the pandemic shuttered my employer’s resort last year. My savings account contains only 75 DM from my final severance payment.  

I currently reside with my niece in a shared apartment and pay no rent. Though my checking account is overdrawn by 150 DM I have always met payment deadlines including the 900 DM loan I received from your bank for language courses which I repaid over 18 months.  

This loan will fund essential kitchen equipment and a delivery bicycle. I have 15 years of hospitality management experience and have already secured three corporate catering contracts. The 3 DM installment aligns with my projected monthly revenue and I will provide references from local chefs who have collaborated with me.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully  
Priya Deshmukh

Dear Bank Official  

My name is Ruth Weber and I am a 55-year-old former project officer at a non-profit organization that closed in March 2023. I need this loan to set up a home office including a desk chair and laptop to begin freelance policy consulting.  

Since losing my job I have maintained a 12-month checking account despite a 200 DM overdraft from medical bills. I have no savings but have kept my 1500 DM loan for office software in good standing with your bank. I live in a 4-year-old rental apartment and pay no rent as it is owned by my divorced husband.  

The 3 DM installment is feasible with my anticipated contract work. I have managed budgets over 500,000 DM in my career and am prepared to provide proof of upcoming client agreements. This loan represents a bridge to sustained income and I assure you of my diligence in repayment.  

Gratefully  
Ruth Weber

Dear Sir  

As a retired military officer from Poland I respectfully request 2578 DM to replace furniture damaged during our family’s relocation. I have been unemployed since retiring at 52 and now live in Germany with my wife and 8-year-old son.  

Though my checking account shows a 100 DM overdraft from moving costs I have no other debts. I repaid a 1000 DM loan from your bank for my wife’s medical care in 2022. We have resided in our current free housing for 4 months while I seek civilian employment.  

This loan will cover essential furnishings for our new home. My 20-year military career trained me in logistics and leadership and I am currently training as an IT support technician. The 3 DM payment plan matches my retraining budget and I will provide character references from my commanding officers.  

Please consider my application.  

With respect  
Magdalena Kowalski
