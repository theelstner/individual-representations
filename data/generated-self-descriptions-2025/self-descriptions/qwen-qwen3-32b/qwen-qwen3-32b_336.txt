Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile has several key points: the applicant has a checking account with less than 0 DM, has had it for 24 months, no credit history or all paid back, purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 4110 DM, savings under 100 DM, employed for at least 7 years, installment rate 3, male single, no co-debtors, residence for 4 years, no property, age 23, other installment plans with bank, renting, two existing credits at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, two dependents, no phone, foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the specific details. Let me think of different scenarios where someone would need a loan for furniture/equipment. Maybe a recent foreign worker settling in, a student moving out, someone upgrading home office equipment, a small business owner needing equipment, or a young professional with dependents.

For each person, I need to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let me start with the first one: a foreign worker who's been in the country for a while, has a stable job, needs furniture for a new apartment. He's 23, single, with two dependents (maybe siblings he's supporting). He's been in his job for 8 years, has two existing credits paid on time. He's renting, has been at the residence for 4 years. Savings are low because he's sending money back home or saving for something else. Trustworthy because of steady job and good credit history.

Second person: maybe a scientific research assistant who needs equipment for a project. Wait, the job is skilled employee/official. Maybe a lab technician? He's been in the job for 7 years, has two dependents (maybe a parent and sibling). Needs to buy furniture because he just moved to a new city for work. No savings because he's been paying for relocation costs. Trustworthy due to stable employment and no past credits.

Third person: a young professional working in administration, needs to furnish a rental apartment. He's been in his job for 9 years, has two dependents (maybe parents he supports). Has two existing credits, pays installments on time. No savings because he's been paying for his siblings' education. Trustworthy because of long-term employment and good payment history.

Fourth person: a foreign worker in IT, needs home office equipment. He's been in the country for 8 years, has been at his current residence for 4 years. Two dependents, maybe children. Needs a new setup for remote work. Trustworthy because of steady income and existing credits managed well.

Fifth person: a skilled worker in manufacturing, needs to buy furniture for a new home. He's been employed for 7 years, has two dependents (spouse and child, but profile says single, so maybe parents). Moved to a new city for job, hence needing furniture. Trustworthy due to consistent job and no delinquencies.

I need to make sure each letter specifies the exact numbers from the profile: 8 years of employment, 24 months checking account, 4 years residence, 3% installment rate, 4110 DM amount, two existing credits, etc. Also, mention the purpose clearly as furniture or equipment. Each letter should have a unique angle but adhere to the profile constraints. Avoid any formatting, keep them concise, and ensure proper endings. Let me draft each one now, making sure to vary the specifics and professions while keeping all profile attributes intact.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am writing to request a loan of 4110 DM to purchase essential furniture for my new apartment. As a foreign worker in Germany for the past 8 years, I have been employed as a laboratory technician at a pharmaceutical company since 2016. My monthly income ensures I can manage the 3% installment rate comfortably. Though my checking account balance is currently negative due to recent medical expenses for my mother, who lives with me, I have consistently paid my existing two bank installments on time. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and plan to continue living there. My stable job and clean credit history make me a reliable candidate. I kindly ask for your approval to furnish my home, which will improve my living conditions and support my family.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Bank Officer,  
I seek a 4110 DM loan to upgrade my home office equipment, which is critical for my role as a data analyst at a logistics firm. I have worked there for 7 years, earning a steady income that covers my 3% monthly payment. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to my father’s ongoing education expenses, but my savings account will soon exceed 100 DM. I have no prior credits, and my two existing bank loans for a bicycle and laptop are fully repaid. I have lived in my rented apartment for 4 years and intend to stay. As a foreign worker committed to Germany, I prioritize financial responsibility. This loan will enhance my productivity, and I assure timely repayments.  

Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Rajesh Patel

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am applying for 4110 DM to buy a sofa and kitchen equipment after my recent relocation to Bremen. As a 23-year-old single technician in a shipyard, I have worked the same job for 9 years, with two dependents (my younger sister and grandmother) relying on my income. My checking account is currently overdrawn due to their healthcare costs, but I manage two existing bank installments punctually. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and own no property, but I value stability. My clean credit history and employment record demonstrate my reliability. This loan will improve my living conditions, and I am committed to repaying it responsibly.  

Respectfully,  
Tobias Richter

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Bank Team,  
I need 4110 DM to replace my outdated computer and office chair for my freelance graphic design work. As a skilled employee with 8 years of experience at a marketing agency, I earn a stable salary covering my 3% installment. My checking account is in deficit due to recent repairs on my car, which is essential for my daily commute. I have no prior debts and have repaid two small bank loans for software licenses. I have rented my current home for 4 years and support two dependents—my mother, who lives nearby. My foreign worker status and long-term job security make me a trustworthy applicant. This equipment will boost my efficiency, and I pledge to honor all payments.  

Sincerely,  
Eduardo Silva

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I request a 4110 DM loan to furnish my apartment after moving in with my cousin to share costs. As a 23-year-old warehouse supervisor with 7 years of employment, I earn enough to handle the 3% monthly rate. My checking account is overdrawn due to my younger brother’s tuition fees, but I maintain two active bank credits for a motorcycle and tools, both paid on time. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and have no property. My foreign worker background and consistent job history reflect my commitment to financial responsibility. This loan will provide a dignified living space, and I assure you of my dedication to repayment.  

Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Khaled Noureldin
