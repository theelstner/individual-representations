Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile has specific attributes: checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM for 8 months, good credit history, business purpose, loan amount 907 DM, savings under 100 DM, employment less than a year, installment rate 3, male married/widowed, no other debtors, residence since 2 years, property as real estate, age 26, no other installment plans, housing in own, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, one dependent, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

First, I need to create five different individuals. Each should have unique scenarios but fit the profile. Let me brainstorm some roles. Maybe a scientific research assistant, a teacher, an IT technician, a mechanic, and a public official. Each needs specific details. For example, the research assistant could work at a university, the teacher at a school, etc.

Each letter must explain why they need the loan for business, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their existing credit paid back, their job, residence, and other factors from the profile. Also, they have a dependent, so maybe mention family responsibilities.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, doesn't use formatting, and ends properly. Let me check the example given: "scientific research assistant" instead of generic terms. So each job should be specific. Also, the loan purpose is business, so each person's business should be different. Maybe a café, a small tech business, a repair shop, a farm supply store, and a consulting firm.

Now, let me start drafting each letter. Make sure to include specific instances: duration in months (8), savings less than 100 DM, employment since less than a year, etc. Also, mention the existing credit paid back, residence since 2 years, real estate as property, etc. Each person's situation should reflect these points. Need to avoid generic terms and make each unique. Let me check each attribute against the profile to ensure compliance. Also, each letter should have a proper closing without any formatting. Let me make sure the language is formal but concise, as motivation letters should be professional yet personal.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Lars Müller and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin specializing in renewable energy solutions. I have maintained a checking account with your bank for the past 8 months and have consistently paid back my existing credit of 500 DM for laboratory equipment. I am applying for a 907 DM loan to establish a small café near the university campus which will serve as a meeting place for students and researchers.  

Although my savings account currently holds 80 DM I have stable monthly income of 1800 DM from my position and my wife and I have lived in our own apartment for the past 2 years. We own real estate in the area which we purchased 5 years ago. With my technical background and the growing demand for student-friendly spaces I am confident this venture will succeed. I have no other installment plans and my employer has assured me of continued employment. I kindly request your support in this endeavor.  

Sincerely  
Lars Müller

Dear Bank Officer  

My name is Jan Novak a registered foreign worker and skilled mechanic employed at a car dealership in Frankfurt. I have worked there for 9 months and have diligently repaid my previous 600 DM credit for tools. I now seek a 907 DM loan to open a weekend car detailing service at a nearby garage.  

While my savings are 90 DM I earn 1900 DM monthly and have lived at my current address for 2 years. I own a small apartment as property and support my young daughter. My employer confirms my punctuality and technical expertise. This service will cater to busy professionals who need quick detailing before weekends. I have a strong work ethic and am confident in repaying the loan through increased income.  

Gratefully
