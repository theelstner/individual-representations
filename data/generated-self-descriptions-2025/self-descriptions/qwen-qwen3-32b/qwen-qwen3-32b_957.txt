Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me list them out:

- Existing checking account: less than 0 DM
- Duration of checking account: 24 months
- Credit history: critical account, other credits existing (not at this bank)
- Purpose: radio/television
- Credit amount: 1231 DM
- Savings account/bonds: at least 1000 DM
- Present employment since: at least 7 years
- Installment rate: 4
- Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married
- No other debtors/guarantors
- Present residence since: 4 years
- Property: building society savings agreement or life insurance
- Age: 57
- No other installment plans
- Housing: rent
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 2
- Job: management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, officer
- Dependents: 1
- Telephone: yes
- Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name

Each letter must be from a different person, so I need to invent specific instances for the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant." Also, durations should be specific, like "8 years" instead of ">=7 years."

Let me think about different job roles under the "Job" category. Possible options could be:

1. Management: Maybe a department head.
2. Self-employed: Perhaps a consultant or small business owner.
3. Highly qualified employee: Could be a senior scientist or engineer.
4. Officer: Maybe a managerial position in a corporation.
5. Another management role but different from the first, like a team leader.

Wait, the profile says "Job: management/ self-employed/ highly qualified employee/ officer." So each letter should have a different job from these categories. Let me assign each letter a different job category.

First person: Management – maybe a department manager.

Second: Self-employed – perhaps a consultant.

Third: Highly qualified employee – like a senior research scientist.

Fourth: Officer – maybe a corporate officer.

Fifth: Another management role but different, but since the categories are management, self-employed, highly qualified, officer. Maybe another management, but perhaps a different type, like a project manager?

Wait, but the user says "each letter should be written from the perspective of a different person that could be described in the following profile." So each person should have different attributes where possible. Let me make sure each letter has a unique job and other varying attributes.

Also, the purpose is radio/television. Maybe each person has a slightly different reason for needing the loan for electronics. For example, upgrading home entertainment, work-related equipment, educational purposes, etc.

Financial situation: They have a savings account of at least 1000 DM. They have been employed for at least 7 years, so maybe 8, 10, 7, etc. They have a residence since 4 years. They have existing credits at this bank (2), so maybe they have a mortgage and a car loan, or other types.

Personal status: All are female, either divorced, separated, or married. Let me vary that.

Let me start drafting the first letter.

Person 1: Department Manager, 57 years old, married, 8 years in current job, 2 existing credits (mortgage and car loan), savings 1500 DM. Purpose: upgrading home TV for work-related presentations.

Person 2: Self-employed consultant, 57, divorced, 10 years in business, savings 1200 DM, needs a radio for her consulting office.

Person 3: Senior Research Scientist, 57, separated, 7 years at current position, savings 1100 DM, wants a TV for educational programming for her and her dependent.

Person 4: Corporate Officer, 57, married, 9 years in role, existing credits: business loan and personal loan, needs a radio for her home office.

Person 5: Team Leader in manufacturing, 57, married, 7 years employed, savings 1000 DM, needs TV for family use.

Wait, but the job categories are management, self-employed, highly qualified, officer. So team leader is management. Corporate officer is officer. Senior research scientist is highly qualified. Consultant is self-employed. So the fifth one could be another category, but maybe a different role. Let me check.

Each letter must be from a different person with different job categories. So the five letters should cover all four categories? But there are four categories and five letters. So one category will be used twice with different roles. Wait, the profile says "Job:management/ self-employed/ highly qualified employee/ officer". So four categories. But the user wants five letters. Therefore, one category will be used twice with different roles. Let me check if that's allowed. The user says "different person that could be described in the following profile". So as long as each person is a different instance, even if the job category is the same but the specific job is different.

For example, two management roles but different positions. So perhaps:

First: Department Manager (management)

Fifth: Team Leader (management)

But they are different management roles. So that's acceptable.

Now, each letter must explain why they need the loan (radio/TV), their financial situation (existing savings, employment duration, existing credits), and why they are trustworthy.

Also, they have a critical credit history but other credits not at this bank. So they need to address that, perhaps explaining that their other credits are managed well.

Let me start drafting each letter.

First letter: Department Manager, 57, married, 8 years in job, existing credits (mortgage and car loan at another bank). Savings 1500 DM. She wants a TV for work presentations. She can mention her stable job, savings, and existing credits are under control.

Second letter: Self-employed consultant, 57, divorced, 10 years in business, savings 1200 DM. Needs a radio for her office. She can mention her steady income and savings.

Third letter: Senior Research Scientist, 57, separated, 7 years at current job, savings 1100 DM. Wants a TV for educational content. She can highlight her stable employment and savings.

Fourth letter: Corporate Officer, 57, married, 9 years in role, existing credits (business loan and personal loan at another bank). Needs a radio for home office. Emphasize her high position and financial responsibility.

Fifth letter: Team Leader in manufacturing, 57, married, 7 years employed, savings 1000 DM. Needs a TV for family. She can mention her long-term job and savings.

Now, each letter should start with her name, address, date, etc., but since the user didn't ask for that, maybe just the body. Wait, the user says "Write 5 motivation letters..." so they probably expect the full letter structure, but the user says "Do not use any formatting on the letter." So maybe just the body text without the formal structure. But the example in the user's mind might include the salutation and closing. Let me check the example response.

Looking at the example response provided by the assistant in the initial query (the user's example), the assistant wrote letters with salutations, body paragraphs, and closing. For example:

"Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am writing to request a loan of 1231 DM to purchase a high-quality television for my home..."

So each letter should have a salutation, body, and closing. The user says "Do not cut off the letter - be sure to write a proper ending!" So each letter must be complete.

Now, each letter should be from a different person with varying specifics. Let me proceed to draft each one, ensuring that all profile attributes are covered, with specific numbers and roles.

First letter: Department Manager.

Name: Maybe Maria Schmidt.

She has been working as a department manager at a medium-sized company for 8 years. She is married, has one dependent, lives in a rented apartment. She has a savings account of 1500 DM. She has two existing credits at the bank (maybe a personal loan and a car loan?), but the credit history is critical because she has other credits at another bank. She needs a TV for work-related presentations. She is trustworthy because of her stable job and savings.

Second letter: Self-employed consultant.

Name: Kathrin Weber.

She is a marketing consultant, self-employed for 10 years. Divorced, one dependent. Savings 1200 DM. Needs a radio for her office. She has been in her residence for 4 years. She has no other debtors, and her job provides steady income. She mentions her savings and stable income.

Third letter: Senior Research Scientist.

Name: Dr. Elisabeth Fischer.

She is a senior research scientist at a university, employed for 7 years. Separated, one dependent. Savings 1100 DM. She wants a TV to access educational programming. She emphasizes her stable employment and savings.

Fourth letter: Corporate Officer.

Name: Sabine Müller.

She is a corporate officer (maybe a director) at a large corporation, employed for 9 years. Married, one dependent. She has two existing credits at the bank (maybe a mortgage and a business loan). Needs a radio for her home office. She highlights her high position and financial responsibility.

Fifth letter: Team Leader in manufacturing.

Name: Uta Becker.

She is a team leader at a manufacturing plant, employed for 7 years. Married, one dependent. Savings 1000 DM. Needs a TV for family use. She mentions her long-term job and savings.

Now, each letter must address the critical credit history. They need to explain that while they have other credits, they are managing them responsibly, and their current financial situation is stable with savings and steady income.

Also, the installment rate is 4, which might refer to the monthly payment. They need to show they can manage the payments.

Let me draft each letter with these points in mind.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Maria Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan of 1231 DM to purchase a high-resolution television for my home office. As a department manager at a medium-sized logistics company for the past 8 years, I earn a stable monthly income of 4200 DM. While my current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent medical expenses, I maintain a savings account with 1500 DM and have consistently repaid my existing car loan and mortgage (both with another bank) without issue. My employer has confirmed my long-term employment, and I reside in my rented apartment for the past 4 years. I kindly request your support, as this television will enhance my ability to conduct virtual presentations for clients.  

Sincerely  
Maria Schmidt

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am writing to request a loan of 1231 DM to upgrade my office radio equipment. As a self-employed marketing consultant with 10 years in business, I generate an average monthly revenue of 4800 DM. Though my credit history includes a small business loan from another institution, I have maintained a savings account of 1200 DM and have no outstanding debts with this bank. I am divorced, live in my rented residence for the past 4 years, and have a dependent child. My stable income and savings demonstrate my ability to repay this loan responsibly. The new radio will improve client communication during my consultations.  

Respectfully  
Kathrin Weber

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Dr. Elisabeth Fischer, and I need a loan of 1231 DM to acquire an educational television for my home. I have worked as a senior research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for 7 years, earning 4500 DM monthly. My savings account holds 1100 DM, and while I have an existing student loan with another lender, my payment history is flawless. I am separated, live in a rented flat for 4 years, and care for one dependent. This TV will allow me to access scientific documentaries that support both my professional development and my child’s learning. I assure you of timely repayments given my secure employment.  

Yours faithfully  
Elisabeth Fischer

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am Sabine Müller, a corporate officer at a pharmaceutical company, employed for 9 years. I request a loan of 1231 DM to purchase a radio for my home office. My monthly salary is 5000 DM, and I maintain a savings account with 1300 DM. While I have a business credit line and a personal loan with another bank, both are managed punctually. I am married, reside in my rented home for 4 years, and have one dependent. My two existing credits with this bank (a car loan and a personal loan) are in good standing. This radio will improve my workflow during after-hours research.  

Kind regards
