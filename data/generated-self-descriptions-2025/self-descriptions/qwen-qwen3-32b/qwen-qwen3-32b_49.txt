Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details. 

First, the person has a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative, so maybe they have some overdraft. The duration is 6 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is a used car, loan amount 1352 DM. Savings account has between 500-1000 DM. Present employment since unemployed. Installment rate is 1, which I think refers to the payment plan. Personal status is female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 2 years. Property is a building society savings agreement or life insurance. Age 23, no other installment plans. Housing is rent. One existing credit at the bank. Job is unemployed/unskilled, non-resident. Dependents: 1. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

Now, each letter needs to be from a different person with specific instances. Let me think of five different scenarios. Maybe different reasons for needing the car, different backgrounds, but all fitting the profile.

First person: Maybe a student who needs a car for commuting to classes and a part-time job. She could be divorced, living with her child, has some savings, and is looking for stability. She has a building society savings plan.

Second person: Perhaps someone who is starting a small business, like a delivery service, needing a used car. She's separated, has a life insurance policy, and is confident she can repay the loan with her new business.

Third person: A young woman who needs a car for caregiving reasons, maybe to take care of a family member. She's unemployed but has savings and a support network. She's married, living in rented housing.

Fourth person: Maybe someone who is re-entering the job market after being a stay-at-home mom, now separated, needs a car to get to job interviews and find employment again. She has a savings account and is determined to rebuild her career.

Fifth person: Perhaps a woman who needs a car for her studies to become a certified professional, like a nurse's aide. She's divorced, has dependents, and is using the car to access training facilities.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their savings, existing credit history, and how they'll repay. Also, note that they have a telephone and are foreign workers registered. 

I need to make sure each letter is concise, doesn't use formatting, and ends properly. Let me start drafting each one with specific details, replacing the generic attributes with specific ones from the profile. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant," but in this case, the job is unemployed/unskilled. So adjust accordingly.

Check for each profile: unemployed, but maybe they have part-time work or other income sources. They have savings between 500-1000 DM. Existing credit paid back. Residence since 2 years. Need to mention that. Also, the loan is for a used car, so each letter should specify the purpose clearly.

Let me start with the first letter. Maybe a student named Anna Müller. She's 23, divorced, with a child. She has a part-time job and is studying. Needs a car to commute. She has a building society savings plan. She mentions her savings, her part-time income, and her commitment to repay.

Second letter: Maria Schmidt, starting a small delivery business. She's separated, has a life insurance policy. She's confident in her business's success to repay the loan. She has savings and an existing credit paid on time.

Third: Laura Weber, caring for an elderly relative. She's married, unemployed but has savings. Needs the car for caregiving. She emphasizes her responsibility and existing savings.

Fourth: Sophie Becker, re-entering the workforce after being a stay-at-home mom, now separated. Needs a car for job interviews. She has savings and is determined to get a stable job.

Fifth: Nina Hoffmann, pursuing certification as a nurse's aide. Divorced, with a child. Needs the car to attend training. She has a part-time job and savings.

Each letter should mention the specific purpose, their financial situation (savings, existing credit history), their ability to repay (even though unemployed, maybe through part-time work or new job), and why they're trustworthy (paid back previous credits, stable residence, etc.). Also, note the telephone and foreign worker status if relevant.

Make sure each letter is unique in their situation but fits the profile. Avoid repetition. Keep them short and concise, ending with a proper closing.

Dear Bank Loan Committee  

My name is Anna Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 1352 DM to purchase a reliable used car. As a 23-year-old divorced mother of one, I rely on transportation to commute between my part-time job at a local café and my studies in environmental science. Though I am currently unemployed between semesters, I have consistently repaid my existing student loan and maintain a savings account with 750 DM. I have resided in my rented apartment for two years and hold a building society savings agreement. My stable income from part-time work, combined with my commitment to financial responsibility, assures me I can manage the installment rate. I kindly request your trust in my ability to repay this loan.  

Sincerely  
Anna Müller
