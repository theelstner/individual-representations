Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile has specific attributes: checking account under 0 DM, duration 20 months, credit history critical with other credits not at this bank, purpose is a new car, loan amount 2235 DM, savings under 100 DM, employment since 1-4 years, installment rate 4, male married/widowed, guarantor, residence since 2 years, property as building society savings or life insurance, age 33, other installment plans at bank, housing is rent, two existing credits at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, no phone, not a foreign worker.

First, I need to create five distinct individuals. Each should have unique specifics. Let me brainstorm names and professions. For example, one could be a scientific research assistant, another a public official, maybe a teacher, a technician, and a civil servant.

Each letter must explain why they need the loan (car), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They need to address the critical credit history and existing debts. Each should mention having a guarantor, existing credits at the bank, their job stability, and how they'll repay.

Let me outline each person:

1. **Scientific Research Assistant**: 8 years in job, maybe at a university. Guarantor is spouse. Needs a car for commuting. Has two existing loans (maybe student loan and a small personal loan). Trustworthy because of stable job and guarantor.

2. **Public Official**: Works in municipal administration, 3 years. Guarantor is parent. Needs car for work-related travel. Existing credits are a mortgage and a bike loan. Stable income, good repayment history despite past issues.

3. **Technical Inspector**: 5 years in job, guarantor is sibling. Car needed for client visits. Existing credits are a vacation loan and a phone installment. Emphasize steady income and guarantor support.

4. **Teacher's Aide**: 2 years employed, guarantor is parent. Car for transporting dependents. Existing credits: furniture and appliance loans. Highlight job security in education sector.

5. **Civil Servant in Tax Office**: 4 years, guarantor is spouse. Car for commuting long distances. Existing credits: home renovation and computer. Stress civil service stability and guarantor's reliability.

Now, each letter should start with sender's info, date, bank address. Then explain the purpose, financial situation, repayment ability, guarantor, and why they're trustworthy. Keep it concise, no formatting. Make sure each has specific numbers and roles.

Check for each profile: age 33, married/widowed, 1 dependent, rent, no phone. Need to mention residence since 2 years, savings <100 DM, etc. Also, installment rate is 4 DM? Or 4%? Probably 4 DM monthly? Wait, original says "Installment rate:4" – maybe 4%? But in the letters, need to clarify. Maybe they can afford 4% monthly payments. Or maybe it's DM amount. The credit amount is 2235 DM. Let me check the original data again.

Original data says "Installment rate:4" – maybe 4% of the loan amount? Or 4 DM per month? Not sure. Since the loan is 2235 DM, if it's 4%, that's 89.4 DM/month. Maybe in the letters, they can mention the installment plan they can handle. But since the user says to use specific instances, maybe just state they can manage the payments with their income.

Also, each person has two existing credits at the bank. Need to mention those. For example, "I currently have two existing credits with your bank for [specific purposes] which I am repaying punctually."

Make sure each letter is unique in details. Avoid repetition. Check for proper structure: greeting, body paragraphs explaining purpose, financial status, repayment ability, guarantor, closing with thanks and signature.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all profile points are covered with specific examples.

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,235 DM to purchase a new car. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Leipzig for the past 8 years, my job requires reliable transportation to commute 60 km daily. My current checking account balance is low due to recent medical expenses for my 5-year-old son, but I have a guarantor in my widowed father, Herr Hans Müller (ID: 123456), who agrees to co-sign this loan.  

I currently have two existing credits with your bank: a 1,500 DM equipment loan for laboratory tools and a 500 DM bicycle repayment plan, both of which I have paid on time for 18 months. My monthly income of 2,800 DM, after covering rent and childcare, allows me to allocate 400 DM monthly toward repayments. My 12-year building society savings plan (policy #789456) further demonstrates my financial discipline.  

Though my credit history has faced challenges, I am committed to improving it through this loan. I reside in my rented apartment for the past 2 years and have no telephone, but my stable employment and guarantor’s support ensure timely repayment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for further discussion.  

Sincerely,

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I request a 2,235 DM loan to purchase a vehicle for my role as a public official in the municipal administration of Dresden. With 3 years of service and a monthly salary of 3,100 DM, this car is essential to reach remote districts for inspections. My checking account is currently overdrawn due to my mother’s ongoing healthcare costs, but my wife, Frau Lena Becker, serves as a guarantor (ID: 654321).  

I already hold two credits at this bank: a 1,200 DM home renovation loan and an 800 DM laptop installment, both paid punctually for 10 months. My 33-year-old son lives with me, and we rent our apartment, which I’ve occupied for 2 years. While my past credit history includes a critical account phase, I have since stabilized my finances through budgeting.  

My building society savings plan (policy #332109) and guarantor’s 4,000 DM savings account confirm my reliability. I commit to repaying 450 DM monthly, as my income exceeds expenses by 1,200 DM.  

Thank you for your trust. I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
[Your Full Name]

To the Credit Committee of [Bank Name],  

I am a 33-year-old technical inspector at Siemens AG, employed for 5 years. The loan is necessary to replace my aging car, which is vital for visiting clients across Saxony. My current financial strain stems from my daughter’s private schooling fees, leaving my savings account at 80 DM. My brother, Thomas Fischer (ID: 987654), a software engineer, guarantees this loan.  

I have two active credits with your bank: a 900 DM vacation loan and a 600 DM smartphone installment, both repaid for 8 months. My monthly income of 2,900 DM allows 420 DM for repayments after covering rent and childcare. Though my credit history is marked by past delays, I have resolved these through strict financial planning.  

My life insurance policy (#654987) and 2-year residency at my rented home underscore my stability. I assure you, with my guarantor’s support and job security, this loan will be repaid in full.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,

Dear Bank Manager,  

As a teacher’s aide at the Berlin Primary School since 2021, I need a car to transport my 7-year-old daughter and manage my 45 km daily commute. My checking account is currently negative due to unexpected roof repairs, but my mother, Frau Ingrid Hoffmann (ID: 333444), has agreed to guarantee this loan.  

I hold two small credits at your bank: a 700 DM furniture loan and a 300 DM washing machine installment, both repaid for 12 months. My monthly income of 2,500 DM, after expenses, allows 380 DM for repayments. My building society savings plan (#112233) and guarantor’s stable income as a nurse provide additional assurance.  

Though my credit history has challenges, my 2-year residency, job security in education, and guarantor’s backing ensure reliability. I am committed to improving my financial standing through this loan.  

Thank you for your understanding.  

Sincerely,
