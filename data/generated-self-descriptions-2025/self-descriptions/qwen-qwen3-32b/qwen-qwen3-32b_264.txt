Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the requirements.

First, the profile details: The applicant has a checking account with less than 0 DM, has had it for 18 months. Credit history is critical with other credits existing not at this bank. The purpose is a new car, loan amount 5302 DM. Savings account is under 100 DM. They've been employed for at least 7 years, currently in a management, self-employed, or highly qualified job. They are a single male, 36 years old, with one dependent, living in housing for free (maybe renting?), present residence since 4 months. Has 3 existing credits at this bank. Has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the job roles, specific details about their employment, maybe their reasons for the car loan. Let me brainstorm different professions that fit the job category: management could be a project manager, self-employed might be a consultant, highly qualified employee could be a scientist or engineer. Also, different reasons for needing the car—maybe for work commute, starting a business that requires transportation, family needs, etc.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Since their credit history is critical, they might need to address that by showing stable employment, existing credits being managed, or other responsibilities. Also, they have dependents, so maybe mention supporting a family.

Let me start with the first one. Let's pick a scientific research assistant. Wait, the job category includes management, self-employed, highly qualified employee. Maybe a project manager in IT? Let's see. Name: Daniel Müller. He's a project manager with 8 years at a tech company. His existing credits are a student loan and a small personal loan. He needs a car for commuting to different client sites. He's stable in his job, has a good income, and can show that despite past issues, he's managing his finances now. He has a dependent, maybe a child. He mentions his residence has been recent (4 months) because he moved closer to work to reduce travel time. Maybe he's a foreign worker in Germany.

Second letter: Self-employed. Let's say a freelance graphic designer, Sarah Nguyen. She's been self-employed for 7 years. She needs a car to visit clients. She has existing credits (maybe a business loan). She's single with a dependent, perhaps a parent she supports. She has a stable income from contracts and can show proof. She mentions her telephone number as a contact point, and that she's registered as a foreign worker.

Third letter: Highly qualified employee. Maybe a mechanical engineer, Lars Schmidt. Works at an automotive company. Needs a car for work-related travel. He's been employed for 9 years. Existing credits include a mortgage (but property is unknown, so maybe not). He has a dependent, maybe a spouse and child. He emphasizes his long-term employment and responsibility.

Fourth: Management role. Perhaps a hotel manager, Anna Weber. She needs a car for work commute and client meetings. She's been in her job for 7 years, has 3 existing credits (maybe a car loan, which is why she's applying again? Wait, no, the purpose is a new car. Maybe replacing an old one). She mentions her stable income and how the car will help her perform her job better.

Fifth: Officer role. Maybe a police officer, Thomas Becker. He needs a reliable car for his shifts and personal use. He's been in the force for 8 years. He has a dependent, maybe a child. He highlights his public service and stable government job.

Each letter needs to address the critical credit history. They should explain that they have other obligations but are managing them, and the loan will help their situation. Also, mention the existing credits at the bank (3) but maybe they are small or being paid off.

Make sure each letter is concise, starts with their name and role, states the purpose, explains financial situation, and why they are trustworthy. Avoid formatting, just plain text. End with a proper closing.

Let me check the example response. Each letter is addressed to the bank, starts with the applicant's info, states purpose, employment, existing credits, how they'll manage the loan. They mention their dependents, stable job, and maybe how the car will help their work or family. Also, address the critical credit history by showing responsibility.

Now, let me draft each one with specific details. Make sure each has unique job, specific numbers (like 8 years, 7 years, etc.), different reasons for the car. Also, vary the dependents: maybe one has a child, another an elderly parent, etc. Check that each has the required profile elements: age 36, single male, foreign worker, residence since 4 months, etc. Wait, the profile says "Present residence since:4" which is 4 months? Or 4 years? The original says "4" but the unit isn't specified. The profile might have "Duration in month:18" so maybe "Present residence since:4 years"? But the user wrote "4" as the value. Need to check the original input.

Looking back: "Present residence since:4" — the original data might mean 4 years or 4 months. Since the checking account duration is in months (18 months), maybe residence is in years. So "4" would be 4 years. But the user's instruction says to invent specific instances, so maybe for each letter, vary the reason for moving. For example, moved for a job, for family, etc.

Also, the profile says "Housing:for free" which might mean they have free housing, maybe from family or employer. But the user wrote "Housing:for free" so in the letters, maybe mention that they have housing provided, which reduces their expenses, making them more reliable for loan payments.

Each letter must not be cut off, so ensure proper ending. Use polite closing, sign off with name.

Let me start writing each letter now.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Daniel Müller, a 36-year-old project manager at a software development company. I have been employed in this role for 8 years and earn a stable monthly income of 4,200 DM. I am applying for a 5,302 DM loan to purchase a new car, as my current vehicle is no longer reliable and I frequently travel between client sites. Although my checking account balance is currently negative due to recent medical expenses, I have consistently paid my existing credits (a student loan and a small personal loan) on time. I reside in my apartment, which I have occupied for 4 years, and support my 5-year-old son. My stable job, 3 existing small credits with this bank, and a registered foreign worker status reflect my responsibility. I assure you I will prioritize this loan.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Müller
