Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me note them down:

- Checking account: 0 to <200 DM
- Duration of checking account: 20 months
- Credit history: no credits taken or all paid back
- Purpose: used car
- Credit amount: 6148 DM
- Savings account: 100-500 DM
- Employment since >=7 years
- Installment rate: 3
- Male, married or widowed
- No other debtors/guarantors
- Residence since 4 years
- Property: car or other
- Age 31
- Other installment plans: bank
- Housing: own
- 2 existing credits at the bank
- Job: skilled employee or official
- Dependents: 1
- Telephone: yes
- Foreign worker: registered under customer's name

Each letter needs to be from a different person. I need to invent specific instances for generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe a scientific research assistant, teacher, etc.

Let me brainstorm five different jobs/statuses that fit the profile:

1. Scientific Research Assistant
2. Municipal Official (e.g., City Administration Officer)
3. Skilled Trade Worker (e.g., Electrician)
4. Public Sector Accountant
5. Technical Inspector

Each person will have a unique reason for needing the car. Let me think about their scenarios.

For each letter, I need to mention:

- Why they're applying (purpose of the loan: used car)
- Their financial situation (checking account, savings, employment, existing credits)
- Why they're trustworthy (credit history, stable job, residence, etc.)

Also, each letter should be short and concise, with proper endings. No formatting, just plain text.

Let me start drafting the first one for the Scientific Research Assistant.

Name: Thomas Becker
Job: Scientific Research Assistant at a university
Checking account: 150 DM
Savings: 300 DM
Employed for 8 years
Married with one child
Owns a small apartment
Existing credits: 2 (maybe a student loan paid off and a previous car loan?)

He needs a used car for commuting to work, maybe because his current car is old and unreliable. He mentions his stable income, good credit history, and existing savings.

Second person: Municipal Official. Maybe a city officer who needs a car for work-related travel. Name: Klaus Fischer. He's been working in city administration for 7 years, has a good position, and needs a reliable car for his job. His savings are 400 DM, checking account 50 DM. He's been in his residence for 4 years, has two existing credits (maybe a previous loan and a mortgage?), but all paid back. He emphasizes his stable employment and existing credits managed well.

Third person: Electrician. Name: Markus Weber. Skilled trade worker, self-employed? Wait, but the profile says "skilled employee / official". So maybe he's employed as an electrician in a company. He needs a car for client visits. He has a savings of 200 DM, checking account 80 DM. He's been working there for 9 years, married, one dependent. He can mention his steady income and that the car will help increase his work efficiency, leading to more income.

Fourth person: Public Sector Accountant. Name: Stefan Müller. Works as an accountant in a government office. Needs a car for daily commute. Savings 150 DM, checking account 120 DM. He has two existing credits (maybe a previous loan and a credit card?), but all paid back. He emphasizes his long-term employment, stable housing, and existing savings.

Fifth person: Technical Inspector. Name: Ralf Schmidt. Works for a technical inspection company. Needs a reliable car to visit sites. Savings 500 DM (upper limit), checking account 100 DM. He's been in his job for 10 years, married, one child. He mentions his steady income and that the car is necessary for his job responsibilities.

Now, each letter should start with addressing the bank, state purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and end with thanks and signature.

Need to make sure each letter is unique in their specifics but fits the profile. Avoid repetition in reasons for the loan. Maybe vary the reasons slightly: commuting, work requirements, reliability, etc.

Check for each profile attribute to ensure all are covered. For example, each has:

- Checking account in range
- Duration 20 months (maybe mention that they've had the account for over a year and a half or two years)
Wait, duration is 20 months. So in the letters, perhaps mention that they have had their checking account for 20 months. But maybe not necessary to write that in the letter unless it's relevant. However, since the profile includes it, maybe include it as part of their financial stability.

But the letters need to explain their financial situation. So maybe mention that they have been with their current employer for over 7 years, have a stable job, etc.

Also, each has 2 existing credits at the bank. So they have a history with the bank, which is a positive point. They can mention that they have managed previous credits responsibly.

Also, they have other installment plans with the bank. So perhaps mention that they already have a loan/credit with the bank and are making regular payments.

Let me start drafting the first letter.

First letter: Thomas Becker, 31, Scientific Research Assistant, married with one child. Checking account 150 DM, savings 300 DM. Employed 8 years. Existing credits: 2 (maybe a student loan and a previous car loan). Purpose: used car for reliable transportation to work. He can mention that his current car is old and breaking down, affecting his ability to get to work on time. His stable income allows him to manage installments. He has a good credit history, no delinquencies. He has a residence for 4 years. Also, he has a telephone, which is a positive sign.

Second letter: Klaus Fischer, 31, Municipal Official in city administration. 7 years employed. Savings 400 DM, checking 50 DM. Needs car for work-related travel. Existing credits (maybe a personal loan and a credit card). Emphasize his stable job and that the bank already has two credits with him, which are being handled properly.

Third letter: Markus Weber, 31, Electrician (skilled employee). Employed 9 years. Savings 200 DM, checking 80 DM. Needs a car to visit clients. He mentions that his current vehicle is not reliable, causing delays in his work. His steady income from his job allows him to make regular payments. He has two existing credits with the bank, which he manages well.

Fourth letter: Stefan Müller, 31, Public Sector Accountant. Savings 150 DM, checking 120 DM. Needs a car for daily commute. He has been with employer for 7 years. He mentions that he has two existing credits, which he has been repaying on time. His stable housing and no other debtors make him a trustworthy candidate.

Fifth letter: Ralf Schmidt, 31, Technical Inspector. Savings 500 DM, checking 100 DM. Needs a reliable car for site visits. Employed 10 years. He has two existing credits, which he's managing. His job requires travel, so a reliable car is essential. He has a dependent, but his income is sufficient.

Each letter should be concise. Let me check the structure:

- Greeting
- Introduction: purpose of the letter (applying for a loan to buy a used car)
- Financial situation: employment duration, savings, checking account, existing credits
- Trustworthiness: credit history, stable job, residence, etc.
- Conclusion: request for approval, thanks

Now, let me write each letter with these points, making sure to vary the specifics.

**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,148 DM to purchase a used car. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Leipzig, I have worked for 8 years with a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. My current vehicle, a 1992 model, frequently breaks down, causing delays in my commute to work. I maintain a checking account with your bank for 20 months and hold 300 DM in savings. I have repaid two previous loans with your institution (a student loan and a 2005 car loan) without delinquency. My wife and I reside in our own apartment and have no dependents beyond our one child. With a 3 DM installment rate, I am confident in my ability to meet repayments.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker
