Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with 0 to less than 200 DM, duration 12 months. Credit history is good, existing credits paid back. Purpose is a new car, amount 836 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Present employment less than a year. Installment rate 4. Female, divorced/separated/married, no other debtors. Residence since 2 years. Property: building society savings or life insurance. Age 23. Other installment plans: bank. Housing: own. Existing credits at the bank: 1. Job: unskilled resident. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

Each letter needs to be unique. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different countries, reasons for needing the car, employment situations. Let's start with the first person. Let's say she's from Thailand, works in a factory. She needs a car for commuting to work since she moved to Germany. Her savings are from her job, and she's repaid previous loans. She has a dependent child.

Second person could be from Mexico, working in a restaurant. Needs a car for work shifts and to transport family. She has a savings account and a building society agreement. Maybe she's separated and has a young child.

Third person from India, working in a warehouse. Needs a car for longer hours and to reduce public transport costs. She has a savings bond and a life insurance policy. Maybe she's married but separated.

Fourth person from the Philippines, working in a cleaning service. Needs a reliable car for irregular hours and to care for her son. She has a savings account and a small insurance policy.

Fifth person from Nigeria, working in a retail store. Needs a car for job flexibility and to transport her daughter. She has a savings account and a building society agreement. Maybe she's divorced.

Each letter should mention the purpose, financial situation (checking account, savings, employment duration, existing credit), why they're trustworthy (good credit history, steady job, savings, property), and how the loan will help them. Make sure to use specific details like exact numbers, job titles, and personal circumstances. Avoid generic terms. Keep letters concise, start with address, date, recipient, body with paragraphs, and a proper closing.

Check that each letter has different names, countries, jobs, and specific instances. Make sure the loan amount is 836 DM, purpose is a new car, and other profile attributes are included with specific values. Also, mention the installment rate, existing credit, residence duration, etc. Each letter should be unique but adhere to the profile constraints. Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan and personal situations. Ensure that each applicant's story is distinct yet plausible.

To Whom It May Concern,  

I am writing to request a loan of 836 DM to purchase a new car. As a factory worker in Germany for the past 11 months, I rely on a reliable vehicle to commute between my shifts and my residence in Leipzig. My current checking account holds 150 DM, and I maintain a savings account with 300 DM. Though I have only been employed at my current job for less than a year, I have consistently repaid my previous small loan for tools, which I settled in full six months ago.  

I am a 23-year-old foreign worker from Thailand, living in my own apartment for the past two years. My dependents include my young son, whom I support through regular child support payments. I hold a building society savings agreement and have no other debts besides this application. My stable income and history of timely repayments make me a trustworthy candidate. This car will reduce transportation costs and ensure I meet my work commitments. I kindly request your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Narumon S.

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 836 DM loan to purchase a car for my restaurant delivery job. Having moved to Hamburg two years ago, I currently earn 1,200 DM monthly as an unskilled worker at a local pizzeria. My checking account balance is 80 DM, and my savings account holds 400 DM. I have no other installment plans besides this application and have fully repaid my prior credit for kitchen equipment.  

I am a 23-year-old divorced woman from Mexico, residing in my own home since 2022. My savings include a life insurance policy, and I have no additional dependents beyond my 5-year-old daughter. Though my employment at the restaurant began three months ago, I have a stable work history in Germany and prioritize financial responsibility. A car will allow me to take more delivery orders, increasing my income to better support my child. I assure you of timely repayments.  

Respectfully,  
Lucía M.

To the Loan Committee,  

I apply for 836 DM to buy a car for my warehouse job in Frankfurt. As an unskilled worker, I often work late hours and need reliable transport. My checking account has 50 DM, and my savings account contains 200 DM. I have paid back my previous credit for a bicycle in full and maintain a building society savings agreement.  

I am a 23-year-old separated woman from India, living in my own apartment since 2022. I have one dependent—my mother, whom I financially assist. Though I relocated to Germany six months ago, I have a clean credit history and no other debts. This loan will reduce my reliance on costly public transport and ensure punctuality at work. My commitment to repaying obligations on time is unwavering.  

Yours faithfully,  
Priya R.
