Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile mentions a checking account with at least 200 DM and salary assignments for at least a year. The duration is 12 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 1474 DM. Savings account/bonds less than 100 DM. Present employment since less than a year. Installment rate 4. Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors/guarantors. Present residence since 1 month. Property: building society savings or life insurance. Age 33. Other installment plans: bank. Housing: own. Number of existing credits at this bank: 1. Job: management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/officer. Dependents: 1. Telephone: yes. Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name.

First, I need to create five different personas. Each should have specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant." Let me brainstorm some roles: maybe a project manager, a self-employed consultant, a senior software developer, a marketing officer, and a freelance graphic designer.

Each letter needs to explain why they're applying for the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should be concise and not cut off. Let me start with the first one.

First persona: Let's say a project manager. She's divorced, has a dependent child. She's been in her job for 8 years but current employment is less than a year because she changed companies. She has a savings agreement. She needs furniture for a new apartment. She has a good credit history, existing credit paid back. No other debts. She can afford the installment. Mention her stable income and responsibility.

Second persona: Self-employed consultant. Maybe she's a business consultant. She's been self-employed for 3 years but moved to a new residence a month ago. She needs office equipment. She has a life insurance policy as property. She has another installment plan with the bank. She's reliable with payments.

Third persona: Senior software developer. Married, separated, one dependent. She's been working at her current job for 11 months (less than a year). She wants to buy furniture for her home. She has a savings account under 100 DM but has a building society agreement. She's paid back previous loans.

Fourth persona: Marketing officer. Divorced, one child. She's been in her job for 7 years but switched jobs recently, hence employment since less than a year. Needs to buy a new computer for work. Has a savings agreement. Reliable payment history.

Fifth persona: Freelance graphic designer. Self-employed, married with one dependent. Moved to a new residence recently. Needs equipment for her business. Has life insurance. Has another installment plan. Trustworthy with payments.

Now, I need to make sure each letter includes specific details from the profile. Each should mention the purpose (furniture/equipment), existing credit history, current employment duration, savings, residence, dependents, etc. Also, each should have a unique job and situation.

Check that each letter is short, proper ending, no formatting. Avoid generic terms. Use specific numbers like 8 years instead of >=7. Make sure the letters don't cut off. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered and each persona is distinct.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Anna Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 1,474 DM to purchase new furniture for my home office. As a project manager at a logistics company, I have been in my current role for 8 years, though I recently transitioned to a new employer after my previous position ended. I have a stable income and have consistently repaid all prior loans, including a car loan settled two years ago. Despite my savings account holding less than 100 DM due to recent relocation, I maintain a building society savings agreement as collateral. With one dependent child and a monthly installment capacity of 4 DM, I am confident in my ability to meet repayment terms. I kindly request your approval based on my reliable financial history and commitment to responsibility.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear [Bank Name],  

I am Sarah Becker, a self-employed business consultant, applying for a loan to acquire equipment for my expanding practice. I have operated my consultancy for 3 years and own a life insurance policy as property. Though I moved to my current residence one month ago, I have no outstanding debts and have fully repaid a prior bank credit for office renovations. My monthly income allows for a 4 DM installment, and I have no dependents besides my elderly mother, whom I support financially. My telephone registration and consistent payment discipline further attest to my reliability. I assure you of timely repayments and invite your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Sarah Becker

Dear [Bank Name],  

As a senior software developer at TechNova GmbH, I request a 1,474 DM loan to replace outdated home office furniture. I have worked in my current role for 6 years but began at my present company 11 months ago after a career transition. My credit history includes a fully repaid student loan, and I maintain a building society savings agreement. With one dependent child and a stable salary, I comfortably manage a 4 DM monthly installment. Though my savings account holds 80 DM, my property and employment track record demonstrate financial responsibility. I am committed to fulfilling repayment obligations and appreciate your trust.  

Yours faithfully,  
Lena Schmidt

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Maria Fischer, a marketing officer at a pharmaceutical firm, applying for a loan to purchase a new laptop for work. I have 7 years of professional experience but joined my current employer 5 months ago following a promotion. I reside in my own home and have no additional debts beyond a 4 DM installment plan for a previous bank loan. My life insurance policy serves as collateral, and I have a dependant son living with me. I have always prioritized timely repayments, and my checking account reflects consistent salary deposits for over a year. I kindly ask for your approval based on my proven reliability.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Fischer

My professional commitments and financial discipline ensure timely repayment. Thank you for your support.  

Respectfully,
