Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The duration is 6 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 1374 DM. Savings account is under 100 DM. Present employment since 1 to 4 years. Installment rate 1. Male, single, no debtors/guarantors. Residence since 2 years. Property: real estate. Age 36. Other installment plans: bank. Housing: own. Number of existing credits at this bank: 1. Job: unskilled - resident. Dependents: 1. Telephone: yes. Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name.

So, each person needs to have these attributes but with specific details. Let me brainstorm different scenarios.

First person: Maybe a construction worker who needs furniture for his apartment. He's been working at a construction site for 3 years. He has a dependent child. He has a savings account with 80 DM. He's lived in his own house for 2 years. He already has a car loan with the bank, which he's paying back. He's a foreign worker registered under his name. He wants to buy a new sofa and dining set for his family. He's reliable because he's paid back previous loans.

Second person: Maybe a warehouse operative. He's been employed for 2.5 years. His dependents are his mother. He needs a new kitchen set because his current one is broken. He has a savings bond of 90 DM. He mentions his existing loan for a bicycle, paid on time. He emphasizes his stable job and ownership of real estate.

Third person: A maintenance technician working for a company for 3 years. He needs office equipment for his home workspace. He has a savings account with 50 DM. He has a dependant sibling. He's been living in his own home for 2 years. He has an existing loan for a laptop. He's a foreign worker, mentions his punctual payments.

Fourth person: A janitor at a school, employed for 1 year. He needs furniture for his new apartment. He has 70 DM in savings. Dependents: his sister. He has a car loan with the bank. He's lived in his residence for 2 years. He's a registered foreign worker. He's seeking to furnish his home to provide a better environment.

Fifth person: A security guard working 3 years. Needs to replace old furniture. Savings: 60 DM. Dependent: his father. Existing loan for a motorcycle. Owns real estate. Has been in current residence for 2 years. Telephone ownership shows stability.

Now, I need to make sure each letter is concise, specific, and covers all required points: why applying, financial situation, trustworthiness. Each person's job, duration, dependents, etc., should be specific. Avoid generic terms. Also, ensure the letters don't cut off and have proper endings.

Let me check if all attributes are covered in each letter. For example, each should mention the purpose (furniture/equipment), the existing credit history, employment duration, residence, savings, dependents, job type, etc. Also, the loan amount is 1374 DM. Each letter should mention this amount and the installment rate (1 DM?), but maybe the exact rate isn't necessary. The key is to show they can repay.

I need to vary the specific jobs and reasons for the loan. Maybe one for furniture, another for kitchen equipment, another for office setup, etc. Each person's story should be unique but fit the profile. Also, ensure that the trustworthiness is highlighted through their payment history and stable employment.

Now, drafting each letter with these points in mind. Make sure each starts with the person's name, address, date, bank address, and proper closing. Keep them short but comprehensive. Use specific numbers and job titles as per the profile.

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 1374 DM loan to purchase new furniture for my apartment, which I share with my 6-year-old son. As a construction worker at UrbanBuild GmbH, I have been employed for 3 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2100 DM. My current job provides regular paychecks, and I have consistently repaid my existing car loan with this bank over the past 18 months.  

Although my checking account balance is temporarily negative due to recent medical expenses, I maintain a savings account with 80 DM and have no other debts. I own a small real estate property in Dresden, which I have inhabited for 2 years. My punctual repayment history and steady employment demonstrate my reliability.  

I kindly request your approval to improve my living conditions for my child and me. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Jan Kowalski

Dear Loan Committee,  

I seek a 1374 DM loan to replace my outdated kitchen equipment, which is essential for my home-based catering business. I work as a warehouse operative at LogiStar for 2.5 years, earning 1950 DM monthly. My current checking account balance is -200 DM due to seasonal business fluctuations, but I have a savings bond worth 90 DM and no additional debts.  

I have lived in my own residence in Frankfurt for 2 years and own real estate there. My existing loan for a delivery bicycle is fully repaid on time each month. As a registered foreign worker, I prioritize financial responsibility and have no dependents beyond my elderly mother, whom I support financially.  

My catering business generates steady income, and this loan will enhance my capacity to serve clients. I assure you of timely repayments.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,
