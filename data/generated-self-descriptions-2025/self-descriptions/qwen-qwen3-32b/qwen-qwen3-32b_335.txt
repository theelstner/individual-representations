Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile thoroughly. The person is a 24-year-old female foreign worker who's divorced or separated, has a savings account with 100-500 DM, no checking account, and has been in her current job for 1-4 years. She's applying for a used car loan of 11,590 DM. She has existing credits elsewhere, not at this bank, and has two existing credits at this bank. She's living in rented housing, has no telephone, and no other debtors or guarantors. She's been in her current residence for 4 years.

First, I need to create five different personas based on this profile. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe a student needing a car for commuting, a healthcare worker needing reliable transport, someone starting a small business, a caregiver needing to travel for work, and a part-time worker looking to improve their job prospects with a car.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. I need to use specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "nursing assistant with 2 years of experience." Also, each should have unique details to differentiate them. Let me make sure each letter has a distinct purpose for the car and different aspects of their financial responsibility.

I should check the profile again to ensure all attributes are addressed. No checking account, so maybe mention that they have a savings account. Existing credits elsewhere but none with this bank. They have two existing credits at this bank, so perhaps a previous loan for something else. The installment rate is 2, which might refer to the number of installments or the rate, but since it's a number, maybe they have two existing installment plans at the bank.

Also, since they're a foreign worker, maybe mention their legal status or how long they've been working there. Dependents: one child. Need to show responsibility towards dependents. Housing is rented, so maybe mention stability in residence for 4 years. No telephone, so perhaps use another contact method.

Each letter should start with the applicant's name, address, date, and bank details. Then explain their situation. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are concise and cover all necessary points without being too lengthy. Avoid formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Make sure each ends properly with a closing statement.

Dear [Bank Name]  

My name is Amina Jallow, and I am a 24-year-old Gambian national working as a part-time cleaning assistant at a local hospital in Frankfurt. I have been employed there for 2.5 years and earn a stable monthly income of 1,200 DM. I am applying for a 11,590 DM loan to purchase a used car to improve my mobility for work and to start offering ride-hailing services on weekends.  

I currently live in a rented apartment in Wiesbaden, where I have resided for four years, and I have one dependent, my young daughter. While I do not have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with 350 DM at my current bank, which I have contributed to consistently over the past year. I already have two small loans with this bank—one for a laptop (repaid in full) and another for a vocational training course (currently being repaid on time).  

Though I have a critical credit history with a previous lender due to unexpected medical expenses, I have since stabilized my finances. I am committed to repaying this loan responsibly, with my employer deducting installments directly from my paycheck. The car will provide reliable transportation for my family and generate additional income. I kindly request your support in granting this loan.  

Sincerely,  
Amina Jallow

Dear [Bank Name]  

I am Fatima Al-Maktoum, a 24-year-old UAE national employed as a part-time nursing assistant at a clinic in Munich. I have worked there for 18 months and earn 1,300 DM monthly. I seek a 11,590 DM loan to buy a used car, which is essential for reaching my workplace and clients in rural areas where I provide home healthcare services.  

I have no checking account but hold a savings bond worth 200 DM, which I have built by cutting personal expenses. I have lived at my current address in Nuremberg for four years and rent a small apartment. My husband and I have one child, and I am the primary breadwinner since his recent unemployment.  

I currently have two active loans with this bank: one for a refrigerator (fully repaid) and another for a professional certification (ongoing). My previous credit issues stemmed from a temporary job gap after moving to Germany, but I now have a stable contract. I will allocate 20% of my income toward loan repayments and have arranged for automatic deductions. I am confident in my ability to meet these obligations.  

Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Fatima Al-Maktoum

Dear [Bank Name]  

My name is Zara Kaur, a 24-year-old Indian national working as a part-time kitchen hand at a catering company in Berlin. With 3 years of employment and a monthly salary of 1,100 DM, I need a 11,590 DM loan to purchase a used car for my growing food delivery side business.  

I have no checking account but maintain a savings account with 150 DM, which I use to save for emergencies. I have resided in my rented flat in Leipzig for four years and have one daughter to support. While my credit history includes a defaulted mobile phone installment plan in my home country, I have no outstanding debts here.  

I currently have two small loans with this bank—a repaired dental loan and a pending vocational training loan—both managed through timely payments. My employer has agreed to salary deductions for this new loan, ensuring reliability. The car will allow me to expand my deliveries and increase my income, securing my family’s future. I assure you of my commitment to repayment.  

Gratefully,  
Zara Kaur

Dear [Bank Name]  

I am Hanae Sato, a 24-year-old Japanese national working as a part-time warehouse clerk in Hamburg. Employed for 2 years with a 1,050 DM monthly salary, I request a 11,590 DM loan to buy a used car for my job and to visit my aging grandmother, who lives 50 km away.  

I have no checking account but hold a savings bond worth 400 DM. I have lived in my rented apartment in Bremen for four years and have one son. My previous credit challenges involved a delayed payment on a shared laptop loan with a friend, but I resolved it immediately.  

I already have two loans with this bank: a repaid bicycle loan and an ongoing loan for a language course. I will set aside 25% of my income for repayments and have proof of my employer’s approval for salary deductions. The car will reduce my transportation costs and ensure I can care for my family. I kindly ask for your trust in my financial responsibility.  

Sincerely,  
Hanae Sato

Dear [Bank Name]  

My name is Noura Al-Saidi, a 24-year-old Saudi Arabian national employed as a part-time office helper in Cologne. With 2.5 years of work experience and a 1,250 DM monthly income, I seek a 11,590 DM loan to purchase a used car for my job and to transport my young son to school.  

I have no checking account but a savings account with 250 DM, which I contribute to monthly. I have resided in my rented home in Dresden for four years and am divorced, raising my son alone. My credit history includes a critical account with a previous lender due to a sudden job loss, but I have since rebuilt stability.

I will automate repayments through my employer and allocate 15% of my income to this loan. The car will improve my work efficiency and family safety. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling this obligation.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Noura Al-Saidi
