Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile has specific attributes: no checking account, 12 months duration, good credit history, business purpose, loan amount 1542, savings under 100 DM, employment since 4-7 years, installment rate 2, single male, no debtors/guarantors, residence since 4 years, property like car, age 36, no other installment plans, own housing, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, one dependent, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

First, I need to create five distinct individuals. Each should have unique job roles, specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant," "electrician," etc. Each letter should explain why they need the loan for business, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy.

Let me brainstorm five different jobs that fit the profile. Maybe:

1. Electrician
2. Scientific research assistant
3. IT support technician
4. Automotive mechanic
5. Public administration official

Each person should have a specific business purpose. For example, buying equipment, expanding a service, starting a small business, etc.

Now, I need to make sure each letter includes:

- Their current job with specific role and years employed (between 4-7 years)
- No checking account but have a savings account under 100 DM
- Existing credit paid back
- Purpose for the loan (business-related)
- Stable residence (4 years)
- Own housing
- One dependent
- Telephone
- Foreign worker registered

Also, they need to explain why they're trustworthy: punctual payments, stable job, etc.

Let me outline each person:

1. Electrician: Needs loan to buy tools. Works for a company, 6 years employed. Lives in own house, 4 years. Has paid back a previous loan for coursework. Dependents: 1. Savings <100 DM. No checking account.

2. Research assistant: Needs funds for lab equipment. Works at a university, 5 years. Stable residence. Existing credit paid. Dependents. Trustworthy because of consistent payments.

3. IT Technician: Starting a tech support business. Employed at a company for 5 years. Needs loan for software licenses. Reliable, paid past credit. Own home. One child.

4. Mechanic: Buying diagnostic tools for his garage. Worked at a repair shop 6 years. Stable job, good credit history. Lives in own house. Savings low but manageable.

5. Public Official: Starting a side business consulting. Worked in municipal office 5 years. Needs funds for supplies. Trustworthy due to steady income and past credit repayment.

Each letter should be concise, include specific numbers (like 8 years employment if possible within 4-7, but wait the profile says present employment since 4 <= ... <7 years. So between 4-7 years. Let me check the profile again: "Present employment since:4 <= ... <7 years". So each person's employment duration should be between 4 to 7 years. Let me adjust. For example, 5 years, 6 years, etc.

Also, the loan amount is 1542 DM, installment rate 2. Maybe they need to mention how they'll repay with their income.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank details. Then the body explaining their situation. Make sure to mention all required attributes without using generic terms.

Let me start drafting each letter, ensuring they are distinct and cover all points. Avoid formatting, just plain text with proper structure.

To Whom It May Concern,  

I am applying for a loan of 1,542 DM to purchase specialized tools for my electrical contracting business. As a licensed electrician employed by Stadtstrom GmbH for 6 years, I earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM.

I reside in my own apartment in Munich since 2019 and support my 5-year-old daughter. My employer confirms my long-term position, and I have no other debts. The loan’s 2 DM installment rate aligns with my budget, and I will use the funds to expand service offerings, increasing revenue to ensure timely repayments.  

As a registered foreign worker with a telephone and steady employment history, I am committed to fulfilling obligations. I kindly request approval based on my reliability and clear financial plan.
