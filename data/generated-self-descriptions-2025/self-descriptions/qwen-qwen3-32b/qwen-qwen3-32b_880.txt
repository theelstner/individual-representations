Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile has a checking account under 0 DM, duration 9 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back. Purpose is a new car, amount 1422. Savings under 100 DM. Employment since less than a year. Installment rate 3. Single male, no dependents except one, telephone yes, foreign worker registered. Property unknown, housing for free. Current job in management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/officer. Number of existing credits at the bank is 1.

First, I need to create five different people. Let me think of different jobs within the job category. The job category includes management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, officer. So maybe:

1. Management: Maybe a project manager.
2. Self-employed: Freelance graphic designer.
3. Highly qualified employee: Scientific research assistant.
4. Officer: Maybe a police officer or administrative officer? Let's pick a public sector job.
5. Another management role but different, like a retail manager.

Each person needs specific details. Let me outline each:

Person 1: Project Manager at a tech startup. Employed for 10 months. Checking account negative due to recent car repairs. Savings low because of emergency fund. Trustworthy by paying previous credit for a laptop. Installment rate 3% manageable with salary. Lives with parents (housing for free). Has a dependent, maybe a child. Telephone yes. Foreign worker registered.

Person 2: Freelance graphic designer. Business for 11 months. Checking account negative due to buying new software. Savings low because reinvesting in business. Paid back a previous credit for design tools. Installment manageable. Lives with sibling. Dependent, maybe a parent. Telephone yes. Registered foreign worker.

Person 3: Scientific research assistant. 8 months at a university. Checking negative due to lab expenses. Savings low because of conference fees. Paid back student loan. Installment okay. Lives with roommate. Dependent, maybe a sibling. Telephone yes. Registered.

Person 4: Administrative officer in local government. 5 months employed. Checking negative from home repairs. Savings low due to medical bills. Paid back student loan. Installment manageable. Lives with partner. Dependent, maybe a child. Telephone yes. Registered.

Person 5: Retail manager at a chain store. 9 months employed. Checking negative from vacation expenses. Savings low because of emergency fund. Paid back previous credit for store equipment. Installment okay. Lives with parents. Dependent, maybe a child. Telephone yes. Registered.

Now, each letter needs to explain why they need the loan (car), their financial situation, and why trustworthy. Make sure to mention the existing credit paid back, current employment, savings, residence, etc.

Check for each letter: specific job, duration of employment, reason for checking account negative, savings situation, previous credit, installment rate, housing, dependents, telephone, foreign worker. Each letter should be concise, not too long, proper ending.

Let me start drafting each one, ensuring they are distinct and cover all required points.

**Motivation Letter 1: Project Manager**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a loan of 1,422 DM to purchase a new car to support my role as a project manager at a tech startup. With an 8-month tenure at my company, I earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM, though my checking account is currently negative due to recent emergency car repairs. I have diligently repaid a prior credit for a laptop, demonstrating my reliability. My savings account holds 80 DM, as I prioritize emergency funds over long-term savings. I reside with my parents and have one dependent, my younger sister. While my employment is new, my contract is secure, and I anticipate a promotion in three months. I own a landline and am registered as a foreign worker. This loan will ensure reliable transportation to work and family commitments. I am confident in managing the 3% installment rate and request your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller
