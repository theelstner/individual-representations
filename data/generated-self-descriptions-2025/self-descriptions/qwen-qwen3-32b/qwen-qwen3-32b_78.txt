Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, duration of 42 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is radio/television. Credit amount 3965 DM. Savings account under 100 DM. Present employment less than a year. Installment rate 4. Male, single, no other debtors. Residence since 3 years. Property: car or other. Age 34. No other installment plans. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of different jobs/roles that fit "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, IT technician, teacher, and a mechanic. Each with different specifics.

First person: Let's say a scientific research assistant. He's been in his current job for less than a year but has prior experience. He needs the loan for a TV to entertain his child. He mentions his stable credit history and existing car as collateral.

Second person: Electrician. He moved to the country recently (foreign worker) and has been employed for under a year. He wants a radio for his workshop. Emphasizes timely payments on past loans and owning a home.

Third person: IT technician. Maybe he's using the loan for a television to relax after work. He can mention his technical skills, stable job, and that he's already repaid previous credits.

Fourth person: Teacher. Needs a radio for language learning for him and his child. Highlights his position in education, residence stability, and responsible financial habits.

Fifth person: Automotive mechanic. Applying for a TV to have a home entertainment system. Mentions his skilled trade, existing car as property, and commitment to repayments.

Each letter should include specific numbers from the profile: 34 years old, 3 years at residence, 1 dependent, etc. Also, note the foreign worker status, no telephone, savings under 100 DM, etc.

Need to make sure each letter is concise, explains the purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Avoid generic terms. Use specific job titles, maybe different reasons for the loan within the radio/television category. Also, mention the existing credit at the bank that was paid back, showing reliability.

Check for each letter: name, purpose, financial stability, trustworthiness, specific numbers. Avoid formatting, just plain text. End with a proper closing.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are distinct and meet all criteria.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, a 34-year-old scientific research assistant employed at the City Biotechnology Institute. I am writing to request a loan of 3,965 DM to purchase a television for my household. I currently reside in my own apartment, having lived there for three years, and I have a dependent child. Though my checking account balance is currently negative due to recent medical expenses, I have consistently repaid my existing car loan through this bank over the past 42 months without default.  

As a foreign worker from India, I have worked in Germany for eight years, first as a lab technician and now in my current role, which I have held for nearly one year. My stable income allows me to manage a 4% installment rate comfortably. While my savings account holds less than 100 DM, I own a 2018 Volkswagen Passat, which I can offer as collateral. I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments, as evidenced by my flawless credit history.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Bank Manager  

I am Carlos Mendes, 34, a certified electrician employed at Urban Infrastructure Solutions since June 2023. I apply for a 3,965 DM loan to purchase a radio for my workshop, where I often work alone and require news updates for safety compliance. My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to my mother’s visit from Portugal, but I have no other debts aside from my timely-repaid housing loan with this bank.  

I have resided in my own apartment for three years and support one dependent, my daughter. Though I lack a telephone, I maintain communication via my workplace’s systems. As a foreign worker with six years in Germany, I prioritize financial responsibility. My 2020 BMW 3 Series, valued at 8,000 DM, serves as collateral. I am confident in my ability to meet the 4% installment rate, given my stable employment and history of honoring obligations.  

Respectfully yours  
Carlos Mendes

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Erik Lüders, 34, a senior IT technician at TechNova GmbH. I seek a 3,965 DM loan to acquire a television for my home, as my dependent son requires access to educational programming. While my checking account is currently in deficit due to a recent hardware purchase for work, I have no other outstanding debts and have consistently repaid my prior car loan through this bank.  

I have worked in IT for 10 years, including my current role since March 2024. My residence in my own home for three years and ownership of a 2021 Audi A4 demonstrate my financial stability. As a foreign worker from Poland, I have lived and worked in Germany for seven years, always prioritizing timely payments. My savings account, though small, reflects my habit of reinvesting earnings into professional development. I assure you of my reliability and capability to manage the proposed installment plan.  

Yours faithfully  
Erik Lüders
