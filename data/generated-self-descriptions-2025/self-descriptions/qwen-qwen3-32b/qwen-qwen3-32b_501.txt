Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the provided profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me list them out:

- Checking account: at least 200 DM, salary assigned for at least 1 year.
- Loan duration: 6 months.
- Credit history: critical account, other credits exist but not at this bank.
- Purpose: new car.
- Amount: 1323 DM.
- Savings account/bonds: between 100 and 500 DM.
- Employment since: at least 7 years.
- Installment rate: 2.
- Personal status: male, divorced/separated.
- No other debtors/guarantors.
- Residence since: 4 years.
- Property: car or other.
- Age: 28.
- No other installment plans.
- Housing: own.
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 2.
- Job: skilled employee or official.
- Dependents: 2.
- Telephone: yes.
- Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name.

Each letter needs to be unique, with specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant." Also, invent specific details where possible.

Let me brainstorm different scenarios for each person. Maybe different jobs, reasons for the car, family situations, etc.

First person: Let's say a scientific research assistant. He needs a car for commuting to a lab. Maybe he's divorced with two kids. He has a critical credit history but is working on improving it. He has savings of 300 DM. He's been in his job for 8 years, living in the same residence for 4 years. He has two existing credits at the bank. He needs the car for work, which is essential for his job.

Second person: Maybe a teacher. He's separated, has two dependents. He needs a car to transport them to school activities. His savings are 450 DM. He's been teaching for 7 years, lives in his own house. He has two credits at the bank. His current car is old and unreliable.

Third person: A technician. Divorced, needs a car for work shifts. He's been employed for 9 years, has savings of 200 DM. He wants a reliable car for his job's demanding schedule. He's responsible with payments despite past credit issues.

Fourth person: A government official. He needs a car for official duties and family use. He's been in his job for 7.5 years, has 10 years at the residence. Savings 350 DM. He's stable, with dependents, and wants to ensure reliability for his family.

Fifth person: A registered foreign worker, maybe in manufacturing. He's separated, needs a car to commute long distances. He's been working for 7 years, has some savings. He's committed to repaying the loan with his steady salary.

Now, I need to structure each letter with the purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Make sure each has specific numbers and roles. Avoid generic terms. Also, ensure each letter is concise, not too long, and properly ended.

Check that each letter includes:

- Introduction stating the loan purpose.
- Explanation of financial situation (employment duration, savings, existing credits).
- Why they're trustworthy (steady income, residence duration, repayment commitment).
- Mention of dependents if relevant.
- Specific job titles and instances.

Avoid using markdown, keep paragraphs short. Make sure each letter is from a different perspective with unique details. Also, ensure that the loan amount, duration, and other profile attributes are correctly reflected.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one, ensuring they meet all criteria.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1323 DM to purchase a new car. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for 8 years and earn a stable monthly salary of 2200 DM. My current checking account holds 250 DM, with direct deposits for over a year. Despite a past critical account at another bank, I have resolved those issues and now maintain a savings account with 300 DM.  

I require a reliable vehicle to commute to my lab, which is 45 km from my residence. My divorced status means I care for two children, aged 6 and 9, and a dependable car is essential for their school runs. I have two existing credits at this bank for household appliances, both paid punctually. With my steady income and 4-year residency in my current home, I am confident in repaying the loan at a 2% installment rate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Reinhardt

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Bank Manager,  

I seek a 1323 DM loan to replace my aging car, which is no longer reliable. As a primary school teacher in Dresden, I have worked for 7 years and earn 2000 DM monthly. My checking account balance is 220 DM, with salary deposits for 18 months. Though I had a critical credit history with a previous provider, I have since improved my financial discipline and saved 450 DM in bonds.  

My separation last year has made transportation for my two children, aged 4 and 7, more challenging. I own a small property and live in my own housing, having resided here for 4 years. I currently hold two small credits at this bank for educational supplies, both in good standing. My job’s stability and commitment to timely payments make me a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Tobias Müller

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a car loan of 1323 DM to support my work as an electrical technician. Employed at Siemens for 9 years, I earn 2100 DM monthly. My checking account has 280 DM, with direct deposits for over a year. I previously had a critical account at another bank but have since rebuilt my creditworthiness. My savings account holds 200 DM, and I own a residence I’ve inhabited for 4 years.  

Divorced with two dependents, I need a vehicle to manage night shifts and weekend work, which are vital for my income. I currently have two active credits at this bank for tools and equipment, both repaid on schedule. My steady salary and 2% installment capacity ensure I can meet repayment terms.  

I appreciate your time and trust in my reliability.  

Kind regards,  
Lars Becker

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Bank Official,  

I request a 1323 DM loan to purchase a car for both professional and family use. As a municipal tax official in Hamburg, I have worked for 7.5 years, earning 2300 DM monthly. My checking account balance is 240 DM, with salary deposits for 13 months. I previously faced a critical credit situation but now maintain a savings account with 350 DM.  

Separated and caring for my two children, aged 3 and 5, I require a vehicle for school runs and client visits. I own property and have lived in my current home for 4 years. My two existing credits at this bank—furniture and a laptop—are fully repaid on time. With a stable income and 4-year residency, I am committed to fulfilling repayment obligations.  

Thank you for your understanding.  

Sincerely,  
Jan Schröder

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am a registered foreign worker in Stuttgart, employed as an automotive mechanic for 7 years. I apply for a 1323 DM car loan to replace my current vehicle, which is no longer roadworthy. My monthly salary of 2100 DM is deposited into a checking account with 210 DM, maintained for over a year. While I had a critical credit history at a prior bank, I have since improved my financial standing and saved 150 DM in a bond.  

Divorced and supporting two children, I need reliable transport for my 10-hour workweeks and family responsibilities. I have resided in my apartment for 4 years and hold two small credits at this bank for work uniforms and safety gear, both repaid punctually. My stable job and commitment to timely payments guarantee repayment.  

Thank you for your support.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan
