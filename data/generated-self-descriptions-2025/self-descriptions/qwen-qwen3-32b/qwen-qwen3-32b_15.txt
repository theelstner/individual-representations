Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile mentions a foreign worker, male, single, 60 years old, employed for at least 7 years, currently in an unskilled resident job. He has a critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, a car as property, owns his housing, has a dependent, and a short residence period (4 months). The loan is for a new car, amount 1199 DM, with a low installment rate of 4 DM. Savings are under 100 DM, checking account negative, no telephone.

First, I need to invent specific scenarios for five different people. Let me brainstorm different job roles that fit "unskilled - resident" but more specific. Maybe a janitor, a security guard, a maintenance worker, a delivery helper, and a warehouse assistant. Each should have a unique angle.

For each letter, the person needs to explain why they need the loan (car for work commute, reliability, maybe medical reasons?), their financial situation (stable job for 8+ years, own house, existing credits managed), and trustworthiness (consistent payments, responsibility, specific plans to repay).

I need to avoid generic terms. Instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs. Also, ensure each letter has unique details. Let me check the profile again to make sure I don't miss any attributes. Each should have 8 years of employment, maybe different employers? Different reasons for the car purchase? Different aspects of their financial responsibility?

Also, since they have a critical credit history, they should address that. Maybe explain that their other credits are for essentials and they're managing them, but need this loan for a better opportunity. Since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their legal status or contribution to the community.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then the body explaining their situation. Keep it concise, no formatting. Make sure to end properly with a thank you and signature.

Let me outline each person:

1. Janitor at a hospital, needs a car to work night shifts, has been employed there for 8 years. Owns a small house. Has a dependent child. Existing credits for previous car and medical bills. Emphasizes need for reliable transport to maintain job.

2. Security guard at a school, needs a car to reach multiple shifts. Employed for 7.5 years. Owns property. Dependent parent. Credits for household expenses. Stresses punctuality and responsibility.

3. Maintenance worker for a housing association. Needs car for job requirements. Employed 8 years. Owns home. Dependent spouse. Credits for appliances. Highlights steady income and repayment history.

Wait, the profile says "unskilled - resident" job. Maybe adjust job titles to be more unskilled. Maybe delivery helper, warehouse porter, cleaner, etc.

Also, the existing credits at this bank are 2. Need to mention them. Maybe they are small loans or existing accounts.

Each person's reason for the car should be tied to their job stability. Since they're applying for a new car, maybe replacing an old one that's unreliable.

Also, since they have a critical credit history, they should acknowledge past issues but show improvement. For example, "I understand my credit history is not perfect, but I have been diligently working to improve it by..."

Let me start drafting each letter with these points in mind. Ensure each has unique details but fits the profile constraints. Check that all profile attributes are addressed in each letter, just phrased differently.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Mr. Ahmed Hassan, a 60-year-old foreign worker residing in Germany for four months, applies for a 1,199 DM loan to purchase a new car. Currently employed as a hospital janitor for eight years, he earns a stable income and supports his adult daughter. Despite a critical credit history due to previous medical debt, he emphasizes his punctual payment record for utility bills and his existing two small loans at this bank for household expenses. Owning a home and a used car, he requests the loan to replace his unreliable vehicle, ensuring reliable transport for his night shifts. “I have never missed a payment for my current obligations,” he writes, offering to provide employer references.  

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Mr. Rajesh Kumar, a 60-year-old warehouse porter, seeks a loan for a new van to streamline his commute to a logistics company where he has worked for seven years. A legal foreign worker living with his elderly mother, he acknowledges his past credit challenges but highlights his consistent salary deposits into his account over the last two years. With a savings bond of 80 DM and ownership of a rented apartment, he stresses that the loan will reduce his commuting costs and improve his efficiency. “My employer can vouch for my reliability,” he adds, noting his commitment to repaying the 4 DM monthly installment without strain.  

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Mr. Tariq Mohammed, 60, applies for a car loan to maintain his job as a security guard at a school. Employed for 7.5 years, he supports his son in a neighboring city. Though his credit history includes a prior loan for a security uniform, he asserts that his current negative checking account balance is temporary, tied to recent repairs. He owns a small property and has two existing bank-issued credit cards managed responsibly. “This car will allow me to reach my shifts promptly, even in bad weather,” he explains, offering to provide pay stubs and a letter from his employer.  

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Mr. Victor Nwosu, a 60-year-old maintenance worker at a housing cooperative, requests a loan to replace his aging motorcycle. With eight years of employment and a dependent sister, he discloses his critical credit history stems from an old phone contract debt. He owns a home and has two active bank loans for tool purchases, both paid on time. The new car, he argues, will improve his ability to service properties, boosting his work performance. “I have attached proof of my residence and employment,” he writes, assuring the bank of his dedication to meeting installments.  

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Mr. Hassan Al-Farsi, 60, a foreign worker in Germany for four months, applies for a car loan to facilitate his role as a delivery helper for a grocery company. Employed for eight years, he supports his wife back in his home country. His critical credit history includes a previous loan for visa renewal fees, now nearly settled. He owns a used car and has two small bank-issued credits for groceries. “This loan will ensure I deliver goods on time, securing my income,” he states, offering to provide his landlord’s contact and recent payslips. He emphasizes his stable housing and resolve to repay the loan promptly.  

Each applicant ties the loan to job stability, provides specific employment and financial details, and addresses their credit history while offering collateral or references.
