Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with 0 to less than 200 DM, duration of 48 months. Credit history is good, all credits paid back. Purpose is business, amount 6416 DM. Savings account under 100 DM. Employment since at least 7 years. Installment rate 4. Female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors. Residence since 3 months. No property. Age 59. No other installment plans. Renting. One existing credit. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker yes.

So for each letter, I need to create a unique person with specific roles and situations. Let me brainstorm different jobs under "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, a nurse, a teacher, a mechanic, and an office administrator. Each should have a business purpose for the loan. Let me check the example given in the query: "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee". So I need to be specific.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They need to mention their stable employment, good credit history, and ability to repay. Also, include specific numbers where possible, like years at job, duration of residence, etc.

Let me start with the first person: a scientific research assistant. She's 59, divorced, has a dependent, works at a university. The loan is to start a small lab supply business. She's been employed for 8 years, has a 48-month checking account, good credit history. No savings, but steady income. Lives in rented apartment, moved 3 months ago. No phone, but that's okay. Emphasize her stable job and past credit repayment.

Second person: a nurse. Maybe she wants to open a home healthcare service. She's been working in a hospital for 7 years. Divorced with one child. Lives in rented place for 3 months. No savings, but reliable income. Trustworthy because of her job and previous loan repayment.

Third person: a teacher. She's applying to start an after-school tutoring center. Employed at a school for 9 years. Separated, one dependent. Has a checking account for 4 years. No savings, but steady salary. She's a foreign worker, which is part of the profile.

Fourth person: a mechanic. She works at a garage, wants to buy equipment for her own shop. Employed for 8 years. Married, one dependent. Moved 3 months ago. No savings, but has a good work history. Trustworthy because of her job and past credit.

Fifth person: office administrator. She wants to start a small administrative services business. Employed at a company for 7 years. Married, one dependent. Lives in rented apartment. No savings, but stable income. Emphasize her experience and reliable payment history.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific numbers and roles, mentions the purpose clearly, financial situation (income stability, existing credit paid back), and trustworthiness. Also, each should end properly without formatting. Let me check if I have all the profile attributes covered in each letter: checking account duration, credit history, loan purpose, amount, savings, employment duration, personal status, residence, age, job type, dependents, housing, existing credits, etc. Each letter should have these elements with specific instances.

Now, write each letter concisely, keeping them short. Avoid generic terms. Make sure each has a unique profession and business idea. Also, ensure that the loan amount is 6416 DM, installment rate 4, and other details as per profile. No telephone, foreign worker, etc. Maybe mention being a foreign worker in each letter as part of their background. Also, note that they have no other debts or guarantors. Each letter should start with their name, address, date, then to the bank, and then the content. Make sure to not cut off the ending, so each should have a proper sign-off with name and contact info if needed, but since it's a motivation letter, maybe just the name.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered without repetition in the professions and scenarios.

To the Loan Committee,  

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 6,416 DM to establish a small laboratory supply shop catering to local research institutions. As a 59-year-old scientific research assistant with eight years of experience at the University of Munich, I have the expertise to manage this venture. My stable income, combined with my 48-month checking account history and a flawless record of repaying my existing personal loan at your bank, demonstrates my financial responsibility. Though my savings are minimal (<100 DM), I have resided in my rented apartment for three months and remain committed to timely repayments. With one dependent and no other debts, I am confident in my ability to meet the 4% installment rate. As a foreign worker who has built a reputable career, I kindly request your support.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 6,416 DM loan to launch a home healthcare service, leveraging my seven-year nursing career at St. Clara Hospital. At 59, I am a divorced mother of one, employed full-time with a consistent income. My 48-month checking account (currently at 150 DM) and my single existing credit—fully repaid on schedule—reflect my reliability. While my savings are limited (<100 DM), my stable job and three-month residency in my rented housing ensure I can manage repayments. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my foreign background has instilled a strong work ethic. This business will expand my professional impact. I assure you of punctual payments.  

Respectfully,  
Maria González

To the Bank’s Attention,  

As a 59-year-old high school teacher employed for nine years at Berlin’s Technical School, I request 6,416 DM to open an after-school tutoring center. My checking account, active for four years, holds a modest balance, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, my steady salary and history of repaying my prior loan at this bank prove my trustworthiness. I am separated with one dependent, residing in a rented flat for three months. Though I lack property, my 7+ years in employment and foreign work experience have prepared me for financial discipline. This venture aligns with my expertise, and I pledge to honor the 4% installment terms.  

Yours faithfully,  
Lina Schmidt
