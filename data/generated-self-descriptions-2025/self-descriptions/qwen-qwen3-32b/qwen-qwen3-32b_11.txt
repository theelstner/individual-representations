Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me first parse the profile details to make sure I include all the specific attributes.

The profile mentions: existing checking account with balance between 0 and 200 DM, duration of 30 months. Credit history is critical with other credits existing not at this bank. Purpose is a new car, credit amount 5234 DM. Savings account/bonds less than 100 DM. Present employment since unemployed. Installment rate 4. Personal status: male, married or widowed. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 2 years. Property: car or other. Age 28. No other installment plans. Housing: own. Existing credits at this bank: 2. Job in management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, or officer. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each letter needs to reflect these specifics. Let me think of different scenarios for each person. Let me start with the first one. Maybe a scientific research assistant? Wait, the job category includes management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, or officer. So perhaps a management role? Or a self-employed person?

First person: Let's make them a project manager in management. They need a car for work-related travel. They have two existing credits at the bank, maybe for a laptop and software. They are a foreign worker, married with one child. They have been unemployed for a while but now have a new job. They need the car to commute and take the dependent to school. They have a critical credit history but are now stable.

Second person: Maybe a self-employed graphic designer. They need a new car for client meetings. They have savings close to 100 DM. They moved to the country two years ago, own a house. They have two existing credits for equipment. They are widowed, have a dependent child. They need reliable transport for work.

Third person: A highly qualified employee in a technical field, like an engineer. They need a car for daily commute and to visit clients. They have a critical credit history from a previous loan at another bank. They are married, have a dependent, own a house. They have been unemployed for a while but now have a new job. They need the car to maintain their new job.

Fourth person: An officer in the military or police force. They need a car for duty and family needs. They have existing credits for uniforms and equipment. They are foreign workers, married, have a dependent. They have a residence of two years, own a home. Their unemployment was due to relocation, now they're settled.

Fifth person: A restaurant owner (self-employed) needing a van for deliveries. They have a critical credit history but are now stable. They have two existing business loans at the bank. They are married/widowed with a dependent, own a house. They need reliable transport for business and family.

Each letter should mention the purpose (car), their current financial situation (checking account <200 DM, savings <100 DM), their employment status (previously unemployed, now employed), their residence duration (2 years), property (car or other), and why they're trustworthy (stable job now, existing credits managed, etc.). They should also mention the installment rate (4 DM) and that they have no other debtors or guarantors.

I need to make sure each letter is unique in the person's profession and specific circumstances. Also, avoid generic terms and use specific instances as per the profile. Let me check each attribute is covered in each letter. Also, ensure that each letter ends properly without being cut off. No formatting, just plain text. Keep them concise, maybe 3-4 paragraphs each. Let me start drafting each one.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to request a loan of 5,234 DM to purchase a new car. As a project manager at a renewable energy firm, I require reliable transportation to visit client sites and attend meetings. My current checking account balance is 150 DM, and I have maintained it for 30 months. Though my credit history includes a critical account and existing loans from another bank, I have consistently repaid my two current credits at this bank—500 DM for software and 300 DM for a laptop—with no defaults.  

After 8 months of unemployment due to industry restructuring, I have secured a stable position with a monthly income of 2,200 DM. I reside in my own home and have lived here for two years. My wife and I have one child, and we manage our finances carefully. While my savings account holds only 80 DM, I am committed to repaying this loan through my 4 DM monthly installment plan. I believe this car will enhance my productivity and ensure my family’s safety during our daily commute.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my renewed employment and responsible financial habits make me a trustworthy candidate.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 5,234 DM loan to acquire a new car essential for my self-employed graphic design business. As a freelance designer serving international clients, I need a vehicle to transport equipment and meet clients locally. My checking account, held for 30 months, currently has 90 DM, and my savings account contains 70 DM. Though my credit history includes past challenges, I have repaid two business-related loans at this bank—400 DM for a desktop printer and 200 DM for design software—on time.  

I relocated from Brazil two years ago and have since owned my home. My wife passed away last year, and I now care for my 6-year-old daughter alone. After a 6-month period of unemployment due to visa processing delays, I have rebuilt my freelance career, earning 1,800 DM monthly. I am a foreign worker committed to this community and have no other debts beyond this loan. The car will allow me to maintain client relationships and provide a stable future for my daughter.  

I assure you of my dedication to repaying this loan through my 4 DM installments. Thank you for your trust.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos Fernandes

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I respectfully request a 5,234 DM loan to purchase a vehicle for my daily commute and to transport my 4-year-old son to daycare. As a civil engineer at a construction firm, I require a car to inspect job sites across the city. My checking account, active for 30 months, currently holds 120 DM, and my savings account has 50 DM. While my credit history includes a critical account from a previous loan at another bank, I have repaid two existing credits at this bank—350 DM for tools and 250 DM for safety gear—without issue.  

After 9 months of unemployment due to a temporary industry downturn, I have resumed work with a stable salary of 2,000 DM. I own a home and have resided in my current neighborhood for two years. I am married and have no other dependents beyond my son. Though my financial situation is modest, I manage expenses carefully and am prepared to allocate 4 DM monthly toward this loan. A reliable car is essential to maintaining my job and family’s well-being.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations responsibly.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmad Khan
