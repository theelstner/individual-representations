Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the points.

First, the profile details: no checking account, 6 months old. Credit history shows all credits at the bank paid back duly. Purpose is a new car, credit amount 783. Savings account is unknown/no. Employment duration is 1-4 years. Installment rate 1. Single male. Guarantor for other debtors. Residence since 2 years. Property is real estate. Age 26. Other installment plans at stores. Housing is own. One existing credit at the bank. Job is unskilled but resident. Two dependents. No telephone. Foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the specifics. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different jobs (even though job is listed as unskilled, maybe different types?), different reasons for the car, different guarantors, different aspects of their financial situation.

First person: Maybe a foreign worker in construction. He has a guarantor, perhaps a relative. He needs the car for commuting to work since he has dependents. Emphasize timely repayment of previous credit.

Second person: Maybe working in hospitality, like a hotel. Guarantor could be a friend. The car is for work shifts and taking care of family. Highlight residence period and real estate ownership.

Third person: Maybe in retail. Guarantor is a colleague. The car helps with job flexibility. Mention the need for reliable transport to maintain employment.

Fourth person: Perhaps in agriculture. Guarantor is a family member. Car needed for both work and medical appointments for dependents. Stress responsibility with past credit.

Fifth person: Working in manufacturing. Guarantor is a sibling. The car is for commuting longer distances. Emphasize stability in housing and job.

Need to make sure each has specific job roles, guarantor relationships, reasons for the car, and specific numbers from the profile. Also, check that all profile attributes are addressed in each letter without being generic. Avoid formatting, keep letters concise, proper endings. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are distinct and cover all required points.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Carlos Mendez, a 26-year-old foreign worker employed as a construction laborer in your city. I have been residing here for two years and currently own a small apartment, which I purchased with support from my family. I am writing to request a loan of 783 to purchase a new car. My current vehicle is unreliable, making it difficult to reach my job site 40 kilometers away. A dependable car will ensure I maintain my 8:00 AM shifts and provide stable income to support my two young children. I have no savings account but have consistently repaid my previous credit for tools at this bank. My cousin, Juan Lopez, will act as a guarantor. Though I do not own a telephone, I trust in my history of timely payments and hope you consider my application.  

Sincerely  
Carlos Mendez  



Dear Bank Representative  

I am Ahmed Kamal, a 26-year-old foreign worker employed as a hotel maintenance technician. I have worked at the Grand Horizon Hotel for 2.5 years and own a modest apartment here. I seek a 783 loan to replace my aging motorcycle, which is unsafe for transporting my 5-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter to daycare. My current employer confirms my steady income, and my uncle, Mr. Rashid Khan, agrees to guarantee the loan. Though I lack a checking account, I have paid back my prior credit for a refrigerator without issue. This car will reduce transportation costs and ensure my family’s safety. I kindly ask for your trust in my reliability.  

Respectfully  
Ahmed Kamal  



Dear Loan Committee  

My name is Rajesh Patel, 26, a foreign worker in retail logistics at CityMart. I have lived in my current residence for two years and own property in my hometown. I apply for a 783 loan to purchase a van, which will allow me to take my parents, who live with me, to medical appointments and run a weekend grocery delivery side business. I have no savings account but have repaid my previous loan for work uniforms fully. My coworker, Anil Sharma, will co-sign. Though I have only worked here 18 months, I am committed to my job and family. Your support would greatly improve our quality of life.  

Yours faithfully  
Rajesh Patel  



Dear Sir or Madam  

I am Luis Fernandez, a 26-year-old agricultural worker from Spain, employed at Green Valley Farms. I have resided in my home for two years and own a plot of land in my village. I request a 783 loan to buy a pickup truck, essential for transporting crops to market and my two sons to school. My previous credit for farming equipment was repaid in full. My brother, Diego, will guarantee this loan. I have no checking account but manage my finances carefully. This vehicle will increase my earnings and stability. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling this loan as I have with all obligations.  

Sincerely  
Luis Fernandez  



Dear Bank Officer  

My name is Tarek Osman, a 26-year-old foreign worker employed as a factory assembler at Nordwerk. I have lived in my apartment for two years and own property in Egypt. I seek a 783 loan to purchase a car for my family’s safety and my job flexibility, as overtime shifts are frequent. My aunt, Fatima Hassan, agrees to act as a guarantor. Though I lack a savings account, I have paid my sole existing credit—tools for work—on time. I have no telephone, but my employer can verify my 3-year employment. This car will ensure I never miss work and can care for my two dependents. I respectfully ask for your approval.  

Yours truly  
Tarek Osman
