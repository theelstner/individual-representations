Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I hit all the details.

First, the profile has a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, with a duration of 36 months. Credit history is clean—no issues. The purpose is business-related, credit amount is 1953 DM. Savings account is under 100 DM. Employment duration is at least 7 years. The applicant is a single male, 61 years old, with one dependent, lives in a residence for free, has no other installment plans, no other debtors/guarantors, has been in the current residence for 4 years, property is unknown or none, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker. The job is in management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, or officer.

So each letter needs to reflect these specifics. Let me think of five different jobs from the profile: management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, officer, maybe another one? Wait, the job category includes management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/office. So maybe pick each of those categories as separate, but need five. Maybe split management into different roles? Or perhaps include another angle.

Wait, the user said "five motivation letters from different people with specific instances of all generic attributes." So for each letter, I need to assign a specific job from the job category. Let me list possible jobs:

1. Management: e.g., Production Manager
2. Self-employed: e.g., IT Consultant
3. Highly qualified employee: e.g., Scientific Research Assistant
4. Officer: e.g., Corporate Officer
5. Maybe another management role or another self-employed type? Or perhaps a different category? Let me check the original profile again. The job is listed as management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/office. So maybe "office" is another category? Maybe a different role like administrative officer?

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants five different roles within those categories. Let me pick five distinct jobs:

1. Production Manager (Management)
2. IT Consultant (Self-employed)
3. Scientific Research Assistant (Highly qualified employee)
4. Corporate Compliance Officer (Officer)
5. Maybe a fifth one, perhaps a Restaurant Owner (Self-employed) to vary.

Each letter needs to explain why they're applying for the loan (business purpose), their financial situation (checking account, savings, etc.), and why they're trustworthy.

Let me start with the first one: Production Manager.

He is 61, single, has a dependent, employed for 8 years (since >=7), checking account 150 DM, savings 80 DM, residence since 4 years, no property, housing for free. The loan is for business—maybe expanding his factory's machinery. He's reliable because he's been in his job for years, has a good credit history, and has a stable income.

Second, IT Consultant (self-employed). He needs funds for new software licenses or equipment. Has been self-employed for 7 years, maybe. Checking account 180 DM, savings 50 DM. Trustworthy because of consistent income and good credit.

Third, Scientific Research Assistant. Maybe applying for lab equipment. 8 years in the job, checking account 200 DM, savings 90 DM. Trustworthy due to stable employment and no credit issues.

Fourth, Corporate Compliance Officer. Needs funds for a compliance training program. Has been in the company for 7 years, checking account 120 DM, savings 70 DM. Trustworthy because of long-term employment and good financial habits.

Fifth, Restaurant Owner (self-employed). Needs a loan to renovate the kitchen. Has been in business for 9 years, checking account 190 DM, savings 60 DM. Trustworthy due to steady business and timely payments.

Each letter should mention the specific job, duration of employment (at least 7 years, so maybe 8,7,9, etc.), checking account balance between 0-200, savings under 100, residence since 4 years, age 61, single with one dependent, housing for free, etc. Also, the purpose is business-related, so each should have a specific business purpose.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long, and ends properly. Also, avoid any formatting. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all the profile attributes are included with specific numbers and roles.
