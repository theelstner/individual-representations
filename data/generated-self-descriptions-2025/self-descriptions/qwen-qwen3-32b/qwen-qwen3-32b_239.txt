Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details. 

First, the person has a checking account with less than 200 DM, has had it for 21 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is business, and the amount is 2767 DM. Savings account is between 100-500 DM. Employment duration is at least 7 years. Installment rate is 4. They are a divorced male, 61 years old, foreign worker, lives in rented housing, has a car or other property, one dependent, no telephone, and has other installment plans with the bank. Job is unskilled resident. 

Each letter needs to be from a different person with specific instances. Let me break down the generic attributes into specific ones. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "retail store supervisor" or something similar. The job is unskilled, so maybe roles like warehouse worker, janitor, etc. Let me think of five different jobs that fit "unskilled - resident." Maybe warehouse worker, cleaner, security guard, delivery helper, and maintenance worker.

Each person should explain why they need the loan for business. They need to mention their financial situation, like their savings, current employment, credit history. Also, why they're trustworthy: paying back previous loans, stable job, etc. 

Let me start with the first person. Let's pick a warehouse worker. He could want to start a small delivery service. Mention his 8 years at the same job, savings of 300 DM. He's divorced with one child. Lives in a rented apartment. Has a used car. Paid back previous loans. Installment rate is 4 DM. 

Second person: maybe a cleaner. She could want to open a small laundry service. 7 years at her job. Savings of 200 DM. Divorced, no children. Stable residence for 2 years. 

Third person: security guard. Wants to start a small event security business. 9 years in job. Savings 400 DM. Divorced, one dependent. 

Fourth: delivery helper. Wants to buy a bike for delivery business. 7 years employed. Savings 150 DM. 

Fifth: maintenance worker. Plans to repair tools and resell. 10 years at job. Savings 500 DM. 

Wait, savings must be between 100-500 DM. So fifth person's savings can't be 500 DM, it has to be under 500. Let me adjust that to 450 DM.

Each letter needs to be concise, not too long. Start with address, date, bank name, then body. Explain purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Conclude with thanks and signature.

Check for each person's specific details. Make sure each has a unique job and business idea. Also, mention the credit amount (2767 DM), duration (21 months?), but the letters should not include the numbers from the profile directly, but the person's own terms. Wait, the profile's duration is 21 months for checking account. The person's employment is >=7 years, so each person should have at least 7 years in their job. 

Also, the installment rate is 4, which might refer to the rate they can pay, but in the letters, they can mention their ability to make regular payments based on their income. 

Each person is a foreign worker, male, divorced/separated, one dependent. Housing is rent. No telephone. 

Need to ensure that each letter is distinct. Let me draft each one step by step, making sure all the points are covered without being repetitive.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, and I am a 61-year-old warehouse worker at a logistics company in Frankfurt, where I have been employed for 8 years. I am writing to request a loan of 2,767 DM to launch a small delivery service, which will operate using my existing van. My savings account holds 300 DM, and I have consistently paid back two previous loans with this bank for car repairs. Though my checking account balance is modest, I have maintained it for 21 months without overdrafts. I am divorced with one adult child who is financially independent, and I live in a rented apartment. My stable income allows me to manage a 4 DM monthly installment. I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan promptly, as it will enable me to generate additional income and strengthen my financial independence. Thank you for your consideration.
