Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile.

First, the profile details: the person is a 29-year-old single male, foreign worker, has been in their current job for at least 7 years, currently a skilled employee or official (like a scientific research assistant, maybe?), has no checking account, has a critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, wants a loan of 2743 DM for radio/television, savings less than 100 DM, no other debtors, lives in their own housing, has 2 existing credits at the bank, and has been in their residence for 2 years. They don't have a telephone.

I need to create five different people with these attributes but with specific details. Let me think of different job roles first. The profile says "skilled employee / official". Let me think of five different jobs that fit. Maybe:

1. Scientific research assistant
2. Electrician
3. IT support technician
4. Mechanical engineer
5. Public administration officer

Each of these can be specific instances of the generic "skilled employee / official". Now, for each person, I need to explain why they need the loan (radio/television), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Also, they all have a critical credit history but existing credits at the bank. Let me make sure each letter mentions their specific job, duration in job (at least 7 years), their residence duration (2 years), and their dependents (1 child). Also, they have property like a car.

Let me start with the first one. The scientific research assistant. He needs the loan for a radio/television. Maybe he wants it for his child's education, to have access to educational programs. His financial situation: he has a stable job, but his savings are low because he's been paying for his sister's medical bills. He has existing credits (maybe a car loan and a personal loan from another bank). He's been in his job for 8 years. He's a foreign worker, so maybe he mentions being in the country for several years, contributing to the community.

Second, the electrician. Maybe he needs the TV for his family, to have a better entertainment option. His financial situation: steady income, but he's been paying off a previous credit for tools. He's been living in the same residence for two years, has a car. Trustworthy because he's always paid his bills on time, even though his credit history is critical because of a past medical emergency.

Third, IT support technician. Maybe he wants to buy a TV for his child to help with homework. Financially, he's been working at the same company for 7 years, has a car, but his savings are low because he's been saving for a laptop upgrade. His credit issues stem from a previous credit card debt that he's been paying off.

Fourth, mechanical engineer. Needs the TV for his family. Financially, he's stable with a good job, but has existing loans. Maybe he's been in his job for 9 years, and his savings are low because he's been investing in courses to upgrade his skills. His credit history is critical because he had a temporary financial issue due to a car repair.

Fifth, public administration officer. Wants the TV for his family. Financial situation: steady income, but has a small savings because he's been paying alimony. He's been in his job for 7 years, has a car. His credit history is critical because of a previous loan that he took for his parents' business.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then explain the purpose, their financial situation, their job stability, residence, existing credits at the bank, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their dependents, their commitment to repay, and maybe their plans to improve their financial situation.

I need to make sure each letter is unique in the specific details but fits the profile. Also, keep them concise, not too long. Avoid formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Make sure each ends properly with a thank you and signature.

Let me check if I covered all the profile attributes in each letter. Checking account: none. Duration in months: 28 (so about 2 years, but the profile says "Duration in month:28" which is 2 years and 4 months. Wait, the profile says "Present residence since:2" which is 2 years. So each person has been in their current residence for 2 years. Also, "Duration in month:28" – maybe that refers to how long they've had their current job? Wait, no, the profile says "Duration in month:28" is separate. Wait, the original profile has:

Duration in month:28 – maybe that's the duration of the existing credits? Or maybe it's the duration of their current job? Wait, the profile says "Present employment since:.. >= 7 years", so 7 years or more. The "Duration in month:28" might be another field. Wait, maybe that's the duration of their current checking account? But the profile says "Status of existing checking account: no checking account". So maybe that 28 months is irrelevant? Or perhaps it's another field. Maybe it's the duration of their current employment? But the employment duration is >=7 years (84 months). So maybe that 28 months is another parameter, perhaps the duration of their current residence? But the profile says "Present residence since:2" (years?), so 2 years (24 months). Maybe the 28 is a typo? Or perhaps it's another field. Since the user says to invent specific instances of all generic attributes, maybe I can ignore that unless it's part of the letters. Since the letters don't need to mention that, maybe it's okay. Let me focus on the other attributes.

Each letter must include:

- Applying for a loan of 2743 DM for radio/television.

- Financial situation: savings <100 DM, critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, current employment >=7 years, no other installment plans, own housing, 1 dependent, foreign worker, no telephone.

So each letter should mention that they are a foreign worker, have been in their job for at least 7 years (specific number, like 7, 8, 9), have a car or other property, live in their own housing, have one dependent, no telephone, and savings under 100 DM.

Also, the purpose is radio/television. Maybe each person has a slightly different angle on why they need it. For example, educational content, staying informed, family entertainment, etc.

Now, let me draft each letter with these points.

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,743 DM to purchase a television for my household. As a scientific research assistant at the Institute of Environmental Studies for the past 8 years, I earn a stable monthly income of 2,200 DM. My current residence in Munich, where I have lived for 2 years, is owned by me, and I own a used car valued at 4,500 DM.  

Though my credit history includes a critical account from a prior medical emergency loan at another bank, I have consistently repaid my two existing credits here—1,800 DM for coursework and 1,200 DM for furniture—at 350 DM monthly. My savings account holds 80 DM, but I prioritize disciplined budgeting. With one dependent, I allocate 400 DM monthly to support my sister’s education in my home country. I assure timely repayment of this loan within 12 months.  

Respectfully,  
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 2,743 DM loan to acquire a radio/television to improve communication for my family. As a certified electrician employed at Urban Power Solutions for 7 years, I earn 2,000 DM monthly. I reside in my own apartment in Hamburg, having moved there 2 years ago, and own a 2015 Volkswagen Passat.  

My credit history reflects a past vehicle loan from a different bank, now 85% repaid. I currently hold two small credits here—900 DM and 600 DM—for tools, paid punctually. My savings amount to 50 DM, but I manage expenses carefully, dedicating 300 DM monthly to my 6-year-old daughter’s private schooling. As a foreign worker since 2018, I contribute to local infrastructure projects. This loan will be repaid at 230 DM monthly for 18 months.  

Thank you for your consideration.

To Whom It May Concern,  

I request a 2,743 DM loan to purchase a television for educational use, as my son requires access to language-learning programs. Working as an IT support technician at TechNova since 2019, I earn 2,100 DM monthly. I own a condominium in Berlin and a 2017 Kia Ceed, having lived at my current address for 2 years.  

My credit history includes a 2,500 DM personal loan from a non-local bank, now 70% settled. I have two existing credits here—1,000 DM and 800 DM—for software licenses, repaid without delay. My savings total 30 DM, but I allocate 250 DM monthly to a technical certification fund. With no telephone expenses and a stable job, I propose a 200 DM monthly installment for 16 months.  

Gratefully,  
[Your Name]

Dear [Bank Name] Team,  

I am applying for a 2,743 DM loan to buy a television, essential for staying informed about global market trends critical to my work. As a mechanical engineer at AutoTech since 2016, I earn 2,300 DM monthly. I own a home in Bremen and a 2013 BMW 3 Series, and have resided at my current address for 2 years.  

My credit history includes a 3,000 DM equipment loan from another bank, 90% repaid. I currently manage two small credits here—1,500 DM and 700 DM—for workshop upgrades, paid reliably. My savings account holds 20 DM, but I reinvest 400 DM monthly into professional development courses. As a foreign worker since 2015, I am committed to repaying this loan at 250 DM monthly for 14 months.  

Sincerely,

To the Loan Committee,  

I need a 2,743 DM loan for a television to provide my daughter with access to cultural programming. As a public administration officer at the City of Dresden since 2017, I earn 2,250 DM monthly. I own a detached house and a 2016 Renault Clio, living at my current residence for 2 years.  

My credit history includes a 4,000 DM home repair loan from another institution, now 80% cleared. I have two active credits here—1,200 DM and 900 DM—for municipal training, repaid on time. With savings of 90 DM and no telephone expenses, I budget 350 DM monthly toward my parents’ healthcare abroad. I pledge to repay this loan at 220 DM monthly for 15 months.  

Thank you for your trust.
