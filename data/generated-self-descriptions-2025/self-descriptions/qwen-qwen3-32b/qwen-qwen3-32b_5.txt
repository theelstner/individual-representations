Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account status of less than 0 DM, which means the person might be in debt. The duration of the checking account is 42 months, so about 3.5 years. Credit history is good—existing credits paid back duly. The purpose of the loan is furniture or equipment. The amount is 7882 DM. Savings account is less than 100 DM. Present employment since 4 to 7 years—so between 4 and 7 years. Installment rate is 2, which I think refers to the monthly payment they can handle. Personal status is single male. Other debtors or guarantors: there's a guarantor. Present residence since 4 years. Property: building society savings agreement or life insurance. Age 45. No other installment plans. Housing is for free, meaning maybe they live with someone else or it's provided. Number of existing credits at the bank is 1. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 2. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

Now, I need to create five different people with these attributes. Let me think of different scenarios where someone might need a loan for furniture/equipment. Maybe a scientific research assistant, a teacher, an IT technician, a nurse, and a civil servant. Each should have unique specifics but fit the profile.

For each letter, I need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They all have a guarantor, so I should mention that. Also, they have a good credit history, so that's a point to highlight. Their savings are low, but they have a building society savings agreement. They've been employed for 4-7 years, so maybe different jobs in different fields. Since they're foreign workers, maybe they came from different countries.

Let me start with the first one: a scientific research assistant. He's been working at a university for 6 years. Needs furniture for a new lab. Guarantor is his sister. He's 45, single with two dependents. Lives with a roommate, hence housing for free. Has a building society agreement. No telephone—maybe he uses a mobile phone, but the profile says none, so maybe he doesn't have a landline.

Second, a teacher. Let's say he's been teaching at a secondary school for 5 years. Needs classroom equipment. Guarantor could be a colleague. Same structure.

Third, IT technician. Worked at a company for 4 years. Needs equipment for home office. Guarantor is a friend.

Fourth, nurse. Worked at a clinic for 6 years. Needs furniture for a home office. Guarantor is a cousin.

Fifth, civil servant. Worked in local government for 5 years. Needs furniture for a new apartment. Guarantor is a brother.

Each letter should mention their specific job, duration, guarantor, dependents, residence, and how they'll repay. Make sure the loan purpose is clear. Also, mention the existing credit paid back, which shows reliability. Since their checking account is negative, maybe they mention a temporary setback but show they can manage payments with the guarantor's support.

I need to keep each letter concise, around a paragraph each. Start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then the body explaining their situation, purpose, ability to repay, guarantor, and a polite closing. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Make sure each letter is unique in details but fits the profile parameters.
