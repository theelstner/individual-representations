Okay, I need to create five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile includes a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The person has had their checking account for 24 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is radio/television, credit amount 1938 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Present employment for less than a year. Installment rate 4. Male, divorced or separated. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 3 months. Property is a building society savings agreement or life insurance. Age 32. No other installment plans. Housing is own. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each letter needs to reflect these specifics but with invented instances. Let me think of different scenarios for five different people. They all need to explain why they need the loan (radio/television), their financial situation (negative checking account, low savings, recent job, etc.), and why they're trustworthy (good credit history, existing credit paid back, etc.).

First person: Maybe a scientific research assistant. Let's say he's 32, divorced, has a dependent child. He moved to the country 3 months ago, has a job as a skilled employee but has been there less than a year. His checking account is negative because he's saving up for the TV to improve his living conditions. He has a building society savings plan. He's a foreign worker. He can mention that despite recent employment, he's responsible with past credits.

Second person: Maybe a technical draftsman. Also 32, separated, living in own housing. He has an existing credit paid back, needs the loan for a radio/TV. His savings are low because he's using them for his daughter's education. He's a foreign worker, has been in the current residence for 3 months. Emphasize timely payments on existing credit.

Third person: A public administration official. Maybe he's from another country, works in local government. Needs the loan for a TV to stay informed. His checking account is negative due to recent relocation costs. He has a life insurance policy as property. No other debts, and he's committed to paying back.

Fourth person: An electrician. Divorced, has a child. Works as a skilled employee, moved to the area 3 months ago. Needs the TV for educational purposes. His savings are low but he's repaid previous loans. He's a foreign worker, lives in his own home.

Fifth person: A mechanical engineer. Recently employed, checking account in negative due to medical bills for his dependent. Needs the TV for staying connected. Has a building society agreement. Emphasizes responsibility despite current financial hiccups.

Each letter should start with their name and address, date, bank's address. Then a subject line. The body should explain their purpose, financial situation, and trustworthiness. End with a polite thank you and signature.

Need to make sure each letter is unique in their specific job, reason for loan, and personal circumstances. Avoid repetition. Also, use the exact numbers: 32 years old, 3 months residence, 1 dependent, etc. Also mention the existing credit at the bank paid back duly. Each should mention the negative checking account and low savings but explain why, and how they can repay.

Check that each letter doesn't have formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Keep them concise, maybe 3-4 paragraphs each. Make sure the purpose is radio/television but vary the reason slightly (entertainment, educational, staying informed, etc.)

Let me start drafting each one with these points in mind.

Subject: Loan Application for Radio/Television Purchase  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,938 DM to purchase a television set. As a 32-year-old scientific research assistant at the City Institute for Environmental Studies, I have been employed for 8 months and earn a stable monthly income of 2,400 DM. My checking account currently shows a small deficit due to recent unexpected medical expenses for my 5-year-old daughter, whom I support as a single parent. However, I have consistently repaid my existing car loan (1,200 DM) with this bank over the past 18 months without delay.  

I reside in my own apartment in Munich, where I have lived for 3 months since relocating from Poland as a foreign worker. My financial situation is further supported by a building society savings agreement worth 800 DM, which I contribute to monthly. While my savings account holds only 80 DM currently due to relocation costs, I am committed to fulfilling this new installment of 4 DM per month, aligning with my punctual repayment history.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide additional documentation if needed.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Subject: Request for Loan to Purchase Television  

Dear Bank Manager,  

I am applying for a 1,938 DM loan to acquire a television for my household. At 32 years old, I work as a technical draftsman at a construction firm in Hamburg, a position I’ve held for 11 months. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 150 DM due to urgent home repairs last month. Despite this, I have maintained a flawless repayment record for my existing 500 DM credit with your bank, taken out to cover my daughter’s school fees.  

I have lived in my current apartment for 3 months and own it outright. As a divorced father of one, I prioritize financial responsibility. My savings account contains 50 DM, as most of my income goes toward childcare and groceries. However, my stable employment and monthly income of 2,700 DM ensure I can manage the 4 DM installment. My life insurance policy, valued at 1,200 DM, further demonstrates my long-term financial planning.  

I kindly request your approval and am prepared to discuss this further.  

Yours faithfully,  
[Your Name]

Subject: Loan Application for Radio/Television  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am a 32-year-old public administration official at the local government office in Bremen, employed for 10 months. My monthly salary of 2,500 DM is sufficient to cover my expenses, but my checking account is currently negative by 200 DM due to my recent relocation from Romania. I need a television to stay informed about global news, which is critical for my work and personal development.  

I have no other debts aside from the 1,938 DM loan I request, as my existing credit for a laptop (paid off in full) was also with this bank. My savings account holds 30 DM, as I have prioritized settling into my new residence (3 months here). I own my home and hold a building society savings agreement worth 900 DM. My commitment to repaying obligations is proven by my timely payments on all past credits.  

Thank you for your trust in my reliability.  

Best regards,

Subject: Request for Loan to Purchase Television  

Dear Bank Officer,  

I am writing to request a 1,938 DM loan for a television. At 32, I work as an electrician in Frankfurt, employed for 9 months. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 100 DM due to my son’s extracurricular activities, which I fund as a single parent. My monthly income is 2,600 DM, and I have no other installment plans.  

I have resided in my own home for 3 months, having moved from Greece as a foreign worker. My savings account contains 20 DM, as I recently paid for my daughter’s medical checkups. I am confident in repaying the 4 DM monthly installment, given my stable job and history of repaying my existing 800 DM loan with your bank. My life insurance policy, valued at 1,500 DM, further secures my financial stability.  

I appreciate your consideration and welcome any questions.  

Sincerely,

Subject: Application for Television Purchase Loan  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

As a 32-year-old mechanical engineer at a manufacturing firm in Stuttgart, I have been employed for 11 months and earn 2,800 DM monthly. I am applying for a 1,938 DM loan to purchase a television, as my current checking account is negative by 180 DM due to my mother’s temporary stay with me. I am divorced and have one dependent child.  

My savings account holds 50 DM, as most of my income covers household expenses. I have lived in my own home for 3 months, having relocated from Portugal. My financial responsibility is evidenced by my timely repayment of a prior 1,000 DM credit with this bank. I also maintain a building society savings agreement worth 1,000 DM. The requested installment of 4 DM is feasible with my current income.  

Thank you for your understanding. I look forward to your response.  

Yours truly,
