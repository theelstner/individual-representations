Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the details correctly.

First, the profile has several key points: existing checking account with less than 200 DM, duration of 24 months. Credit history is good, existing credits paid back. Purpose is a used car, credit amount 4113 DM. Savings account between 500-1000 DM. Present employment less than a year. Installment rate 3. Female, divorced/separated/married, no other debtors. Residence since 4 years, property is car or other. Age 28, no other installment plans, housing is rent. One existing credit at the bank, job is skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be unique but adhere to these parameters. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different job roles, reasons for needing the car, and personal situations. For example, one could be a nurse, another a teacher's assistant, maybe an office clerk, a lab technician, and a social worker. Each has a different reason for needing the car, like commuting to work, transporting dependents, job requirements, etc.

I need to make sure each letter includes the financial situation: checking account balance, savings, employment duration, credit history. Also, mention the purpose of the loan, why they need the car, and their ability to repay. Since they have an existing credit at the bank, maybe they have a good relationship. Also, note that they are a foreign worker, which might affect their stability. Each letter should be concise, not too long, and end properly.

Let me start with the first one. Let's pick a nurse. She's been working as a nurse's assistant for 8 years but recently moved to a new city and has been employed there for less than a year. She needs a car to commute since public transport is unreliable. She has savings of 750 DM. She's divorced with a child. She mentions her existing credit (maybe a previous loan for something else) paid back on time. She's a foreign worker, so maybe she emphasizes her stable job and commitment.

Second, a teacher's assistant. Maybe she's working part-time and needs a car to reach different schools. She has savings of 600 DM. She's married, separated, living with her child. She's been in her current residence for 4 years. She mentions her job stability and the necessity of the car for her work.

Third, an office clerk. She works in administrative support and needs a car for daily commute. She has 500 DM in savings. Maybe she's a foreign worker who has been in the country for a while, shows good credit history, and has a dependent. She emphasizes her ability to manage finances and the car's role in maintaining her job.

Fourth, a scientific research assistant. She needs a car to travel between lab sites. She's been employed at her current job for 11 months. She has savings of 900 DM. She's married, separated, with a child. She highlights her professional background and the importance of the car for her work efficiency.

Fifth, a social worker. She needs a car to visit clients. She's been working in the field for 8 years but recently changed jobs, hence less than a year in current employment. She has savings of 800 DM. She's divorced, has one dependent. She mentions her dedication to her job and how the car is essential for her role.

I need to ensure each letter includes specific numbers: checking account less than 200 DM, savings between 500-1000, age 28, residence since 4 years, etc. Also, each letter should not use generic terms but specific instances. Avoid formatting, keep them short, and end properly with a thank you and signature.

Let me check each letter for these points. Make sure the employment duration is under a year, mention the existing credit paid back, the purpose of the loan, financial status, and trustworthiness. Also, note the foreign worker aspect, maybe mention being in the country for a certain time or having stable employment despite recent job changes.

Now, write each letter with these details, varying the scenarios but keeping all parameters consistent with the profile. Use different names and professions each time. Make sure the tone is formal but personal, explaining the need clearly and confidently.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Amina K. and I am a nurse’s assistant at St. Clara Hospital, where I have worked for eight years. I recently relocated to this city for a better opportunity and have been employed at a new clinic for seven months. I need a reliable used car to commute daily, as public transport here is inconsistent. My current checking account balance is 150 DM, but I maintain a savings account with 750 DM. I have always repaid my previous credit for medical equipment on time, and I currently have no other debts. As a foreign worker, I value stability and have lived here for four years. Supporting my young daughter is my priority, and this car will ensure I keep my job. I kindly request your approval for this loan.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Amina K.
