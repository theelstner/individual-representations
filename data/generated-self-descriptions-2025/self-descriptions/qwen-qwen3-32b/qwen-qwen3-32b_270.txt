Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The duration is 14 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is a new car, credit amount 8978 DM. Savings account is under 100 DM. Employment since at least 7 years. Divorced male with one dependent. Own housing, no other installment plans. Job in management/self-employed/highly qualified. Residence since 4 years. Property is building society savings or life insurance. Has a phone, foreign worker registered.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of different jobs within the job category. The profile says "management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/ officer." So maybe:

1. Management: Let's say a project manager.
2. Self-employed: Maybe a consultant.
3. Highly qualified employee: Scientific research assistant as mentioned in the example.
4. Officer: Maybe a public sector officer, like a municipal planner.
5. Another management role but different, like a retail store manager.

Now, each person needs specific details. For example, the scientific research assistant has 8 years of experience. Let me assign different durations (but at least 7 years). Also, different reasons for the car loan. Maybe commuting to work, business purposes, family needs, etc.

Financial situation: Each has a negative checking account but paid back credits. Savings under 100 DM. Need to explain their financial situation briefly. Trustworthiness: Emphasize credit history, stable job, residence, etc.

Let me outline each letter:

1. Project Manager: Maybe works in construction, needs a car for client visits. 8 years at current job. Divorced with one child. Lives in own home. Paid back previous loan. Requesting 8978 DM.

2. Consultant: Self-employed IT consultant needing a car for client meetings. 7.5 years in business. Similar dependents and residence.

3. Research Assistant: As example, but need to adjust. Maybe 8 years in a lab, need reliable transport for early morning shifts and family.

4. Municipal Planner: Public sector, needs car for site visits. 9 years employed. Divorced, one child. Stable income.

5. Retail Store Manager: Manages a chain store, requires car for inventory and store visits. 7 years in position. Owns home, stable.

Each letter should start with sender's info, date, bank address, subject. Then explain purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Conclude with thanks and signature.

Need to make sure each has unique specifics. Avoid generic terms. Use exact numbers where possible. Also, check that each letter is concise but covers all points. No formatting, just plain text with line breaks.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they don't repeat the same scenarios and have distinct professions and reasons.

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 8,978 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a project manager in the construction industry with eight years of experience at my current employer, I require reliable transportation to visit client sites and coordinate logistics. My current checking account balance is temporarily negative due to recent equipment repairs, but I have consistently paid all prior credits in full, including a 2019 loan for professional tools.  

I reside in my own home and have lived at my current address for four years. Though my savings account holds less than 100 DM, my stable income (1,800 DM monthly) allows me to manage expenses responsibly. I am divorced, with one dependent child, and I prioritize financial obligations diligently. My job offers long-term security, and I am confident in repaying the loan through my existing employment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing this further.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 8,978 DM loan to replace my aging car, which is essential for my work as a self-employed IT consultant. With 7.5 years in business, I service clients across the region, and a new vehicle will improve my ability to meet deadlines. My current account balance is temporarily negative due to seasonal fluctuations, but I have maintained a flawless credit history, including repaying a 2020 marketing loan.  

I own my home and have resided at my address since 2019. My savings account is small (80 DM), but my average monthly income is 2,100 DM, with no other debts. As a registered foreign worker with a local phone line, I am committed to fulfilling repayment terms. This loan will directly support my business growth and client satisfaction.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
[Your Name]

To the Loan Committee of [Bank Name],  

I am a scientific research assistant at the [Institute Name], employed for eight years, applying for a car loan to commute between my lab and a secondary part-time role. My current account balance is -150 DM due to unexpected medical expenses, but I have no delinquencies on my existing credit. My savings account holds 50 DM, yet my monthly salary of 1,950 DM ensures repayment capacity.  

I am divorced, with one child, and reside in my own housing. My job provides long-term stability, and my employer values my contributions to ongoing climate research projects. A reliable vehicle is critical for my early-morning lab shifts and family responsibilities. I assure you of punctual payments, as demonstrated by my 2018 equipment loan repayment.  

Thank you for your understanding and support.  

Yours faithfully,  
[Your Name]

Dear [Bank Name] Team,  

As a municipal planner with the [City Name] Development Office, I require a new car to conduct site inspections and attend zoning meetings. With nine years of service, my role demands frequent travel, and my current vehicle is no longer roadworthy. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 200 DM due to recent home maintenance, but I have paid all prior loans—such as a 2021 loan for professional certification—without issue.  

I own my home and have lived at my current address since 2020. My monthly income is 2,050 DM, with no additional debts. I am divorced, supporting one child, and take pride in my financial discipline. This loan aligns with my stable career and commitment to public service.  

I appreciate your consideration and am available for further discussion.  

Kind regards,  
[Your Name]

To Whom It May Concern,  

I am a retail store manager at [Company Name], overseeing inventory and operations for three locations.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am eager to discuss next steps.
