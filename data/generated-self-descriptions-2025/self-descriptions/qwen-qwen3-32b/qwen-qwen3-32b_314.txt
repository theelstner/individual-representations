Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with at least 200 DM and salary assignments for at least one year. The loan duration is 24 months, credit history shows existing credits paid back, purpose is furniture/equipment, amount 3749 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Present employment less than a year, installment rate 2. Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors. Residence since 4 years, property is car or other. Age 26, no other installment plans, housing is own, one existing credit at the bank, job is skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

I need to create five different people with specific instances. Let me think of different professions for the job: maybe a scientific research assistant, a nurse, a teacher, a mechanic, and an office administrator. Each should have unique scenarios.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let me start with the first one.

First person: Scientific research assistant. She's 26, divorced, has a child. Worked at a university for 8 months. Owns a car. Needs furniture for a new apartment. Paid back previous loans. Stable income. No savings. Maybe mention her stable job and existing credit at the bank.

Second person: Nurse. Maybe she's married, separated, living in own housing. Worked at a clinic for 11 months. Needs to buy equipment for home office. Trustworthy because of her stable job and credit history.

Third person: Teacher. Married, one dependent. Worked as a primary school teacher for 9 months. Needs furniture for a new classroom. She has a car, owns her home, and has a good track record with previous loans.

Fourth person: Mechanic. Divorced, one child. Worked at an auto repair shop for 10 months. Needs tools for her business. Owns a car, stable income, and has been paying back existing credit.

Fifth person: Office administrator. Separated, one dependent. Worked for a government office for 6 months. Needs to furnish her home. She has a car, owns her house, and has a good job.

Each letter should be concise, mention specific details from the profile, avoid generic terms. Make sure each has a unique profession and specific instances. Check for the required elements: purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Also, ensure that each letter ends properly without formatting.

Let me draft each one step by step, making sure to include all necessary details and vary the scenarios appropriately.

Dear Sir or Madam  
I am writing to request a loan of 3749 DM to purchase furniture for my new apartment. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, I have been employed for 8 months and earn a stable salary of 2400 DM per month. Though I have only been in this role since January 2023, I have consistently paid back my previous student loan in full and on time. I have lived at my current residence for 4 years and own a car as collateral. My husband and I separated last year, and I now care for our 3-year-old daughter alone. I currently hold one existing credit with your bank for a laptop, which I am repaying without issue. I assure you my income and disciplined financial habits make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Anika Müller

Dear Bank Manager  
I seek a 3749 DM loan to equip my home office as a freelance nurse. I have worked at the Düsseldorf Clinic since September 2022, earning 2200 DM monthly, and my employer has confirmed my continued employment. I am separated from my husband but co-parent our son, who lives with me. Though my savings account holds only 80 DM, I have no other debts and have fully repaid a prior 1500 DM loan with your bank for medical supplies. I own a car and reside in my own apartment, which I have occupied for 4 years. My stable income and commitment to timely repayments ensure I can manage this loan responsibly. I appreciate your trust in my application.  

Respectfully

Dear Sir or Madam  
I am applying for a 3749 DM loan to furnish a classroom for my tutoring business. As a primary school teacher at Berlin’s Karlstraße School, I have been employed for 9 months, earning 2500 DM per month. My current residence, where I live with my husband and 5-year-old son, has been my home for 4 years. I own a used car and have no other debts. While my savings account contains 50 DM, I have consistently repaid my existing 2000 DM loan for teaching materials. My employer values my dedication, and I am confident in my ability to meet installment payments. Thank you for your consideration of this request.  

Yours faithfully

Dear Bank Representative  
I require a 3749 DM loan to purchase specialized tools for my auto repair business. I have worked at AutoTech GmbH in Hamburg since March 2023, earning 2300 DM monthly. I am divorced and care for my 8-year-old daughter alone. Though I have been employed for 10 months, my prior experience as a mechanic ensures my income stability.

I assure you my financial discipline and steady earnings will allow me to fulfill this loan obligation. Thank you for your time.
