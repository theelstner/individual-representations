Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the points.

First, the profile has several key elements: the person has a checking account with less than 0 DM, has had it for 6 months. Their credit history is critical with other credits existing not at this bank. The loan purpose is a new car, amount 860 DM. Savings account is under 100 DM. They've been employed for at least 7 years, are a female (divorced/separated/married), no other debtors/guarantors, residence since 4 years, no property, age 39, no other installment plans, housing is own, 2 existing credits at this bank, job is skilled employee/official, 1 dependent, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

I need to create five different people. Each should have unique specifics. Let me think of different jobs that fit "skilled employee/official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, a nurse, a teacher, an office manager, and a social worker. Each will have different reasons for needing the car. Let me assign each a unique job and scenario.

First person: Scientific research assistant. She needs a car for commuting to a lab. She has been working there for 8 years. Maybe she mentions her stable job and existing credits (perhaps a mortgage and a personal loan). She needs the car to continue her work, especially since she has a dependent. She emphasizes her steady income and responsibility.

Second person: Nurse. She works night shifts and needs a reliable car for her schedule. She's been in her job for 7 years. Existing credits could be student loans. She mentions her residence stability (4 years in current home) and her need for the car to transport her child. Her savings are low because she's been saving for the car.

Third person: Teacher. She's a part-time teacher, has been teaching for 9 years. Existing credits could be a previous car loan. She needs a new car for transporting students on field trips. She mentions her stable employment and how the car will help her career. She also has a dependent and is responsible with her finances.

Fourth person: Office manager. She manages a local business, employed for 7 years. Existing credits are a business loan. She needs a car for client meetings. She highlights her role in the company and her ability to manage finances, showing trustworthiness.

Fifth person: Social worker. She works with a non-profit, has been there 10 years. Needs a car to visit clients. Existing credits could be a student loan. She emphasizes her community work and how the car is essential for her job, ensuring she can support her dependent.

Now, I need to make sure each letter includes all the required elements: checking account status, duration, credit history, purpose, amount, savings, employment duration, personal status, residence, property, age, dependents, housing, existing credits, job, and telephone. Each letter should be concise, not cut off, and properly end. Avoid formatting, just plain text.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one, ensuring the specifics are there and the person's situation is unique yet fits the profile. I need to vary the reasons for the car loan and the job roles, while keeping the financial situation consistent as per the profile.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Anna Müller and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin. I have been employed there for 8 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. I am applying for a loan of 860 DM to purchase a new car which is necessary for my daily commute to the laboratory where I work. I currently have a critical credit history due to a previous loan for medical expenses but have been making timely payments for the past 18 months. I reside in my own home and have lived at my current address for 4 years. I am a divorced mother of one and have no other debts. I believe my long-term employment and responsible financial habits make me a trustworthy candidate. I would be grateful for the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability.  

Sincerely  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Committee  

I am Sabine Fischer a nurse at the Dresden Regional Hospital. I have worked in this role for 7 years and earn 2,600 DM per month. I need a new car to ensure I can reliably attend night shifts and transport my 6-year-old daughter to school. My current checking account is in a transitional phase with a short 6-month history but I maintain a good savings discipline despite my account balance being under 100 DM. I already have a student loan repayment of 150 DM monthly and two existing small loans with this bank for medical equipment. I own my apartment and have lived there for 4 years. As a single parent I prioritize financial responsibility and would use this loan to secure my family’s stability.  

Respectfully  
Sabine Fischer

My employer values my punctuality and I am committed to repaying this loan in full to improve my creditworthiness.
