Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me note them down:

- No checking account
- Duration in month: 11 months (so they've been at their current job for 11 months)
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly till now
- Purpose: business
- Credit amount: 2142 (probably DM)
- Savings account/bonds: >=1000 DM
- Present employment since: >=7 years (so they've been employed for at least 7 years, but current job is 11 months? Maybe they changed jobs recently)
- Installment rate: 1 (maybe 1% or 1 unit, but not sure, maybe just mention the rate)
- Personal status: male, divorced/separated
- Other debtors/guarantors: none
- Present residence since: 2 years
- Property: real estate
- Age: 28
- Other installment plans: none
- Housing: own
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 1
- Job: skilled employee / official
- Dependents: 1
- Telephone: yes
- Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name

Now, each letter needs to be from a different person. They should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. I need to invent specific instances for generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "scientific research assistant," etc.

Let me think of five different jobs that fit "skilled employee / official." Maybe:

1. Scientific Research Assistant
2. Municipal Administrative Officer
3. Electrical Engineer
4. IT Systems Administrator
5. Public School Teacher

Each person will have their own business purpose. Let me think of different business ideas. Since the credit amount is 2142 DM, which isn't huge, maybe small business ventures:

1. Starting a small tech consultancy
2. Opening a specialty coffee shop
3. Purchasing equipment for a repair service
4. Launching an online retail store
5. Expanding a freelance graphic design business

Each letter should mention their savings, existing credit history, stable employment, ownership of real estate, etc. Also, they need to explain why they're trustworthy—reliable payments, savings as collateral, etc.

Let me start drafting the first one.

First person: Scientific Research Assistant applying for a tech consultancy. He's 28, divorced, lives in his own house, has savings, stable job for 7 years (but current job 11 months, maybe a recent promotion or job change). Existing credit paid back. Needs funds for equipment. Has a dependent child.

Second: Municipal Administrative Officer wants to open a coffee shop. Maybe he's been in his current job 11 months after 7+ years of employment elsewhere. Uses savings as down payment, needs loan for renovation. Trustworthy because of credit history and real estate.

Third: Electrical Engineer needs to buy tools for a repair business. He has real estate, savings, and a dependent. Emphasize prompt payments on existing credit.

Fourth: IT Systems Administrator wants to start an online store. Highlights stable income, existing credit managed well, and ownership of property.

Fifth: Public School Teacher looking to expand freelance work. Maybe needs funds for software and marketing. Uses savings as collateral, shows responsibility.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, includes all required elements, and ends properly. Also, avoid formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Let me check each attribute is covered in each letter.

Each letter should mention:

- Purpose of loan (specific business)
- Financial situation: savings, employment duration, existing credits paid, real estate, housing, dependents
- Trustworthiness: credit history, savings, stable job, etc.

Also, note that they don't have a checking account, but have a savings account. Maybe mention that they manage finances through savings account.

Also, foreign worker registered under their name—maybe they're a registered foreign worker, which could indicate legal status and stability.

Let me start writing each letter one by one, making sure to vary the specifics and include all required elements without being repetitive.

Dear Bank Loan Committee  

My name is Lars Müller, 28, a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin with 8 years of professional experience. I am applying for a loan of 2142 DM to purchase laboratory equipment for my independent consultancy in biotechnology. I have held this position for 11 months after previously working as a lab technician, and I have consistently repaid all prior credits, including a small equipment loan from this bank two years ago. I own a residence in Berlin and maintain a savings account with 1200 DM. Though I currently do not have a checking account, my salary is directly deposited, and I have no other installment plans. As a divorced father of one, I prioritize financial stability. My registered foreign worker status and real estate ownership further attest to my reliability. I kindly request your approval based on my proven responsibility and growing professional opportunities.  

Sincerely  
Lars Müller
