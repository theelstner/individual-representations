Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

The profile says the person is a foreign worker, male, single, 26 years old, has been in their current job for 1 to 4 years, specifically a skilled employee or official. They don't have a checking account, have a savings account under 100 DM, existing credit paid back, applying for a new car loan of 3518 DM, with a guarantor, living in rented housing, and has a building society savings agreement or life insurance. They have no other installment plans, no telephone, and one existing credit at the bank.

First, I need to create five different people. Let me think of different job roles under "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a nurse, an IT technician, and a teacher. Each should have specific details. Let me check the original example given: "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee". So each letter should have a specific job.

Each letter must explain why they need the loan (car for work commute, maybe?), their financial situation (current job duration, savings, existing credit history), and why they're trustworthy (guarantor, paid back previous credits, etc.).

Let me start with the first person. Let's say a scientific research assistant. He's been working at a university for 2.5 years. Needs a car to commute longer distances. Has a guarantor, maybe a relative. His savings are low because he's been saving for the car. He mentions his previous credit for a laptop was paid back. He's a foreign worker, so maybe he mentions his work visa or employment stability.

Second person: Automotive mechanic. Worked at a garage for 3 years. Needs a car for work (maybe delivering parts or customer transport). Guarantor is his brother. Has a building society savings plan. No checking account but manages through cash. Paid back a previous tool loan.

Third: Nurse. Worked in a clinic for 1.5 years. Needs a reliable car for night shifts and dependents. Guarantor is a cousin. Has life insurance. Previous medical equipment loan paid back.

Fourth: IT technician. Worked for a company for 3.5 years. Needs a car for client visits. Guarantor is a friend. Savings account small because saving for emergency. Paid back a laptop loan.

Fifth: Teacher in a private school. Employed for 2 years. Needs a car for commuting and dependents. Guarantor is a sibling. Has a savings agreement. Paid back a previous credit.

Each letter should be concise, no formatting. Start with address, date, bank name, then body. Make sure each has specific numbers: age 26, job duration between 1-4 years, etc. Also mention the loan amount 3518 DM, purpose new car, and other details from the profile.

Check for each letter: no checking account, savings <100 DM, guarantor, existing credit paid back, foreign worker, etc. Avoid generic terms, use specifics. Make sure each person's situation is unique but fits the profile. Also, end each letter properly with a closing.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered without repetition. Need to vary the reasons for the car (commute, work necessity, dependents, etc.), different guarantors, different jobs. Also, maybe different aspects of their financial situation. Each should highlight trustworthiness through their credit history and guarantor.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Luis Alvarez and I am a scientific research assistant at the City University working on renewable energy projects for the past 2 years and 8 months. I am applying for a loan of 3518 DM to purchase a new car which is essential for my daily commute between my residence in the outskirts and the campus 45 minutes away.  

As a foreign worker on a renewable energy scholarship I have maintained a stable income and have consistently repaid my previous credit for laboratory equipment totaling 2500 DM over 12 months. Though I do not currently hold a checking account I have maintained a savings account with 85 DM to demonstrate my commitment to financial responsibility. My cousin Maria Ruiz serves as guarantor for this loan and has a strong financial history of her own.  

I reside in a rented apartment in the same neighborhood for the past 3 years and have a building society savings agreement active for 26 months. With only 1 existing credit at your bank and no other installment obligations I believe my disciplined approach to finances and the support of my guarantor make me a reliable candidate. This car will significantly improve my work efficiency and punctuality.  

Sincerely  
Luis Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am writing as Ahmed Khan a certified automotive mechanic employed at Speedy Wheels Garage for the past 3 years. I require 3518 DM for a new vehicle to transport repair parts between our two service locations.  

Having migrated from Pakistan 18 months ago I have built a stable career in this field while maintaining flawless repayment of my initial 2000 DM tool purchase credit. Though my savings account holds only 60 DM I have consistently managed my finances through cash transactions and maintain a life insurance policy through the National Building Society.  

My brother Irfan Khan serves as guarantor for this loan and has agreed to assume responsibility should unforeseen circumstances arise. I currently rent an apartment in the industrial district where I have lived for 3 years and have no other installment obligations. With my monthly income covering both living expenses and the proposed 2 DM installment rate I am confident in my ability to repay this loan promptly.  

Respectfully  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir or Madam  

As a registered nurse at Greenfield Clinic for the past 1 year and 10 months I need reliable transportation to manage my rotating night shifts. This loan of 3518 DM will cover a new car essential for safely transporting my 2-year-old daughter and myself between our home and workplace.  

Though I do not yet have a checking account I have maintained 45 DM in savings and have fully repaid my 1800 DM medical certification loan over 9 months. My uncle Dr Hassan Patel serves as guarantor and has confirmed his willingness to support this application.  

Having lived in my current rental apartment for 3 years and holding a building society savings agreement since employment began I believe my stable nursing position and responsible financial history demonstrate my reliability. With no other debts or installment plans I can comfortably manage the proposed repayment schedule.  

Sincerely  
Amina Patel

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am a senior IT technician at TechNova Solutions employed for 3 years and 6 months. This loan request for 3518 DM aims to replace my aging vehicle needed for client site visits across the region.  

As a foreign worker from Vietnam I have built a stable career here while meticulously repaying my prior 3000 DM laptop purchase credit over 14 months. Though my savings account contains only 30 DM I have demonstrated financial discipline through budgeting and maintain a life insurance policy through the National Building Society.  

My colleague Mark Johnson serves as guarantor for this loan and has agreed to assume responsibility if necessary. I reside in a rented property in the tech district for the past 3 years with no other installment obligations. The proposed 2 DM installment aligns comfortably with my monthly income after providing for my 1 dependent.

Dear Sir or Madam  

As an English teacher at Horizon Private School employed for 2 years I require a new car to commute 50 minutes daily between my home and school. This loan of 3518 DM will secure reliable transportation for both my work and family needs.  

Having migrated from Colombia 14 months ago I have maintained perfect credit repayment on my initial 2200 DM classroom equipment loan. Though I keep only 25 DM in savings I have avoided unnecessary expenses to prepare for this vehicle purchase. My sister Laura Mendez serves as guarantor and has a strong employment history as a school administrator.  

I have resided in my current rental apartment for 3 years and hold a building society savings agreement active for 25 months. With no other debts or installment plans and a stable teaching position I am confident in my ability to meet repayment terms promptly.
