Okay, I need to create five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the profile attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the key points.

First, the profile includes a foreign worker who is a skilled employee or official, aged 31, single with one dependent. They have been in their current job for 4-7 years, specifically 4 years in this case. They don't have a checking account, have a critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, and want a car loan of 2775 DM. They have less than 100 DM in savings, own their home, have a building society savings agreement or life insurance, and no telephone. They also have other installment plans with the bank and have two existing credits at this bank. They've been in their current residence for 2 years.

Now, for each letter, I need to vary the specifics. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different job roles, reasons for the loan, and how they address their credit history. Let me brainstorm:

1. Scientific Research Assistant: Applying for a car to commute to work. Emphasize stable employment and existing credits as proof of reliability.

2. Municipal Official: Needs a car for work-related travel. Highlight residence stability and property ownership.

3. IT Support Specialist: Car for family needs. Mention dependents and how the loan will help support the family.

4. Electrician: Vehicle for job requirements. Stress the importance of the car for work and existing savings plan.

5. Public Transport Scheduler: Car for flexibility. Address past financial issues and steps taken to improve.

Each letter needs to be concise, include specific numbers, and explain trustworthiness. Make sure not to use formatting and end each properly. Let me check if I covered all profile attributes in each letter. Also, ensure that each person's situation is unique but fits the profile. Avoid generic terms, use specific job titles and durations. Let me draft each one step by step, making sure to include all required elements without being too verbose.

Dear Bank Loan Committee  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, 31, a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin. I have worked in this role for 6 years, earning a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. I am applying for a 2,775 DM loan to purchase a used car, as my current public transport costs consume 150 DM monthly. I have no checking account but maintain a building society savings agreement worth 1,200 DM. Though I have a critical credit history from a previous utility loan, I have consistently paid my two existing credits at this bank (a 500 DM appliance loan and a 300 DM tool loan) without default. I reside in my own apartment in Neukölln for 2 years and support my 6-year-old son. I assure you my disciplined budget and 4-year employment stability make me a reliable candidate.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Mohamed

Dear Loan Committee  

I am Karim El-Sayed, 31, a municipal official in Frankfurt responsible for urban planning. I have held this position for 5 years, with a monthly salary of 3,100 DM. I seek a 2,775 DM loan to replace my aging car, which is essential for visiting construction sites. I own my home in Offenbach and hold a life insurance policy valued at 900 DM. While I lack a checking account, I have repaid two prior bank credits—200 DM for software and 400 DM for professional certification—through this bank. My current credit history includes a delayed payment on a private student loan, but I have resolved this by negotiating a revised schedule. With one dependent and fixed housing costs, I can allocate 220 DM monthly for installments.  

Respectfully  
Karim El-Sayed

Dear Committee  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, 31, an IT support specialist at Siemens since 2019. I require a car to manage my 45-minute daily commute more efficiently, hence this 2,775 DM loan. I earn 2,900 DM monthly and have no checking account but maintain a savings bond of 80 DM. I admit my past credit for a smartphone purchase had critical delays, yet I now prioritize repaying my two active loans here—a 600 DM laptop loan and a 350 DM course fee—on time. I reside in my own apartment in Munich for 2 years and care for my daughter, aged 4. My employer confirms my 5-year tenure, and I propose a 2 DM installment rate to ensure affordability.  

Yours faithfully  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Sir/Madam  

I am Hassan Ali, 31, a certified electrician employed by a construction firm in Hamburg for 4 years. The loan is necessary to acquire a vehicle for client site visits, which currently cost 120 DM weekly in taxis. My monthly income is 3,000 DM, and I own my residence in Stade. Though I have a critical history with a previous credit from a foreign bank (unresolved due to relocation), I have two active, punctual repayments here: a 450 DM tool loan and a 250 DM safety gear loan. I hold a building society savings plan of 1,500 DM and support my 8-year-old son. My stable job and 220 DM monthly budget for this loan demonstrate my commitment.  

Sincerely  
Hassan Ali
