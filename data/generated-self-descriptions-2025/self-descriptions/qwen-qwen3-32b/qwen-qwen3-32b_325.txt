Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

The profile includes details like the checking account status is below 0 DM, duration of 18 months. Credit history is good, purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 2659 DM. Savings account has over 1000 DM. Employment since 1-4 years, male, single, no other debtors, residence since 2 years, property is car or other, age 28, own housing, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker.

First, I need to create five different people. Let me brainstorm different scenarios. Maybe different job roles, reasons for furniture purchase, maybe different countries they're from, different specific situations.

For each letter, I need to specify each generic attribute. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant," "electrician," etc. Each person's purpose for the loan could vary under furniture/equipment—like a home office setup, kitchen appliances, children's room, etc.

Let me outline each person:

1. Electrician needing furniture for a home office to work remotely. Maybe he's a foreign worker from Poland, has been employed for 3 years, has a savings account of 1500 DM. He has a dependent child. His existing credit is a car loan paid on time.

2. A laboratory assistant from Romania, working in a hospital. She wants to buy a new kitchen setup. She's been in her job for 2.5 years, has savings of 2000 DM. She's living in her own apartment for 2 years, has a car. Her existing credit is a car loan.

3. A construction site supervisor from Italy. Needs to buy a sofa and TV for family gatherings. Employed for 3 years, savings 1200 DM. Owns a car. Existing credit for a motorcycle.

4. A software developer from India working as a foreign worker. Needs to furnish a home office with ergonomic furniture. Employed for 2 years, savings 1800 DM. Existing credit for a laptop. Lives in own housing, has a car.

5. A mechanical engineer from Mexico. Applying for a loan to buy a baby's room set. Employed for 1.5 years, savings 1300 DM. Owns a car. Existing credit for a camera.

Each letter should mention their job, duration, savings, purpose, existing credit history, residence, dependents, etc. Make sure to vary the specifics each time. Also, they should explain why they're trustworthy—timely payments, savings, stable job.

Now, structure each letter: start with address, date, bank name. Then body explaining purpose, financial situation, why trustworthy. Conclude with thanks and signature.

Need to check that each letter doesn't repeat the same job or purpose. Make sure all profile attributes are addressed in each letter with specific numbers and roles. Avoid generic terms. Also, since they don't have a telephone, maybe mention that they can be contacted through their workplace or residence.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered concisely.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Adrian Müller, a 28-year-old electrician employed at a construction firm in Berlin. I have been working in this role for 3 years and currently hold a savings account with 1,500 DM. My checking account balance is temporarily negative due to recent home repairs, but my stable income ensures I can repay this deficit. I am applying for a 2,659 DM loan to purchase a new desk, ergonomic chair, and computer to set up a home office. As a foreign worker from Poland, I have lived in my current residence for 2 years and own a car as collateral. I have consistently repaid my existing car loan (1,200 DM monthly installment) without delay. With one dependent—a 3-year-old child—and no other debts, I am committed to fulfilling this loan responsibly. I kindly request your approval based on my reliable employment and savings.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Adrian Müller
