Okay, I need to create five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The duration is 9 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is radio/television, credit amount 1366 DM. Savings account is less than 100 DM. Present employment is less than a year. Installment rate 3. Personal status is female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 4 months. Property is building society savings agreement or life insurance. Age 22. No other installment plans. Housing is rent. Number of existing credits at the bank is 1. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So, each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of different scenarios. Let's pick different jobs first. The profile says "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, a nurse, a teacher, a mechanic, and a civil servant. Each of these can be a different person.

For each, I need to specify their exact job, duration of employment (since it's less than 1 year, maybe 8 months, 10 months, etc.), their personal status (divorced, separated, married), and other specifics.

Let me start with the first one. Let's take a scientific research assistant. She's 22, foreign worker, has been in her job for 8 months. She's separated, has one dependent. She needs the loan for a television to set up a home. She has a building society savings agreement. She mentions her existing credit (maybe a previous small loan for a laptop that she paid back). She's living in rented housing, moved there 4 months ago. No phone. She's reliable because she's paid back previous credit and has a stable job.

Second person: a nurse. Let's say she's 22, married, has one dependent. Employed as a nurse for 10 months. She needs the loan for a radio for her home. She has a life insurance policy as property. She has no savings, but she's paid back her previous credit (maybe a medical equipment loan). She's a foreign worker, living in the same residence for 4 months. She has no phone. She's requesting the loan to improve her home environment.

Third person: a teacher's assistant. Maybe she's 22, divorced, one child. Worked as a teaching assistant for 9 months. Needs a television for educational purposes for her child. She has a building society agreement. She has paid back a previous student loan. She's a foreign worker, renting, no phone. She's reliable because of her stable job and timely payments.

Fourth person: automotive mechanic. 22, married, separated, one dependent. Employed as a mechanic for 8 months. Needs a radio for her home. She has life insurance. She has a previous credit for tools that she paid back. She's living in the same place for 4 months. No phone. She's a foreign worker, and her job is stable.

Fifth person: civil servant. Maybe a clerk in the local government. 22, married, one dependent. Employed for 10 months. Needs a television. She has a savings agreement. Paid back a previous credit for a computer. Stable job, reliable payments.

Now, each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation (negative checking account, low savings, etc.), and why they are trustworthy (paid back previous loans, stable job, etc.). They should also mention their current employment duration, residence, and other profile attributes.

I need to make sure each letter is unique in the specific details. Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan, maybe vary between personal use, educational, etc. Also, vary the existing credit they have paid back. Each letter should be concise, not too long, and end properly.

Let me draft the first one:

I need to check that each letter includes all required elements: purpose, financial situation (checking account, savings, etc.), trustworthiness (credit history), employment duration, residence, job type, dependents, etc. Also, make sure the numbers match the profile (e.g., 8 months, 10 months, etc. for employment, 4 months residence, age 22, etc.). Also, each letter should have a unique job and specific instances. Also, each has different existing credits paid back (laboratory equipment, medical certification fees, student loan, tool purchase, computer loan). That seems okay. Each letter is concise, ends properly. No formatting. Looks good.
