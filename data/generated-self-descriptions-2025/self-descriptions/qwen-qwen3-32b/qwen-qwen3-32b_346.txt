Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile details: The applicant has a checking account with at least 200 DM and a salary assigned there for at least a year. The loan duration is 10 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is a new car, amount 3949 DM. Savings account/bonds less than 100 DM. Present employment for less than a year. Installment rate 1. Male, single. Guarantor for other debtors. Residence since 1 year. Property: building society savings or life insurance. Age 37. No other installment plans. Own housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job is unskilled resident. Two dependents. No telephone. Foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique but fit these parameters. Let me think of different scenarios for five people. Maybe vary their reasons for needing the car, their jobs, and guarantors. Let me brainstorm:

1. A foreign worker in construction needing a car for commuting to multiple job sites. Guarantor is his brother.

2. A maintenance worker who needs a reliable car for work shifts and dependents. Guarantor is a cousin.

3. A delivery driver requiring a vehicle for work, with a guarantor friend from the same country.

4. A person working in a warehouse needing transportation for long hours, guarantor is a sibling.

5. A daily laborer needing a car for job stability, guarantor is a family friend.

Each should mention their specific job, how long they've been employed (even though the profile says less than a year, maybe they started recently but have previous experience), their dependents, the guarantor, and why they need the car. Also, highlight their good credit history and existing credit with the bank. Make sure the letters are concise, no formatting, proper endings.

Let me check if all profile attributes are covered in each letter. For example, each should mention the purpose (car), credit amount, existing credit paid back, employment duration, guarantor, residence since 1 year, property type, age, dependents, etc. Also, note that savings are less than 100 DM, so they need the loan despite having some savings. Maybe mention that they don't have sufficient savings for the car.

I need to make sure each letter is distinct. Maybe vary the jobs: construction worker, maintenance, delivery, warehouse, daily labor. Different guarantors: brother, cousin, friend, sibling, family friend. Different reasons for car: commuting, work necessity, job stability, dependents' needs, etc.

Also, since they are foreign workers, maybe mention their intention to stay or contribute to the community. Highlight punctual repayment of previous credits. Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address, salutation, body, closing.

Let me draft one example first to check structure, then proceed to others ensuring uniqueness.

Dear [Bank Name]  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, and I am a 37-year-old construction worker employed at a local building site. I have resided in this city for one year and currently own a small apartment through a building society savings agreement. I have been diligently repaying my existing credit of 2,000 DM for the past six months without delay.  

Due to my job’s demanding schedule, I require a reliable car to commute between job sites and support my family of two children. While my savings account holds only 80 DM, I have maintained a checking account with this bank for over a year, with consistent salary deposits. My brother, who lives nearby, will act as a guarantor for this loan.  

I assure you of my commitment to repaying the 3,949 DM loan in full. My punctual work attendance and stable income from my employer, ABC Construction, make me a trustworthy candidate. I kindly request approval to secure this vehicle and continue contributing positively to my community.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mohamed

Dear [Bank Name]  

I am writing as Fatih Yilmaz, a 37-year-old maintenance technician at a manufacturing plant. I have lived in my current residence for one year and hold a life insurance policy as collateral. Though my savings amount to 50 DM, I have consistently paid my sole existing credit—a furniture loan—on time.  

My employment began eight months ago, but I have eight years of prior experience in similar roles abroad. A car is essential for my job, as I often work early mornings and evenings. My cousin, Mehmet, will guarantee this loan.  

With two dependents and a stable salary, I prioritize financial responsibility. The requested car will improve my efficiency at work and reduce transportation costs. I am confident in my ability to manage monthly installments and uphold my repayment history.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Fatih Yilmaz

Dear [Bank Name]  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, a 37-year-old foreign worker employed as a warehouse porter. I have resided here for one year and own a building society savings bond. My existing credit—a bicycle loan—was fully repaid last month.  

I seek a car to commute safely between shifts, as my job requires 12-hour workdays. While my savings account holds 30 DM, my employer, XYZ Logistics, has guaranteed timely salary transfers to my checking account for over a year. My friend Arjun, who has lived here for five years, will act as guarantor.  

This vehicle will not only aid my work but also allow me to support my two children back home. I am committed to repaying the 3,949 DM loan and maintaining my perfect credit record.  

Respectfully,  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear [Bank Name]  

I am Karim Hassan, 37, working as a daily laborer through a local contracting firm. I have lived in my apartment for one year and possess a building society savings plan. My sole existing credit—a toolset loan—is in good standing.  

A car is necessary for my job, as I must travel to multiple worksites daily. My savings amount to 20 DM, but my salary is consistently deposited into my bank account. My uncle, who is a permanent resident, agrees to guarantee this loan.  

With two dependents and a stable employment history in construction, I am determined to invest in reliable transportation. I assure you of my dedication to repaying this loan promptly, just as I have with all prior obligations.  

Sincerely,  
Karim Hassan
