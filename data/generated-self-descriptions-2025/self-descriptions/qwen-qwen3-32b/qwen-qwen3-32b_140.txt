Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the checking account has a balance between 0 and 200 DM, and the account has been open for 15 months. The credit history is critical with other credits existing but not at this bank. The purpose of the loan is for radio/television. The amount is 2728 DM. Savings account is unknown or none. Employment duration is between 4 to 7 years. The applicant is a single male, has a guarantor, has lived in the current residence for 2 years, owns real estate, has an installment plan with the bank, has 3 existing credits at this bank, job is skilled employee or official, has one dependent, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

I need to create five different people with specific roles and situations. Let me think of different job roles under "skilled employee / official." Maybe a scientific research assistant, a teacher, an electrician, a civil servant, and a mechanic. Each person should have a unique reason for needing the loan for radio/television. Maybe they need it for a home business, educational purposes, or to stay connected for work.

For each letter, I need to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They all have a guarantor, so I should mention that. Also, they own real estate, so maybe they can use that as collateral. They have existing credits at the bank, so showing a history of repayment there would be good. Since their credit history is critical, they might need to explain that they've been working on improving it.

Let me start with the first person: a scientific research assistant. He needs the TV for following international conferences. He has a guarantor, owns property, and has a stable job. He mentions his existing credits are for educational purposes and he's repaid them well.

Second, a teacher who wants a radio for language learning. She has a guarantor, owns a house, and has dependents. She can mention her stable employment and existing credits for home improvements.

Third, an electrician needing a TV for staying updated with industry standards. He has a guarantor, owns real estate, and has a good relationship with the bank despite past issues.

Fourth, a civil servant applying for a radio to keep up with policy changes. He has a guarantor, owns property, and has a history of timely payments.

Fifth, a mechanic needing a TV for technical training. He has a guarantor, owns his home, and is a loyal customer with existing credits.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, mentions specific details, and ends properly without any formatting. Each should have a unique angle but adhere to the profile's constraints. Let me check if all attributes are covered in each letter: checking account status, duration, credit history, purpose, amount, savings, employment duration, personal status, guarantor, residence, property, age, installment plans, housing, existing credits, job, dependents, telephone, foreign worker status. 

Yes, each letter should mention the guarantor, existing credits at the bank, owning real estate, being a foreign worker, etc. Also, the purpose is radio/TV but each has a slightly different justification. Make sure the financial situation is explained, showing they can manage payments. Trustworthiness comes from the guarantor, existing property, stable job, and repayment history with the bank.

I need to avoid generic terms and use specifics. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant," "electrician," etc. Also, the loan amount is 2728 DM, so each letter should mention that exact figure. Each person's age is 35, single, with one dependent. They all have a telephone and are registered foreign workers. The residence is 2 years, employment 4-7 years, existing credits at the bank (3), and installment rate 4.

I need to ensure that each letter is distinct but follows the same structure. Let me draft each one step by step, making sure all points are covered concisely.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

My name is Lars Müller, 35, a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin. I have been employed in this role for 5 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. I am applying for a 2,728 DM loan to purchase a television to follow international scientific conferences, which are critical for my work.  

I currently hold a checking account with another bank, with a balance of 150 DM opened 15 months ago. My credit history includes a small personal loan from a different institution, which I have been diligently repaying. I own a real estate property in Munich and reside there with my 6-year-old son. My sister, Anna Müller, will act as a guarantor for this loan.  

Though I have three existing credits at this bank for educational expenses, I have maintained timely payments. I am a registered foreign worker with a valid residence permit and own a home. I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and guarantor’s support make me a reliable candidate. I kindly request your approval to proceed.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller
