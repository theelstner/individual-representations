Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile mentions a checking account with less than 0 DM, a duration of 24 months. The person has a credit history of paying back existing credits. The purpose is business, credit amount 6568 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employment duration 1-4 years. Personal status: male, married or widowed. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 2 months. Property: car or other. Age 21. Other installment plans: stores. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: unskilled resident. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each letter needs to be from someone fitting these specifics. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different types of businesses they want to start. Since they're foreign workers, maybe from different countries. Let me vary the purposes within business, like food truck, tech repair, tailoring, etc. Each person should have a unique angle but fit the profile.

First person: Maybe a food vendor. He's a foreign worker in Germany, has been employed for 2 years. He wants to start a food cart. He's been saving small amounts but needs a loan. He's reliable, has a car as collateral.

Second: Maybe a tech repair service. He's been working in a factory for 3 years, wants to set up a repair shop. His wife helps, they have a dependent child. He has a car and owns a house.

Third: A tailoring business. He's from another country, works part-time, wants to start a tailoring business. Uses his sewing skills. Has a car as property.

Fourth: Maybe a small grocery store. He's been in Germany for 2 years, works in construction. Wants to open a store catering to his community. Has a car and owns his apartment.

Fifth: A mobile car wash service. He's been employed for 1 year, has a van he can use. Needs funds for equipment. Married with a child, stable job.

Each letter should mention their specific job, duration, savings (even though it's less than 100 DM), existing credit paid on time, purpose, collateral (car), and commitment to repay. Need to make sure each has different specifics but fits the profile. Also, they are all foreign workers, so maybe mention their country of origin. Check that each has 1 dependent, own housing, no phone (though maybe that's outdated, but the profile says none). Also, they have other installment plans with stores, so maybe mention that they manage those payments.

Avoid generic terms. Use specific instances like "scientific research assistant" as an example. Wait, in the profile, the job is "unskilled - resident". So their jobs should be unskilled. So maybe factory worker, construction laborer, etc.

Let me start drafting each letter with these points in mind. Make sure each has a unique business purpose, specific job, duration, and other details. Also, ensure they explain why they need the loan, their financial situation (checking account negative, savings low), but trustworthy because they have paid credits before, own property, etc.

**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, a 21-year-old Egyptian foreign worker residing in Germany for the past two years. I am currently employed as a factory assembly line operator at a manufacturing plant in Munich, a position I have held for 2.5 years. My wife and I relocated to Germany to build a stable future, and we are now seeking a loan of 6,568 DM to launch a small Middle Eastern food cart business.  

Despite my current checking account balance being in deficit due to recent medical expenses for my wife, I have maintained a consistent income and paid off my existing store installment plan for a smartphone. I own a used car, which I am willing to pledge as collateral, and I reside in my own apartment, which I purchased with savings from my first year of work. My previous credit for vocational training was repaid in full, and I have no outstanding debts.  

This loan will cover permits, equipment, and initial inventory. I am committed to repaying the installment of 2 DM monthly, as my employer deducts and transfers funds directly. I kindly request your trust in my determination to succeed.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mohamed

**Letter 2**  
Dear Bank Manager,  

I am Rajesh Kumar, a 21-year-old Indian national working as a warehouse packer in Hamburg. I have been employed at my current job for three years and have recently been accepted into a vocational course for electronics repair. To support my family—my wife and newborn daughter—I seek a 6,568 DM loan to establish a mobile phone repair kiosk.  

My savings account holds 80 DM, accumulated through strict budgeting, and I own a motorcycle registered in Germany. Though my checking account occasionally dips into negative due to fluctuating work hours, I have never defaulted on my existing bank credit for a power tool set, which I repay punctually.  

My business plan leverages my technical skills learned in India and my evenings as a part-time repair technician for local shops. I reside in my own apartment and am willing to use my motorcycle as collateral. With this loan, I aim to generate income to cover my young family’s needs while continuing my education.  

Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Rajesh Kumar

**Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

As a 21-year-old unskilled worker from Poland, I am writing to request a 6,568 DM loan to start a tailoring business. My name is Paweł Nowak, and I have worked as a construction laborer in Berlin for 18 months. My wife and I have lived in our own apartment for two years, and I own a used sewing machine and car, which I purchased with my first paycheck here.  

While my current checking account balance is negative due to recent visa renewal costs, I have a flawless credit history, having fully repaid a prior loan for vocational clothing design courses. I manage a monthly installment plan for a washing machine through a store, which I pay without delay.  

The loan will fund a small storefront and materials to create custom uniforms for local businesses. My tailoring skills, honed during my studies in Poland, combined with my stable employment, ensure timely repayment of 2 DM installments. I kindly ask for your support to turn my passion into a sustainable livelihood.  

Yours faithfully,  
Paweł Nowak

**Letter 4**  
Dear Bank Officer,  

I am Hassan Al-Farouq, a 21-year-old Syrian refugee and factory worker in Stuttgart, employed for 3.5 years. My wife and I have one child and seek a 6,568 DM loan to open a small grocery store specializing in Arabic products.  

My savings account contains 50 DM, and my checking account occasionally dips below zero due to medical bills for my son’s asthma. However, I have consistently repaid my existing credit for a commercial refrigerator, which I use to resell dairy products part-time. I own a van, which I propose as collateral, and I live in my own apartment.  

This loan will cover licensing, shelves, and initial stock. My employer guarantees continued income, and I am prepared to adjust my work hours to manage repayments. I assure you of my dedication to this venture and my family’s future.  

Gratefully,  
Hassan Al-Farouq

**Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

My name is Carlos Rivera, a 21-year-old Mexican national working as a warehouse forklift operator in Frankfurt. I have been employed for two years and wish to apply for a 6,568 DM loan to start a mobile car wash service.  

My checking account is occasionally overdrawn due to my wife’s university tuition payments, but I have no unpaid debts and have fully repaid a prior loan for a vehicle inspection course. I own a used car, which I will use as collateral, and I reside in my own apartment.  

This business will cater to local residents, using my existing van and free evenings after work. I manage a store installment plan for a microwave, which I pay on time. With your support, I will generate additional income to support my family and repay the loan as agreed.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Carlos Rivera
