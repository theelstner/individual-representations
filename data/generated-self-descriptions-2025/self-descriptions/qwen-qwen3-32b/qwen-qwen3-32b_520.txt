Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The duration is 6 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is a new car, loan amount 1203 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Employment for at least 7 years. Installment rate 3. Single male, no other debtors or guarantors. Residence for 2 years. Property is a building society savings agreement or life insurance. Age 43. No other installment plans. Own housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. One dependent. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

Now, I need to create five different people with specific roles and situations. Let me think of different job roles for the "skilled employee / official" category. Maybe a scientific research assistant, a civil servant, an IT technician, a teacher, and a mechanical engineer. Each person should have unique details but fit the profile.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying for the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their job, duration of employment, savings, existing credit history, residence, and other relevant points. Also, they need to tie in the purpose of the loan (car) and how it will benefit them, like for work-related travel or family needs.

Let me start with the first person: a scientific research assistant. They work at a university, have been there for 8 years. Savings of 300 DM. Existing credit is a bike loan paid off. They need a car for fieldwork. Trustworthy because of timely payments and stable job.

Second person: a civil servant, maybe a local government official. Employed for 7 years. Savings of 450 DM. Existing credit for a laptop. Needs a car for commuting. Stable income, responsible with debts.

Third: IT technician at a company, 9 years. Savings 200 DM. Existing credit for a camera. Needs a car for client visits. Reliable, pays bills on time.

Fourth: High school teacher, 7 years. Savings 150 DM. Existing credit for a vacation. Car needed for transporting dependents. Stable job with good reputation.

Fifth: Mechanical engineer in manufacturing, 10 years. Savings 500 DM. Existing credit for tools. Needs a car for commuting and work projects. Trustworthy with financial responsibilities.

Each letter should be concise, avoid formatting, and end properly. Let me make sure each includes specific numbers and details as per the profile. Also, check that all profile attributes are addressed in each letter. For example, each should mention the savings range, employment duration, existing credit history, residence time, etc.

I need to ensure that each letter is distinct. Maybe vary the reasons for needing the car: fieldwork, commuting, client visits, family needs, work projects. Also, different existing credits: bike, laptop, camera, vacation, tools. Each person's job and specific situation should be clear.

Let me draft each one step by step, making sure not to repeat the same reasons or credits. Also, check that each starts with their name and ends with a proper closing. Avoid any markdown, keep paragraphs short. Make sure the tone is formal but personal, showing motivation and trustworthiness.

**Letter 1: Scientific Research Assistant**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,203 DM to purchase a reliable vehicle. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Leipzig for 8 years, I earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. My current savings account holds 320 DM, and I have consistently paid back my previous credit for a bicycle loan over 18 months. Though my checking account has been negative for the past 6 months due to unexpected equipment repairs, I have resolved this by reallocating my budget. I reside in my own home and have lived at my current address for 2 years. The car will facilitate my fieldwork, which requires frequent travel to remote study sites. With my punctual repayment history and secure employment, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3 DM. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

**Letter 2: Municipal Civil Servant**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I respectfully request a 1,203 DM loan to replace my aging car, which is essential for my role as a civil servant in municipal planning. Employed by the city of Dresden for 7 years, I receive a monthly salary of 3,100 DM. My savings account contains 450 DM, and I have fully repaid a prior credit for a laptop used in my job. While my checking account balance is currently negative due to recent medical expenses, I have a building society savings plan valued at 1,200 DM. I have lived in my home for 2 years and have no other debts. The new vehicle will ensure timely attendance at community meetings and site inspections. My history of responsible credit management and steady income make me a reliable candidate. I appreciate your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Lars Müller

**Letter 3: IT Technician**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 1,203 DM loan to purchase a car that will support my work as an IT technician at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 9 years. My monthly income is 3,300 DM, and I maintain a savings account with 200 DM. A previous credit for a camera was repaid in full over 12 months. My checking account has been overdrawn recently due to a temporary software licensing fee, but I have since adjusted my finances. I own my residence and have lived there for 2 years. The vehicle is necessary to service clients across the region efficiently. With my stable job and disciplined financial habits, I am committed to fulfilling the 3 DM installment rate. Thank you for your time and trust in my application.  

Kind regards,  
Tobias Fischer

**Letter 4: High School Teacher**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I seek a 1,203 DM loan to acquire a car for commuting and transporting my 8-year-old daughter to school activities. As a high school chemistry teacher in Munich for 7 years, I earn 2,900 DM monthly. My savings account holds 150 DM, and I have repaid a prior credit for a family vacation. My checking account deficit of 80 DM was due to a recent textbook purchase for my students, which I have since covered. I reside in my own home and have done so for 2 years. With no other debts and a registered foreign worker status, I am dedicated to timely repayments. This loan will ease my responsibilities as a single parent and ensure reliability in my professional and personal life. I am grateful for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Jan Wiegand

**Letter 5: Mechanical Engineer**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 1,203 DM loan to purchase a vehicle critical for my role as a mechanical engineer at BMW, where I have worked for 10 years. My monthly income is 3,500 DM, and I maintain a savings account with 500 DM. I previously repaid a credit for specialized tools over 24 months. My checking account has been negative for 6 months due to a delayed project bonus, but I have since balanced my expenses. I own my home and have lived there for 2 years. The car will enable me to manage work-site visits and meet project deadlines. My consistent repayment history and secure employment assure you of my trustworthiness. Thank you for your support.  

Respectfully,  
Sebastian Klein
