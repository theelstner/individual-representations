Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the points.

First, the profile details: The applicant is a 35-year-old single male, employed in a management, self-employed, or highly qualified employee role. He's been in his current job for 4-7 years. He doesn't have a checking account, has a critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, wants a used car loan of 7253 DM, has less than 100 DM in savings, no other debtors or guarantors, lives in his own home, has two existing credits at the bank, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker. He's been in his current residence for 2 years and has one dependent.

I need to create five different people with specific roles. Let me think of different job roles from the profile's "Job" category. The options are management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, or officer. Let me pick five distinct ones. Maybe:

1. Management: Could be a project manager.
2. Self-employed: Maybe a freelance graphic designer.
3. Highly qualified employee: Perhaps a scientific research assistant.
4. Officer: Maybe a police officer or military officer? Wait, in some contexts, "officer" could mean a corporate officer, but maybe a police officer is more straightforward.
5. Another management role but different, like a retail store manager.

Wait, the user said "five different people" with specific instances. Let me make sure each has unique job roles and other attributes. Let me check the original profile again. The job category includes management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, or officer. Let me assign each letter to a different category.

First person: Project manager (management). Second: Self-employed web developer. Third: Research scientist (highly qualified). Fourth: Police officer (officer). Fifth: Maybe a restaurant manager (management again but different from project manager). Wait, but the profile says "Job:management/ self-employed/ highly qualified employee/ officer". So four categories. But the user wants five letters. Maybe two from management but different roles. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the fifth could be a different self-employed role. Let me think. Let's go with:

1. Project Manager (Management)
2. Freelance Graphic Designer (Self-Employed)
3. Research Scientist (Highly Qualified Employee)
4. Police Officer (Officer)
5. Restaurant Manager (Management)

That gives five distinct roles. Now, each needs to have specific details. Let me start with the first one.

For the project manager: Name could be Thomas Müller. He's 35, single, has a dependent (maybe a child). He's been working as a project manager for 5 years. He needs a used car for commuting. His current job provides a stable income. He has two existing credits at the bank (maybe a laptop and a vacation loan). No checking account, but he's been in his residence for 2 years. He's a registered foreign worker. His savings are low because he's been saving for the car. Why is his credit history critical? Maybe past issues with a previous credit, but he's been managing others well.

Second, freelance graphic designer: Name could be Daniel Fischer. Self-employed for 5 years. He needs a car for client visits. Savings are low because he invests in equipment. His income is variable but steady. He has two credits (maybe a studio setup loan and a software subscription). His residence is 2 years, own home. Trustworthy because of consistent payments despite self-employment.

Third, research scientist: Maybe Dr. Lena Schmidt. She's a scientific research assistant at a university. 8 years in her job. Needs a car for fieldwork. Savings are minimal due to research funding allocation. Critical credit history from a previous student loan, but she's repaid it. Two existing credits (lab equipment, conference travel). Stable salary, dependent is a parent she supports.

Fourth, police officer: Michael Weber, 35, police officer for 6 years. Needs a reliable car for shifts. Savings are low because of emergency fund for duty gear. Critical credit history from a past personal loan, but now managed. Two credits (duty boots, training courses). Stable government job, dependent is a child.

Fifth, restaurant manager: Thomas Becker, manages a chain restaurant. 5 years in position. Needs a car for deliveries. Savings are tied up in restaurant equipment. Critical credit history from a previous business loan. Two credits at the bank (kitchen appliances, POS system). Stable income, dependent is a spouse.

Now, each letter should explain the purpose, financial situation, and trustworthiness. They need to be concise, no formatting, proper endings.

Let me check each profile against the original attributes. For example, each has 4-7 years in current job, 35 years old, single, one dependent, etc. Also, the loan amount is 7253 DM for a used car, installment rate 3 (maybe 3%?), but not sure. The letters should mention why they need the car, how they can repay, and their stability.

Make sure each letter is from a different person with unique job roles and specific instances. Avoid generic terms. Use the exact numbers: 33 months (2.75 years) in checking account? Wait, the profile says "Duration in month:33" but the checking account status is "no checking account". So the person doesn't have one. So in the letters, they don't have a checking account. Also, "Present residence since:2" years. So each person has been living there 2 years. "Other installment plans:none". So no other plans. "Housing: own". Each owns their home. "Number of existing credits at this bank:2". Each has two credits there. "Savings account/bonds:... < 100 DM". So very little savings. "Credit history: critical account/ other credits existing (not at this bank)". So they have a critical history elsewhere but maybe managing current ones.

Each letter should address these points. For example, explaining the critical credit history but showing responsibility. Maybe the first person had a medical debt that's been resolved, or a past late payment but now on track. Since the existing credits are not at this bank, maybe they have other loans from elsewhere but are handling them.

Now, drafting each letter with these specifics. Let me start with the first one.

First letter: Thomas Müller, project manager. He's applying for a used car loan. He's been in his job for 5 years, has two existing credits at the bank (maybe a laptop and a vacation loan). His savings are low because he's been saving for the car. He's a registered foreign worker, has a dependent (child). He mentions his stable income and timely payments on existing credits. He needs the car for commuting to work, which is essential for his job. He's owned his home for 2 years. He's aware of his past credit issues but has been managing current debts responsibly.

Second letter: Daniel Fischer, freelance graphic designer. Self-employed for 5 years. Income is variable but steady. He needs the car for client meetings. His savings are low because he's invested in design software and equipment. He has two credits at the bank (studio setup and software). He's a registered foreign worker, single, with a dependent (maybe an elderly parent). He emphasizes his consistent income and punctual payments despite self-employment. The car will help increase his business by allowing more client visits.

Third letter: Dr. Lena Schmidt, research scientist. 8 years as a research assistant. Needs a car for fieldwork. Savings are low because research funds are allocated to lab expenses. She has two credits (lab equipment and conference travel). Critical credit history from a student loan that's paid off. She's stable in her job, has a dependent (parent). The car is necessary for her work, which contributes to her field. She's reliable with payments.

Fourth letter: Michael Weber, police officer. 6 years in the force. Needs a car for rotating shifts. Savings are minimal due to investing in emergency gear. Two credits (duty boots, training). Critical history from a past personal loan, now resolved. Stable government job, dependent is a child. The car will ensure he can perform his duties reliably.

Fifth letter: Thomas Becker, restaurant manager. 5 years managing a restaurant. Needs a van for deliveries. Savings are tied up in kitchen equipment. Two credits (kitchen appliances, POS system). Critical history from a previous business loan. Stable income from restaurant. Dependent is spouse. The van is essential for business operations, ensuring timely deliveries.

Each letter should start with the applicant's info, state purpose, explain financial situation, address credit history, and conclude with commitment to repayment. Make sure they are concise, no markdown, proper endings.

Now, let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all specific details are included and that each person is distinct.

**Motivation Letter 1: Thomas Müller**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am writing to request a loan of 7,253 DM to purchase a used car to support my role as a project manager at a construction firm. I have worked in this position for 5 years, earning a stable monthly income of 4,200 DM. While my credit history includes a critical account from a previous personal loan, I have since resolved this issue and consistently repaid my two existing credits at this bank—a laptop loan and a vacation loan. I reside in my own home and have lived at my current address for 2 years. Though my savings are minimal due to allocating funds toward work-related expenses, I am committed to repaying this loan through my reliable income. The car will ensure I can commute efficiently to job sites. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Müller

**Motivation Letter 2: Daniel Fischer**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I seek a 7,253 DM loan to acquire a used car for client visits as a freelance graphic designer. Self-employed for 5 years, my average monthly income is 3,800 DM, with contracts secured through long-term clients. I currently manage two small credits at this bank for studio equipment and design software. My savings are limited as I reinvest earnings into my business. I have a critical credit history from a delayed payment on a non-bank loan 3 years ago, which I resolved promptly. Living in my owned home for 2 years and supporting my elderly mother, I prioritize financial responsibility. This car will enhance my ability to serve clients and generate consistent revenue to repay the loan.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Fischer

My monthly salary is 4,500 DM, and I have two existing credits at this bank for lab equipment and conference travel. My savings account holds less than 100 DM as I allocate funds to research-related expenses. My credit history includes a critical student loan, which I fully repaid 2 years ago. I reside in my own home and care for my elderly father. This loan is essential for my work, and I assure you of timely repayments given my stable employment and dedication.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Lena Schmidt
