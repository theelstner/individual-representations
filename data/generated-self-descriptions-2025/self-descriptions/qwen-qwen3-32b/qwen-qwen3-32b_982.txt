Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the details.

First, the profile has specific attributes like existing checking account status (0-200 DM), duration of 30 months, credit history with critical account or other credits not at this bank, purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 8386 DM, savings account <100 DM, employment duration 4-7 years, installment rate 2, male single, no other debtors, residence since 2 years, property is building society savings or life insurance, age 49, no other installment plans, housing is own, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, dependents 1, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different job roles, countries of origin, reasons for needing furniture. Let me brainstorm:

1. A scientific research assistant from Eastern Europe who needs furniture for a new home after moving. He has a stable job but has been in Germany for a few years. He already has a small credit at the bank for a computer.

2. A maintenance technician from the Middle East. He's been working in Germany for 5 years, has a dependent child, and needs to replace old furniture. His savings are low because he's sending money back home.

3. A civil servant from North Africa. He's been in his job for 6 years, has a life insurance policy, and needs to furnish a newly purchased apartment. He's a single father.

4. An electrician from Southeast Asia. He's been in Germany for 4 years, has a building society savings agreement, and needs equipment for his home workshop to take on more clients.

5. A public administration officer from South America. She's been working for 6 years, has a critical credit history due to medical bills, but needs to buy furniture for her daughter's upcoming school needs.

Wait, the profile says the person is male. So all five should be male. Also, the job is either skilled employee or official. Let me adjust the fifth one to be male. Maybe a male public administration officer.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention existing credit at the bank, their employment duration, residence, and other profile elements. Also, they have a critical credit history but need to address that by showing responsibility.

I need to make sure each letter is unique. Let me outline each one:

1. Research Assistant: Stable job, existing credit (computer), needs furniture for new apartment. Emphasize timely payments on current credit.

2. Maintenance Tech: Long-term employment, sending money home, needs furniture. Highlight dependents and responsibility.

3. Civil Servant: Public job, life insurance, furnishing new place. Mention existing credit and timely payments.

4. Electrician: Skilled job, building society savings, equipment for workshop. Show how loan will increase income.

5. Public Officer: Critical credit history due to past medical debt, now resolved. Needs furniture for daughter. Emphasize current stability and savings.

Now, I need to write each letter concisely, without formatting, proper endings. Let me start drafting each one, making sure to include all required elements with specific details.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Karim Mohamed, a 49-year-old scientific research assistant at the Dresden Institute of Environmental Studies. I have worked there for 6 years and currently hold a small credit with your bank for laboratory equipment. I am applying for an 8,386 DM loan to purchase furniture for my newly rented apartment after relocating from Egypt. My checking account balance is 150 DM, and I maintain a building society savings agreement. Though I have a critical credit history due to a previous car loan in my home country, I have consistently paid my current employment-related debts. I reside in my own apartment and support my 12-year-old son. I assure you of timely repayments given my stable income and commitment to improving my living conditions.  

Sincerely,  
Karim Mohamed

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Aditya Kumar, 49, a senior maintenance technician at a manufacturing plant in Leipzig. I have worked there for 5 years and own a small savings bond worth 80 DM. I seek 8,386 DM to replace outdated furniture, as my current setup is deteriorating and I have a dependent daughter to support. My checking account balance is 90 DM, and I have a critical credit history from a previous housing loan in India. However, I have no delinquencies on my current job-related obligations. I have lived in my home for 2 years and own life insurance. My stable employment and dedication to financial responsibility make me a reliable candidate.  

Respectfully,  
Aditya Kumar

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Fernandez, 49, a civil servant in Hamburg’s city administration. I have served for 4 years and hold a building society savings agreement. I apply for 8,386 DM to furnish a newly purchased apartment, as my current furniture is insufficient for my growing needs. My checking account holds 70 DM, and I have one existing credit with your bank for office supplies. Though my credit history includes a critical account due to medical expenses in Spain, I have resolved these and maintain timely payments. I reside in my own home and have no other debts. My public sector job ensures steady income to meet repayment terms.  

Yours faithfully,  
Luis Fernandez

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Hassan Al-Mansouri, 49, an electrician employed at a construction firm in Frankfurt for 5 years. I request 8,386 DM to purchase tools and equipment for my home-based workshop, which will allow me to expand my freelance work. My checking account balance is 120 DM, and I own a life insurance policy. I have a critical credit history from a business loan in Morocco, but I have no overdue payments on my current obligations. I support my 15-year-old son and have lived in my residence for 2 years. My skilled trade and existing credit with your bank for safety gear demonstrate my reliability.  

Sincerely,  
Hassan Al-Mansouri

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Rajesh Patel, 49, a public administration officer in Bremen with 6 years of service. I seek 8,386 DM to buy a new sofa and desk for my daughter’s education, as our current furniture is unsuitable for study. My checking account has 50 DM, and I maintain a building society savings plan. While my credit history includes a critical account due to emergency dental costs in India, I have since managed my finances prudently. I own my home and have one existing credit with your bank for a work laptop. My stable government salary and commitment to my family’s well-being guarantee timely repayments.  

Respectfully,  
Rajesh Patel
