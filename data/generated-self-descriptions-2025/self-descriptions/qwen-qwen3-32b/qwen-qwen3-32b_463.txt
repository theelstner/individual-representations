Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

First, the profile has several key points: the person has a checking account less than 0 DM, has had it for 15 months. They have a credit history of paying back existing credits. The purpose of the loan is a new car, amount 1721 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employment for less than a year, installment rate 2. Male, single, no other debtors or guarantors. Residence for 3 years, property is real estate, age 36, no other installment plans, housing is own, one existing credit at the bank, job is skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

So each letter needs to be from someone with these attributes but with specific details. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, teacher, etc. Each person should have a unique job, maybe different countries they're from, specific reasons for needing the car, etc.

Let me brainstorm five different jobs/professions that fit the "skilled employee / official" category. Let's see: Scientific Research Assistant, Electrician, Public School Teacher, IT Systems Administrator, and maybe a Social Worker. Each of these can be from different countries as foreign workers.

For each letter, the person needs to explain why they need the loan (car purchase), their financial situation (current job, existing credit paid back, residence, etc.), and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their stable employment, existing credit paid on time, real estate as collateral, and maybe their plans for the car (like commuting to work, which ties into their job).

I need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long, and properly ends. Also, avoid any formatting. Let me start drafting each one.

First person: Scientific Research Assistant from Germany, working at a university. He has a dependent, lives in his own house. He needs a car to commute to a lab that's 45 km away. He's been employed there for 10 months. His existing credit was a laptop purchase paid back. Trustworthy because of timely payments and real estate.

Second: Electrician from Spain, working in a construction company. Needs a car for client visits. Has a stable job for 11 months. Paid back a tool loan. Lives in his own house, has a sister as dependent.

Third: Public School Teacher from Brazil, teaching in a secondary school. Needs a car to reach remote areas where she has to visit students. Employed for 9 months. Paid back a previous credit for classroom supplies. Trustworthy due to her stable job and real estate.

Fourth: IT Systems Administrator from India, working for a tech firm. Needs a car for daily commute and emergency IT support. Employed for 8 months. Paid back a credit for certifications. Has a dependent parent.

Fifth: Social Worker from Nigeria, working with a non-profit. Needs a car to visit clients in rural areas. Employed for 10 months. Paid back a credit for training. Trustworthy because of her job stability and real estate.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then a subject line. Then the body explaining their situation, purpose of loan, financial stability, and trustworthiness. End with a polite thank you and signature.

I need to make sure each letter has specific numbers and details, like exact months of employment (e.g., 10 months instead of <1 year), specific job roles, reasons for car purchase, and references to their existing credit history.

Also, since they are foreign workers, maybe mention their country of origin and how they have established themselves in their current job.

Check that all elements from the profile are included: checking account negative, duration 15 months, savings <100 DM, residence since 3 years, etc. But maybe not all need to be explicitly stated in the letters, but the letters should reflect the profile's attributes.

For example, the checking account being negative could be mentioned as a temporary situation due to recent employment. Savings are low because they are building up, but they have real estate as collateral.

Each letter should address their ability to repay, referencing their monthly income, existing repayment history, and the necessity of the car for their work, which ensures continued income to repay the loan.

Now, let me write each letter step by step, ensuring they are distinct and meet the requirements.

Subject: Application for Car Loan  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to request a loan of 1,721 DM to purchase a new car. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Heidelberg for the past 10 months, I require reliable transportation to commute 45 km daily to the university’s biochemistry lab. My current checking account balance is temporarily negative due to recent relocation costs, but I have consistently paid my existing credit for a laboratory laptop over the past 18 months.  

I reside in my own apartment in Karlsruhe, where I have lived for three years, and own real estate in my hometown of Stuttgart. Though my savings account holds less than 100 DM at present, I am committed to repaying this loan through my stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. As a foreign worker from Austria, I have prioritized financial responsibility, ensuring all prior debts are settled on time. This car will significantly improve my efficiency at work, securing my employment and ability to meet repayment terms.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for further discussion at your convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

Subject: Request for Auto Financing  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 1,721 DM loan to purchase a vehicle essential for my work as an electrician at SolarTech Construction. My employment there began 11 months ago, and I frequently travel to construction sites across Munich, where I install solar panel systems. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 120 DM due to upfront tool purchases, but I have no other debts and have fully repaid a 500 DM credit for safety equipment last year.  

I own a residence in Valencia and have lived in my current Munich apartment for three years. While my savings are minimal, my real estate holdings and steady income of 3,100 DM monthly provide financial stability. As a foreign worker from Spain, I value reliability—both in my trade and my financial commitments. This car will reduce travel time and enable me to take on more projects, ensuring timely loan repayments.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your response.  

Sincerely,  
Diego Fernández

Subject: Application for Vehicle Loan  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 1,721 DM loan to buy a car necessary for my role as a public school teacher in Berlin. My job at the Friedrich Community School, which I’ve held for 9 months, requires visiting students in remote districts, a task currently hindered by unreliable public transport. My checking account is temporarily negative (-85 DM) due to recent textbook purchases, but I have paid off a prior 600 DM credit for classroom supplies without issue.  

I own a small apartment in Berlin and have resided there for three years. Though my savings account contains 80 DM, my real estate investments and monthly salary of 2,600 DM demonstrate my capacity to repay. As a foreign worker from Brazil, I take pride in my punctuality and dedication—qualities I extend to financial obligations. This car will allow me to fulfill my teaching duties effectively while maintaining loan payments.  

Thank you for your time. I appreciate your support.  

Sincerely,  
Ana Souza
