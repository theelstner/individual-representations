Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile has specific attributes: no checking account, 36 months duration, good credit history, business purpose, loan amount 5742 DM, savings between 100-500 DM, employment for 4-7 years, installment rate 2, single male, no other debtors, residence since 2 years, property like a car, age 31, no other installment plans, own housing, two existing credits at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, one dependent, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

First, I need to create five distinct individuals. Each should have unique names and specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, IT technician, etc. Each person's business purpose should vary too—like starting a café, opening a repair shop, launching a consulting firm, etc.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should be concise, no formatting, and properly ended. Let me brainstorm names and roles. Maybe:

1. Ahmed, a scientific research assistant wanting to start a lab supply business.
2. Luis, an electrician planning to open a repair shop.
3. Rajesh, an IT technician aiming to launch a tech consulting firm.
4. Michael, a carpenter looking to expand his workshop.
5. Tarek, a logistics coordinator planning to start a delivery service.

Now, each needs specific details. For example, Ahmed has been working at a university for 5 years, has a savings bond of 300 DM, lives in his own apartment, has a used car, and has two existing loans for a laptop and bicycle, both paid. His business idea is a lab supply store to support local researchers.

I need to ensure each letter includes their job, years employed, savings amount, residence duration, existing credits, and how the loan will be used. Also, emphasize timely repayment based on their credit history. Each should have a unique angle but stick to the profile constraints. Avoid repetition in business purposes and personal details. Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Make sure the letters are short but comprehensive, ending with a polite thank you and signature.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Leipzig. I have worked there for 5 years and currently earn a stable monthly salary of 2,800 DM. I am applying for a 5,742 DM loan to establish a small laboratory supply business which will provide equipment to local research institutions. I have saved 300 DM in a government bond and rent a residence I have occupied for 2 years. Though I do not currently hold a checking account I have consistently repaid two existing credits with your bank a 1,200 DM laptop loan and a 600 DM bicycle loan. I own a used car and live in my own apartment. With this loan I will generate income through contracts with three universities and repay installments of 220 DM monthly. I am a registered foreign worker with a 31 year-old dependent daughter to support but I assure you my disciplined financial habits will ensure timely repayment.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Mohamed
