Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details. 

The profile says the person has a checking account with less than 200 DM, has had it for 72 months (which is 6 years). Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is for radio/television. The credit amount is 5595 DM. Savings account is between 100-500 DM. Present employment since 1-4 years. Installment rate is 2. Personal status is male, married or widowed. No other debtors or guarantors. Present residence since 2 years. Property is car or other. Age 24. No other installment plans. Housing is own. Number of existing credits at this bank is 1. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

First, I need to create five different people based on this profile. Let me note the key points each person should have: they are foreign workers, aged 24, married or widowed with one dependent, employed as skilled workers or officials for 1-4 years, have a car or other property, own their housing, have a savings account between 100-500 DM, and a checking account under 200 DM. They have a good credit history, no other debts, and need a loan for radio/television.

Wait, the purpose is radio/television. That seems a bit odd for a loan amount of 5595 DM. Maybe in the context of the time (since DM is Deutsche Mark), perhaps it's for a business-related purchase? Or maybe it's for a more expensive item. Maybe the person is using the loan for a specific purpose related to their job or to improve their living situation. Let me think of plausible scenarios.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let me come up with five different scenarios. Let's vary the job roles, maybe different nationalities as foreign workers, different reasons for needing the loan (though the purpose is fixed as radio/television, but maybe they can phrase it as purchasing equipment or a necessary appliance). Also, need to mention their stable employment, good credit history, savings, residence, etc.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say he's a scientific research assistant. The profile mentions "skilled employee" so maybe that's a good role. He's been working for 8 years (since the duration is 1-4 years, wait no, the duration in months for employment is 1-4 years, so 12-48 months. Since present employment since:1 <= ... <4 years. So the person has been in their current job for between 1 to 4 years. Let me pick specific numbers, like 2.5 years, or 3 years. Also, age is 24, so if they've been in their current job for 2 years, they might have changed jobs once. But since they are a foreign worker, maybe they came to the country and started working there.

Let me think of each person's unique attributes:

1. Scientific research assistant, 8 years in the field (but current job for 3 years), married with one child, savings 300 DM, owns a car, works at a university.

2. Technical draftsman, 2 years in current job, married, no children (widowed with one dependent?), owns a motorcycle, works at a manufacturing firm.

Wait, the profile says dependents:1. So each person has one dependent. Personal status is male, married or widowed. So maybe one is married with a child, another is widowed with a child, etc.

Third person: Let's say he's a public administration officer, 4 years in current job, married, owns a car, savings 200 DM.

Fourth: Maybe a mechanic, 1.5 years in current job, married, owns a car, savings 400 DM.

Fifth: A teacher's assistant, 2 years employed, widowed with a child, owns a bicycle, savings 150 DM.

Each needs to explain why they need the loan for radio/television. Maybe they need it for a business purpose, like a shop for electronics, or for home use to stay informed, or for educational purposes. Since the purpose is fixed, but they can frame it in different contexts.

Also, they should mention their stable job, good credit history, savings, residence, etc. Each letter should be concise, not too long. Let me draft each one with these elements.

Make sure each letter has specific numbers: e.g., 8 years in profession, 3 years at current job, 24 years old, savings of 300 DM, etc. Also, mention the existing credit paid back, no other debts, own housing, etc.

I need to avoid formatting, just plain text. Each letter should start with a salutation, state the purpose, explain their situation, why they need the loan, their ability to repay, and a closing.

Let me start writing each letter step by step, ensuring all profile attributes are covered with specific instances.

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,595 DM to purchase a professional radio equipment set for my role as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin. At 24 years old, I have worked in this field for 8 years and have been employed at my current position for 3 years. My husband and I have lived in our owned apartment for 2 years and have one young child to care for. Though my checking account balance is modest (180 DM), I maintain a savings account with 300 DM and have consistently repaid my existing car loan through this bank. As a foreign worker from Poland, I value financial responsibility and aim to use this loan to enhance my research efficiency. My stable income and punctual repayment history assure you of my reliability.  

Sincerely  
Tomasz Kowalski
