Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person doesn't have a checking account. They have a 24-month duration. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is radio/television, so each person needs a loan for that. The amount is 2397 DM. Savings are between 500-1000 DM. They've been employed for at least 7 years. Installment rate is 3. Single male, no other debtors. Residence for 2 years. Property is car or other. Age 35. Other installment plans with the bank. Housing is own. Two existing credits at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. One dependent. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered.

Each letter needs to be specific. Let me think of different professions that fit "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, teacher, IT technician, and a mechanic. Each should have unique details.

First person: Scientific research assistant. Let's say he works at a university. He wants to buy a TV for his apartment. He has savings of 600 DM. Lives in own housing, stable job for 8 years. No checking account but manages savings. Trustworthy because of credit history.

Second: Electrician. Maybe self-employed? Wait, the profile says present employment since >=7 years. If he's self-employed, that's okay. He needs a radio for his workshop. Savings 700 DM. Has a car. Paid back previous loans. Trustworthy.

Third: Teacher. Public school teacher with 7 years. Wants a TV for relaxation. Savings 550 DM. Lives in own home. Has a dependent child. No checking account but uses savings. Reliable payments.

Fourth: IT technician. Works for a company, 9 years. Needs a TV for home entertainment. Savings 800 DM. Has a car. No checking account but manages through savings. Paid credits on time.

Fifth: Auto mechanic. Owns a repair shop, employed there for 7 years. Loan for TV. Savings 900 DM. Owns home. Trustworthy with repayment.

Each letter should mention the purpose, financial situation (savings, employment duration, existing credits), and trustworthiness. Make sure each has specific numbers and roles. Avoid generic terms. Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Also, each should end properly without formatting. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are concise and meet the requirements.

**Letter 1: Scientific Research Assistant**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to request a loan of 2397 DM to purchase a television for my personal use. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin with 8 years of employment, I have a stable income and a strong commitment to repaying debts responsibly. I currently hold two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have paid back diligently. Though I do not maintain a checking account, my savings account holds 600 DM, and I own a car as collateral. I reside in my own home and have lived there for 2 years. My single status with one dependent does not hinder my ability to manage monthly installments, which I am confident I can handle alongside my current bank installment plans. I kindly ask for your trust in my reliability and financial discipline.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Reinhardt  

**Letter 2: Certified Electrician**  
Dear Bank Manager,  

I am applying for a loan to purchase a radio/television to improve communication in my workshop. With 7 years of experience as a certified electrician at Weiss Engineering, I have a steady income and a proven track record of repaying two existing loans with your institution. I do not have a checking account but maintain 700 DM in savings. My job security, combined with my ownership of a vehicle and a 2-year residency in my own housing, demonstrates my stability. At 35 years old, I am single with one dependent and have no other debts. My telephone number is listed for easy contact. I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling all installment payments promptly.  

Respectfully,  
Lars Müller  

**Letter 3: Public School Teacher**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I seek a loan of 2397 DM to acquire a television for my household. As a public school teacher in Dresden with 9 years of service, my employment provides consistent earnings. I have no checking account but hold 550 DM in savings bonds. I have always repaid my previous credits responsibly, including the two active ones with your bank. I own my home and have resided there for 2 years. My single status with one child does not affect my ability to manage finances, as evidenced by my adherence to existing installment plans. I am confident in my capacity to meet repayment terms.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Fischer  

**Letter 4: IT Support Technician**  
Dear Bank Official,  

I am requesting a loan to purchase a television, which I will use for home entertainment. As an IT support technician at TechNova Solutions for 9 years, my income is stable, and I have no outstanding debts beyond the two loans I currently repay with your bank. I do not have a checking account but maintain 800 DM in a savings account. I own a car and reside in my own apartment, which I have called home for 2 years. At 35, I am single with one dependent and have no other installment obligations besides my bank commitments. My credit history reflects punctual repayments, and I am eager to extend this reliability to this new loan.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jan Schulz  

**Letter 5: Auto Mechanic**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I would like to apply for a loan of 2397 DM to buy a television for my household. With 7 years of experience as an auto mechanic at AutoFix Garage, I have a secure income and a history of fulfilling financial obligations. I have repaid all prior credits without issue, including the two I currently hold with your bank. My savings account contains 900 DM, and I own a vehicle as personal property. I live in my own home, which I have occupied for 2 years. As a single man with one dependent, I manage my finances carefully, adhering to my installment plans. I assure you of my trustworthiness and ability to meet repayment terms.  

Respectfully,  
Andreas Weber
