Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me note them down:

- Existing checking account: less than 0 DM, duration 6 months.
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly.
- Purpose: radio/television.
- Credit amount: 2647 DM.
- Savings: 500-1000 DM.
- Employment since 1-4 years.
- Installment rate: 2.
- Male, single, no other debtors/guarantors.
- Residence since 3 years, property: real estate, age 44.
- No other installment plans, housing: rent, 1 existing credit at the bank.
- Job: skilled employee or official, dependents: 2, no telephone, foreign worker: yes.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So I need to vary the job roles, maybe different countries of origin, specific reasons for the loan (radio/television could be for a business, personal use, etc.), and show trustworthiness through repayment history and savings.

Let me brainstorm five different scenarios:

1. A foreign worker in Germany, working as a skilled employee, wants to buy a TV for his family. He has a good credit history, some savings, and stable employment. Maybe he's from Eastern Europe.

2. Another foreign worker, perhaps from Asia, working as an official in a local government office. Needs a radio for his business, like a small shop for news. He has real estate, which shows commitment.

3. A third person, maybe from the Middle East, working as a technician. The TV is for his children's education, showing responsibility. He's been in the job for 3 years.

4. A fourth individual from South America, working as an IT official. The radio is for his restaurant to provide entertainment. He has savings and a stable job.

5. A fifth person from Africa, a skilled worker in construction. The TV is for a community center he's involved in. Shows community contribution and trustworthiness.

Each letter should mention their specific job, duration of employment, savings, residence, credit history, and why they need the loan. Also, emphasize timely repayments and stability. Avoid generic terms; use specific numbers like 8 years, 3 years, etc., as per the profile.

Need to ensure each letter is concise, starts with their name and address, date, bank address, subject, body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and a polite closing.

Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. For example, each has 2 dependents, foreign worker, savings between 500-1000 DM, etc.

Make sure the purpose is radio/television but vary the context (personal, business, education, community, etc.). Also, mention the existing credit at the bank and that it's been paid back.

Avoid formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Keep each letter short, maybe 150-200 words.

Now, draft each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered with specific details.

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,647 DM to purchase a television for my family. As a 44-year-old foreign worker from Poland, I have been employed as a mechanical technician in Munich for 3 years. My current employer, [Company Name], values my reliability, and I have no intention of leaving this stable position.  

I maintain a checking account here, though it is occasionally overdrawn due to irregular utility payments.

I have already repaid one credit with your bank and consistently meet installment obligations.  

This television will provide educational content for my two children and improve our quality of life. With my monthly income of 3,200 DM and no other debts, I can comfortably manage the 2 DM installment rate. I reside in my rented apartment for the past 3 years and assure you of timely repayments.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for further discussion.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
