Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me note them down:

- Checking account balance: between 0 and 200 DM
- Duration of checking account: 30 months
- Credit history: past delays in payments
- Purpose: business
- Credit amount: 2503 DM
- Savings account/bonds: 100-500 DM
- Employment duration: at least 7 years
- Installment rate: 4
- Male, single, no other debtors/guarantors
- Residence since 2 years
- Property: building society savings or life insurance
- Age: 41
- Other installment plans: stores
- Housing: own
- Number of existing credits at the bank: 2
- Job: skilled employee or official
- Dependents: 1
- No telephone
- Foreign worker: yes

Each letter should be from a different person, so I need to vary the scenarios while sticking to the profile. Let me brainstorm different roles and situations.

First person: Maybe a scientific research assistant. The job fits the "skilled employee" part. He could be looking to start a small business related to his field. His savings are low but exist. He has past credit issues but has been employed for 8 years. He's a foreign worker living in his own house, with a dependent.

Second person: Maybe a teacher. Teachers are often considered officials. He wants to open a small educational workshop. He has a savings account, but not much. He's had past payment issues but is now managing his finances better. He has another installment plan for a store purchase.

Third person: A technical support officer. He wants to start a repair service. He's been in his job for 7 years, has a building society savings. His residence is only 2 years, but he's stable otherwise.

Fourth person: A public administration official. Maybe he wants to invest in a small office supplies business. He's a foreign worker, single, with a dependent. His credit history had delays but he's improved.

Fifth person: A maintenance supervisor. He wants to start a cleaning service. He's been employed for 9 years, has savings between 100-500 DM. He's had past issues but is now on track.

Now, for each letter, I need to include:

- Why they're applying (business purpose)
- Financial situation (checking account, savings, existing credits)
- Trustworthiness (stable job, residence, property, no other debtors)

Make sure each has specific details. For example, instead of "skilled employee", use specific roles like "scientific research assistant".

Check that each letter is concise, doesn't cut off, and has a proper ending. Avoid formatting. Use the exact numbers from the profile: 8 years, 2503 DM, etc.

Let me start drafting each letter, ensuring they are distinct and fit the profile.

Dear Bank Loan Committee  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, a 41-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt. I have been employed for 8 years and currently hold a checking account with your bank for 2.5 years, with a balance of 150 DM. Despite a past delay in repaying a student loan, I have since maintained consistent payments on my two existing credits here. I am applying for a 2,503 DM loan to fund a small lab equipment rental service, which I believe will capitalize on my expertise. I own a modest apartment and hold a building society savings agreement. With a stable income and one dependent to support, I am committed to repaying this loan through the business’s projected monthly revenue of 800 DM.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Loan Review Panel  

I am Lukas Meyer, 41, a primary school teacher in Munich with 7 years of employment at my current position. I have resided at my current address for 2 years and maintain a savings account with 400 DM. My checking account, active for 30 months, holds 80 DM. While I admit to a past credit oversight due to medical expenses, I have since prioritized financial responsibility. I seek 2,503 DM to launch a tutoring center for disadvantaged students. My stable salary, combined with my existing two small credits (both in good standing), demonstrates my reliability. As a homeowner with life insurance and a dependent daughter to care for, I assure you this loan will be repaid through the tutoring service’s earnings.  

Respectfully  
Lukas Meyer

Dear Bank Officials  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, 41, a technical support officer at Siemens since 2018. I have a 2-year residence in my current rental home and a checking account with your bank for 2.5 years, currently holding 90 DM. I own a savings bond valued at 300 DM. I acknowledge a previous late payment on a car loan but have since improved my habits. I request 2,503 DM to establish a mobile phone repair kiosk. My job provides a monthly income of 1,200 DM, and I already service two small bank credits. As a foreign worker with a dependent mother living with me, I am motivated to succeed. Repayment will come from the kiosk’s projected 500 DM monthly profit.  

Yours faithfully  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Lending Team  

I am Thomas Weber, 41, a public administration official in Berlin employed since 2016. My checking account (30-month history, 180 DM balance) and savings account (280 DM) reflect my cautious approach to finances. I admit to a past delay in a credit card payment but have resolved this. I apply for 2,503 DM to start a freelance office supplies consulting business. I own a life insurance policy and live in my own apartment. With a stable income of 1,400 DM and one child to support, I am confident in repaying this loan through the business’s 300 DM monthly earnings. My two existing credits with your bank are current.  

Sincerely  
Thomas Weber

Dear Loan Committee  

I am Carlos Fernández, 41, a maintenance supervisor at a logistics company since 2015. I have resided in my home for 2 years and hold a building society savings agreement. My checking account (2.5 years old, 120 DM) and 200 DM in savings demonstrate my financial discipline.

With a monthly income of 1,100 DM and one dependent, I assure you this loan will be repaid through the cleaning service’s 400 DM monthly revenue. My two existing bank credits are up to date.  

Respectfully
