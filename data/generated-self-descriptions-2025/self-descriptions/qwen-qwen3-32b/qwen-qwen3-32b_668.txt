Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

First, the profile details: The person has a checking account with less than 200 DM, has had it for 30 months. Good credit history with all credits paid back. Purpose is furniture/equipment, loan amount 3496 DM. Savings account over 1000 DM. Employment for 1-3 years, male, single, no dependents? Wait, no, dependents are 2. Owns a car or other property. Age 34. Other installment plans with stores. Owns housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Has a phone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

So each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of different scenarios. Let's vary the jobs, maybe. First, a scientific research assistant. Second, an official, maybe in administration. Third, a skilled worker like electrician. Fourth, a teacher (if that's considered an official). Fifth, maybe a technical draftsman. Each with specific details.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan (furniture/equipment), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They need to mention their savings, current employment, existing good credit history, etc. Also, specific numbers: e.g., 8 years of work experience, 2 years at current job, etc. Let me make sure to include all required elements without being generic.

For example, first person: Scientific research assistant at a university, 8 years in field, current job for 2 years. Savings 1500 DM. Needs furniture for new apartment. Trustworthy because of timely payments, stable job, own home, dependents.

Second person: Municipal administrative officer, 6 years experience, 2.5 years at current job. Savings 1200 DM. Needs equipment for home office. Trustworthy for similar reasons.

Third: Electrician, self-employed? Wait, profile says job is skilled employee, so maybe employed. Let's say works for a construction company, 7 years in job, 2 years at current position. Needs to buy tools. Savings 1100 DM.

Fourth: Teacher at a primary school, 5 years teaching, 3 years at current school. Savings 1300 DM. Needs furniture for family room. Has a good credit history.

Fifth: Technical draftsman in engineering firm, 9 years experience, 1.5 years at current job. Savings 1400 DM. Needs to upgrade home office equipment for work.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Conclude with thanks and signature.

Need to make sure each has specific numbers and roles, not generic. Also check that all profile elements are addressed: checking account duration, savings, employment duration, existing credit, dependents, property, etc.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are concise and cover all points without being too long. Avoid repetition between letters by varying the specifics. Also, ensure that each person's situation is unique enough but fits the profile. Check that the loan amount is 3496 DM, and the installment rate is 4 (maybe 4% or DM per month? Probably the latter, but since it's in the profile, maybe just mention the installment plan with stores as existing. Maybe mention that they manage other installments, showing responsibility.

Also, each person has 2 dependents, so mention that they have two children or similar. Own housing, so mention owning a home. Foreign worker registered under their name – maybe they have a relative or someone registered as a foreign worker under their name, perhaps a family member living with them. Not sure how to phrase that naturally, but include it as part of their situation.

Okay, let me start writing each letter with these points in mind.

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

As a 34-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Leipzig with eight years of experience in my field, I am applying for a loan of 3,496 DM to purchase new furniture for my recently renovated apartment.

My savings account holds 1,500 DM, and I have consistently maintained a checking account with your bank for 30 months without overdrafts.  

I currently have one existing credit with your bank, a car loan paid in full as agreed, and I manage monthly installments for a store-purchased computer. I own a two-bedroom home in Dresden and support two dependents, my mother and younger brother, who reside with me. A foreign worker, my cousin, is officially registered under my name for legal residency. My punctual repayment history and secure employment make me a reliable candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing this further.

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to request a 3,496 DM loan to equip my home office, which is essential for my role as a municipal administrative officer in Munich. At 34, I have six years of public sector experience and have held my current position for 2.5 years, earning 3,100 DM monthly. My savings account contains 1,200 DM, and I have no outstanding debts beyond a paid car loan through your bank.  

I have maintained a checking account with your institution for two and a half years and have always met repayment deadlines. I reside in my own apartment for two years and support two children from a previous marriage. A registered foreign worker, my uncle, lives under my care legally. My stable income, combined with my history of repaying one existing credit (a bicycle loan) and managing store installments, assures you of my reliability.  

Thank you for your trust. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan responsibly.  

Respectfully,  
[Your Name]
