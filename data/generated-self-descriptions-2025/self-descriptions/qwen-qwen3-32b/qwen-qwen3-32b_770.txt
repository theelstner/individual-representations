Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile has several key points: checking account balance less than 200 DM, 12 months duration, critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, purpose is furniture/equipment, loan amount 3617 DM, savings under 100 DM, employed for at least 7 years, single male with one dependent, no other debtors, residence for 4 years, property like a car, age 28, renting, 3 existing credits at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the specific details. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different job roles, reasons for the loan, and slight variations in personal circumstances. Let me brainstorm some possibilities:

1. A scientific research assistant needing furniture for a new lab setup.
2. An IT technician wanting to upgrade home office equipment for remote work.
3. A teacher needing to replace old classroom furniture.
4. A mechanic looking to purchase tools for a side business.
5. A civil servant upgrading home equipment for a dependent's needs.

Each person should explain their financial situation, why they need the loan, and their trustworthiness. They should mention their stable job, existing credits at the bank, residence duration, and other factors. I need to make sure each letter is concise, doesn't cut off, and ends properly. Also, avoid formatting. Let me start drafting each one, making sure to use specific details instead of generic terms.

For the first one, the scientific research assistant: He's been working at a university for 8 years, needs furniture for a new lab. Existing credits are for lab equipment. Emphasize his stable job and existing credits at the bank. Mention his dependent, residence since 2019, and that he's a registered foreign worker. Highlight timely repayments despite critical credit history.

Second, IT technician: Works for a tech firm, 7 years in job. Needs to upgrade home office equipment for remote work. Has three existing credits for software licenses. Stress his steady income, residence since 2020, and that he's on track with payments. Maybe mention his savings are low but he's committed to repay.

Third, teacher: Needs furniture for classroom. Employed at a school for 9 years. Existing credits for educational materials. Highlight his long-term employment, residence since 2019, and that he's a responsible borrower despite past credit issues.

Fourth, mechanic: Starting a side business, needs tools. Works at a garage, 8 years. Existing credits for initial setup. Emphasize steady income, plans to repay with side business profits, residence since 2020, and commitment to payments.

Fifth, civil servant: Upgrading home equipment for a dependent. Works in municipal services, 7 years. Existing credits for previous home repairs. Stress stable government job, long-term residence, and reliable payment history.

I need to check each letter for the specific numbers: 8 years employment, age 28, 4 years residence, etc. Also, ensure each has unique job roles and loan purposes. Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan. Make sure each ends with a proper closing, no formatting. Let me write each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered concisely.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Lars Müller and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin where I have worked for the past 8 years. I am applying for a loan of 3617 DM to purchase new laboratory furniture and equipment needed for an upcoming research project. My current checking account balance is 150 DM and my savings account holds 80 DM. Despite a critical credit history due to past student loans I have consistently made payments on my three existing credits with your bank. I reside in my current apartment for 4 years and have no other debtors or guarantors. As a registered foreign worker I have built a stable income and am committed to repaying this loan through my monthly salary. I kindly request your approval to support my professional development.  

Sincerely
