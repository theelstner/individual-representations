Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the points.

First, the profile details are: no checking account, 28 months duration, credit history of all credits at this bank paid back duly, purpose is a used car, credit amount 7824, savings account unknown/no, present employment less than 1 year, installment rate 3, male single, guarantor for other debtors, residence since 4 years, property is real estate, age 40, other installment plans with bank, housing is rent, 2 existing credits at bank, job is skilled employee/official, 2 dependents, has a telephone, foreign worker registered under their name.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe use different jobs like electrician, mechanic, etc. Also, the purpose is a used car, but maybe each person has a slightly different reason for needing the car—commuting for work, children's activities, starting a business, etc.

Let me start with the first person. Let's pick a job: scientific research assistant. They need a car for commuting. They have a guarantor, maybe a sibling. They have real estate, so maybe they own a condo. They have two dependents, perhaps two children. They’ve been in their residence for 4 years. They have two existing credits, maybe a mortgage and a previous car loan. They have a good credit history. Since they don't have a checking account, maybe they use a different banking method. They need the installment rate to be manageable with their income.

Second person: Maybe a teacher or another skilled profession. Let's say a maintenance technician. Purpose could be to transport children to school and for work. Guarantor could be a parent. They might have a small real estate investment, like a rental property. Their employment is new (<1 year), but they have prior experience. They need the loan to have reliable transport.

Third person: Maybe a healthcare worker, like a nurse. The car is needed for shifts and dependents. Guarantor could be a cousin. They might have real estate as a house they own. They mention their stable housing and existing credits (like a personal loan and a credit card). They highlight their responsibility in repaying past loans.

Fourth person: Perhaps an IT support specialist. The car is for commuting and freelance gigs. Guarantor is a friend. They mention their real estate as an apartment. They have another installment plan with the bank for a laptop. They emphasize their steady income and dependents.

Fifth person: Maybe a mechanic. The car is needed for work and family. Guarantor is an uncle. They own a small property. They mention their new job but previous experience in the same field. They highlight their savings potential even without a savings account.

I need to make sure each letter includes all the profile elements but with specific details. Also, each should end properly without formatting. Let me check each required attribute is addressed in each letter: checking account status, duration (28 months?), credit history, purpose, amount, savings, employment duration, installment rate, personal status (single male), guarantor, residence duration, property, age, other installment plans, housing, existing credits, job, dependents, telephone, foreign worker.

Wait, the duration in the profile is 28 months—so each person has been at their current job for 28 months? Wait, no—the "Duration in month:28" is part of the profile. Wait, looking back: the profile says "Duration in month:28"—probably the duration of the existing checking account? But the checking account status is "no checking account". Hmm. Maybe that's a different duration. Wait, original profile says:

Status of existing checking account: no checking account

Duration in month:28

So maybe that's the duration of something else? Maybe the duration of their current employment? Or residence? Wait, "Present employment since:... < 1 year"—so employment is less than a year. So maybe "Duration in month:28" refers to something else. Maybe the duration of their current residence? But "Present residence since:4" (years?), but the profile says "4" for present residence since. Wait, original says:

Profile:

Duration in month:28

Present residence since:4

So maybe "Duration in month:28" refers to the duration of their current employment? But present employment is "<1 year" which is less than 12 months. But 28 months is over two years. There's a conflict here. Wait, maybe the "Duration in month:28" is a different field. Let me check the original problem statement again.

The user provided a profile with various attributes. The "Duration in month:28" is under the profile. The "Present employment since:... < 1 year" is another attribute. So perhaps the "Duration in month:28" refers to the duration of their current residence? Since present residence since:4 (years?), but 28 months is about 2 years 4 months, conflicting with "present residence since:4"—maybe that's 4 years? There might be a mistake in the profile data. But since the user says to invent specific instances for generic attributes, maybe I can resolve that.

Assuming that "Duration in month:28" refers to the time at their current residence (28 months is about 2 years 4 months), but the profile says "Present residence since:4"—maybe that's 4 years. Hmm. Maybe there's inconsistency. To resolve, perhaps "Duration in month:28" refers to the duration of their current employment, but since present employment is less than 1 year, that's conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake. Since the user says to invent specific instances, perhaps I can adjust. For example, maybe the "Duration in month:28" refers to the time they have had their current job, but since present employment is less than 1 year, that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the "Duration in month:28" refers to something else. Maybe the duration of their existing credits? Or the duration of their relationship with the bank? Since they have two existing credits at the bank, maybe they've been with the bank for 28 months. But the user says to invent specific instances, so maybe I can clarify that in each letter. For example, in each letter, mention that they have been a customer of the bank for 28 months, during which they have managed two credits responsibly. That could work. So that's the "Duration in month:28"—time as a bank customer. That makes sense and avoids conflict with other attributes.

So each applicant has been with the bank for 28 months (about 2 years 4 months), has two existing credits there, paid back duly. They don't have a checking account but have a savings account or not—profile says savings account/bonds: unknown/no savings account. So each person doesn't have a savings account.

Each has a guarantor. They are single males, 40 years old, with two dependents, living in rented housing, owning real estate (so maybe they own a property elsewhere?), have another installment plan with the bank (like a loan or credit card), and are foreign workers registered.

Now, for each letter, I need to personify different people. Let me start drafting.

First person: Let's say a scientific research assistant. He needs a used car to commute to work. He has a guarantor, maybe a sibling. He owns real estate (a small apartment). He's been at his current job for less than a year but has 8 years of experience. He mentions his good credit history with the bank, two existing credits (maybe a mortgage and a previous car loan). He has dependents, so reliable transport is essential.

Second person: A maintenance technician. Guarantor is his father. He needs the car for work and to transport his kids. He has real estate as an investment property. He's been in his current residence for 4 years. His employment is new but he has prior experience. He emphasizes his timely repayments.

Third person: A nurse. Guarantor is his sister. The car is for night shifts and family needs. He owns a house. He has a stable housing situation and existing credits (personal loan and credit card). He highlights his responsibility.

Fourth person: IT support specialist. Guarantor is a friend. The car is for freelance work and commuting. He has a rental apartment. He mentions another installment plan for a laptop. He has two dependents and wants to ensure their needs.

Fifth person: A mechanic. Guarantor is his uncle. The car is for work and family. He owns a small property. He has been in his job less than a year but has prior experience. He wants to show reliability.

Each letter should be concise, mention the purpose, financial situation (income, existing credits, guarantor), trustworthiness (credit history, guarantor, real estate ownership), and end politely.

Now, let me write each letter with these specifics, making sure to include all required elements without formatting.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to request a loan of 7824 to purchase a used car. As a scientific research assistant at a biotech firm, I require reliable transportation to commute 45 minutes daily to my workplace. I have worked in this field for 8 years, though I started my current position 8 months ago. I am a 40-year-old single father with two children, living in a rented apartment while owning a small condo as property.  

Though I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained two credits with your bank over 28 months—both repaid punctually—as well as an installment plan for laboratory equipment. My brother, a civil engineer, has kindly agreed to act as guarantor. I reside in my current home for 4 years and own a telephone. This car will significantly reduce my commuting stress and ensure my children’s school drop-offs are efficient.  

I assure you of my commitment to repayment, supported by my stable income and real estate assets. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 7824 loan for a used car to support my role as a maintenance technician at a manufacturing plant. With 10 years of industry experience and my current job for 9 months, I need a vehicle to transport tools and attend off-site repairs. I am 40, single, and care for my two young cousins, who live with me.  

I own a vacation cabin as property and rent my primary residence. While I lack a savings account, I have consistently repaid two prior loans with your bank—the first for machinery, the second for coursework—over 28 months. My father, a retired teacher, will guarantee this loan. I have lived in my current apartment for 4 years and manage an installment plan for a power tool set.  

This car will improve my job performance and family logistics. I kindly ask for your trust in my financial responsibility.  

Best regards,  
Tobias Fischer

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 7824 loan to buy a used car, essential for my night shifts as an emergency nurse. With 12 years of healthcare experience and my current role for 6 months, reliable transport is critical for my 10 PM–7 AM schedule and to safely transport my two children.  

I own a townhouse and rent a second property, though I do not maintain a checking account. My credit history with your bank includes a 28-month track record of repaying two loans—a medical equipment loan and a vacation fund—without default. My cousin, a financial analyst, has agreed to co-sign. I reside in my current home for 4 years and hold a bank installment plan for a home security system.  

This vehicle will ensure my punctuality at work and family commitments. I am confident in my ability to meet repayment terms.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Jan Novak

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I request a 7824 loan for a used car to expand my freelance IT support business. As a systems analyst with 7 years’ experience, I need a vehicle to reach clients across the region. I am 40, single, and support my sister’s two children, who depend on me financially.  

Though I lack a savings account, I have repaid two loans with your bank—first for certification courses, then for a laptop—over 28 months. My friend, a software developer, will act as guarantor. I own a small apartment and rent a garage, having lived in my residence for 4 years. My monthly installment for a server rental is paid via bank plan.  

This car will increase my client base and income, ensuring timely repayments. I appreciate your confidence in my reliability.  

Yours faithfully,  
Erik Jensen
