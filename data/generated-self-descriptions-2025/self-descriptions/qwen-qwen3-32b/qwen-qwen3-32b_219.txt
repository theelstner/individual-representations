Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with at least 200 DM and salary assignments for at least one year. The loan duration is 36 months, credit history shows existing credits paid back duly, purpose is radio/television, amount 3913 DM. Savings account/bonds less than 100 DM. Present employment since 1 to 4 years. Installment rate 2. Male, single, no other debtors/guarantors. Residence since 2 years. Property: real estate. Age 23. No other installment plans. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

I need to create five different people with specific roles instead of generic terms. Let's think of different jobs that fit "skilled employee / official." Maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, IT technician, teacher, and a mechanic. Each should have unique scenarios but adhere to the profile.

For each letter, the structure should be: introduce themselves, state the purpose of the loan (radio/television), explain their financial situation (employment duration, existing credit paid back, checking account status), mention their residence, property, dependents, and why they're trustworthy. Also, include specific numbers where possible, like exact years of employment, age, etc.

Let me start with the first one. Let's take a scientific research assistant. He's 23, employed for 3 years, living in his own house, has a dependent (maybe a child?), has a savings account under 100 DM, but has a good credit history. He needs the TV for educational purposes or to stay updated with research.

Second, an electrician. Maybe he's been working for 2 years, has a dependent, similar setup. The TV could be for following industry news or training programs.

Third, an IT technician. Perhaps he's been in his job for 3 years, needs the TV for keeping up with tech trends, has a dependent, own housing.

Fourth, a teacher. Maybe he's been teaching for 2 years, needs the TV for educational content or to create lesson plans.

Fifth, a mechanic. He's been employed for 1.5 years, needs the TV for maybe watching tutorials or staying updated on car models.

Each letter should be concise, not too long. Make sure they all have different specific details but fit the profile. Also, ensure that each mentions the existing credit paid back, the checking account status, residence duration, and other profile points.

Check for each letter: purpose (radio/TV), financial situation (employment duration, salary assignments over a year, checking account >=200 DM), credit history, savings <100 DM, residence since 2 years, property real estate, age 23, single, male, dependents 1, telephone yes, foreign worker registered.

Avoid generic terms. Use specific job titles, exact years (like 3 years instead of >=7), etc. Make sure each letter ends properly with a closing.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered without repetition in the examples.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Lars Müller, 23 years old, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, where I have been employed for 3 years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 3913 DM to purchase a high-quality television for my home. As a single father to my 4-year-old daughter, I believe having a reliable TV will provide educational content for her and a way for me to unwind after work.  

I have maintained a checking account with your bank for 18 months, with consistent salary deposits for over a year. My current employer has recognized my reliability, and I have no late payments on my existing credit, a student loan I repaid fully six months ago. I reside in my own apartment in a rented property since February 2022 and own real estate inherited from my grandfather. Though my savings account holds only 80 DM, I manage my finances responsibly, as evidenced by my punctual repayment history.  

I kindly request your approval, confident in my stable income and commitment to fulfilling obligations. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Lars Müller  



Dear Sir or Madam  

I am Thomas Becker, 23, an electrician at Siemens since June 2022. I seek a 3913 DM loan to buy a television for my apartment. As a single man with a 2-year-old son in daycare, I want to ensure we have access to quality programming during our limited time together.  

I have held a checking account with your bank for 14 months, with regular salary deposits. My current job provides a steady income, and I have no other debts beyond the one existing credit I’ve paid on time—my previous bicycle loan. I’ve lived at my current address since January 2023 and own a small inherited property in Munich. While my savings account contains 50 DM, I have always prioritized timely bill payments and financial responsibility.  

Your support would mean a great deal to me. I assure you of my dedication to repaying this loan as agreed. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully  
Thomas Becker  



Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Jan Schröder, 23, an IT technician at a local tech firm since March 2023. I am applying for a 3913 DM loan to purchase a television, which I will use to follow industry webinars and stay updated on cybersecurity trends critical to my work.  

I have maintained a checking account with your bank for 13 months, with consistent salary assignments. My employer values my performance, and I have no delinquencies on my existing credit—a laptop loan repaid in full last year. I reside in my own home, purchased by my parents and now in my name, since 2022. Though my savings account holds 30 DM, I manage my budget carefully, as reflected in my flawless repayment history.  

I am confident in my ability to meet monthly installments and appreciate your thoughtful review of my application.  

Kind regards  
Jan Schröder  



Dear Sir or Madam  

I am Felix Weber, 23, a primary school teacher at Hamburg’s Nordstadt School, employed since August 2022. I request a 3913 DM loan to acquire a television for my household. As a single parent to my 6-year-old son, I need a device for educational programming and to connect with family via video calls.  

I have a checking account with your bank for 15 months, with uninterrupted salary deposits. My teaching contract guarantees a stable income, and I have no other debts aside from the one credit I’ve repaid—my initial teaching certification loan. I have lived at my current residence since December 2022 and own a family-owned real estate property in Lübeck. My savings account currently holds 20 DM, but I prioritize financial discipline, as demonstrated by my timely credit repayments.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling all obligations.  

Yours faithfully  
Felix Weber  



Dear Sir or Madam

I have a checking account with your bank for 12 months, with regular salary deposits. My employer confirms my reliability, and I have no late payments on my existing credit—a toolset loan I repaid last year.

My savings account contains 10 DM, but my consistent income and responsible spending habits ensure I meet financial commitments.  

I kindly ask for your approval, assured of my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for your time.
