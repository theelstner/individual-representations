Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me list them out:

- Checking account balance: between 0 and 200 DM, so maybe around 150 DM?
- Duration of checking account: 18 months.
- Credit history: critical account or other existing credits not at this bank. So maybe they had some issues before but are now looking to improve.
- Purpose: new car. So each person is applying for a car loan.
- Credit amount: 884 DM. That's the loan amount.
- Savings account/bonds: less than 100 DM. So maybe they don't have significant savings.
- Employment since at least 7 years. Let's pick 8 years for specificity.
- Installment rate: 4. Not sure what that means exactly, but maybe the monthly payment is 4% or 4 DM? Maybe the latter since the loan is 884 DM. If the installment is 4 DM, that seems low. Wait, maybe it's 4%? Let me check. The user says "installment rate:4", perhaps meaning the percentage. But 4% of 884 is 35.36 DM per month. Hmm. Maybe it's a typo or a specific term. Since the user says to use specific instances, maybe I should just use "4% monthly installment rate" as part of the letter.

Personal status: male, single. So each applicant is a single man.

Other debtors/guarantors: none. So they don't have anyone else to back the loan.

Present residence since 4 years. So they've lived in the same place for 4 years.

Property: car or other. Maybe they already own a car or some property.

Age: 36.

Other installment plans: bank. So they have existing installment plans with the bank.

Housing: own. They own their home.

Number of existing credits at this bank: 1. So they already have one loan here.

Job: skilled employee or official. Let me pick specific jobs, like scientific research assistant, IT technician, teacher, electrician, etc.

Dependents: 2. So each has two dependents, maybe children.

Telephone: yes. They have a phone.

Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name. So they might be a registered foreign worker.

Now, each letter needs to be from a different person with these attributes. Let me create five different personas.

First person: Scientific research assistant, 8 years employed, owns a car, has one existing credit at the bank (maybe a mortgage?), living in own housing, two children, etc.

Second person: Maybe a teacher or IT technician. Let me vary the jobs. Let's pick IT technician, electrician, teacher, mechanic, and another job.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan (car purchase), their financial situation (current job, existing credit, residence duration, etc.), and why they're trustworthy (stable job, own home, etc.).

I need to make sure each letter is concise, specific, and doesn't use any formatting. Also, avoid cutting off the letters. Each should have a proper ending.

Let me start drafting the first one.

First person: Scientific research assistant at a university, 8 years in job, owns a home, has a 4-year-old residence, two children, existing credit for a mortgage, wants a new car for commuting. He has a critical credit history due to a previous car loan that was managed poorly, but now wants to prove responsibility. He has a stable income, owns property, and has a phone. The loan amount is 884 DM for a new car to replace an old one that's unreliable.

Second person: IT technician at a software company, 7 years employed, owns a condo, two dependents. Existing credit is for a laptop purchase. Needs a new car for work-related travel. Critical credit history from a previous credit card debt, now settled. Stable job, owns home, has a phone.

Third person: Electrician working for a construction firm, 8 years in job, owns a house, two kids. Existing credit for tools. Needs a van for work and family use. Critical history from a past loan, now resolved. Stable income, own home, phone.

Fourth person: Teacher at a secondary school, 8 years employed, owns a house, two children. Existing credit for educational materials. Needs a car for commuting and school activities. Critical credit history from a previous personal loan, now improved. Stable job, own home, phone.

Fifth person: Automotive mechanic, 8 years in job, owns a workshop, two dependents. Existing credit for workshop equipment. Needs a car for customer pickups and parts delivery. Critical credit history from a previous loan, now managed. Stable job, own home, phone.

Each letter should mention the specific job, duration, residence, existing credit, purpose of new loan, and why they're trustworthy. Also, the checking account details: 18 months old, balance around 200 DM. Savings less than 100 DM. Installment rate 4% or DM. Foreign worker registered.

Need to make sure each letter is unique but fits the profile. Let me check for each required attribute in each letter.

Now, writing each letter with these details, keeping them short and concise.

**Letter 1: Scientific Research Assistant**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 884 DM to purchase a reliable vehicle for my daily commute and research fieldwork. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past 8 years, I earn a stable monthly income of 2,200 DM. I currently reside in my own apartment, having lived there for 4 years, and have one existing credit at this bank for a home improvement loan, which I repay punctually.  

Though my credit history includes a previously critical account due to an old car loan, I have since resolved this by maintaining timely payments for my current obligations. My checking account, held for 18 months, has a balance of 150 DM, and I maintain a savings account with 80 DM. I own a used car valued at 3,000 DM and have no dependents beyond my two children. My registered foreign worker status and ownership of housing further underscore my stability. I assure you that my disciplined financial habits and steady employment make me a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

**Letter 2: IT Technician**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I respectfully request a 884 DM loan to replace my aging car, which is essential for my work as an IT technician at TechNova Solutions. With 8 years of employment and a monthly salary of 2,100 DM, I have consistently met my financial responsibilities. I own a condominium and have resided in my current home for 4 years. My existing credit at this bank—a laptop purchase loan—remains in good standing.  

My credit history reflects a past critical account due to a mismanaged credit card, but I have since prioritized budgeting to avoid recurrence. My checking account, open for 18 months, holds 180 DM, while my savings amount to 90 DM. As a homeowner and registered foreign worker, I value financial responsibility. I will use this loan to invest in a vehicle that supports my professional duties and family needs.  

I am confident my stable income and commitment to repayment make me a reliable applicant.  

Gratefully,  
Markus Fischer

**Letter 3: Electrician**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 884 DM loan to purchase a van for my electrician business and family transportation. Employed at Urban Construction for 8 years, I earn 2,000 DM monthly and own a house in Nuremberg, where I’ve lived for 4 years. My existing credit at this bank—a tool-purchase loan—is fully manageable, and I have no other debts.  

My credit history includes a critical account from a prior auto loan, which I resolved by refinancing. My checking account, held for 18 months, has 120 DM, and my savings total 70 DM. As a homeowner and registered foreign worker, I take pride in my punctual payments and stable employment. This loan will enhance my ability to serve clients and support my two children.  

I assure you of my dedication to repaying this loan responsibly.  

Respectfully,  
Thomas Weber

**Letter 4: Secondary School Teacher**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 884 DM loan to acquire a vehicle for commuting and transporting students on school trips. As a secondary school teacher in Dresden for 8 years, I receive a monthly salary of 1,900 DM and reside in my own home, which I’ve owned for 4 years. My existing credit at this bank—a loan for classroom supplies—is repaid without issue.  

A past critical account stemmed from a personal loan I settled early, and I have since focused on financial discipline. My checking account, open for 18 months, holds 170 DM, with 60 DM in savings. My stable job, homeownership, and registered foreign worker status reflect my reliability. This car will improve my ability to fulfill my professional and parental duties.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Sebastian Hoffmann

**Letter 5: Automotive Mechanic**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I request a 884 DM loan to purchase a car for my automotive repair business and family use. Working at AutoFix Garage for 8 years, I earn 1,950 DM monthly and own a house in Stuttgart, where I’ve lived for 4 years. My existing credit at this bank—a workshop equipment loan—is current, and I have no additional debts.  

My credit history includes a critical account from a prior vehicle loan, which I addressed by improving my payment habits. My checking account, held for 18 months, has 140 DM, and my savings amount to 50 DM. As a homeowner and registered foreign worker, I am committed to financial responsibility. This loan will directly support my business and household needs.  

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan promptly.  

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Becker
