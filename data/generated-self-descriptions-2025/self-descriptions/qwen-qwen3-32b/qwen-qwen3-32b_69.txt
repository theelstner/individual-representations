Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a foreign worker, age 22, married with one dependent. They have a checking account with less than 200 DM, but a savings account over 1000 DM. They've been employed for 1-4 years, have a credit history of paying back past credits, and want a car loan of 1007 DM. They own their home, have no other debts, and one existing credit at the bank.

I need to create five different individuals. Let me think of different job roles under "skilled employee/official." Maybe a scientific research assistant, a nurse, a teacher, an IT technician, and a mechanic. Each should have specific details. For example, the first could be a research assistant with 8 years of experience, but wait, the profile says present employment since 1-4 years. So maybe each person has been in their current job for 2, 3, 1, etc., years. Also, they are foreign workers, so maybe from different countries? Let me check the profile again.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan (car for commuting, maybe?), their financial situation (savings, current job), and why they're trustworthy (credit history, stable job). Let me start drafting the first one.

First person: Scientific research assistant, 28 years old? Wait, the age in the profile is 22. Wait, the profile says age 22. Wait, no, the profile says age is 22. Wait, the user wrote "Age:22" in the profile. But that's conflicting because someone 22 might have only been employed for 1-4 years. But maybe they started working at 18? Let me confirm. The profile says age is 22. So each person is 22 years old. Hmm, that's young. But maybe they are skilled workers. Maybe they have a part-time job or just started their career. Let me adjust accordingly.

First person: Let's say a 22-year-old foreign worker from India, working as a scientific research assistant for 2 years. Married with a dependent. They need a car to commute to work since they live in a rural area. They have savings of 1200 DM. They have a stable job and have paid back previous credits. They own their home. They can mention their stable income and savings as trustworthiness.

Second person: Maybe a nurse from the Philippines, 22, married, working in a clinic for 3 years. Needs a car for shifts. Savings of 1500 DM. Stable job, paid back past loans. Owns home. No other debts.

Third: A teacher's assistant from Vietnam, 22, working for 1.5 years. Needs a car to reach remote schools. Savings 1100 DM. Has a contract for next year. Owns property. Trustworthy because of good credit history.

Fourth: IT technician from Nigeria, 22, employed for 3 years, married. Needs a car for client visits. Savings 1300 DM. Stable job, owns home. No other debts.

Fifth: Auto mechanic from Brazil, 22, self-employed for 2 years. Needs a car for customer pickups. Savings 1400 DM. Has a workshop, owns home. Good payment history.

Wait, but the job in the profile is "skilled employee / official". Self-employed might not fit. Maybe adjust the fifth to be an apprentice or a certified mechanic employed at a garage.

Also, check the duration of the checking account is 12 months. Each person has had their checking account for 12 months. And present residence since 1 month? Wait, the profile says "Present residence since:1" which is in months? So they've lived in their current residence for 1 month. That's recent. Maybe they moved recently. Should mention that briefly? Maybe not necessary in the letters unless it affects trustworthiness. Since they own real estate, maybe they have property elsewhere.

Also, no telephone. Maybe they don't have a landline, but that's not critical. The letters should focus on the positive aspects: savings, stable job, good credit history, ownership of property.

Each letter should be concise, so maybe 3-4 paragraphs. Start with introduction, purpose, financial situation, why trustworthy, and closing.

Let me start drafting the first letter for the scientific research assistant. Make sure to include specific numbers: credit amount 1007 DM, installment rate 4. Maybe mention the exact amount they can pay monthly. But the installment rate is 4, which might be DM per month? The user didn't specify, but maybe just state they can manage the payments with their income.

Also, the existing credit at the bank is 1. So they already have one credit, which they are paying back duly. Mention that in the letters.

Okay, let's put it all together for each person, ensuring each has unique job roles, employment duration, savings amounts, and specific reasons for the car loan.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, and I am a 22-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin.

My current checking account has been active for 12 months, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

My parents in the Philippines provide additional financial support, and I have a 12-month checking account with your bank.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Tran Minh, a 22-year-old teacher’s assistant at a primary school in Dresden. I have worked there for 18 months and earn 1,600 DM per month. I am married and live in my own home, which I inherited from my grandparents. I am applying for a 1,007 DM loan to buy a compact car to transport students with special needs to field trips, as our school currently lacks a dedicated vehicle.  

I maintain a savings account with 1,100 DM and have paid off my previous student loan without delay. My employment contract will renew in six months, and I have no other debts. Though I have only lived in my current apartment for one month, I own property in Hanoi, Vietnam. As a responsible foreign worker, I prioritize financial stability and community service.  

This loan will directly benefit both my career and the children I support. I am confident in my ability to repay the installment of 4 DM monthly. Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
Tran Minh
