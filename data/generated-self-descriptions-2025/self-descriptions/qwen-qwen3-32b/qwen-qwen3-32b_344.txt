Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

The profile mentions a foreign worker who is a skilled employee or official, male, married or widowed, 25 years old, has a checking account with less than 200 DM, has a savings account between 500-1000 DM, has a credit history of paying back existing credits, the purpose is for radio/television, credit amount 3213 DM, employment duration less than a year, installment rate 1, no other debtors, residence since 3 years, property is real estate, one existing credit at the bank, housing is rent, no other installment plans, one dependent, no telephone, and foreign worker yes.

First, I need to create five different people. Each should have unique job roles, names, and specific details. Let me brainstorm some jobs that fit "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, IT technician, teacher, and a nurse. Each will have different reasons for needing the loan for radio/television. Maybe they want to set up a home entertainment system, improve their workspace, for educational purposes, etc.

For each letter, I need to mention their current job, duration (at least 7 years as per the original prompt, but the user specified to replace generic attributes with specific instances. Wait, the original profile says "Present employment since:... < 1 year". Wait, the user's instruction says to replace generic attributes with specific instances. The original profile says "Present employment since: ... < 1 year"—so the person has been in their current job for less than a year. But the user's example says "8 years" for "scientific research assistant" instead of ">=7 years". Wait, maybe there was a typo. Let me check again.

Looking back, the user's instruction says: "Invent specific instances of all generic attributes from the profile (e.g. 'scientific research assistant' instead of 'skilled employee', '8 years' instead of '>= 7 years', etc.)". The original profile for "Present employment since" is "... < 1 year", so the person has been in their current job for less than a year. But in the example, they used "8 years" for a different attribute. Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The user wants specific numbers for duration. The profile says "Duration in month:18"—so the checking account has been open for 18 months. Also, "Present employment since: ... < 1 year"—so current job is less than a year. But the user wants specific instances. For example, instead of ">=7 years", use "8 years". But here, the employment duration is less than a year, so maybe specify like "6 months".

Wait, the user's example in the instruction says "8 years" instead of ">=7 years"—so they want to take a generic attribute and give it a specific value. In the original profile, the employment duration is less than 1 year. So for each letter, the person has been in their current job for, say, 6 months. But the user wants each letter to have different specifics. So maybe for each person, their employment duration is different, like 5 months, 8 months, etc., but all under a year.

Also, the purpose is radio/television. Each person can have a slightly different reason for needing the loan for this purpose. Maybe one wants to buy a TV for their family, another for a home office setup, etc.

Let me outline each person:

1. Scientific Research Assistant: Let's say he's working at a university, has been in the job for 8 months (but wait, the profile says present employment since <1 year, so 8 months is okay). He wants to buy a TV for his family. He has savings between 500-1000 DM. He's a foreign worker, married with one dependent. He has real estate, so maybe he owns property. But the housing is rent—so he rents a place but owns property elsewhere? Maybe he's renting currently but has property in his home country.

Wait, the profile says "Property: real estate"—so he owns real estate. So each person should mention owning real estate. Also, they have a checking account for 18 months, savings between 500-1000 DM, credit history of paying back duly, etc.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy.

Let me start drafting the first letter. Let's take the first person as a Scientific Research Assistant. Name could be Ahmed. He's been employed for 8 months, has a checking account for 18 months, savings 700 DM, owns property (maybe in his home country), married with one child. He needs the TV for family use. He has a stable job, even though he's been there less than a year, but maybe he has a good credit history.

Second person: Electrician. Name: Carlos. Employed for 10 months (but wait, less than a year is 11 months max). Let's say 10 months. He's a foreign worker, married, one dependent. He wants the TV for his home. He mentions his savings, real estate, and that he's paid back previous credits.

Third person: IT Technician. Name: Rajesh. Employed for 9 months. Needs the TV for his family. Maybe he mentions that he's in a stable field and expects promotions.

Fourth person: Teacher. Name: Michael. Employed for 7 months. Maybe he's a substitute teacher or new to the country. He needs the TV for educational purposes, to follow news for his job.

Fifth person: Nurse. Name: Yuki. Employed for 5 months. She's a foreign worker, married, one child. She needs the TV for her family. She mentions her stable job in healthcare and her savings.

Each letter should start with their name and address, date, bank's address, salutation, body, closing. But since the user says to not use any formatting, I'll just write the content without the formal structure. Wait, the user says "Do not use any formatting on the letter." So just the text of the letter, not the envelope or anything. So each letter is just the body, starting with "Dear [Bank Name]" and ending with "Sincerely, [Name]".

Each letter should be concise, so maybe 3-4 paragraphs. Let me make sure each person has different specifics. Also, check that all attributes from the profile are covered in each letter: checking account <200 DM, duration 18 months, credit history good, purpose radio/TV, amount 3213 DM, savings 500-1000, employment <1 year, married/widowed (but since they have dependents, probably married), no other debtors, residence since 3 years, real estate, age 25, housing rent, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled worker, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker.

I need to make sure each letter includes these points, but phrased naturally. For example, mentioning the savings account, current employment duration, purpose, etc.

Let me start drafting each one, making sure each has unique details. Also, the user wants each letter from a different person, so different names, jobs, reasons for the loan, maybe different aspects of their financial situation.
