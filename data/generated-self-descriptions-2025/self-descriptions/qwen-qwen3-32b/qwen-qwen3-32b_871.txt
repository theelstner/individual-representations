Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with less than 0 DM, so the person might be in a bit of a financial bind. The duration of the checking account is 12 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly, which is good. The purpose is furniture or equipment, and the amount is 652 DM. Savings account is under 100 DM. Employment duration is at least 7 years. The person is female, divorced/separated/married, has no other debtors or guarantors, has lived in the current residence for 4 months, has property like a building society savings agreement or life insurance, is 24 years old, no other installment plans, rents housing, has one existing credit at the bank, job is skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, and is a foreign worker.

I need to create five different scenarios. Let me think of different professions or situations that fit the job description (skilled employee/official). Maybe a scientific research assistant, a nurse, a teacher, an office administrator, and a social worker. Each should have a unique reason for needing the loan for furniture or equipment. Let me start with the first one.

For the scientific research assistant: She's been working for 8 years, maybe at a university or lab. She needs a new desk and chair for her home office. She's a foreign worker, so perhaps she recently moved and needs to set up her workspace. She has a dependent, maybe a child. Her existing credit is a car loan paid on time. She's been in the country for 4 months, so maybe she's in a new residence. She has a life insurance policy as property. Since she has no telephone, maybe she uses a mobile phone, but the profile says none, so maybe she doesn't have a landline. She's trustworthy because she's paid back previous credits. 

Second, a nurse. She works in a hospital, 8 years as a staff nurse. Needs to furnish a living room for her family. She's divorced, has one child. She has a building society savings agreement. Maybe she's renting a new apartment. She's a foreign worker, perhaps from another EU country. She has one existing credit, maybe a student loan. She's been employed for 8 years. 

Third, a teacher. Maybe a primary school teacher. Needs classroom equipment like a projector or desks. Wait, the purpose is furniture/equipment for personal use, not business. So maybe she needs furniture for her home. She's married, separated, with one dependent. She's been in her job for 7 years. She has a savings agreement. 

Fourth, an office administrator. Works for a government office. Needs to replace old furniture in her rented apartment. She's a foreign worker, maybe from another country, has been in the current residence for 4 months. She has a life insurance. 

Fifth, a social worker. Needs to set up a home office with a new desk and chair. She's been employed as a social worker for 7 years. Divorced, one child. 

Each letter needs to mention the specific job, duration of employment (at least 7 years, so maybe 7 or 8), the purpose (furniture/equipment), the existing credit paid back, savings under 100 DM, residence since 4 months, property as savings agreement or insurance, age 24, etc. Also, mention why they are trustworthy: timely payments, stable job, etc.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, doesn't use formatting, and ends properly. Let me check each attribute is covered in each letter. Also, avoid generic terms and use specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant," "nurse," etc. Each should have a unique scenario but fit the profile.

Dear Bank Loan Committee  

My name is Anika Müller, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, where I have worked for the past 8 years. I am applying for a loan of 652 DM to purchase a new ergonomic desk and chair for my home office. Due to recent health issues, my current workspace has become uncomfortable, and I need proper equipment to maintain productivity. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 50 DM, I have consistently paid my existing car loan (amount: 3,000 DM) on time for the past 18 months. I have resided in my current rented apartment for 4 months and hold a life insurance policy as collateral. As a foreign worker from India, I have no other debts and prioritize financial responsibility. I kindly request your support to improve my work conditions.  

Sincerely,  
Anika Müller

Dear Bank Loan Committee  

I am Selma Özdemir, a staff nurse at Charité Hospital, employed for 7 years. I seek a 652 DM loan to furnish a living room for my daughter and me after recently separating from my husband. My current checking account is temporarily negative due to unexpected medical bills, but I have no other installment plans and have repaid my previous 5,000 DM student loan in full. I have lived in my rented flat for 4 months and maintain a building society savings agreement. As a foreign worker from Turkey, I value stability—my income covers monthly expenses with 4 DM to spare. I assure you of timely repayments, as I have always prioritized financial responsibility.  

Thank you for considering my application.
