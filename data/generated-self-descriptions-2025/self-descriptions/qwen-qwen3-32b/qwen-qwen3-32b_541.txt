Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

First, the profile has several key points. The applicant has a checking account with at least 200 DM and has been assigned a salary for at least a year. The loan duration is 18 months, credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 3049 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Present employment less than a year. Installment rate 1. Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 1 year. Property: building society savings or life insurance. Age 45. Other installment plans: stores. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: unskilled - resident. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So, for each letter, I need to create a unique person with specific details. Let me break down the generic attributes into specific ones. For example, instead of "unskilled - resident," maybe a housekeeper or cleaner. The job should be unskilled but resident. The person is a foreign worker, so maybe from another country, living in Germany. Age 45, female, married or separated, with one dependent, maybe a child or parent. They have a building society savings agreement. They have an existing credit paid back, so maybe a previous loan for something else. The purpose here is furniture/equipment, so they need to buy a sofa, kitchen equipment, etc. They have been employed for less than a year, so maybe recently moved or started a new job. They have a savings account under 100 DM, so not much savings. They have installment plans with stores, perhaps paying off appliances or electronics. They own their home. No telephone, so maybe they use a mobile phone or rely on other communication. They have a checking account for over a year with salary assignments. 

Let me think of five different scenarios. Each person should have a unique job, reason for needing furniture, maybe different family situations. For example:

1. A housekeeper from the Philippines working in Germany, needing a new sofa for her family since their old one broke. She's separated, has a child, and has been in her current job for 8 months.

2. A cleaner from Romania, recently moved to Germany, needs a kitchen set for her own house. She's married but separated, living with her mother as a dependent.

Wait, the dependents are 1. So maybe each has one dependent, like a child or elderly parent. Also, each should have different specifics for the job, maybe different countries as foreign workers. Let me outline five:

Person 1: Housekeeper from Mexico, separated, child dependent, needs furniture for a new apartment after moving.

Person 2: Cleaning assistant from Poland, married but separated, dependent is a parent, needs equipment for home office.

Person 3: Domestic helper from India, divorced, child, needs to replace old furniture after a flood.

Person 4: Housemaid from Vietnam, single mother, needs furniture for a child's room.

Person 5: Cleaning staff from Colombia, living with an elderly parent, needs kitchen equipment.

Each letter should explain their situation, why they need the loan, their financial stability (existing credit paid, current job, checking account), and trustworthiness. They all have the same profile parameters but different personal stories.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, specific, and doesn't use generic terms. Also, each should start with their name and address, date, bank address, and proper closing. No formatting, just plain text. Each letter should be self-contained.

Let me start drafting each one step by step, ensuring all profile attributes are covered with specific instances.

[Date: March 15, 2024]  

To the Management of Munich City Bank,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,049 DM to purchase new furniture for my home. As a housekeeper employed at a local hotel for the past 8 months, I have a stable monthly income of 1,200 DM, which I deposit into my checking account that has been active for over a year. My current employer, Frau Schneider, can confirm my reliability and work ethic.  

I am a 45-year-old Mexican national living in Germany for 10 years, residing in my own apartment since 2023. My son, my sole dependent, and I have outgrown our current furniture after recent repairs to our living room. I have already repaid a 2,000 DM loan for my daughter’s education through your bank in 2022, demonstrating my commitment to timely repayments. Though my savings account holds only 80 DM, I have a building society savings agreement and pay store installments for a recent washing machine purchase.  

I assure you of my ability to meet monthly payments, given my steady income and responsible financial history. I am willing to provide any additional documentation to support my application.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Alvarez

[Date: April 2, 2024]  

To the Loan Committee of Berlin Savings Bank,  

I request a 3,049 DM loan to equip my home office, which I use to manage my cleaning business contracts. At 45, I have worked as a freelance cleaner since relocating from Poland 11 months ago. My checking account, active for 14 months, receives my salary from three regular clients, including Herr Müller of the Berlin Medical Clinic.  

I am divorced, with my mother as my sole dependent, whom I support financially. Though my savings amount to 60 DM, I maintain a building society savings plan and have no outstanding debts beyond a 500 DM store installment for office supplies. My residence in Germany spans 6 years, and I own my apartment in Marzahn.  

I have repaid a prior 1,500 DM loan for my son’s university tuition through your bank without default. As a punctual worker and responsible borrower, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan within 18 months.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Aneta Kowalski

[Date: February 28, 2024]  

Hamburg Regional Bank,  

I seek a 3,049 DM loan to replace damaged furniture after recent flooding in my apartment. As a domestic helper for the Fischer family since June 2023, I earn 1,150 DM monthly, deposited into my checking account for over a year. My son, my sole dependent, and I have no savings beyond 45 DM but hold a life insurance policy through the Norddeutsche Lebensversicherung.  

I am a 45-year-old Indian national who has lived in Germany for 9 years. Though I have only worked at my current job for 9 months, my former employer, Frau Becker, can attest to my diligence during my 5-year tenure as a caregiver. I have repaid a 2,500 DM loan for home repairs through your bank in 2021.  

This loan is essential to restore our living space. I assure you of my commitment to repay through my stable income and disciplined budgeting.
