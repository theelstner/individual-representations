Okay, I need to create five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The duration is 18 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is a new car, credit amount 4380 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Employment since 1-4 years. Installment rate 3. Male, single, no other debtors. Residence since 4 years. Property: car or other. Age 35. No other installment plans. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: unskilled - resident. Dependents: 2. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

So for each letter, I need to invent specific instances. Let me think of different scenarios for five people. Each should have a unique job (since the profile says "unskilled - resident", maybe different unskilled jobs), different reasons for the car loan, maybe different aspects of their financial situation.

First person: Maybe a delivery driver. He needs a reliable car for work. He's been in his job for 3 years. Savings of 300 DM. Lives in the same residence for 4 years. Has a dependent child and a parent. Emphasize timely payments on existing credit.

Second person: Maybe a construction worker. Needs a car to commute longer distances. Employed for 2 years. Savings 200 DM. Dependents: spouse and child. Highlight responsibility with current credit.

Third: A maintenance technician. Needs a van for work tools. Job for 3 years. Savings 400 DM. Dependents: two children. Mention stable employment and home ownership.

Fourth: A warehouse worker. Car for job flexibility. Employed 1.5 years. Savings 150 DM. Dependents: partner and child. Emphasize foreign worker status and timely payments.

Fifth: A bus driver. Needs a car for family trips. Job for 2.5 years. Savings 250 DM. Dependents: two kids. Highlight residence duration and existing credit management.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date. Then address the bank, state purpose, explain financial situation, why trustworthy. Conclude with thanks and signature.

Check for specific numbers: age 35, duration 18 months (maybe checking account opened 1.5 years ago but negative balance?), savings between 100-500, installment rate 3 DM? Or 3%? Probably 3% interest rate. But maybe the installment rate is 3 DM per month? Not sure. Maybe the letters should mention the installment rate as 3% when referring to repayment ability.

Also, existing credit paid back duly. Each person has one existing credit at the bank, which they've managed well.

Need to make sure each letter is concise, no formatting, proper ending. Avoid generic terms. Use specific job titles, exact numbers where possible.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring each has unique details but fits the profile.

To the Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 4380 DM loan to purchase a reliable vehicle for my work as a delivery driver. With 3 years of employment at a logistics company, I earn a stable monthly income of 2200 DM. My current savings account holds 300 DM, and I have maintained a checking account for 18 months, though it occasionally dips into negative due to irregular fuel expenses. I have consistently repaid my existing 1500 DM credit for home repairs, which is now fully settled.  

Living in my own apartment for 4 years, I support my 5-year-old daughter and my elderly mother. My job requires frequent travel, and a new car will reduce repair costs while improving efficiency. I am committed to repaying this loan through my steady income and disciplined budgeting.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,  

As a construction worker employed for 2 years, I need a vehicle to commute to job sites 40 km from home. My monthly savings of 200 DM and stable 2000 DM salary demonstrate my ability to manage repayments. I have no overdue payments on my existing 1200 DM loan for tools, which I paid off over 12 months.  

My savings account currently holds 150 DM, and I reside in my owned home for 4 years. I am single but care for my 3-year-old son and my wife, who is a homemaker. A new car will ensure punctuality at work and reduce public transport costs.  

I assure you of my reliability, given my track record with previous credit and steady employment.  

Gratefully,  
[Your Name]

To the Bank’s Attention,  

I work as a maintenance technician at a manufacturing plant, a role I’ve held for 3 years. The loan for a new car is essential to transport equipment to client sites. My savings of 400 DM and monthly income of 2100 DM allow me to allocate 350 DM monthly toward repayments.  

I have fully repaid a prior 1800 DM credit for household appliances. My family includes two children, and we own our residence. My employer values my punctuality, which a dependable vehicle will sustain.  

I request your trust in my financial discipline and commitment to timely payments.  

Respectfully,

Dear Loan Committee,  

As a warehouse worker for 1.5 years, I seek a car to manage my 60 km daily commute efficiently. My savings account contains 150 DM, and I earn 1900 DM monthly. I have responsibly repaid a 1000 DM loan for my sister’s education over 10 months.  

I reside in my own home for 4 years and support my partner and 2-year-old child. Though my checking account occasionally dips below zero due to medical expenses, my income remains stable. This loan will reduce transport costs and ensure job continuity.  

Thank you for your consideration.

To Whom It May Concern,  

I am a bus driver with 2.5 years of experience, applying for a car loan to replace my aging vehicle. My savings of 250 DM and 2000 DM monthly income allow me to commit to repayment installments. I have no defaults on my existing 1300 DM credit for a bicycle repair, which I settled in 6 months.  

I live in my owned residence for 4 years and care for two children. My job requires reliability, and a new car will ensure I meet work demands while safely transporting my family. My employer confirms my punctuality and dedication.  

I kindly request your approval based on my responsibility and stable earnings.  

Yours faithfully,
