Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile has several key points: existing checking account under 0 DM, duration 18 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is radio/television. Credit amount is 3190 DM. Savings account under 100 DM. Employment since 1-4 years. Female, divorced/separated/married, no other debtors. Residence since 2 years. Property: real estate. Age 24. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the specifics. Let me think of different scenarios for each person. Let me start with the first one. Maybe a scientific research assistant? The job is a skilled employee. Let's say she's from another country, maybe India, working in Germany. She needs the loan for a TV to stay updated with research. She has a real estate property, maybe inherited. She's divorced, has a child. She's been in her job for 2 years. She has an existing credit for a car, paid back. She mentions her stable income and property as security.

Second person: Maybe a nurse? Skilled employee. From the Philippines, working in Germany. Needs TV for professional development. She's been employed for 3 years. Lives in her own house, bought with family help. Divorced, one child. Existing credit for furniture. She can mention her steady income and real estate.

Third person: Office administrator from Brazil. Needs a TV for language courses. Employed for 1.5 years. Owns a small apartment. Married, separated, with a child. Existing credit for a laptop. She emphasizes her timely payments and property.

Fourth: Technical translator from Poland. Needs a TV to follow industry news. Employed for 2.5 years. Owns a house. Married, with one dependent. Existing credit for a camera. She highlights her stable job and real estate.

Fifth: Social worker from Nigeria. Needs a TV for community projects. Employed for 3 years. Owns a property. Single mother. Existing credit for a computer. She mentions her dedication and assets.

I need to make sure each letter includes the specific numbers: 18 months checking account, 2 years residence, 1 existing credit, age 24, savings under 100 DM, etc. Also, each should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and trustworthiness. Avoid generic terms, use concrete examples. Make sure each letter is concise, starts with sender info, date, bank address, subject, body, closing. No formatting, just plain text. Each letter should be a proper letter with all parts. Let me check each one for the required elements and uniqueness.

To the Loan Committee of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3190 DM to purchase a television for my household. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, I have been employed for 2.5 years and earn a stable income of 2400 DM monthly. My current checking account, open for 18 months, has a temporary negative balance due to recent medical expenses, but I have consistently repaid past credits, including a 2000 DM car loan settled in full last year.  

I own a small apartment in Garching, inherited from my family, and have resided there for 2 years. Though my savings account holds only 80 DM, I am a foreign worker from India with no additional debts and a strong commitment to timely repayments. This television will help me stay updated with global scientific developments, essential for my work. I kindly request your trust in my reliability and financial responsibility.  

Sincerely,  
Anita Sharma

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 3190 DM loan to acquire a television for my home. As a nurse at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, I have worked for 3 years and earn 2600 DM monthly. My checking account, open for 18 months, is currently overdrawn by 150 DM due to unexpected repairs, but I have no history of late payments on my existing 1500 DM furniture loan with your bank.  

I own a two-bedroom apartment in Neukölln, purchased with my parents’ support, and have lived there for 2 years. I am a divorced mother of one, and though my savings are minimal (90 DM), I am a foreign worker from the Philippines with a stable job and real estate to secure this loan. The television will aid in accessing professional training programs. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling repayment obligations.  

Respectfully,  
Maria Delgado

[Your Address]  
[City, Date]  

To the Loan Committee of [Bank Name],  

I am applying for a 3190 DM loan to purchase a television, crucial for my language studies as an office administrator at a Berlin tech firm. Employed for 1.5 years, I earn 2300 DM monthly.

As a separated mother of one, I have no other debts and no telephone, relying on mobile services. This loan will support my career growth through language courses. I am a foreign worker committed to timely repayments and trust your support.  

Yours faithfully,
