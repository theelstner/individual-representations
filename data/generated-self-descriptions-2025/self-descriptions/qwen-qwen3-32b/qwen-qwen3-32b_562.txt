Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, duration 24 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is a used car, credit amount 2964. Savings account unknown/no. Employment for >=7 years. Installment rate 4. Male, single, no other debtors. Residence since 4 years. Property unknown. Age 49. Other installment plans with bank. Housing for free. 1 existing credit at the bank. Job as skilled employee/official. Dependents: 2. Telephone yes. Foreign worker registered.

So each letter needs to be unique, with specific jobs, maybe different reasons for the car, different employment details. Let me brainstorm different roles for each person.

First person: Maybe a scientific research assistant. Let's say he works at a university or research institute. He needs a car to commute to work, maybe his current car broke down. He's been employed there for 8 years. He has dependents, maybe a partner and a child. He mentions his punctual credit history and stable job.

Second person: Could be a public official, like a town clerk. He needs a car for work-related travel, maybe visiting different locations. He's been in his job for 7 years. He mentions his housing situation, living in a rented apartment, and how the car will help his job performance.

Third person: Maybe an electrician. He needs a reliable car for client visits. He's self-employed but has been in the field for 9 years. Wait, the profile says "skilled employee / official". Maybe he's a skilled worker in a company, not self-employed. Let me adjust. Let's say a maintenance technician at a manufacturing plant, 8 years employed. Needs a car to get to shifts, especially since he has two dependents.

Fourth person: Perhaps a teacher or educator. Wait, teacher might be considered different. Maybe a technical draftsman in a government office. He needs a car for attending workshops or meetings. He's been working there for 7 years. His residence is stable, 4 years in the same place.

Fifth person: Maybe a logistics coordinator or something similar. Needs a car for transporting goods, but maybe that's too specific. Alternatively, a social worker who needs a car to visit clients. He's been employed for 8 years, has a stable income. Also, mentions the installment plan with the bank.

Each letter should mention why they need the car, their financial stability (existing credit paid back), employment duration, dependents, and why they're trustworthy. Also, mention the current negative checking account but maybe explain it as a temporary situation.

Let me make sure each letter has unique job roles, specific numbers (like 8 years, 7 years, etc.), different purposes for the car. Also, ensure that they don't have savings accounts, but maybe mention other assets or income sources. Since property is unknown, maybe they don't own any, but their job is stable.

Need to avoid generic terms. Instead of "skilled employee", use specific roles. Also, the foreign worker aspect: maybe one of them is a registered foreign worker, but since the profile says "registered under the customer's name", maybe it's a family member? Or perhaps it's part of their employment history. Maybe mention that in one of the letters.

Also, each letter should be concise, not too long. Start with addressing the bank, state purpose, explain financial situation, why they need the loan, and why they're trustworthy. End with thanks and signature.

Let me outline each letter:

1. Research assistant: University job, car for commuting, temporary negative balance due to recent expenses, but steady income.

2. Town clerk: Public sector job, need car for official visits, stable employment, punctual payments.

3. Maintenance technician: Manufacturing plant, car for reliable transport, supporting family, existing credit managed well.

4. Technical draftsman: Government office, car for attending meetings, stable residence, no savings but steady income.

5. Social worker: Non-profit organization, car for client visits, foreign worker status, temporary financial dip due to medical bills.

Each with different specifics. Now, write each letter with these points, ensuring they are distinct and meet all profile attributes.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Thomas Müller, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Duisburg-Essen, where I have worked for the past 8 years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,964 DM to purchase a used car. My current vehicle is no longer roadworthy, and I rely on a reliable car to commute 45 kilometers daily to my workplace.  

Although my checking account currently shows a minor deficit due to recent laboratory equipment repairs, I have consistently paid all previous credits in full, including my existing personal loan of 1,500 DM at this bank. I earn a stable monthly income of 3,200 DM, with 4% of my salary automatically deducted for installment plans. I reside in my parents’ home, which I have done for the past 4 years, and support my two children, who are both in secondary school.  

As someone with a long-standing employment history and a commitment to financial responsibility, I am confident in my ability to meet repayment terms. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Müller

My current checking account reflects a temporary shortfall due to recent home repairs, but I have maintained a flawless credit history, including the 1,200 DM loan I received from this bank 18 months ago.
