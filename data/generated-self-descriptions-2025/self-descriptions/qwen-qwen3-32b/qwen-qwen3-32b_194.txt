Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details. 

First, the profile has specific attributes that need to be converted into real examples. For instance, instead of "skilled employee," maybe use "scientific research assistant" or something similar. The checking account is between 0 and 200 DM, so maybe the person has a small account. The duration is 27 months, so they've had their checking account for 2 years and 3 months. Credit history is good, all previous credits paid back. The purpose is business, so each letter should mention a business-related reason. The credit amount is 3915 DM. Savings account is less than 100 DM. Present employment since 1 to 4 years, so maybe 2 years. Personal status is single male, no other debtors, residence since 2 years, property like a car, age 36, dependents 2, telephone yes, foreign worker registered.

I need to create five different scenarios. Each person should have a unique business purpose. Let me brainstorm different business ideas. Maybe a small retail store, a catering service, a repair shop, a delivery service, and a freelance consulting business. Each person's situation should reflect the profile attributes with specific details.

For each letter, I need to mention their current job, how long they've been employed, their savings, checking account duration, residence, dependents, and why they're trustworthy. They should explain the loan purpose, how they'll use the money, and their repayment plan. Also, include specific numbers where possible, like exact years of employment, exact duration of checking account, etc.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say a scientific research assistant applying for a loan to start a small lab supply store. He's been working at a university for 2.5 years, has a residence of 2 years, checking account for 27 months, savings less than 100 DM. He's single with two dependents. He'll use the loan for inventory and equipment, and he's confident in repayment due to steady income and a solid business plan.

Second person could be a freelance IT consultant. He's been in his job for 3 years, has a car, and wants to set up a home office. He's been in his residence for 2 years. Explains that his freelance income is stable, and he's managed to pay back previous loans. The loan will cover software licenses and equipment.

Third person: a catering service owner. He's worked as a chef in a restaurant for 3 years, wants to start his own catering business. Needs funds for kitchen equipment and marketing. He's living in his own house, has a car, and has a good credit history.

Fourth person: a repair shop owner. He's a skilled mechanic, been employed at a garage for 2.5 years. Wants to open his own shop. Needs money for tools and a workshop space. Has a steady income and a plan to repay the loan with the shop's profits.

Fifth person: a delivery service driver. He's been working as a courier for 3 years, wants to buy a van to start his own delivery service. He's been in his residence for 2 years, has a car, and has dependents. The loan will cover the van and initial operational costs. He'll use his existing job's income to make repayments.

Each letter should be concise, mention specific details from the profile, and end properly. Need to avoid generic terms and use the exact numbers and roles. Also, ensure that each person's reason for the loan is unique but fits under the business purpose. Make sure they all highlight their trustworthy nature by mentioning their credit history and stable employment.

Dear Bank Manager

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 3915 DM to establish a small laboratory supply store. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past 2 years and 9 months, I have developed extensive knowledge of lab equipment needs. Though my current savings account holds only 80 DM, I have maintained a checking account for 2 years and 3 months with consistent deposits. My employer has noted my reliability, and I have paid back a previous student loan in full. With two dependents living in our own home, I carefully manage our finances. The loan will fund inventory and a local storefront rental. I am confident my stable income and existing business plan ensure timely repayment.

Sincerely  
Lars Müller  

Dear Bank Manager

I seek a 3915 DM loan to launch a freelance IT consulting business. As a systems administrator at Siemens for 3 years, I have built a client base through contract work.

My single status allows me to dedicate focused effort to business growth. The loan will cover software licenses and office equipment. With my 3-year employment history and 4 DM monthly installment capacity, I am prepared to repay this loan responsibly.
