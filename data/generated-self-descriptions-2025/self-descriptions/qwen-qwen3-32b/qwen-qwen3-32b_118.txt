Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile has several key points. The checking account has less than 0 DM, which might be a red flag, but the credit history is good with existing credits paid back. The purpose is radio/television, and the amount is 7174 DM. The person has a savings account status as unknown or no account. Employment duration is 4-7 years, so I need to pick something in that range, like 5 years. The personal status is female, divorced/separated/married, with dependents of 1. They have a car or other property, own their housing, and have a job in management, self-employed, or highly qualified employee. Age is 30, and they have a telephone. Also, foreign worker registered under their name.

So, each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of five different job roles within the job category mentioned. The job category is management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, or officer. Let me pick specific roles: maybe a project manager, a freelance graphic designer, a senior IT officer, a restaurant owner, and a scientific research assistant. That gives five distinct professions.

Now, for each letter, I need to explain why they're applying for the loan (radio/television purpose), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let's tackle each one step by step.

First person: Project Manager. She's 30, married with one child. Employed at a construction firm for 5 years. Checking account is negative due to recent home repairs, but she has a good credit history. The loan is for a new TV for her family. She can mention her stable income and timely payments. Also, she owns a car and lives in her own home. Maybe she has a registered foreign worker as part of her household help.

Second person: Freelance Graphic Designer. She's 30, divorced with one child. Self-employed for 6 years. Savings account unknown because she's a freelancer, income varies. The loan is for a radio/TV for her home office. She can talk about her consistent clients and past credit repayment. Owns a car, lives in her own house. Maybe has a registered foreign worker helping with her business.

Third person: Senior IT Officer. 30, married, one dependent. Works at a tech company for 5 years. Checking account negative due to medical bills. Loan for a TV. She has a stable job, good credit history. Owns a car, owns home. Registered foreign worker as a domestic helper.

Fourth person: Restaurant Owner. 30, separated, one child. Owns a café for 4 years. Checking account negative due to seasonal fluctuations. Needs a radio/TV for the restaurant. Can mention steady cash flow, good credit, owns property. Has a registered foreign worker as part of staff.

Fifth person: Scientific Research Assistant. 30, married, one child. Works at a university for 6 years. Checking account negative due to recent lab equipment purchase. Loan for a TV. Stable employment, good credit, owns car and home. Registered foreign worker for household help.

Each letter needs to be concise, specific, and address the bank. They should explain their situation, financial status, and trustworthiness. Make sure not to use any formatting, just plain text. Also, ensure each letter ends properly without being cut off. Let me start drafting each one with these details in mind.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Anna Müller and I am a project manager at a construction company where I have worked for the past five years. I am writing to request a loan of 7174 DM to purchase a television for my family. Due to recent unexpected home repairs my checking account is temporarily in deficit but I have consistently paid all previous credits on time. I own a car and live in my own home and have maintained a stable income throughout my employment. As a responsible borrower I am confident in my ability to meet monthly installments given my secure job and strong credit history.  

Sincerely  
Anna Müller
