Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully to make sure each letter includes all the specific attributes.

The profile mentions a foreign worker, male, single, 33 years old, with a checking account under 200 DM, 36 months duration, good credit history, purpose is repairs, credit amount 2384 DM, savings under 100 DM, employment less than a year, installment rate 4, no other debtors, residence since 1 month, no property, one existing credit at the bank, unskilled job, one dependent, no phone. 

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I should vary the specifics. For example, different nationalities, jobs (though job is unskilled, maybe different types), reasons for repairs, maybe different countries they're from. Also, need to explain why they're trustworthy despite having a short employment period and low savings. Maybe emphasize their stable residence, good credit history, and existing credit with the bank.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, doesn't use formatting, and ends properly. Let me think of five different scenarios. Let's see:

1. A construction worker from Poland needing repairs for safety. 
2. A maintenance helper from Romania, repairs to avoid health issues.
3. A warehouse worker from Morocco, repairs for structural issues affecting family.
4. A cleaning staff from Nigeria, urgent roof repairs to prevent further damage.
5. A factory worker from India, electrical system upgrades for safety.

Each should mention their specific job, country, repair reason, and trustworthiness factors like timely payments, existing credit, stable residence. Also, address the short employment period by mentioning they're in a stable job or have prior experience. Maybe include dependents, like a child, to show responsibility. 

Need to avoid generic terms. Use exact numbers: 36 months, 2384 DM, 4% installment. Make sure each letter has a unique angle but fits the profile. Also, check that all elements from the profile are included in each letter. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are distinct yet adhere to the profile.

Dear Bank Manager  
My name is Carlos Mendez from Mexico. I am a construction worker employed at a local site for the past 11 months. I need 2384 DM to repair my apartment’s electrical system which has caused two minor fires. I have repaid my previous 500 DM loan for tools on time. Though I have been in Germany for 3 years and reside here for 36 months, I now earn 2200 DM monthly. My sister and child depend on me. I assure timely 4% installments as I prioritize stability for my family.  

Sincerely  
Carlos Mendez
