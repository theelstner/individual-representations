Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile includes details like the checking account status being below 0 DM, a 12-month duration, credit history of existing credits paid back, purpose for furniture/equipment, credit amount 708, savings under 100 DM, employment since 1-4 years, male single, guarantor, residence since 3 months, property as building society savings or life insurance, age 38, no other installment plans, own housing, one existing credit at the bank, job as unskilled resident, two dependents, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I need to vary the specifics. Let me think of different scenarios where someone might need a loan for furniture or equipment. Maybe a single father, a recent immigrant, someone upgrading their home, a small business owner needing equipment, or maybe a student? Wait, the job is unskilled, so maybe not a student. Let me think of different unskilled jobs and how they might need furniture or equipment.

First person: Maybe a foreign worker who's a construction laborer, needs furniture for a new apartment. He has a guarantor, maybe a relative. He's been in the country for 2 years, employed for 3 years. His savings are low, but he's paid back previous credits.

Second person: A single father working in a warehouse, needs to buy a used van for his job (equipment) to have reliable transport. He's been in the current residence for 3 months, maybe moved for a better job. Guarantor is a sibling.

Third person: A foreign worker in agriculture, needs to buy equipment for a small side business, like tools for a garden plot. He's been employed for 1 year, has a guarantor, and has a building society savings agreement.

Fourth person: Maybe someone working in hospitality, like a hotel cleaner, needs to furnish a rental property they just bought. They have dependents, guarantor is a cousin, and they've been in their job for 2 years.

Fifth person: A factory worker who wants to start a small repair service, needing equipment like tools and a workspace setup. They have a guarantor, maybe a friend from the same country, and have been in their residence for 3 months.

I need to make sure each letter includes the specific numbers from the profile: age 38, credit amount 708, 12 months, 3 years residence, etc. Also, mention the guarantor, existing credit paid back, savings under 100 DM, and so on. Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Keep them concise, no formatting, proper endings.

Let me start drafting each one, making sure to vary the jobs, purposes, and specific situations while sticking to the profile attributes.

**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 708 DM to purchase essential furniture for my new apartment. As a construction laborer employed for 3 years, I have a stable income but currently have no savings due to recent medical expenses for my 5-year-old son. I have a guarantor, my cousin Ahmed, who works as a mechanic in this city. Though my checking account is temporarily negative due to a delayed paycheck, I have consistently repaid my previous credit for a power tool set. I reside in my own home and have a building society savings agreement. I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments and appreciate your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Karim A.

**Letter 2**  
Dear Bank Officer,  

I seek a 708 DM loan to buy a used van to support my warehouse job, which I’ve held for 2 years. My current vehicle is unreliable, and without transport, I risk losing my position—my family of four depends on this income. I have no savings, as I prioritized my daughter’s school fees. My uncle, a local carpenter, agrees to guarantee the loan. Despite my checking account being overdrawn this month due to seasonal work fluctuations, I’ve never defaulted on my monthly 2 DM installment for my existing credit. Please consider my responsible history and stable housing.  

Respectfully,  
Lars M.

**Letter 3**  
To Whom It May Concern,  

As a foreign worker in agricultural labor for 1 year, I need 708 DM to purchase tools for a small vegetable plot I manage on the side. This income supplements my family’s needs, including my 8-year-old daughter’s education. My savings are minimal, as I regularly send money to relatives abroad. My neighbor, Mr. Hartmann, will act as guarantor. Though my residence here is recent, I’ve paid my sole existing credit in full—repairs for my workplace equipment. I own a life insurance policy and live in my own home. I am confident in my ability to meet repayments.  

Yours faithfully,  
Rajesh T.

**Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I apply for a 708 DM loan to furnish a rental property I’ve purchased to house my sister and her two children, who relocated here for treatment. My job as a hotel cleaner provides steady income, but my savings account is currently empty after covering their travel costs. My brother, a bus driver, guarantees this loan. I’ve maintained my existing credit for a refrigerator, repaid punctually for 12 months. Despite my checking account’s temporary deficit, I own property and have lived in my home for 3 years. I am committed to fulfilling all obligations.  

Sincerely,  
Markus H.

**Letter 5**  
Dear Bank Representative,  

I request a 708 DM loan to establish a small bicycle repair service, using tools purchased with this credit. As a factory worker with 4 years’ employment, I have no savings due to recent home repairs. My guarantor, Mr. Kumar, a local tailor, confirms my reliability. I have always repaid my prior credit for safety gear at work. While my checking account is currently negative from a family emergency, I reside in my own home and hold a building society savings agreement. I am eager to grow my income through this venture and assure timely repayments.  

Respectfully,  
Tobias R.
