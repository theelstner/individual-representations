Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says "no checking account," but they have a savings account/bonds between 500-1000 DM. The person has been in their current job for at least 7 years, is 30 years old, a single male with one dependent, lives in their own housing, has a car or other property, and is a foreign worker. The purpose of the loan is for radio/television, and they have an existing credit paid back duly. The credit amount is 2333 DM, installment rate 4. They have another credit at the same bank, no other installment plans except bank, no phone, and have been in residence for 2 years.

I need to create five different people. Let me brainstorm different jobs from the job category: management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, officer. Let me pick specific roles. For example, a project manager, a self-employed graphic designer, a data analyst, a non-commissioned officer, and a restaurant owner.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan (radio/television), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. I need to make sure each person has unique details but fits the profile. Let me start with the first one.

First person: Project Manager. Let's say he works for a construction company. He wants to buy a TV for his family. He has a stable job for 8 years, savings of 750 DM, owns a car, lives in his own apartment. He mentions his punctual repayment of previous loans, no dependents except one, and is a foreign worker from Germany.

Second person: Self-employed graphic designer. She's been in business for 7 years, has a savings account of 600 DM. Needs a radio for her home office. She owns a car, lives in her own housing, has a previous credit paid off. She mentions her steady income from clients.

Third person: Data analyst at a pharmaceutical company. Has been employed for 9 years, savings of 900 DM. Wants a TV for his family. He has a car, owns his home, and has a good credit history. He's a foreign worker from India.

Fourth person: Non-commissioned officer in the military. Stationed locally, has been in the same post for 7 years. Needs a radio for emergency updates. Has savings of 800 DM, owns a car, and has a stable income.

Fifth person: Owner of a small restaurant. Has been running the business for 8 years, has savings of 550 DM. Wants a TV for the waiting area. He has a good credit history, owns a delivery van, and has a stable income.

I need to make sure each letter includes all the required elements: purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Also, check that each has unique job roles, specific durations, savings amounts, and other details. Avoid generic terms, use specifics like exact years, exact savings amounts, specific job titles.

Now, structure each letter with the person's name, address, date, bank address, salutation, body paragraphs explaining the purpose, financial stability, repayment ability, and a polite closing. Make sure they are concise, no formatting, proper endings. Check that each letter is distinct and fits the profile parameters.
