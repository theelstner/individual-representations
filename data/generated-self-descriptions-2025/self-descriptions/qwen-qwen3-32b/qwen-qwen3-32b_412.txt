Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile mentions an existing checking account with a balance between 0 and 200 DM, held for 24 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is for radio/television. The credit amount is 1967 DM. Savings account is less than 100 DM. Present employment for at least 7 years. Personal status is female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 4 months. Property: car or other. Age 20. No other installment plans. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

Now, I need to create five different people. Let's vary their jobs, marital status, and specific circumstances. Let me think of different skilled jobs. Maybe a scientific research assistant, a nurse, a teacher, a mechanic, and an office administrator. Each should have unique details but fit the profile.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. The purpose is radio/television, so maybe each has a specific reason like educational purposes, home entertainment, etc.

Let me start with the first one: a scientific research assistant. She's 20, married with one dependent, has a car, been in her job for 8 years. She needs the TV for educational content. She mentions her savings, existing credit paid back, and stable job.

Second, a nurse. Maybe she's divorced, living in her own house, has a motorcycle. She wants a radio for her child. She can mention her steady income and timely payments.

Third, a teacher. Separated, has a car, needs a TV for her child's education. She has a 7-year teaching job.

Fourth, a mechanic. Married, owns a motorcycle, needs a TV for family. She has been working there for 7 years.

Fifth, an office administrator. Married, car, TV for her child's homework. She has a stable job and has always paid her debts.

I need to make sure each letter includes all the profile elements with specific numbers and details. Also, each should end properly without any formatting. Let me check each required attribute is covered in each letter: checking account duration, credit history, purpose, amount, savings, employment duration, personal status, residence, property, age, housing, existing credits, job, dependents, telephone, foreign worker status. 

Wait, the foreign worker is registered under their name. So each should mention that they are a registered foreign worker. Also, the installment rate is 4, which I think refers to the number of installments or the rate? Maybe it's the number of monthly installments. But in the letters, maybe just mention that they can manage the payments based on their income.

I need to make sure each letter is concise but covers all necessary points. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring specific details and varying the scenarios.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Anna Müller and I am a 20-year-old scientific research assistant at the Institute of Environmental Studies where I have worked for 8 years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 1967 DM to purchase a television for my home. As a single mother living with my 5-year-old daughter I believe having access to educational programming will greatly benefit her development.  

I currently maintain a checking account with your bank for 24 months with a balance of 150 DM and have always paid my previous credit on time. My monthly income covers my expenses and allows me to make regular payments. I own a car and reside in my own apartment which I have lived in for 4 months. Though my savings account holds only 80 DM I am committed to fulfilling this new obligation responsibly.  

As a registered foreign worker with a stable job and no other debts I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further.  

Sincerely  
Anna Müller
