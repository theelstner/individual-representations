Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile details are: checking account balance under 0 DM, duration 9 months. Credit history is critical with other credits not at this bank. Purpose is a new car, loan amount 2799 DM. Savings account under 100 DM. Employment since 1-4 years. Installment rate 2. Single male, no other debtors. Residence since 2 years. Property is real estate. Age 36. No other installment plans. Housing is rent. Two existing credits at this bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 2. No phone. Foreign worker: yes.

Each letter needs to be unique but fit these parameters. Let me think of different scenarios for five people. Maybe different job roles, reasons for the car, and specific numbers where applicable. For example, one could be a mechanic, another a teacher, maybe a nurse, an IT technician, and a construction worker. Each should explain their need for the car, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific details. For instance, the job title should be specific like "automotive mechanic" instead of just "skilled employee". Also, mention the exact duration of employment (e.g., 3 years), the number of dependents (2 children), and their current residence period (2 years). They should address their current financial situation, like the checking account being overdrawn but due to specific reasons, and how the loan will help them improve their situation.

Also, since they have existing credits at the bank, they should acknowledge that and show responsibility. Maybe mention timely payments. The car's purpose could vary: commuting to work, transporting dependents, starting a side business, etc. Each letter should have a unique angle. Also, they are foreign workers, so maybe mention their legal status or contributions.

I need to avoid generic terms. Instead of "critical account", say something like "occasional overdrawn due to irregular work hours". Make sure each letter is concise, starts with their name and address, date, bank's address, salutation, body paragraphs explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and a polite closing.

Check for each profile attribute to ensure all are covered. Let me start drafting each one step by step, making sure each is distinct and includes all required specifics.

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,799 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute as an automotive mechanic at a local garage. I have worked there for 3 years, earning a stable monthly income of 2,200 DM. My current checking account is occasionally overdrawn due to irregular payment cycles from clients, but I am committed to rectifying this by the end of the year.  

I reside in my rented apartment with my two children and have lived here for 2 years. Though my savings account holds less than 100 DM, I have two existing credits with this bank—both for tools and training—which I repay punctually. The car will allow me to reach my workplace and clients efficiently, increasing my productivity. I am a foreign worker with a valid residence permit and have no delinquencies in my employment history.  

I assure you of my trustworthiness through my steady job, real estate investment as collateral, and dedication to meeting my financial obligations. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Dear Sir or Madam,  

As a 36-year-old IT technician employed at a software firm for 2.5 years, I seek a 2,799 DM loan to purchase a reliable vehicle. My current car’s repair costs are unsustainable, and my checking account is temporarily negative due to recent medical expenses for my youngest child. I have a 9-month account history here and two existing credits (a laptop loan and a household appliance loan) in good standing.  

I rent a home in a safe neighborhood and own real estate in my hometown. My monthly income of 2,400 DM supports my two dependents, and I allocate 300 DM monthly toward savings, though my account remains below 100 DM due to recent bills. The new car will reduce transportation costs and ensure timely arrival at work.  

I am a foreign worker with a 5-year employment contract and have no history of defaults. I request this loan with the assurance that my income and assets will allow me to meet installments. Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am a single father of two and a certified nurse at a municipal hospital, working 12-hour shifts. I apply for a 2,799 DM car loan to replace my aging vehicle, which breaks down frequently during my night shifts. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 150 DM due to an unexpected tire replacement, but my 3-year employment history ensures a steady income of 2,100 DM monthly.  

I have resided in my rented apartment for 2 years and own a small property in my home country. Though my savings are minimal, I have consistently repaid my two existing bank credits—a 2021 furniture loan and a 2022 professional certification fee. As a foreign worker with a valid work permit, I prioritize financial responsibility.  

This loan will secure my transportation to work and provide a safer car for my children. I pledge to honor payments as proof of my reliability. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Dear Sir or Madam,  

As a 36-year-old construction site supervisor with 8 years of experience, I request a 2,799 DM loan for a new car. My current vehicle is unsuitable for carrying tools, and my checking account is in arrears due to a delayed project payment. I have worked at my firm for 3 years and earn 2,300 DM monthly, supporting my two children.  

I rent a home and own real estate in my hometown. My savings account is low due to recent home repairs, but I manage two existing bank credits (a 2020 bicycle loan and a 2023 safety equipment purchase) without delay. As a foreign worker, I have no criminal record and plan to extend my residency through responsible financial behavior.  

This loan will improve my work efficiency and reduce transport costs. I am confident in my ability to repay, given my stable income and commitment. Thank you for your support.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am a single parent and scientific research assistant at a pharmaceutical lab, employed for 2 years. My 2,799 DM car loan request stems from the need to commute 45 minutes daily to work—a journey currently hindered by unreliable public transport. My checking account is overdrawn due to a recent family emergency, but my monthly salary of 2,250 DM remains consistent.  

I have lived in my rented flat for 2 years and own a small apartment in my home country. Though my savings are below 100 DM, I have repaid two prior bank loans (a 2021 lab fee credit and a 2022 computer loan) on time. As a foreign worker with a 7-year residency plan, I value financial discipline.  

This car will ensure punctuality and reduce stress, enabling me to focus on my career and children’s needs. I guarantee repayment through my income and real estate as collateral. Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
