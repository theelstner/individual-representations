Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person has a checking account with 0 to less than 200 DM, has had it for 12 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is business, credit amount 1037 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Employment duration 4-7 years. Single male, no other debtors, residence since 4 years, property is real estate, age 39, own housing, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different job roles under "unskilled - resident". Maybe roles like warehouse worker, cleaner, security guard, construction laborer, and maybe a delivery helper. Each should have a unique business purpose for the loan. For example, starting a small business, expanding, buying equipment, etc.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their stable employment, savings, real estate as collateral, and good credit history. Also, note that they are foreign workers, so maybe mention their legal status and commitment.

Let me outline each person:

1. Warehouse Worker: Maybe wants to start a small grocery store. He has been working at a warehouse for 6 years. Savings 300 DM. Lives in own apartment, has a good credit history. Emphasize steady income and real estate as security.

2. Cleaner: Perhaps wants to buy a cleaning equipment to start a freelance service. Worked as a cleaner for 5 years. Savings 200 DM. Highlight punctual payments and responsibility.

3. Security Guard: Plans to open a small repair shop. Employed as security for 4 years. Savings 400 DM. Mention his steady job and real estate ownership.

4. Construction Laborer: Needs funds to buy materials for a contracting business. Worked construction for 6 years. Savings 250 DM. Emphasize dependents and responsible financial habits.

5. Delivery Helper: Wants to purchase a bicycle for deliveries to increase income. Employed for 5 years. Savings 150 DM. Highlight timely repayments and commitment.

Now, structure each letter with their specific details. Make sure each has a unique business purpose, job title, savings amount, employment duration, etc. Also, mention the loan amount (1037 DM) and installment rate (3 DM). Each should start with their name and address, date, bank address, subject, then body explaining their situation, why they need the loan, their financial stability, and why they're trustworthy. End with thanks and signature.

Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Avoid generic terms; use specific numbers and roles. Ensure no formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Keep letters concise but complete. Make sure each ends properly without being cut off.
