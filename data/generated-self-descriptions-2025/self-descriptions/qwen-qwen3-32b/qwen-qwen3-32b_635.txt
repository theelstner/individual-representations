Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a status of no checking account but has been for 9 months. The credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 1980 DM. Savings are less than 100 DM. Present employment is less than a year. Installment rate is 2. Personal status is female, divorced/separated/married. Other debtors/guarantors: co-applicant. Residence since 2 years. Property: car or other. Age 19. No other installment plans. Housing: rent. Number of existing credits at this bank: 2. Job: skilled employee/official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each letter needs to include these specific details. Let me think of different scenarios. The person is a young foreign worker, maybe in different professions. Since the job is a skilled employee or official, I can vary the job roles. Let me brainstorm five different jobs: maybe a scientific research assistant, nurse, teacher, IT technician, and a social worker. Each with specific instances.

First letter: Let's take a scientific research assistant. She's 19, foreign worker, has been in job for less than a year. Needs furniture for new apartment. Has a co-applicant, maybe her mother. She has paid back previous credits. No checking account but has savings under 100 DM. Lives in rented housing, has a car. Dependents: 1. No phone.

Second letter: Maybe a nurse. She's married, separated, living in Germany for 2 years. Needs to buy equipment for home office. Co-applicant is her sister. She has two existing credits here. Employment started 8 months ago. Still young, 19, but working as a nurse. Foreign worker from another country.

Third: A teacher's assistant. Divorced, with one child. Needs furniture for their residence. Co-applicant is the ex-husband. Has been in current job for 10 months. Has a car. No savings, but paid back previous loans.

Fourth: IT technician. Single mother, 19, foreign worker. Needs to furnish the apartment. Co-applicant is her aunt. Has been employed for 11 months. Lives in rented place, has a car. Previous credits paid.

Fifth: Social worker. Married, separated, living in Germany 2 years. Needs equipment for home-based care. Co-applicant is her cousin. Job for 9 months. No savings, but good credit history.

Each letter should be concise, mention the purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Need to avoid generic terms and use specifics from the profile. Make sure each has unique job and situation. Also, check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Let me draft each one, ensuring they are distinct and include all necessary details without formatting.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Amina Khoury, and I am a 19-year-old foreign worker from Lebanon currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt. I have been in this role for 8 months and earn a stable monthly income of 1,800 DM. I am applying for a 1,980 DM loan to purchase essential furniture for my new rented apartment, as I currently have no checking account and my savings amount to only 80 DM. I am divorced and have one dependent, my young daughter, whom I support financially. My mother, who lives with me, will co-sign the loan. I have already repaid two small credits at this bank and maintain a good credit history. Though I have only lived in my current residence for 2 years, I own a used car as collateral. I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments, given my stable employment and the co-applicant’s support.  

Sincerely  
Amina Khoury

Dear Sir/Madam  

I am Sarah Müller, a 19-year-old nurse from Vietnam working at the Dresden City Hospital. I have been employed here for 9 months and earn 2,000 DM monthly. I need a 1,980 DM loan to buy medical equipment for my home study space, as my current setup is inadequate for my night classes. I am separated and have one child, whom my sister helps care for. My sister will also act as a co-applicant for this loan. Though I have no savings and no checking account, I have repaid two prior loans at this bank without issue. I have lived in Germany for 2 years and rent a small apartment. My employer confirms my stable income, and I own a car. I am confident in my ability to manage the 2 DM installment rate responsibly.  

Best regards  
Sarah Müller
