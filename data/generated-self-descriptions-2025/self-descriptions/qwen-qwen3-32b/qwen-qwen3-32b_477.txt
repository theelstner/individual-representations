Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the profile includes specific attributes like age 26, female, divorced/separated/married, has one dependent, works as a skilled employee or official, has been in current job less than a year, has a checking account under 0 DM, savings under 100 DM, credit history with no issues, purpose is furniture/equipment, loan amount 3114 DM, etc. 

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the specifics. For example, instead of just "skilled employee," maybe use different jobs like "scientific research assistant," "nurse," "accountant," etc. Also, the purpose is furniture/equipment, so I can have different scenarios like buying a sofa, office equipment for a home business, kitchen appliances, etc.

I need to make sure each letter includes why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should be concise, not too long. Also, each person is a foreign worker, so maybe mention their country of origin or how they came to be in Germany.

Let me start with the first person. Maybe a scientific research assistant who needs furniture for a new apartment. She's been in her job for 8 months, has a dependent, and has a checking account in negative. She can mention her stable employment despite the short duration, her credit history, and maybe her savings are low but she's working on building them. She can also mention her intention to repay the loan promptly.

Second person: Maybe a nurse who needs medical equipment for home use. She's been in Germany for a few years, has a dependent, and has a part-time job. She can talk about her stable income from nursing and her commitment to repaying the loan.

Third person: Perhaps an accountant who wants to set up a home office with necessary equipment. She's been in her current job for 10 months, has a child, and mentions her previous credit history of paying back on time. She can highlight her steady income and responsibility.

Fourth person: A teacher's aide needing furniture for a new apartment. She's been in Germany for 5 years, has a daughter, and works part-time. She can emphasize her long-term residence, stable job, and good credit history.

Fifth person: A graphic designer needing equipment for a freelance business. She's been self-employed for 11 months, has a son, and mentions her savings are low but she has a side job. She can talk about her growing freelance income and commitment to repaying the loan.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific numbers and details from the profile. For example, age 26, duration of checking account 18 months, no previous credits or all paid back, savings under 100 DM, etc. Also, each person has different employment durations, but the profile says present employment since <1 year. So each person's job duration should be under 12 months, maybe 8, 10, 11 months, etc.

Also, each person has different job roles, so I need to vary those. The profile says "skilled employee / official," so roles like research assistant, nurse, accountant, teacher's aide, graphic designer (if that's considered skilled) could work. Maybe check if graphic design is considered a skilled job in that context.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, and then the bank's address. The body should explain the purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. End with a polite closing.

Let me start drafting the first one. Let's take the scientific research assistant. Name: Maria Schmidt. She works at a university, needs furniture for a new apartment. She has been employed there for 8 months. She mentions her savings are low but she has a stable income. She has a daughter. She has no previous debts but has paid back any credits. She can mention her checking account is in negative due to recent relocation costs but expects to repay soon. She can state the loan amount needed and her ability to make the installment payments.

Second letter: Nurse Anna Müller. She needs a hospital bed for her mother who is staying with her. She works at a clinic, has been there for 10 months. She has a son, and mentions her income covers her expenses but she needs the loan for the medical equipment. She has a good credit history, no debts. She can mention she's a foreign worker from Poland, has been in Germany for 3 years, and is committed to repaying the loan.

Third letter: Accountant Lisa Weber. She needs office furniture for her home office. She works at a firm, has been employed there for 11 months. She has a child and works part-time. She mentions her previous credit history, even though the profile says no credits taken, but maybe she had a small loan before that she paid back. She can talk about her steady income and ability to make payments.

Fourth letter: Teacher's aide Nada Hassan. She needs furniture for a new apartment. She works at a school, has been employed for 9 months. She has a daughter and is a foreign worker from Egypt. She mentions her stable job, good credit history, and that she's been in Germany for 4 years. She can state her need for the furniture and her commitment to repayment.

Fifth letter: Graphic designer Elena Rodriguez. She needs a new computer and design software. She's self-employed, has been in business for 11 months. She has a son and works part-time at a print shop. She mentions her income is growing, has a good credit history, and needs the equipment to expand her freelance work. She can talk about her ability to make installments.

I need to ensure each letter includes all the required elements from the profile and is unique. Also, check that the numbers match the profile: age 26, 4 years in residence, 1 dependent, etc. Each letter should be concise, maybe 3-4 paragraphs. Avoid any formatting, just plain text with line breaks.

Let me check each letter for the specific attributes. For example, checking account duration is 18 months, so each person should mention that they've had their account for 18 months. Savings under 100 DM. Present residence since 4 years. Property: building society savings or life insurance. Installment rate 1. No other debtors. Housing is rent. Number of credits at the bank is 1. Job is skilled employee or official. Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married. Telephone: none. Foreign worker: yes.

In each letter, these points should be addressed indirectly. For example, mentioning that they have a building society savings agreement, or that they've lived in their current residence for 4 years. Also, the loan purpose is furniture or equipment, so each letter should specify that.

I think that's a solid plan. Now I'll proceed to write each letter with these details in mind, making sure they are distinct and include all necessary information.

Dear Bank Manager,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3114 DM to purchase essential furniture for my new apartment. As a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute for Environmental Sciences, I have been employed for 8 months and earn a stable monthly income of 2200 DM. Though my current checking account balance is negative due to recent relocation costs, I have maintained it for 18 months and consistently managed my finances responsibly. My savings account holds 80 DM, and I have no outstanding debts, having always repaid credits promptly in my home country, Poland.  

I am a 26-year-old divorced mother of one, living in a rented apartment for the past 4 years. My property includes a building society savings agreement, and I have no other installment plans. While my current job is new, I have worked in research for 5 years, including 2 years in Germany. I am committed to repaying this loan and have already budgeted 1 DM monthly for other expenses, ensuring the installment rate of 1 DM is feasible. Your support would greatly improve my living conditions, and I assure you of my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,
