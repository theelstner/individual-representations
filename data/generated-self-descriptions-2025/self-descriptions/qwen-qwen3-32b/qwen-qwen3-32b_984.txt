Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile has specific attributes. Let me list them out:

- Checking account: at least 200 DM, salary assigned for at least 1 year, duration 21 months.
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly.
- Purpose: new car, amount 2923 DM.
- Savings: 100-500 DM.
- Employment: 1-4 years, current job since 1 year.
- Installment rate: 1 (maybe DM per month?).
- Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married.
- No other debtors/guarantors.
- Residence since 1 year.
- Property: car or other.
- Age: 28.
- Other installment plans: bank.
- Housing: own.
- Existing credits at this bank: 1.
- Job: management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/office worker.
- Dependents: 1.
- Telephone: yes.
- Foreign worker: registered under their name.

So each letter needs to incorporate these specifics. The user wants each letter from a different person, with specific instances of generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant," and specific durations like "8 years" instead of ">=7 years."

First, I need to create five different personas. Let me think of different job roles from the job category: management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, officer. Maybe:

1. Management: Project Manager
2. Self-employed: Freelance Graphic Designer
3. Highly qualified employee: Scientific Research Assistant
4. Officer: Administrative Officer
5. Maybe another management role but different, like a Team Leader?

Wait, the job category includes management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, officer. Let me make sure each of the five letters uses a different job from the list. Let me pick five distinct jobs:

1. Project Manager (Management)
2. Freelance Graphic Designer (Self-employed)
3. Scientific Research Assistant (Highly qualified employee)
4. Administrative Officer (Officer)
5. Team Leader in Manufacturing (Management, but different from project manager)

Okay, that's five. Now, each person needs to explain why they need the loan (car purchase), their financial situation (current job, savings, existing credit paid back), and why they're trustworthy.

Each letter should be short and concise. Let me outline each one.

First letter: Project Manager. Female, 28, married with one dependent. She's been in her job for 2 years, has a savings account with 300 DM. Existing credit paid back. Needs a car for commuting. Trustworthy because of steady income, existing good credit history, owns a car already (property). Maybe she's moving to a new job that requires longer commutes, hence needing a newer car.

Second: Freelance Graphic Designer. Self-employed, 28, divorced, one dependent. Been in business for 3 years. Savings of 400 DM. Needs a reliable car for client meetings. Trustworthy because of steady income, existing credit, owns property (maybe a car). Has a telephone, registered foreign worker (maybe she's a registered foreign worker? The profile says foreign worker: registered under the customer's name. So each person has that. Maybe she's a registered foreign worker.)

Third: Scientific Research Assistant. Female, 28, separated, one dependent. Employed for 8 years (wait, the profile says present employment since 1-4 years. Wait, the profile says "Present employment since:1 <= ... <4 years". So each person has been in their current job for 1 to 4 years. So for the scientific research assistant, maybe she's been in her current role for 2 years. But the profile says "existing credits paid back duly till now" and "Duration in month:21" which is 1.75 years. Maybe the existing credit is 21 months old. But for employment, present job since 1-4 years. So each person's employment duration is between 1-4 years. Let me check the original profile again.

Profile says: Present employment since: 1 <= ... <4 years. So each person has been in their current job for at least 1 year but less than 4. So for example, 2 years, 3 years, etc.

So for each letter, the person has been in their current job for 1-4 years. Let me assign different durations for each.

Also, the credit amount is 2923 DM, purpose is new car. Each letter should mention that.

Now, for each letter, I need to make sure all the profile attributes are covered. Let me check:

- Checking account: >=200 DM, salary for 1 year. So each person has a checking account with at least 200 DM and has had salary assignments for at least 1 year (which aligns with employment duration of 1+ years).

- Credit history: existing credits paid back. Each person has at least one existing credit at this bank (number of existing credits at this bank:1), which they paid back duly.

- Savings account/bonds: 100-500 DM. Each person has some amount in that range.

- Residence since 1 year.

- Property: car or other. Since the purpose is a new car, maybe they already have a car (property: car) or other property. But the purpose is to get a new car, so perhaps they are replacing an old one.

- Age 28, female, personal status: divorced/separated/married. Each person's status is one of those.

- Housing: own.

- Other installment plans: bank. So they have other installment plans through the bank.

- Dependents: 1.

- Telephone: yes.

- Foreign worker: registered under their name.

Okay, with that in mind, let's start drafting each letter.

First person: Project Manager, 28, married, 2 years in current job, savings 300 DM, existing credit paid back. She needs a new car because her current one is old. Trustworthy because of steady income, good credit history, owns a home, etc.

Second: Freelance Graphic Designer, self-employed for 3 years, divorced, one child, savings 400 DM. Needs a reliable car for client meetings. Trustworthy because of consistent income, existing credit paid back, owns a property (maybe a car?), has a telephone, etc.

Third: Scientific Research Assistant, separated, 2 years in job, savings 250 DM. Needs a car for commuting to work which is 45 minutes away, current car is unreliable. Trustworthy because of stable job, good credit history, etc.

Fourth: Administrative Officer, 28, married, 2.5 years in job, savings 350 DM. Needs a new car for work-related travel. Trustworthy because of steady employment, existing credit managed well.

Fifth: Team Leader in Manufacturing, 28, separated, 3 years in current job, savings 450 DM. Needs a car for longer commutes due to new shift patterns. Trustworthy because of stable income, own home, etc.

Each letter should start with sender's info, date, bank address, subject, body, closing. But the user said not to use formatting, so maybe just the text without addresses. Wait, the user says "do not use any formatting on the letter." So maybe each letter is just the body text, without addresses, etc. Let me check the example response.

Looking at the example response provided by the assistant earlier, they have each letter starting with "Dear [Bank Name]," then the body, then the sender's name and contact info. So I can follow that structure.

Each letter needs to mention:

- Purpose: car purchase (new), amount 2923 DM.

- Financial situation: current job (specific role, duration), savings, existing credit paid back, housing (own), dependents, etc.

- Trustworthiness: steady income, good credit history, existing savings, etc.

Let me start drafting each one.

First letter: Project Manager.

Subject: Application for Car Loan

Dear [Bank Name],

My name is Anna Müller, and I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2923 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a Project Manager at a leading IT firm, I have been employed for the past 2.5 years and earn a stable monthly salary of 2800 DM. I am currently married with one dependent and have maintained a checking account with a minimum balance of 200 DM for over a year. My existing credit, a personal loan taken to finance my master's degree, has been repaid in full as agreed. 

I currently own a used car, but due to frequent business travel, I require a more reliable vehicle. My savings account holds 300 DM, and I reside in my own apartment. I have no other debtors or guarantors and have consistently met my monthly installment obligations through the bank. At 28 years old, I believe this loan will enhance my professional efficiency and mobility. I am a registered foreign worker and can be contacted at my home telephone. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller

Fifth letter: Team Leader in Manufacturing.

Subject: Application for Car Loan

Dear [Bank Name],

I am Thomas Becker, a Team Leader in a manufacturing plant, applying for a car loan of 2923 DM. With three years in my current position and a monthly salary of 2600 DM, I have a stable income and a checking account maintained at 200 DM minimum. I am separated with one dependent and have lived at my residence for one year. My previous credit, a bicycle loan for commuting, was fully repaid. 

Due to a recent shift in work hours, my current car is insufficient for the extended commute. I have 450 DM in savings and own property. I have no other installment plans besides my bank's existing credit. At 28, my consistent employment and responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate. I am a registered foreign worker and can be contacted via telephone.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker

Now, let me check if all profile attributes are covered in each letter.

Each letter mentions:

- Purpose: car loan for new car (2923 DM)
- Financial situation: current job with specific role and duration (1-4 years), salary, checking account, savings (100-500 DM), existing credit paid back, housing (own), dependents, etc.
- Trustworthiness: steady income, good credit history, no other debtors, etc.
- Personal status: female (except Thomas, but the profile allows for female: divorced/separated/married. Wait, Thomas is male? Wait, the profile says "Personal status and sex: female: divorced/separated/married". Wait, original profile says "Personal status and sex: female : divorced/separated/married". So all five letters should be from females? Wait, the profile says "Personal status and sex: female : divorced/separated/married". So all five applicants are female? But in the fifth letter, I used Thomas Becker, which is male. That's a mistake. Oops. I need to correct that.

Wait, the profile specifies "Personal status and sex: female : divorced/separated/married". So all five applicants must be female. I mistakenly made the fifth applicant male. Let me adjust that. Let's replace Thomas Becker with a female name, perhaps "Monika Becker" or similar, and adjust the personal status accordingly.

Let me redo the fifth letter.

Fifth letter: Female, Team Leader in Manufacturing, separated, 3 years in job, savings 450 DM.

So:

Fifth letter:

Subject: Application for Car Loan

Dear [Bank Name],

I am Monika Becker, a Team Leader in a manufacturing plant, applying for a car loan of 2923 DM. With three years in my current position and a monthly salary of 2600 DM, I have a stable income and a checking account maintained at 200 DM minimum. I am separated with one dependent and have lived at my residence for one year. My previous credit, a bicycle loan for commuting, was fully repaid. 

Due to a recent shift in work hours, my current car is insufficient for the extended commute. I have 450 DM in savings and own property. I have no other installment plans besides my bank's existing credit. At 28, my consistent employment and responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate. I am a registered foreign worker and can be contacted via telephone.

Thank you for your consideration.

Monika Becker

That's better. Now all five applicants are female. Also, each has a different job role and personal status (married, divorced, separated). Let me check each letter's personal status:

1. Anna Müller: married
2. Sarah Lin: divorced
3. Emily Carter: separated
4. Maria Schmidt: married
5. Monika Becker: separated

Wait, Maria Schmidt is married, but the profile says personal status is female: divorced/separated/married. So married is allowed. Okay.

Now, check employment duration:

Each has between 1-4 years. Let's confirm:

Anna: 2.5 years (within 1-4)
Sarah: 3 years (okay)
Emily: 2 years (okay)
Maria: 2.5 years
Monika: 3 years

Yes.

Savings amounts:

Anna: 300 DM (within 100-500)
Sarah: 400 DM
Emily: 250 DM
Maria: 350 DM
Monika: 450 DM

All within range.

Existing credits: each has one existing credit paid back.

Each mentions owning property (car or other). For example, Sarah owns a property (maybe a house?), Emily owns a condominium, Maria owns her home, etc.

Each mentions housing: own.

Other installment plans: bank (each mentions having installment plans through the bank).

Dependents: 1.

Telephone: yes (each mentions telephone contact).

Foreign worker: registered under their name.

Yes, each mentions being a registered foreign worker.

Okay, looks like all attributes are covered. Now, check if the letters are concise and not cut off. Each ends properly with a closing. No formatting used. Each letter is from a different person with specific roles and situations. I think this meets the requirements.
