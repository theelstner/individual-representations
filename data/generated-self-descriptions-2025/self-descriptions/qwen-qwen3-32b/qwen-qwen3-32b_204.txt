Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile is a 26-year-old single male foreign worker. He's employed as a skilled employee or official, has been in his current job for 4 to 7 years. He has a residence duration of 4 years. He has no checking account, has had a delay in paying off credit in the past. The loan purpose is business, amount is 5117 DM. Savings account/bonds less than 100 DM. He has two existing credits at the bank. Housing is own, no other installment plans, no other debtors or guarantors, one dependent, no telephone.

Each letter needs to be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant" or something more specific. Also, need to mention the exact numbers like 27 months, 4 years residence, etc.

Let me brainstorm different jobs that fit "skilled employee / official." Maybe a mechanic, teacher, IT technician, nurse, or electrician. Each letter should explain why they need the loan for business, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy.

For each letter, start with addressing the bank, then introduce themselves, state the purpose of the loan, their employment history, current financial status, mention past credit issues, and how they plan to repay. Also, include specific details like exact years, job titles, and business purposes (e.g., buying equipment, starting a small business, expanding services).

Need to make sure each letter is unique in the business purpose and job role. Also, address the past delay in payments by showing responsibility and lessons learned. Highlight stable residence, existing credits (two) at the bank, and having a dependent to show stability.

Avoid formatting, keep it concise, proper ending. Let me outline each letter:

1. Electrician: Starting a business, need tools. 5 years in job. Mention past delay due to health issues, now recovered. Two existing loans for equipment, paying on time.

2. IT Technician: Expand services. 6 years employed. Delay due to car repair, now managed. Owns a car. Stable residence.

3. Mechanic: Purchase diagnostic equipment. 4 years at current job. Delay due to family emergency. Two small credits repaid.

4. Nurse: Open home care service. 5 years working. Delay due to relocation costs. Now stable, own house.

5. Scientific Research Assistant: Start lab supply business. 6 years in job. Delay due to project funding gap. Good savings despite low amount.

Each letter needs to mention the exact numbers from the profile: 27 months (2 years 3 months), 4-7 years employment (use specific years), 4 years residence, 26 years old, 1 dependent, foreign worker, etc.

Check that all profile attributes are addressed in each letter. Make sure the business purpose is specific. Also, mention the installment rate (3%)? Wait, the installment rate is 3, but the user didn't specify units. Maybe it's 3% or 3 DM? Maybe not necessary to mention unless it's part of repayment plan.

Each letter should end with thanks and willingness to provide more info. No formatting, just plain text. Make sure each is distinct and covers all required points.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, and I am a 26-year-old electrician who has worked at a construction firm in Frankfurt for the past 5 years. I am applying for a loan of 5117 DM to purchase tools and equipment to start my own electrical contracting business. I have lived at my current residence for 4 years and own a used car, which I use for client visits. Though I had a minor delay in repaying a previous credit due to unexpected medical expenses, I have since resolved this and now prioritize timely payments. I currently have two small credits with your bank for equipment, both in good standing. As a foreign worker with stable employment and one dependent, I value financial responsibility and am confident in my ability to manage this loan. I would be grateful for the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Mohamed

Dear Bank Manager  

I am Karim Hassan, a 26-year-old IT technician employed at a software company in Munich for 6 years. I seek a 5117 DM loan to expand my freelance IT services, which include remote support for small businesses. I have resided in my apartment for 4 years and own a car. While I experienced a late payment 18 months ago due to urgent car repairs, I have since maintained a consistent payment record. My current job provides steady income, and I already hold two active credits with your bank for laptop and software purchases, both repaid punctually. As a foreign worker supporting one dependent, I take pride in my discipline. This loan will help me grow my side business, and I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling all obligations.  

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, a 26-year-old auto mechanic working at a garage in Berlin for 4 years. I am requesting 5117 DM to invest in a modern diagnostic machine to improve my workshop’s efficiency. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and own a vehicle used for parts delivery. A payment delay in my credit history occurred when I covered my sister’s emergency travel costs in my home country. Since then, I’ve focused on avoiding such risks. I currently have two small loans with your bank for tools, which I repay monthly. As a foreign worker with one dependent, I am committed to building a reliable financial future. This equipment will increase my revenue, ensuring timely loan repayments. I appreciate your trust and will not disappoint.

Dear Bank Manager  

I am Youssef El-Sayed, a 26-year-old nurse at a clinic in Hamburg, employed for 5 years. I need 5117 DM to launch a home healthcare service for elderly patients. My 4-year residence in Germany and stable job provide a solid foundation for this venture. A past payment delay resulted from covering relocation costs for my family’s visa process. I now budget carefully to prevent recurrence. I already have two credits with your bank for professional certification courses, both fully repaid. As a foreign worker with one dependent, I am dedicated to my community and financial integrity. This loan will enable me to serve more clients and generate income to repay the loan responsibly. Thank you for your support.  

Sincerely
