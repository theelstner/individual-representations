Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account status as "no checking account," which is interesting because usually, you need one for a loan. The duration in months is 12, so each person has been in their current residence for 12 months. The credit history is critical with existing credits not at this bank. The loan purpose is furniture or equipment, and the amount is 1258. Savings are under 100 DM. Employment duration is less than a year, which might be a red flag. The installment rate is 2, personal status is female, divorced/separated/married, no other debtors, residence since 4 years, property is building society savings or life insurance, age 22, no other installment plans, housing is rent, two existing credits at the bank, job is unskilled resident, one dependent, no telephone, and foreign worker yes.

Wait, some of these attributes might conflict. For example, the profile says "Present employment since: < 1 year," but also "Duration in month:12"—is that the same as employment duration? Maybe not. The duration in the profile could refer to residence. Let me check again. The profile says "Duration in month:12"—probably the duration of the existing checking account, but since they have no checking account, maybe it's the duration in their current residence? Wait, the profile says "Present residence since:4" (months?), but the "Duration in month:12"—maybe that's a different field. The user says to replace generic attributes with specific instances. For example, "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee." So I need to take each generic term and make it specific.

Let me parse each attribute:

- Status of existing checking account: no checking account
- Duration in month:12 (maybe duration at current residence? Or maybe duration of employment? The user says to replace generic attributes, so perhaps "Duration in month:12" becomes something specific, but the original instruction is to invent specific instances for generic attributes. Maybe "Duration in month:12" is the time they've been in their current job? But the profile says "Present employment since: < 1 year"—so less than a year, which is 12 months? Wait, 12 months is a year, but the profile says "Present employment since: < 1 year"—so maybe they've been employed for 11 months? But the user wants specific instances. So maybe for each letter, the employment duration is something like 11 months, 10 months, etc. But the user says to replace the generic attributes with specific ones. The original profile has "Duration in month:12"—so maybe that's the time in current residence. Let me check the original problem again.

The user says: "Invent specific instances of all generic attributes from the profile (e.g. 'scientific research assistant' instead of 'skilled employee', '8 years' instead of '>= 7 years', etc.)". So the generic attributes in the profile are things like "unskilled - resident" for job, which should become specific, like "textile factory worker". Similarly, "Duration in month:12" should be replaced with a specific number, like "12 months" becomes "11 months" or "10 months"? Wait, but the original value is 12, so maybe the user wants to keep the 12 but make it specific? Or maybe the "Duration in month:12" is a generic attribute that needs to be made specific. Wait, the original profile has "Duration in month:12"—so maybe that's the time in current residence? The profile also says "Present residence since:4"—so maybe that's 4 months. But the user wants specific instances. So perhaps in each letter, the duration in months is a specific number, but the original value is 12. Hmm. Maybe the user wants to take the generic attributes and make them specific. For example, "Duration in month:12" becomes "I have lived at my current residence for 12 months," but maybe in the letters, they can vary that? Wait, the original instruction says "Invent specific instances of all generic attributes from the profile." So for each generic attribute in the profile, replace it with a specific instance. For example, the job is "unskilled - resident"—so in the letters, each person has a specific job like "textile factory worker," "warehouse helper," etc. Similarly, "Duration in month:12"—maybe that's the time in current residence, so each letter can have a specific duration, but the original value is 12. Wait, but the original value is 12, so maybe the user wants to keep that as 12 but make other parts specific. Maybe I need to clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps the "Duration in month:12" is a generic attribute that needs to be made specific. For example, instead of just "12 months," say "I have been employed at my current job for 12 months." But the profile says "Present employment since: < 1 year"—so less than a year, which is 12 months? Wait, 12 months is exactly a year, so maybe the person has been employed for 11 months. But the user wants to invent specific instances. So maybe for each letter, the employment duration is something like 11 months, 10 months, etc. But the original data says "Present employment since: < 1 year"—so less than 12 months. So in each letter, the employment duration is a specific number less than 12 months, like 11, 10, 9, etc. Similarly, "Duration in month:12"—maybe that's the time in current residence, which is 12 months. The profile also says "Present residence since:4"—so 4 months. Wait, but the user wants to replace generic attributes. So maybe "Duration in month:12" is a generic attribute that needs to be made specific. For example, if the original is "Duration in month:12," maybe the specific instance is "I have been living at my current address for 12 months." But the profile also has "Present residence since:4"—so maybe that's another attribute. This is getting a bit confusing.

Let me try to outline each attribute and think of specific instances:

1. Status of existing checking account: no checking account → each person doesn't have one.
2. Duration in month:12 → maybe time in current residence? Or time at job? Since employment duration is <1 year (so maybe 11 months), perhaps "Duration in month:12" refers to something else. Maybe the time they've had their savings account? But savings are <100 DM. Alternatively, maybe it's the duration of their current job, but since employment is <1 year, perhaps 11 months. But the user wants to replace generic attributes. Maybe "Duration in month:12" becomes "I have been employed at my current job for 11 months."
3. Credit history: critical account/other credits existing (not at this bank) → each person has existing credits elsewhere.
4. Purpose: furniture/equipment → each person needs furniture or equipment.
5. Savings account/bonds: <100 DM → each has less than 100 DM.
6. Present employment since: <1 year → each has been employed less than a year.
7. Installment rate:2 → maybe the number of installments per month? Or the rate? Not sure, but the user wants specific instances. Maybe "I can commit to a monthly installment of 2 DM."
8. Personal status and sex: female, divorced/separated/married → each is a woman in one of those statuses.
9. Other debtors/guarantors: none → no co-signers.
10. Present residence since:4 → time at current address is 4 months.
11. Property: building society savings agreement/life insurance → each has one of these.
12. Age:22 → all are 22.
13. Other installment plans: none → no other payments.
14. Housing: rent → all rent.
15. Number of existing credits at this bank:2 → each has two credits at the bank.
16. Job: unskilled - resident → specific jobs like textile worker, etc.
17. Dependents:1 → each has one dependent.
18. Telephone:none → no phone.
19. Foreign worker:yes → all are foreign workers.

Now, for each of the five letters, I need to create a different person with these attributes. Each letter should explain why they're applying for the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say she's a textile factory worker, 22, foreign worker, married with one dependent, living in the same residence for 4 months, employed for less than a year (say 10 months), has two existing credits at the bank, and needs furniture. She has a building society savings agreement. She doesn't have a checking account but has a savings account under 100 DM. She can commit to a monthly installment of 2 DM. She's a foreign worker, so maybe she's from another country, working in this country. She needs furniture for her new apartment. She might mention her stable job, her savings plan, and her intention to repay the loan.

Second person: maybe a warehouse helper, 22, separated, one dependent. Same financial situation. She's been in her job for 11 months, residence for 4 months. She needs equipment for her home office (if she's working from home?), but the purpose is furniture/equipment. Maybe she's a part-time worker needing a desk and chair. She has life insurance as property. She can mention her part-time job and how the loan will help her work more efficiently.

Third person: maybe a domestic helper, 22, married, one child. She's been employed for 9 months, residence 4 months. Needs furniture for her child's room. She has a building society savings plan. She can emphasize her responsibility as a parent and her steady income.

Fourth person: maybe a cleaner, 22, divorced, one dependent. She's been in her job for 8 months, residence 4 months. Needs to buy a washing machine (equipment). She has life insurance. She can talk about her need for reliable appliances to manage her household.

Fifth person: maybe a factory packager, 22, married, one dependent. Employed for 7 months, residence 4 months. Needs a dining set. She has a savings agreement. She can mention her commitment to her job and how the loan will improve her family's quality of life.

Each letter needs to be concise, explain the purpose, financial situation (including the existing credits at the bank, no checking account, savings under 100 DM, etc.), and trustworthiness (stable job, existing credits managed, savings plan, etc.). Make sure to vary the specifics for each person: different jobs, different dependents (child, maybe a relative?), different reasons for needing furniture or equipment, different property types (building society vs life insurance), different employment durations (within <1 year), etc.

Also, since they are foreign workers, maybe mention that they have migrated and are establishing themselves, showing commitment to repaying the loan.

Now, let me draft each letter with these points in mind, ensuring each is unique and covers all required attributes without formatting.

**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,258 DM to purchase essential furniture for my new apartment. I am 22 years old, a textile factory worker in this city, and have been employed at my current job for 11 months. Though I am a foreign worker from Vietnam and do not yet have a checking account, I have maintained a building society savings agreement for the past 3 years. My monthly income of 850 DM allows me to manage two existing credits at your bank responsibly, and I am confident in my ability to meet the 2 DM installment rate. I am married with one young child, and we have resided at our current address for 4 months. While my credit history includes past challenges, I am committed to rebuilding trust through consistent payments. This loan will provide a stable home environment for my family, and I assure you of my dedication to repaying it promptly.  

Sincerely,  
Nguyen Thi Mai

**Letter 2**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I request a loan to acquire a desk and chair for my part-time remote work as a warehouse helper. At 22, I have been employed at my current job for 10 months and have no checking account but hold a life insurance policy. My monthly earnings of 780 DM support my 6-year-old daughter and me, and I have no other debts beyond two small credits at your bank. Though my credit history is not perfect, I have consistently paid my existing loans on time. I relocated to this city 4 months ago and have lived at my current rented residence since. As a foreign worker from Colombia, I value stability and have prioritized saving 50 DM monthly in a bonds account. This loan will enable me to work more efficiently, and I pledge to honor all repayments.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Maria Alvarez

**Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a loan to furnish my 5-year-old son’s room, as we recently moved into a larger apartment. I work as a domestic helper and have been employed for 9 months, earning 720 DM monthly. I am 22, married, and have no checking account, but I maintain a building society savings plan. My credit history includes past difficulties, but I now manage two existing credits at your bank without issue. I reside in my current rented home for 4 months and have one dependent. While my savings are modest (<100 DM), I am disciplined with my income and have no other installment plans. This loan will improve my child’s living conditions, and I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments.  

Respectfully,  
Amina Jallow

**Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a loan to purchase a washing machine, as my current one has broken down. At 22, I am a cleaner at a local hotel, employed for 8 months, and earn 750 DM monthly. I am divorced, have one dependent (my mother), and live in a rented apartment I’ve occupied for 4 months. Though I lack a checking account and have a critical credit history, I hold a life insurance policy and have no other debts. As a foreign worker from the Philippines, I prioritize financial responsibility and have already repaid two previous credits at your bank. This loan will ease my household responsibilities, and I am prepared to adhere strictly to the repayment terms.  

Gratefully,  
Lina Delgado

**Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am requesting funds to buy a dining set for my family’s new home. I work as a factory packager, have been employed for 7 months, and earn 800 DM monthly. At 22, I am married with one child and reside in a rented flat for 4 months. While my credit history is not exemplary, I have two active, on-time payments at your bank and no other debts. I do not have a checking account but keep 80 DM in savings bonds. As a foreign worker from Romania, I am dedicated to my job and community. This loan will enhance our family’s comfort, and I promise to fulfill all installments diligently.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Popescu
