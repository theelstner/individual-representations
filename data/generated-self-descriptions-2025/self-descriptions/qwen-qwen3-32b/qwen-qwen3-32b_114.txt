Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on a specific profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully to make sure each letter includes all the required attributes with specific instances.

The profile mentions a foreign worker, male, single, 28 years old, with a short duration in the current job (4-7 years), unskilled resident job, etc. The purpose of the loan is a new car, and there's existing credit history with all payments made on time. Each letter needs to be unique but adhere to these parameters.

I should start by varying the professions within "unskilled - resident." Maybe roles like construction worker, warehouse operative, delivery driver, maintenance helper, and factory assembler. Each person's name and background should differ to avoid repetition.

Next, the financial situation: checking account balance under 200 DM, savings under 100 DM, existing credit paid back, residence for 3 years, renting, one existing credit at the bank. Each letter should explain why they need the car—like commuting to work, starting a side business, or family reasons.

Trustworthiness is key. Highlight punctual payments, stable employment, and responsibility. Maybe include specific instances like helping a relative or planning to use the car efficiently. Each letter should end with gratitude and willingness to provide more info.

I need to ensure each letter is concise, no formatting, and properly ends. Avoid generic terms by using specific numbers and roles. Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter without repeating the same examples. Make sure the purpose of the loan is tied to their specific situation, showing necessity and planning. Also, note that they have no telephone, so maybe mention another contact method. Each letter should have a unique angle but still fit the profile constraints.

Dear Sir or Madam  
My name is Ahmed Hassan, a 28-year-old foreign worker employed as a construction laborer in Munich for the past 5 years. I have maintained a checking account for 18 months with a balance under 200 DM and a savings account holding less than 100 DM. I am applying for a 6,260 DM loan to purchase a new car essential for my daily commute to work, which is 45 minutes away by public transport but could be cut to 20 minutes with reliable transportation. I have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I financially support. My current employer has no issues with my performance, and I have repaid my previous credit of 3,000 DM for tools at this bank without delay. Though I am unskilled, I am committed to improving efficiency at work with this vehicle. I assure you of timely repayments at 3 DM per month. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Hassan

I am single, have no dependents, and have consistently repaid my existing 4,500 DM credit for machinery here. My employer confirms my reliability, and I own real estate in my home country as collateral. I am a foreign worker without a telephone, but my landlord can vouch for my residence. I pledge to meet all installments. Thank you for your trust.
