Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile mentions a single male, 43 years old, with a checking account under 0 DM, has been with the current employer for at least 7 years, and has a critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank. The loan purpose is a new car, amount 2625 DM. He has a guarantor, lives in a rented house, has a building society savings agreement or life insurance, and has one existing credit at the bank. Also, there's a dependent, a telephone, and foreign worker status as registered.

First, I need to create five distinct individuals with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me brainstorm different scenarios. For example, different jobs, reasons for the loan, and guarantors. Each person should have unique details but fit the profile.

Let me start with the first person. The job in the profile is "skilled employee / official". Maybe one is a scientific research assistant, another a teacher, a nurse, a software developer, and an electrician. Each needs a unique angle. For the loan purpose, even though it's a car, maybe they can mention specific reasons like commuting for work, starting a business, or family needs.

Financial situation: Each should explain their current situation. Since their checking account is negative, maybe they mention recent expenses or medical bills. They need to show they can repay. Trustworthiness: guarantor, existing credit at the bank, stable job, savings (even though less than 100 DM), and other installment plans.

I need to ensure each letter is concise, starts with their name and address, then the bank's address, date, subject, body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and a proper closing. Avoid formatting, just plain text. Each letter should be unique but follow the structure.

Let me check the example response. The first letter is from Thomas Müller, a scientific research assistant. He mentions his job at a university, the need for a car for fieldwork, his guarantor (father), existing credit for a laptop, and his savings. Each letter has specific details. I need to make sure each of the five has different jobs, reasons, and guarantors. Also, different dependents if possible, but the profile says dependents:1, so maybe a child, spouse, or parent. Since the profile says "male: single", dependents could be a child or elderly parent.

Another thing: the profile says "other credits existing (not at this bank)", so each person should mention a different type of existing credit. For example, student loan, medical expenses, previous car loan, etc. Also, the guarantor could be a family member or friend, maybe different in each case.

Let me outline each of the five letters:

1. Scientific Research Assistant (Thomas Müller) – example already given. Purpose: fieldwork. Guarantor: father. Existing credit: laptop.

2. High School Biology Teacher. Purpose: reliable transport for work and family. Guarantor: sibling. Existing credit: student loan. Maybe dependents: a child.

3. Nurse. Purpose: longer shifts and transporting medical supplies. Guarantor: spouse's sibling. Existing credit: medical bills. Dependent: elderly parent.

4. Software Developer. Purpose: client meetings and work efficiency. Guarantor: business partner. Existing credit: equipment loan. Dependent: child.

5. Electrician. Purpose: job site transportation and business growth. Guarantor: uncle. Existing credit: tools. Dependent: child.

Now, each letter needs to have specific numbers: 8 years at job, 16 months checking account, 4 years at residence. Each should mention the guarantor, existing credit at the bank (maybe different types), and their savings under 100 DM. Also, mention the installment rate and how they can manage payments.

I need to make sure each letter is unique in details but fits the profile. Avoid repetition in reasons and guarantors. Also, check that each person's situation makes sense. For example, a nurse needing a car for shifts and supplies. A teacher needing reliable transport. A software developer needing to meet clients. Electrician for job transportation.

Now, write each letter step by step, ensuring they are concise and cover all necessary points without being too lengthy. Each should start with sender's info, date, bank address, subject, then the body. Make sure to not cut off the letters and end properly with thanks and contact info.

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to request a loan of 2,625 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin for 8 years, I require reliable transportation to commute to fieldwork sites and carry equipment. My current checking account balance is negative due to recent medical expenses, but I have a stable monthly income of 2,500 DM and a guarantor in my father, who is a civil engineer with a clean credit history.  

I currently hold a personal loan of 1,200 DM at another institution for laboratory supplies, which I repay at 150 DM/month. At this bank, I have an existing credit for a laptop, paid in full for 12 months. I reside in a rented apartment in Berlin for 4 years and hold a building society savings agreement. With only one dependent (my daughter) and a monthly installment capacity of 2 DM, I am confident in managing this loan responsibly.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for further discussion at (030) 123456.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Müller
