Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile has specific attributes like no checking account, 10 months duration, existing credits paid back, purpose is a new car, credit amount 1418 DM, savings between 100-500 DM, employment duration 1-4 years, installment rate 3, single male, no debtors, residence since 2 years, property as real estate, age 35, no other installment plans, housing is rent, one existing credit at the bank, job as unskilled resident, one dependent, no telephone, not a foreign worker.

For each letter, I need to invent specific instances. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different jobs within "unskilled resident"—like delivery driver, warehouse worker, maintenance technician, etc. Each person's reason for the car could vary: work necessity, family needs, commuting. They should explain their financial situation, trustworthiness based on credit history, savings, existing credit paid back.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, includes all required elements, and ends properly. Let me outline each person:

1. Delivery Driver: Needs a reliable car for work. Has savings of 300 DM. Worked at a logistics company for 2.5 years. Lives in the same residence for 2 years. Has a real estate property as collateral.

2. Warehouse Worker: Applying for a car to reduce commute time. Savings of 400 DM. Employed at a warehouse for 3 years. Trustworthy because previous credit was paid on time.

3. Maintenance Technician: Needs a car for client visits. Savings of 250 DM. Works for a local company, 1.5 years. Has a savings account. Lives in the same place for 2 years.

4. Construction Laborer: Needs a car for job site transfers. Savings of 150 DM. Employed for 3.5 years. Has a small real estate investment.

5. Janitorial Staff: Applying for a car to manage work and family. Savings of 350 DM. Worked at a commercial building for 2 years. Lives with one dependent, has a property.

Each letter should mention the purpose, financial situation (savings, existing credit, employment), trustworthiness (credit history, savings, residence), and a proper closing. Avoid formatting, keep it short. Make sure each person's job is specific, and the numbers fit the profile (e.g., savings between 100-500, employment duration 1-4 years, etc.)

Let me start drafting each letter with these points in mind, ensuring each has unique details but fits the profile.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Lars Müller and I am a delivery driver at a logistics company where I have worked for 2.5 years. I am applying for a loan of 1418 DM to purchase a reliable car that will allow me to meet the demands of my job more efficiently. Currently I do not have a checking account but maintain a savings account with 300 DM. I have always paid back previous credits in full and on time and I am committed to doing so here. I reside in my rented apartment for the past two years and own a small real estate property as collateral. With my stable income and one dependent to support I am confident in managing the 3 DM installment rate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Lars Müller

Dear Bank Representative  

I am Thomas Becker a warehouse worker at a food distribution center employed there for 3 years. The loan is necessary to replace my aging vehicle which is crucial for my daily commute. My savings amount to 400 DM and though I do not currently have a checking account I have a strong history of repaying debts. I have lived at my current residence for two years and own real estate. My single status allows me to allocate funds responsibly towards this installment plan. I appreciate your trust in me as evidenced by my existing credit with your bank which I have consistently honored.  

Respectfully

Dear Sir or Madam  

As a maintenance technician for a local manufacturing plant for 1.5 years I require a new car to service client sites promptly. I have 250 DM in savings and no existing checking account but have managed my finances prudently. My previous credit with this bank was settled without issue demonstrating my reliability. I rent my home but own real estate and have lived here for two years. With one dependent relying on me I prioritize financial responsibility. The 3 DM monthly payment is feasible given my stable employment. Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards  
Jan Hofmann
