Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

First, the profile has specific details: checking account balance less than 200 DM, duration 12 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is radio/television. Credit amount 1103 DM. Savings account under 100 DM. Employment since 4-7 years. Installment rate 4. Single male, guarantor for other debtors. Residence since 3 months. Property is real estate. Age 29. No other installment plans. Own housing. Two existing credits at the bank. Job as skilled employee or official. One dependent. No telephone. Not a foreign worker.

So each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of different scenarios. Let me pick different jobs first. The profile says "skilled employee / official". Let me think of specific jobs: scientific research assistant, electrician, teacher, nurse, IT technician. That gives me five different jobs.

Each person needs to explain why they're applying for the loan. The purpose is radio/television, but maybe they can have different angles. For example, a student needing a TV for online classes, a professional needing a radio for work, a parent needing a TV for children's educational programs, someone needing a radio for a home business, or a teacher needing equipment for lesson planning.

Financial situation: each has a checking account under 200 DM, savings under 100 DM. They have been employed 4-7 years. Let me vary the exact years. For example, 5 years as a teacher, 6 years as an electrician, etc. They have a guarantor. They have two existing credits paid back duly. They own real estate, live in their own home, have one dependent.

Trustworthy aspects: punctual payments, stable job, guarantor, real estate as collateral, responsible with past credits.

Now, for each letter, I need to create a unique person. Let me outline each:

1. Scientific Research Assistant: Maybe applying for a TV to keep up with international conferences. Employed for 6 years. Guarantor is a parent. Lives in own home. Has two existing credits (maybe a car loan and a personal loan). Needs TV for professional development.

2. Electrician: Needs a radio for communication on job sites. Employed for 5 years. Guarantor is a sibling. Existing credits for tools and equipment. Financial situation tight but stable.

3. Teacher: Wants a TV for educational resources and student materials. Employed for 4 years. Guarantor is a relative. Existing credits for further education. Dependents include a young child.

4. Nurse: Needs a radio for shift updates and communication. Employed for 5 years. Guarantor is a colleague. Existing credits for professional certification. Lives in own home.

5. IT Technician: Applying for a TV to set up a home office for remote work. Employed for 6 years. Guarantor is a family friend. Existing credits for computer equipment. Dependents include a spouse and child.

Wait, the profile says "single male" with one dependent. So each person is a single man with one dependent. So maybe the dependent is a child. Let me adjust the scenarios accordingly.

For each letter, they need to mention their job, years employed, guarantor, existing credits, purpose, and why they're trustworthy.

Let me start drafting the first one.

Scientific Research Assistant: 29 years old, works at a university, 6 years in position. Checking account 150 DM, savings 80 DM. Existing credits: a laptop loan and a car loan, both paid on time. Purpose: TV to access international conferences. Guarantor is his father. Owns real estate (maybe a small apartment). Stable income, responsible payments.

Second letter: Electrician, 29, 5 years at a construction firm. Checking 180 DM, savings 50 DM. Existing credits for tools and a motorcycle. Needs a radio for job site communication. Guarantor is his brother. Owns a house. Dependents: one daughter.

Third: Teacher, 29, 4 years at a secondary school. Checking 190 DM, savings 90 DM. Existing credits for a master's degree. Needs TV for educational resources. Guarantor is his mother. Owns a condominium. Stable job with good prospects.

Fourth: Nurse, 29, 5 years at a hospital. Checking 160 DM, savings 70 DM. Existing credit for professional certification. Needs a radio for shift updates. Guarantor is his sister. Owns property (maybe a land plot). Dependents: one son.

Fifth: IT Technician, 29, 6 years at a tech company. Checking 170 DM, savings 60 DM. Existing credits for software licenses and a laptop. Needs a TV for remote work setup. Guarantor is a colleague. Owns a small apartment. Stable income.

Each letter should be concise, mention specific numbers, and explain why they are trustworthy. Avoid generic terms. Make sure each has a unique job and specific purpose. Also, ensure that all the profile attributes are covered in each letter.

Now, let me write each letter step by step, ensuring they are distinct and include all required elements.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Lars Müller, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Hamburg, where I have worked for the past six years. I am applying for a loan of 1,103 DM to purchase a television, which will allow me to access international scientific conferences and stay updated on critical developments in my field.  

Currently, my checking account holds 150 DM, and my savings account has 80 DM. I have consistently repaid two existing loans—my university laptop and a car loan—without delay. My stable income, combined with real estate ownership (a small apartment), ensures I can manage monthly installments. My father, a retired engineer, has kindly agreed to act as a guarantor.  

At 29, I am single and support one dependent, my young sister. I reside in my own home and have no other debts. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan promptly, as I have with all previous obligations. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller
