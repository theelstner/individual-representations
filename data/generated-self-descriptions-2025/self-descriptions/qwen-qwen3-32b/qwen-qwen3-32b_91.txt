Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile has several key points: the applicant has a checking account with less than 0 DM, has had it for 12 months. No credit history or all paid back. Purpose is repairs, credit amount 1108 DM. Savings under 100 DM. Employed between 4-7 years. Single male, no dependents except one, own housing, real estate, 28 years old, no other installment plans, no phone, foreign worker. 

First, I need to create five different personas. Each should have a unique job (since the profile says "skilled employee / official"), so maybe jobs like scientific research assistant, electrician, IT technician, etc. Each should have specific details. Let me brainstorm some jobs. Let's see: scientific research assistant, electrician, IT support technician, mechanical engineer, and maybe a public administration officer. 

Each person needs to explain why they need the loan for repairs. Maybe different types of repairs: roof, plumbing, electrical, windows, etc. Also, their financial situation: checking account negative, savings low, but they have real estate. They need to show trustworthiness by mentioning credit history (no issues), stable job, own home, etc. 

Let me start with the first one. Let's pick a scientific research assistant. He's been working at a university for 5 years. Needs repairs on his roof. He has a dependent, maybe a child. He mentions his stable job, real estate as collateral, and that he's a foreign worker with a long-term contract. 

Second person: Electrician. Maybe he's self-employed but has been working for 6 years. Needs electrical system repairs. Emphasize timely payments on past credits, owns a house, has a dependent. 

Third: IT support technician at a company, 4 years. Needs plumbing repairs. Highlight savings bonds, even though they are under 100 DM. Maybe he's a foreign worker with a residence permit. 

Fourth: Mechanical engineer in manufacturing, 5 years. Applying for window repairs. Mention his real estate and that he's single with one dependent. 

Fifth: Public administration officer, 6 years. Needs foundation repairs. Stress his stable government job and that he's a foreign worker with plans to stay. 

Each letter should be concise, start with address, date, bank details, then body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Make sure each has specific numbers and details from the profile. Avoid formatting, just plain text. Check that each ends properly with a sign-off.

Let me draft the first one. Make sure to include all required elements. For example, the scientific research assistant: 5 years employed, repairs for roof, 28 years old, single with one dependent, real estate, no other credits here except 2, but profile says 2 existing credits at the bank. Wait, the profile says "Number of existing credits at this bank:2". So each applicant already has two credits there. Need to mention that. 

Also, the installment rate is 4, which might be DM per month? Not sure, but maybe not necessary to include unless specified. The credit amount is 1108 DM. 

Each letter should state the purpose clearly, their ability to repay based on job stability, existing property, and good credit history. 

Let me check each profile attribute is covered in the letters. Checking account negative, duration 12 months. Maybe mention that their checking account is currently overdrawn but due to temporary repairs expense. Savings less than 100 DM. 

Also, present residence since 3 years. So each applicant has lived in their current residence for 3 years. 

Telephone: none, so maybe they don't have a phone, but that's part of the profile. Maybe not necessary to mention unless it's relevant. 

Foreign worker: yes, so each is a foreign worker, so maybe mention their legal status or long-term plans in the country. 

Each letter needs to be unique. Let me make sure each has different jobs, different repair purposes, and different specific details. 

Okay, time to draft each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered and they are concise.

Dear Bank Loan Committee  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 1108 DM to cover urgent roof repairs on my apartment in Munich. As a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich, I have been employed for 5 years with a stable monthly income of 2400 DM. Though my checking account is currently overdrawn by 150 DM due to recent unexpected expenses, I have consistently paid all bills on time and maintain real estate assets valued at 120,000 DM. I am a 28-year-old single father to a 3-year-old daughter, and we have lived in our residence for 3 years. As a foreign worker from Spain with a permanent residence permit, I prioritize financial responsibility, evidenced by my two existing loans with your bank for laboratory equipment, both repaid punctually. I assure you this loan will be managed with the same diligence. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely  
Luis Márquez

Dear Loan Review Team  
I request approval for a 1108 DM loan to repair my home’s outdated electrical system, which poses a fire hazard. Working as a certified electrician at Bayern Strom since 2019, I earn 2600 DM monthly and have no delinquencies on my credit history. My savings account holds 80 DM, but I own a condominium worth 150,000 DM in Nuremberg, my residence since 2020. At 28, I am single with one dependent—my mother, who lives with me. Though my checking account is currently negative due to recent part-time study for my master’s, I have two active bank credits for tools, both paid as agreed. As a foreign worker from Poland, I plan to settle permanently here. Your support would ensure my family’s safety.  

Respectfully

Dear Banking Department  
I seek a 1108 DM loan to fix severe plumbing leaks in my Berlin apartment. As an IT support technician at Deutsche Telekom since 2021, I earn 2300 DM monthly and have consistently met financial obligations. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 90 DM due to emergency pipe repairs, but I hold real estate valued at 130,000 DM. I am 28, single, and care for my 5-year-old son. Having lived in my current home for 3 years, I prioritize stability—reflected in my two existing loans with your bank for IT certifications, fully repaid. As a foreign national from Romania with a 6-year work visa, I am committed to long-term residency. Your trust in me would be well-placed.  

Yours faithfully

Dear Loan Officers  
I am applying for 1108 DM to replace my home’s broken windows, which have led to excessive heating costs. Employed as a mechanical engineer at BMW since 2020, I receive 2500 DM monthly and own property worth 140,000 DM in Regensburg. My savings account contains 50 DM, while my checking account is currently negative due to upfront repair quotes. I am 28, single, and support my father, who resides with me. With 5 years at my job and two existing auto-related loans with your bank (both settled), I demonstrate reliability. As a foreign worker from Italy, I have lived in Germany for 8 years and plan to stay. This loan aligns with my commitment to responsible finances.  

Sincerely

Dear Bank Management  
I need a 1108 DM loan to address foundational cracks in my Leipzig home. As a public administration officer at the city office since 2021, I earn 2200 DM monthly and have no overdue payments. My checking account is currently -120 DM due to contractor deposits, but I own real estate valued at 160,000 DM. At 28, I am single with one dependent—my sister, who I support financially. Having resided here for 3 years, I have two active loans with your bank for municipal training programs, both repaid. As a foreign worker from Portugal with a 5-year residency plan, I value trust and responsibility. Your approval would secure my family’s safety and peace of mind.
