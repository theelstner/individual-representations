Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the attributes.

First, the checking account balance is between 0 and 200 DM with a duration of 48 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is for radio/television, credit amount is 5951 DM. Savings account is less than 100 DM. Present employment since 1 to 4 years. Personal status is female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 2 years. Property is real estate. Age 22. No other installment plans. Housing is own. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each person should have these attributes but with specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant," "nurse," etc. Each letter needs to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Keep them short and concise.

Let me think of five different professions or scenarios. Maybe:

1. Nurse working in a clinic, married with one child, living in own apartment.
2. Teacher in a primary school, separated, living in own house.
3. Office administrator, married, one dependent, owns property.
4. Technical draftsman, divorced, owns a house.
5. Social worker, married, owns property.

Each needs specific details. Let me check the profile again to make sure I don't miss any attributes. The age is 22, so maybe adjust the experience accordingly. For example, if they have been employed for 1-4 years, maybe they started working right after school.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank name, and then the body. The body should state the purpose (radio/television), mention their credit history, current job, residence, property, and other factors. Emphasize trustworthiness by mentioning past payments and current employment.

Need to avoid formatting, so no bold or italics. Each letter should be self-contained, with proper beginning and end. Make sure to vary the specifics for each person. Let me start drafting each one, ensuring they all fit the profile but with unique details.

Dear [Bank Name]  

My name is Amina K. and I am writing to apply for a loan of 5951 DM to purchase a television for my household. I have been working as a nurse at the City Clinic for the past three years, where I earn a stable monthly income. I am 22 years old, married, and have one child to care for. Though my savings account currently holds less than 100 DM, I have consistently paid back my existing car loan on time, which I obtained from this bank six months ago. I have lived in my own residence for two years and own property in my hometown. While I do not own a telephone, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. I kindly request your approval based on my reliable employment and credit history.  

Sincerely  
Amina K.
