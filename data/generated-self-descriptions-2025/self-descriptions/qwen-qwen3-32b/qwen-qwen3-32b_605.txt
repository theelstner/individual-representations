Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the points.

First, the profile details: the person is 28 years old, female, divorced/separated/married, has a dependent (1 child), owns a car or other property, lives in their own housing, has a job in management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/office role, has a credit history with existing credits paid back duly, no checking account, savings less than 100 DM, employed for 1-4 years (let's pick specific durations like 2, 3, etc.), residence for 2 years, no other installment plans, no debtors/guarantors, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker. The loan is for furniture/equipment, amount 3349, and they already have one existing credit at the bank.

Each letter needs to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let me think of five different job roles from the profile's "Job" category. The profile says "management/ self-employed/ highly qualified employee/ officer". So maybe:

1. Management: Let's say a project manager.
2. Self-employed: Maybe a freelance graphic designer.
3. Highly qualified employee: Could be a scientific research assistant.
4. Officer: Maybe an administrative officer in a government agency.
5. Another possibility could be a small business owner (self-employed) but different from the first one. Wait, but the job category includes self-employed. Let me check the original profile again. The job is "management/ self-employed/ highly qualified employee/ officer". So maybe for the fifth one, a self-employed person in a different field, like a catering business owner.

Now, each person needs specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee", use "scientific research assistant", etc. Also, durations: existing credit duration is 36 months (3 years), present employment since 1-4 years (so maybe 2, 3, etc.), present residence since 2 years.

Let me outline each person:

1. **Project Manager (Management):** Female, 28, married with one child, employed as a project manager for 3 years, owns a car, lives in own housing. She needs furniture for a home office upgrade. Has paid back previous credit (maybe a car loan). No checking account but has a savings account with less than 100 DM. Trustworthy because of steady income and timely repayments.

2. **Freelance Graphic Designer (Self-Employed):** Divorced, 28, one dependent (child), self-employed for 2 years, owns a car. Needs equipment (design software, workstation). Has a good credit history. Trustworthy because of consistent income and existing credit repayment (maybe a business loan already paid back).

3. **Scientific Research Assistant (Highly Qualified Employee):** Married, 28, one child, working as a research assistant for 8 years (wait, the profile says present employment since 1-4 years. Oh, the profile says "Present employment since:1  <= ... < 4 years". So each person's employment duration should be between 1-4 years. So for the research assistant, maybe 3 years. But the original example in the profile says "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee", but the employment duration is 8 years. Wait, the original example in the problem statement says "8 years" instead of ">=7 years". So maybe in the letters, the employment duration is between 1-4 years. So for each person, they have been in their current job for 1-4 years. Let me adjust.

So for each person:

- Employment duration: 1, 2, 3, or 4 years. Let's assign different numbers for each letter.

Let me redo the five people:

1. **Project Manager (Management):** Employed for 3 years.

2. **Freelance Graphic Designer (Self-Employed):** Self-employed for 2 years.

3. **Scientific Research Assistant (Highly Qualified Employee):** Employed for 4 years.

4. **Administrative Officer (Officer):** Employed for 3 years.

5. **Small Business Owner (Self-Employed, different field):** Catering business owner, employed for 1 year.

Now, each letter must mention:

- Purpose: furniture or equipment. For example, home office furniture, design workstation, lab equipment, office supplies, kitchen equipment for catering.

- Financial situation: existing credit paid back, savings <100 DM, no checking account, own housing, car, etc.

- Trustworthiness: steady job, timely repayments, employment duration, residence stability, etc.

Also, each letter should be short and concise, not cut off, proper ending.

Let me start drafting each letter with these points in mind.

First letter: Project Manager.

Name: Let's say Anna Müller.

Age 28, married, one child. Employed as project manager for 3 years. Needs furniture for home office. Existing credit (maybe a previous loan for car) paid back. Trustworthy because of stable income and timely payments.

Second letter: Freelance Graphic Designer.

Name: Sarah Becker.

Divorced, 28, one child. Self-employed for 2 years. Needs equipment (software, workstation). Has savings <100 DM. Trustworthy because of consistent income and existing credit (maybe a previous loan for tools).

Third letter: Scientific Research Assistant.

Name: Dr. Lena Schmidt.

Married, 28, one child. Research assistant for 4 years. Needs lab equipment. Existing credit repaid. Trustworthy due to stable job and academic background.

Fourth letter: Administrative Officer.

Name: Marta Fischer.

Single mother, 28. Officer in government for 3 years. Needs furniture for living room. Trustworthy with steady salary and existing credit.

Fifth letter: Catering Business Owner.

Name: Julia Weber.

Self-employed catering, 28, separated, one child. Needs kitchen equipment. Employed for 1 year. Trustworthy because of business growth and timely repayments on existing credit.

Now, each letter should be written in first person, from the applicant's perspective. They need to mention their job, employment duration, purpose, financial situation, and why they're trustworthy.

Make sure to avoid generic terms and use specific instances. Also, check that each letter has the required profile attributes: no checking account, savings <100 DM, etc.

Let me write each letter now, keeping them concise.
