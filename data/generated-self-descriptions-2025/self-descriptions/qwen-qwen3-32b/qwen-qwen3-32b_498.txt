Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. The checking account is between 0 and 200 DM, duration 36 months. Credit history is good, existing credits paid back. Purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 9034 DM. Savings account is 100-500 DM. Employment since less than a year. Installment rate 4. Male, single, with a co-applicant. Residence since 1 month. No property. Age 29. No other installment plans. Renting. One existing credit at the bank. Job in management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/officer. One dependent. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered.

Each letter needs to be unique, with specific instances. Let me brainstorm different scenarios. The purpose is furniture/equipment, so maybe different types of furniture or equipment. The job can vary between management, self-employed, etc. Let me create five different people.

First person: Maybe a self-employed graphic designer needing equipment. He's 29, has been in business for under a year. Has a co-applicant, maybe a sibling. Savings account around 300 DM. Existing credit paid back. Needs a computer and design tools. Trustworthy because of timely payments before.

Second person: Management role, say a hotel manager. Needs furniture for a new apartment. Co-applicant is a friend. Has a good credit history. Recently moved, residence since 1 month. Trustworthy due to stable job and existing credit with the bank.

Third person: Highly qualified employee in IT. Needs office equipment for home setup. Maybe a co-applicant is a spouse, but the profile says male single. Wait, personal status is single. So co-applicant could be a parent or sibling. Let me adjust. Maybe a sibling as co-applicant. Trustworthy because of steady income and savings.

Fourth person: Self-employed chef needing kitchen equipment for a food truck. Co-applicant is a business partner. Recently established, so employment under a year. Savings 100-500 DM. Trustworthy due to business plan and existing credit history.

Fifth person: Officer in the military, needing furniture for a new residence. Co-applicant is a cousin. Moved recently, renting. Trustworthy due to stable military salary and telephone as a contact.

Now, each letter should mention specific details from the profile. Make sure to include checking account duration, savings amount, employment duration, residence since 1 month, etc. Also mention the co-applicant and why they're reliable. Avoid generic terms, use specific job titles and reasons for the loan.

Check each letter for the required elements: purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Keep them concise, not too long. Make sure each has a proper ending without any formatting. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are distinct and meet all criteria.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Lars Müller and I am a self-employed graphic designer applying for a loan of 9034 DM to purchase a high-performance computer and design software essential for my business. I have maintained a checking account with your bank for three years and have always repaid previous credits on time. Though I have been operating my business for less than a year, my client base is growing steadily, and my savings account currently holds 450 DM. My sister acts as a co-applicant and shares financial responsibility. I reside in my rented apartment for one month as I recently relocated for work. I assure you of my commitment to repay the installment of 4 DM monthly, supported by my stable project income and my track record of financial reliability. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely  
Lars Müller
