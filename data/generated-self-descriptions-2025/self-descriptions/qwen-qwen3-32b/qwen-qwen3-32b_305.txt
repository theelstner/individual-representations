Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile has specific attributes like the existing checking account is below 0 DM, duration of 10 months. Credit history is critical with other credits not at this bank. Purpose is a new car, amount 1038 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employment since 4 to 7 years (so maybe 5 years for one, 6 for another). Single male, co-applicant, residence since 3 years. Property is building society savings or life insurance. Age 49, no other installment plans, own housing, two existing credits at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, has a telephone, and registered foreign worker.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different jobs, reasons for the car, co-applicants (maybe spouse, family member?), and different specifics about their employment and savings.

First person: Let's make him a scientific research assistant. He needs a car for commuting to a lab. Maybe his wife is the co-applicant. He's been working at a university for 5 years. His savings are low because he's been paying off previous debts. He mentions his stable job and the co-applicant's income.

Second person: Maybe a public official, like a city administrator. His car is for work-related travel. Co-applicant could be his mother. He's been employed 6 years. He has a life insurance policy. He explains that his current checking account is negative due to recent medical expenses but is now stable.

Third person: Skilled employee in a technical field, like a mechanic. Needs a reliable car for work. Co-applicant is his sister. He's been working at a garage for 4 years. He mentions his building society savings. His savings are low because he's been saving for the car and has other existing loans.

Fourth person: Maybe an official in the healthcare sector, like a hospital administrator. Needs a car to commute and help with a dependent child. Co-applicant is his brother. He's been working 7 years. His checking account is negative due to a recent emergency repair, but he's caught up now.

Fifth person: A skilled employee in IT support. Needs a car for job-related travel. Co-applicant is his father. Employed 5 years. His savings are low because he's been investing in courses to upgrade skills. He has a critical credit history but has been managing other loans.

Each letter should be concise, mention specific numbers (like 5 years, 6 years), explain why they need the car, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should address the bank, state purpose, their current situation, co-applicant support, employment stability, and ability to repay. Make sure each has a proper ending with thanks and contact info.

I need to avoid generic terms. Use specific job titles, exact years (within the 4-7 range), specific reasons for the car. Also, address the critical credit history by showing responsibility, maybe by mentioning existing credits are managed well, co-applicant support, stable residence and job.

Check that each letter is different enough. Maybe vary the co-applicants (spouse, mother, sister, brother, father). Different reasons for the car (work necessity, dependents, job requirements). Different aspects of their financial situation (medical expenses, previous debts, investments in education, emergency repairs).

Also, ensure that each letter explains how they can manage the installment rate of 4 DM. Maybe mention their income, co-applicant's income, existing property like life insurance or building society savings as collateral.

Make sure each letter is short, not too long. Start with addressing the bank, state purpose, explain financial situation, employment, co-applicant, why they are trustworthy, and conclude with thanks and contact info.

Now, let me draft each letter step by step, making sure to include all required elements and specific details.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
To Whom It May Concern,  

I am writing to request a loan of 1,038 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have worked there for 5 years, earning a stable monthly income of 2,200 DM. My current checking account is in arrears due to an unexpected lab equipment repair, but I have a co-applicant, my wife Anna, who contributes 1,100 DM monthly from her nursing job. We reside in our own home and have a building society savings agreement valued at 1,500 DM. While my credit history includes a critical account from a prior auto loan at another bank, we have consistently met those payments. A reliable car is essential to commute to my lab, which is 45 minutes from home. With my stable employment and co-applicant’s support, I am confident in repaying the installment of 4 DM. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 1,038 DM loan to replace my aging car, which is no longer reliable for my work as a city tax administrator. I have worked for the municipal office of Hamburg for 6 years, earning 2,400 DM monthly. My current account deficit stems from recent medical expenses for my mother, who lives with me. My co-applicant, my sister Julia, a school teacher, guarantees additional financial support. We own our home and hold a life insurance policy worth 3,000 DM. Though my credit history includes prior loans at another institution, I have maintained timely repayments. This loan will ensure I can travel to client meetings without disruption. My stable income and co-applicant’s backing make me a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to your positive response.  

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker

**Motivation Letter 3**  
To Whom It May Concern,  

I am applying for a 1,038 DM car loan to support my work as a mechanic at Weber Auto Repairs, where I have been employed for 4 years. My current account balance is negative due to urgent brake repairs on my existing vehicle, which I have since resolved. My co-applicant, my sister Lena, a retail manager, will share repayment responsibility. We have lived at our current residence for 3 years and own a building society savings agreement of 2,000 DM. While my credit history includes a small business loan at another bank, I have never missed a payment. A new car is vital to transport tools to job sites. My steady income of 1,900 DM, combined with Lena’s 1,000 DM, ensures timely repayment of the 4 DM installment. Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Matthias Fischer

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Bank Manager,  

I request a 1,038 DM loan to purchase a vehicle for my role as a hospital logistics coordinator at St. Anna Clinic, where I have worked for 6 years. My current account deficit resulted from emergency roof repairs at home, which I have since covered. My co-applicant, my brother Felix, a software developer, will support this loan. We own our home and hold a life insurance policy worth 2,500 DM. My credit history includes a small personal loan at another bank, which I repay punctually. This car is necessary to transport medical supplies between departments and manage my 1 dependent child. With a monthly income of 2,100 DM and Felix’s 1,200 DM, I am confident in meeting the installment. Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
Jan Roth

**Motivation Letter 5**  
To Whom It May Concern,  

I am applying for a 1,038 DM loan to acquire a vehicle for my job as an IT support specialist at TechNova GmbH, where I have worked for 5 years. My current account balance is negative due to a recent laptop replacement required for work, but my income of 2,300 DM ensures stability. My co-applicant, my father Hans, a retired engineer, guarantees additional financial responsibility. We reside in our own home and have a building society savings agreement of 1,800 DM. While my credit history includes a student loan at another bank, I have consistently repaid it. This car will allow me to service clients across the region. With my income and my father’s 1,000 DM monthly support, I am committed to repaying the 4 DM installment. Thank you for your time.  

Respectfully,  
Nico Schmidt
