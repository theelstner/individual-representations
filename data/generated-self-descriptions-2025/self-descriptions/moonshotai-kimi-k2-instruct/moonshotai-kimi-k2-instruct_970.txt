Letter 1 – Roberto Silva, HVAC Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting €7 166 to replace the broken television and radio equipment my wife uses for her home-based language-tutoring business. I have worked as an HVAC technician at KlimaTech GmbH for the past six years and take home €2 400 net. My single existing bank loan—€5 000 for our wedding three years ago—has been paid on time every month; only two installments remain. We rent a 65 m² flat in Dortmund-Mitte since 2020 and hold a life-insurance policy with €12 000 surrender value as our only property. No other debts or dependents besides my wife and our toddler. With an installment rate of only 2 % of disposable income, the proposed €145 monthly payment fits easily into our budget. I have never missed a utility bill and can be reached at the registered German landline. Thank you for considering our application.  
Respectfully,  
Roberto Silva  

Letter 2 – Dr. Ahmed Hamid, Scientific Research Assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 29-year-old Egyptian post-doc at the University of Cologne, married, with one daughter. After 42 months in Germany I need €7 166 to furnish our apartment with a television and audio system so my wife can continue her online Arabic-literature courses. My employment contract as a scientific research assistant began in January 2018 and runs until 2024, paying €3 100 net. My only current credit—€6 500 for household goods—has been serviced flawlessly; the bank’s own records confirm zero arrears. We rent, hold no savings account, but maintain a building-society savings agreement begun last year. The requested loan would cost €158 monthly, well within the 2 % installment margin. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a verified landline. I trust my documented repayment history speaks for itself.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Ahmed Hamid  

Letter 3 – Lukas Meyer, Police Sergeant  
Dear Lending Team,  
As a married police sergeant stationed in Dresden since 2017, I earn €2 750 net and need €7 166 to upgrade our home communication devices so my wife can run her certified first-aid webinars. My payroll is deposited to my savings bank, though I do not operate a private checking account. My previous €8 000 car loan with your institution will be completed this July; every payment has been punctual. We rent, have no savings account, but own a paid-up life-insurance policy worth €15 000. The new loan’s €152 monthly installment represents 2 % of net income, leaving ample room for family expenses. Dependents: one son. No other loans, no guarantors, registered telephone line available. I appreciate your quick decision.  
Best regards,  
Lukas Meyer  

Letter 4 – Dimitri Petrov, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am a 29-year-old Russian machinist at AutoParts AG, married, with a five-year-old daughter. Since arriving in Germany 42 months ago I have rented the same flat in Wolfsburg. My sole credit of €5 500—taken for furniture—has been repaid diligently; the bank can verify perfect history. I now seek €7 166 to purchase a television and recording equipment so my wife can stream children’s programmes for her nursery assistant diploma. My gross salary is €3 400, net €2 200; the proposed €160 monthly installment equals 2 % of disposable income. I hold no checking account, no savings, but maintain a life-insurance policy. No other debts, no co-signers, landline reachable. Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Dimitri Petrov  

Letter 5 – Jonas Weber, IT System Administrator  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am a system administrator at Stadtwerke München, employed since March 2018, earning €3 000 net. My wife and I, both 29, care for our infant daughter and have lived in the same rented flat for four years. We request €7 166 to buy a smart television and studio microphone so my wife can expand her online craft channel. My only existing loan—€7 000 for relocation costs—has been serviced without delay; the final payment is next month. We have no savings account but hold a building-society savings contract. The new loan’s €149 monthly payment stays within the 2 % installment threshold. No further debts, no guarantors, telephone registered under my name. I look forward to your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Weber
