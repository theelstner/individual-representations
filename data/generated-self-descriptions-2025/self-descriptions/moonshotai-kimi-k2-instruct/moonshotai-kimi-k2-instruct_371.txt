Letter 1  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 40-year-old Bulgarian lab technician at Leipzig University Hospital for the past six years. I rent a small apartment where I live with my ten-year-old daughter. I need 3,001 DM to buy a sturdy desk, an ergonomic chair and a quiet refrigerator so I can study for my German medical-technician exam at night after shifts. My checking balance is 165 DM and my savings book holds 85 DM, yet every month 120 DM automatically clears the first small consumer loan I took two years ago; the bank has never waited a day. With 1.9 % of my net salary going to the new installment, I can still set aside 150 DM for emergencies. The apartment building belongs to me through divorce settlement; the notarized deed is yours to file. Please approve the 18-month loan—my daughter’s school success and my career depend on it.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luisa Morales, divorced Peruvian cook at München Ostbahnhof Gasthaus, employed since 2018. My daughter Camila, 12, shares my rented flat. My only checking account shows 180 DM and my savings passbook 70 DM, but I have never missed the 95-DM payment on the 2,500 DM kitchen-equipment loan you granted in 2021. I ask for 3,001 DM to replace the broken commercial-grade mixer and oven trays I use for private catering that already earns me 250 DM extra monthly. The installment will be 2 % of my income—exactly 115 DM—leaving 300 DM buffer after rent. I own a 55 m² condo in Lima which I rent out; the German land-registry waiver is enclosed. Grant me the loan and I will keep proving that a foreign worker can be your most reliable client.  
Sincerely,  
Luisa Morales

Dear Team,  
My name is Samira Haddad, 40, separated, Jordanian senior radiology assistant at Frankfurt Westend Hospital since 2019. My checking account holds 150 DM and my savings 90 DM, yet I have honored every 105-DM payment on the 2020 laptop loan. I seek 3,001 DM for a height-adjustable treatment couch and ultrasound step-stool to open Saturday home-service sessions for elderly patients, already booked for the next four months. The 110-DM installment equals 1.8 % of my salary; after household costs 400 DM remain. I possess a small inherited house in Amman; the Grundbuchfreistellung is attached. I have lived at the same address for four years and my eight-year-old son counts on me. Allow me this 18-month loan and I will continue to pay dutifully, as your records show.  
With thanks,  
Samira Haddad

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Olga Nowak, married Polish quality-controller at BMW Leipzig, employed since February 2018. My husband works in Warsaw; I rent here alone with my six-year-old daughter. My checking balance is 190 DM and savings 95 DM, but I have never been late on the 100-DM monthly payment for the 2020 bicycle loan. I apply for 3,001 DM to buy a solid-wood bunk-bed, dresser and blackout blinds so my child no longer shares my mattress. The new installment of 118 DM is 2 % of my net wage; after expenses I still save 220 DM. I own a 42 m² Kraków studio free of liens; the Pfandfreistellung is enclosed. After four stable years in the same flat I ask for your trust for the next 18 months.  
Yours faithfully,  
Olga Nowak

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Aisha Rahman, 40, divorced Bangladeshi senior pharmacy technician at Dresden Friedrichstadt Hospital since 2017. My checking account shows 175 DM and my savings 80 DM, yet the bank has received every 110-DM payment on my 2019 training-loan on the dot. I request 3,001 DM to purchase a silent compressor nebulizer, a medical-grade treadmill and a desk so I can run evening respiratory-rehab sessions already approved by my chief physician. The proposed 120-DM installment equals 1.9 % of my income, leaving 350 DM after rent and food. I hold a 60 m² Dhaka apartment documented in the land-letter attached. After four years in the same rented flat and raising my eight-year-old son alone, I promise to repay the 18-month loan as faithfully as the first.  
Respectfully yours,  
Aisha Rahman
