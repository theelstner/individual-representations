Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Kovač; I arrived from Sarajevo four months ago and work nights as a hospital cleaner in Leipzig. I need 2 101 DM for a small colour television so my six-year-old daughter Lejla can follow German lessons broadcast by the local station; her teacher says it will speed up her integration. My net wage is 620 DM; rent on our one-room flat is 230 DM and the 100 DM monthly repayment on this loan would still leave 90 DM buffer. My only existing bank credit—500 DM for a used washing machine—has been paid on time every month since March. Herr Berndt, my guarantor, is a senior orderly who has been employed by the same hospital for 18 years. Though my savings book shows only 87 DM, I have never missed a payment in Bosnia or Germany. I ask for your trust so that my daughter can learn and I can continue building a safe future here. Thank you for considering us.

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrova, 23, Bulgarian, divorced, and mother of little Nikol. Since January I assemble car-seat belts on the early shift, earning 680 DM. I apply for 2 101 DM to buy a solid second-hand television and indoor antenna; the set I borrowed from my neighbour died last week and Nikol keeps asking why the cartoons stopped. My building-society contract, started with 50 DM, is my only property, yet it proves I plan ahead. I have lived at the same address for four years and my guarantor is my sister who has worked as a cook in the same restaurant for three years. With no other debts and a perfect repayment record on my current 300 DM fridge loan, I respectfully request the funds; the instalment of 100 DM fits easily inside my budget. Thank you for helping a mother keep her child smiling.

Dear Team,  
My name is Fatima Al-Hassan, Syrian, resident in Germany since last autumn. I am 23, separated, and care for my infant son Rami while working mornings as a kitchen helper at a nursing home (650 DM net). The 2 101 DM loan will buy a television so I can follow German-language programmes and improve my speech; integration office staff confirm this accelerates language acquisition. My checking balance is 156 DM and my savings passbook holds 60 DM, but discipline matters more than figures: my current 450 DM microwave loan has been serviced promptly each month. My guarantor is Herr Neumann, the home’s head chef, employed 14 years. My share of rent is 220 DM; after food and the proposed 100 DM instalment I still retain 90 DM cushion. I have no other credits, no telephone bills, and no missed payments in my file. I respectfully ask for approval so I can learn the language, secure a better job, and repay faster. Thank you for your confidence.

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Ivana Mladić, Croatian, 23, divorced, living with my three-year-old daughter Mia in a small owned flat in Augsburg. I earn 655 DM monthly as a cleaner at a dental clinic, a job I started nine months ago. I seek 2 101 DM for a television; Mia needs children’s programmes for language development and I need evening news to improve my German. My bank account shows 178 DM and my savings book 45 DM, yet reliability is proven: my only running loan, 380 DM for a winter pram, has never been late. My guarantor is Dr. Meyer whose practise I clean; he has employed the same nurse for 15 years and guarantees my character. The 100 DM monthly instalment equals 15% of income, well below the 20% rule. I carry no other debts, have lived at the same address four years, and hold a life-insurance policy as modest property. Please approve the loan so my daughter and I can keep learning. Thank you sincerely.

Dear Bank Committee,  
My name is Elena Popescu, Romanian, 23, married but currently separated from my husband. I work the late shift in a vegetable-packing plant in Dortmund, netting 640 DM, and live with my four-year-old son Andrei in our own small apartment. I request 2 101 DM to purchase a television; without it Andrei cannot watch the educational morning shows his kindergarten recommends, and I cannot follow the language courses broadcast after work. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings book 70 DM; nevertheless my payment record is clean: the 420 DM loan I took for a bed has been repaid dutifully every month since February. My guarantor is Frau Schmidt, the plant’s shift supervisor, employed 16 years. The proposed 100 DM monthly repayment fits my budget: after rent (210 DM) and food I retain 110 DM safety margin. I have no other instalment plans, no telephone contract, and no history of default. I respectfully ask for your support so my son can learn and I can continue integrating into German society. Thank you for your consideration.
