Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franz Müller, 35, single father of a 7-year-old boy and resident of 45 Bahnhofstraße, Augsburg. Since 2021 I have worked as a warehouse picker for the local pharmaceutical distributor Sanova GmbH. My monthly net income is 1,650 DM and my only bank account currently holds 180 DM because I have just paid the final instalment on my existing 1,500 DM loan—every instalment was transferred on the due date. I now request 1,941 DM over 18 months to buy a used 3.5-tonne delivery van so that I can start an evening courier service for pharmacies. The vehicle costs 2,400 DM; the remaining 459 DM comes from my building-society savings (balance 1,200 DM). With the extra income I conservatively expect 300 DM profit per month, so the 108 DM monthly repayment equals only 4 % of my disposable income. I have no other debts, own my small row house outright and have lived at the same address for two years. The telephone is registered in my name. I respectfully ask you to approve the loan; my payment record with you is already proven and my livelihood depends on expanding my modest business.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Franz Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Stefan Baumgartner, 35, unmarried, living at 12a Rosenweg in Regensburg. I have been employed since 2022 as a janitor and maintenance assistant at the University Hospital, earning 1,580 DM net. My checking balance is 150 DM today because I settled last month’s bills promptly, including the final payment on my current 1,200 DM loan which I have served without delay. I apply for 1,941 DM over 18 months to purchase professional high-pressure cleaning equipment so I can offer weekend façade-cleaning services to small businesses. I already have 1,100 DM in my building-society savings and need no further capital. The monthly instalment of 108 DM represents 4 % of my net income, well within safe limits. I have no other instalment plans, no guarantors, and have lived in my own small terraced house since 2022. A telephone is installed and my foreign-worker status is properly registered. I have shown reliable repayment behaviour and am ready to do so again.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Baumgartner

Dear Madam,  
I am Karl Neumann, 35, single, residing at 7 Im Winkel, Dortmund. Since February 2021 I have worked as an unskilled assembly-line operator at the regional brewery, with a stable net wage of 1,700 DM. My checking account shows 190 DM after I honoured every previous loan payment; my 1,400 DM credit with your bank will be closed next month, again without arrears. I seek 1,941 DM to buy a commercial popcorn machine and supply local Christmas markets. My building-society savings contain 1,050 DM, so I finance the rest myself. The proposed 108 DM monthly repayment is only 4 % of my net income. I own my apartment, have no dependents other than my 10-year-old daughter, carry no other debt, and have resided at the same address for two years. The telephone line is registered to me and my work permit is in order. My record proves I service debts diligently; I ask for your support to secure extra income for my family.  
Respectfully,  
Karl Neumann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Lukas Huber, 35, single, living at 3 Falkensteinerstraße in Salzburg. I have been a resident unskilled worker at the electronics plant since May 2021, taking home 1,620 DM each month. My checking balance is 170 DM because I have just repaid my previous 1,300 DM loan according to schedule. I request 1,941 DM over 18 months to acquire a professional floor-sanding machine so I can refinish parquet on evenings and weekends. I have 1,300 DM in my building-society contract and need no additional funds. The monthly instalment of 108 DM equals 4 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living costs. I have no other instalment obligations, no co-debtors, and have owned my small townhouse since 2022. My telephone is connected and my foreign-worker papers are current. My disciplined repayment history demonstrates reliability; I am confident I will service this loan equally well.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Lukas Huber

Dear Sirs,  
I am Matthias Hartmann, 35, unmarried, residing at 18 Am Kühlen Grund, Wiesbaden. I have worked as an unskilled groundskeeper for the city parks department since March 2021, earning 1,550 DM net. My checking account presently holds 160 DM, having just cleared the last instalment of my 1,100 DM loan without ever falling behind. I apply for 1,941 DM to buy a used lawn-tractor with snow-blade attachment, enabling me to offer private garden and winter services. My building-society savings stand at 1,100 DM, covering the tractor cost together with your loan. The 108 DM monthly payment represents 4 % of my income, a comfortable margin. I have no other debts, live in my own modest home, and have stayed at the same address for two years. The telephone is listed under my name and my residence permit is valid. My past conduct shows I meet obligations; I respectfully request approval so I can build a secure future.  
Yours sincerely,  
Matthias Hartmann
