Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, a 26-year-old single father and senior lab technician at BioChem Solutions for the past eight years. I earn €2 100 net and need €1 934 to replace our broken television—the only educational screen my 5-year-old daughter has for her distance-learning classes. I have no checking account here, but my salary is deposited to my savings book which currently holds €85. My two previous loans with your bank (€600 car and €400 dental) were repaid ahead of schedule; the critical flag on my credit file refers to a €120 phone bill now settled. I live rent-free in my late mother’s house, so housing costs are only utilities. The requested instalment of €38 over 12 months equals 1.8 % of my income, well within the 2 % limit. Please approve this small loan so my daughter can keep up with school. I have never missed a payment and am ready to sign a direct-pay order from my salary.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arkady Volkov, 26, a Moldovan CNC operator at RheinMetall GmbH since February 2016. I take home €2 040 monthly and need €1 934 for a television to continue my certified evening courses in mechanical design; the screen doubles as a second monitor for CAD work. My savings balance is €72. Although my credit history shows a €98 overdraft at another bank, it was cleared last month. I have no property, but I have lived in the same workers’ dormitory room for two years and am considered a permanent employee. My two prior loans with you—€550 for tools and €480 for relocation—are paid in full. The proposed €38 monthly payment fits the 2 % debt-service rule and leaves me ample margin to support my mother abroad. I authorise automatic wage transfer and will provide payslips on request. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Arkady Volkov

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Samir Haddad, a 26-year-old Lebanese electronics technician at Stadtwerke München, employed continuously since July 2015. I earn €2 180 net and am requesting €1 934 to purchase a television that will allow my wheelchair-bound brother to complete his university lectures from home. My savings passbook shows €64. My credit file carries a “critical” note from a €90 unpaid magazine subscription in 2021; the debt was repaid after a brief dispute. I have successfully closed two earlier loans with your institution (€650 household goods, €450 language course). I live in my deceased grandparents’ house and pay only property tax. The €38 monthly instalment represents 1.7 % of income, comfortably below the 2 % ceiling. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I consent to salary attachment. I trust my record demonstrates reliability and ask for prompt approval.  
Kind regards,  
Samir Haddad

Dear Lending Department,  
I write as Tomas Jiménez, 26, a single male and certified welder at Hamburg Ship Repair for eight years. My monthly net is €2 200 and I seek €1 934 for a television that my dependent sister uses for her sign-language classes. My account balance is €78. A €95 disputed mobile charge from 2020 marks my credit report; it is now resolved. My two completed loans with your bank—€500 for welding gear and €425 for emergency travel—were fulfilled without delay. I reside in company-provided housing since 2022 and own no real estate. The requested repayment of €38 monthly equals 1.7 % of income, meeting the 2 % requirement. I have no other obligations and offer direct payroll deduction. I appreciate your trust and will furnish any documents needed.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tomas Jiménez

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Rajesh Kumar, 26, an Indian software-testing specialist at FinTech Solutions, employed since March 2015 with a net salary of €2 150. I am applying for €1 934 to buy a television so my bedridden father can access physiotherapy videos prescribed after his stroke. My savings ledger holds €69. A €93 unpaid gym membership from 2021 caused the critical notation on my credit file; it has since been paid and the entry updated. I have honoured two prior loans from your bank—€580 for a laptop and €460 for visa fees—closing both early. I have lived in the same shared flat for two years and have no property liabilities. The €38 monthly payment accounts for 1.8 % of income, within the 2 % cap. No other debts or guarantors exist, and I agree to an automatic salary transfer. Thank you for considering my application; I remain available for any clarification.  
Respectfully,  
Rajesh Kumar
