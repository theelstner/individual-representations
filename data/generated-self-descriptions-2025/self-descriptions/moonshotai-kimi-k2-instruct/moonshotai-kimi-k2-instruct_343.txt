Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Rosa Martínez, a 26-year-old divorced mother of a six-year-old boy. For the past five years I have worked the night shift as a cleaning assistant at the University Clinic, earning €1,350 net. My current account is €120 overdrawn and my savings book holds €80, but every previous loan—one for my used Opel Corsa—has been paid on the dot. I now need €3,599 to buy a sturdy bed, a desk and a quiet refrigerator so my son can do homework while I sleep after my shift. My rent contract is four years old, I have no other debts, and the university has just renewed my open-ended contract. I authorize you to debit the €167 monthly installment directly from my salary account. Thank you for helping us build a decent home.  
Respectfully, Rosa Martínez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Aisha Al-Hassan, Syrian resident, 26, separated, one daughter. I have sewn pockets at LederMode GmbH since 2019 and take home €1,280. My checking account shows –€90, my savings €60; nevertheless I have never missed the €150 payment on my car loan, now nearly finished. I apply for €3,599 to buy a used industrial sewing machine and an ergonomic chair so I can accept freelance tailoring orders at home and raise my monthly income above €1,600. I live in the same studio for four years, pay €350 rent, own no property except my 2013 VW Polo, and carry no other debt. The attached employer letter confirms my position is secure; overtime is offered every month. Please allow me 21 months to repay with the modest rate of 1; I will stand by my signature as I have since arriving in Germany.  
With thanks, Aisha Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
I am Karolina Nowak, Polish, 26, married but living apart, supporting my four-year-old daughter alone. I have driven deliveries for BioBäckerei Krüger since late 2019, grossing €1,420. My account is €50 in the red, my savings €70, yet my only prior loan—taken for my delivery van—was repaid ahead of schedule. I seek €3,599 to furnish her room with a bunk bed, wardrobe and laptop so she need no longer sleep on my couch. I rent the same flat four years, have no other credits, and the bakery manager has promised me the morning route permanently. Debit €167 monthly; you will never wait for your money.  
Sincerely, Karolina Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Elena Petrova, Bulgarian, 26, divorced, mother of a five-year-old boy. I work as a kitchen assistant at Seaside Restaurant since 2018, earning €1,300 net. My checking balance is –€70, savings €95, but my completed car loan shows perfect discipline. I request €3,599 to replace the broken stove and refrigerator in our rented apartment and to buy a small table where my son can eat warm meals. I have lived in the same address four years, have no other installment plans, and the restaurant owner will increase my hours this winter. I am ready for the €167 monthly debit and will provide payslips each quarter if desired.  
Best regards, Elena Petrova

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Laila Ben Amor, Tunisian, 26, separated, one daughter aged seven. I have worked as a warehouse unloader for LogiSped since 2018, earning €1,310 net. My account is overdrawn by €100 and my savings passbook holds €90, yet I have never been late on my prior small loan for my 2011 Renault. I apply for €3,599 to buy a solid wood bed, a washing machine and a desk so my child no longer shares my mattress or studies on the floor. I rent the same flat four years, own nothing else, and have no other debts. My shift supervisor has written that my contract runs indefinitely. Please grant me the loan with the gentle rate of 1; I will repay €167 every month without fail, as proven by my clean Schufa record.  
Respectfully yours, Laila Ben Amor
