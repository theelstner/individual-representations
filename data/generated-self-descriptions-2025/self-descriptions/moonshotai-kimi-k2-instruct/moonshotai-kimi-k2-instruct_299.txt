Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Marco Bellini, 45, a single father who has spent the last 8 years as a night-shift warehouse porter at St. Joseph’s Hospital.  My 12-year-old daughter and I live in the small house I inherited; I have kept it insured and maintained since 2022.  I need €1,287 to buy the 2015 Fiat Panda offered by the hospital’s car-pool programme—without it I cannot reach the annex where my shift starts at 05:00.  My wages are modest (€1,420 net), but every previous loan—two for furniture, one for a fridge—has been repaid ahead of schedule through payroll deduction.  My older brother, Paolo, who has been a branch teller here for 14 years, is willing to co-sign.  I have no other debts, no rent, and I save €120 a month into my life-insurance plan.  Grant me this loan and I will repay €107.25 monthly for 12 months; the premium will be debited automatically from my salary account.  Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Marco Bellini

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Petru Iliescu, 45, unmarried, and since 2015 I have swept streets for Sector 3 Municipality.  I reside in my late parents’ flat, fully paid since 2022, and I contribute €50 monthly to the municipal building-savings contract.  I am requesting €1,287 to purchase a new Dacia Spring that will cut my 90-minute bus commute to 25 minutes, allowing me to accept the extra dawn shift that adds €180 net each month.  Over the past decade I have repaid two small loans punctually; the last €800 balance was cleared six months early.  My cousin, Alina, a tenured maths teacher, will stand as co-applicant.  With no rent, no dependents other than my cat, and a debt-to-income ratio of 4 %, I can comfortably service €107.25 per month.  I respectfully ask for approval and pledge the same punctuality that has marked my 8-year employment record.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petru Iliescu

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Klaus Weber, 45, a resident unskilled worker at Bayer’s Leverkusen plant for the past 9 years.  I live alone in my deceased mother’s row house (owned outright since 2022) and pay into a life-insurance policy with €3,800 cash value.  I seek €1,287 to buy a new Opel Karl from the works dealership; the vehicle will let me reach the rotating night shift that carries a €250 monthly bonus.  My payroll records show flawless repayment of a €950 television loan finished last spring.  My co-worker, Herr Schmidt, 52, will act as co-applicant.  My budget shows €160 free cash after all obligations; the proposed €107.25 instalment equals 4 % of net income.  I have no other credits, no rent, and I have never missed a utility bill.  Please approve the loan; I stand ready to sign the direct-debit mandate.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Weber

Dear Loan Committee,  
I write as Luis Ortega, 45, single janitor at the University of Seville for 7 years and 4 months.  I reside in the self-owned studio granted by my late aunt (registered 2022) and hold a building-society savings booklet with €2,100 balance.  I need €1,287 to acquire a new Kia Picanto, the only model that fits the restricted parking space behind the faculty where I must report at 04:30 to prepare labs.  My credit file shows two previous loans—both for household appliances—repaid without delay.  My sister, Carmen, a civil servant, volunteers as co-applicant.  The monthly payment of €107.25 represents exactly 4 % of my net salary; I have no rent, no other instalments, and I save €130 monthly.  I respectfully request approval and guarantee payment by payroll transfer.  
Kind regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Madam,  
My name is Jani Nieminen, 45, unmarried maintenance aide at Tampere General for 8 years.  I have lived in my deceased grandmother’s flat, debt-free since 2022, and contribute €60 monthly to OP life insurance.  I apply for €1,287 to buy a new Toyota Aygo offered to staff at 15 % discount until month-end; without a car the 02:00 winter emergency calls require taxis that cost €200 monthly.  My bank history shows one prior €1,000 loan repaid in 10 months.  My colleague, Ms. Virtanen, head nurse, will co-sign.  The loan instalment of €107.25 is 4 % of my net pay; after housing costs I retain €340 surplus.  I have no dependents, no other debts, and I have never defaulted on municipal taxes.  I kindly ask for swift approval and authorise direct debit from my salary.  
Respectfully,  
Jani Nieminen
