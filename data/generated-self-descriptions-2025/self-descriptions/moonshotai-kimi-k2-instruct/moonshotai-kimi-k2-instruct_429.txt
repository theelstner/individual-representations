Letter 1 – Herr Dmitri Volkov, Lab Technician  
I arrived from St. Petersburg eighteen months ago and have rented a small house in Nürnberg for my daughter and myself. As a radio-television repair specialist I have just been offered a permanent post at Techno-Serv GmbH with 1 700 € net. My savings book holds 1 200 € and I own the one-family home outright, inherited from my late mother. The 1 149 € loan will buy the digital oscilloscope I need to meet the firm’s new contract with ARD/ZDF; without it I cannot keep the job. Two previous credits with this bank were repaid early; no other debts exist. I am 46, single, and have lived at Friedhofstraße 14 for three years. Please approve the loan; my livelihood and my daughter’s future depend on it.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 2 – Herr Luis Ortega, Warehouse Foreman  
I came from Barcelona three years ago and now supervise a 12-man team at Logistik-Hub GmbH, employed since 2021. My net salary is 1 850 € and my savings balance 1 050 €. I own my row-house in Fürth without mortgage. The requested 1 149 € will finance a 55-inch smart TV and satellite kit so my autistic son can receive therapeutic educational programmes in Spanish and German; his psychologist confirms this aids development. Two earlier loans from your institution were fully repaid; no other obligations remain. I am 46, single, and have no telephone yet, but I can always be reached through my employer. I ask for your trust once more.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 3 – Herr Viktor Szabó, Brewery Engineer  
Since emigrating from Budapest I have brewed beer at Privatbrauerei Kummert for the past 30 months, currently earning 1 950 € net. My savings passbook shows 1 100 € and my small bungalow in Erlangen is debt-free. The 1 149 € credit will purchase a professional-grade flat-screen to monitor fermentation temperatures via camera; this upgrade is required to keep my ISO 22000 certification. I have honoured two prior loans with your bank and carry no other debt. Age 46, single, resident at Hauptstraße 37 for three years, I guarantee punctual payment through salary assignment. Thank you for your support.  
Hochachtungsvoll,  
Viktor Szabó  

Letter 4 – Herr Aleksandar Milić, Tram Driver  
I have driven trams for VAG since early 2022, bringing home 1 780 € monthly. My savings account holds 1 000 € exactly and I own the apartment I live in, having paid off the mortgage. I need 1 149 € for a television and digital receiver so I can follow the mandatory training broadcasts required for my depot’s new signalling system. My two previous credits with you were settled ahead of schedule; I have no other liabilities. I am 46, single, and have resided at Äußere Bayreuther Str. 88 since 2021. Kindly grant the loan; repayment will be made by direct debit from my salary.  
Freundliche Grüße,  
Aleksandar Milić  

Letter 5 – Herr Constantin Petrescu, Surgical-Device Technician  
I left Bucharest in 2021 and now service operating-room monitors at Klinikum Süd, earning 1 920 € net. My savings book shows 1 150 € and my terraced house in Zirndorf is unencumbered. The 1 149 € loan will allow me to buy a medical-grade 4K display for home calibration tests, a requirement for maintaining my DIN 13485 authorisation and thus my job. I have already repaid two smaller credits with your bank and have no further debts. I am 46, single, have lived at Rosenweg 7 for three years, and can provide my employment contract as security. I respectfully request approval.  
Mit vorzüglicher Verehrung,  
Constantin Petrescu
