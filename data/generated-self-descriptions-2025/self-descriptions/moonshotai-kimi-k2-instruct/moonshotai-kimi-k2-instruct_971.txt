Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Anton Petrov, a 40-year-old Bulgarian warehouse picker who has lived in Germany for six years. I need 3,939 € to replace the 1998 Golf that just failed inspection; without a car I cannot reach my 4 a.m. shift at the Dräger logistics centre in Lübeck. Though my checking account is 120 € overdrawn, my net wage of 1,950 € has arrived on the 25th of every month since I started three years ago. I own my small row-house in Stockelsdorf outright; the land-registry value is 145,000 €. My two school-age children depend on me and I have never missed a rent, utility or credit payment—my only existing loans, 5,400 € for home insulation and 2,100 € for a heating system, are serviced automatically and will be cleared in 2021. A new small car is cheaper and more reliable than constant repairs; the monthly installment of 120 € leaves me 820 € after fixed costs. I respectfully ask for your trust and the loan.  
Sincerely,  
Anton Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Mendoza, 40, single, from Paraguay, working as an unskilled cleaner at the University Hospital Münster since April 2017. I apply for 3,939 € to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can rotate between day and late shifts 30 km away. My checking account shows –45 € because I just paid kindergarten fees for my two daughters, yet my pay-slip of 1,710 € is secure under the public-sector tariff. I have lived in the same rented flat for two years and own a 480 m² plot in Gievenbeck (purchased 2015, market value 60,000 €) on which I plan to build. My only other credit, a 3,600 € solar-panel loan with your competitor, has been paid flawlessly for 28 months. With no other debts and a disposable 870 € monthly surplus, I can comfortably service the 120 € installment. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Mendoza

Dear Team,  
My name is Farid Azizi, Afghan national, 40, resident here since 2015 and employed as an unskilled bakery assistant at Bäckerei Kamps in Cologne. I am requesting 3,939 € to purchase a new Kia Picanto; my current 22-year-old Polo died, and public transport at 3 a.m. is impossible. My checking balance is –78 € after settling winter electricity, but my 1,650 € wage has been stable for the 34 months I have held this job. I live in my own 42 m² apartment (fully paid, value 55,000 €) and support my two nephews who attend local school. My record shows disciplined repayment of a 4,200 € furniture loan concluded last year. After essential expenses I retain 740 €, so the 120 € car installment is easily covered. I kindly ask for your support to keep my employment secure.  
Best regards,  
Farid Azizi

Dear Loan Department,  
I, Stefan Radu, Romanian citizen, 40, single father of two, have worked since 2018 as an unskilled line worker at the Liebherr refrigerator plant in Marienberg. I seek 3,939 € for a new Toyota Aygo; my 1999 Corsa’s gearbox failed and spare parts are unavailable. My account is 95 € negative after buying school materials, yet my gross wage of 1,880 € is guaranteed by the metal-workers’ collective agreement. I have owned my 65 m² condominium since 2019 (mortgage-free, valued 68,000 €) and have no housing costs beyond utilities. My only running loan, a 3,000 € laptop financing plan, will finish next April with perfect payment history. The proposed 120 € monthly installment represents 6 % of income, leaving 910 € for living costs and savings. Please approve my application so I can maintain punctual shift attendance.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Radu

Dear Creditor,  
My name is Khalid Hassan, 40, Egyptian, living in Dresden and working as an unskilled kitchen porter at the Hilton Hotel since May 2017. I apply for 3,939 € to buy a new Hyundai i10; night buses do not run after my 11 p.m. shift end. My checking account currently shows –62 € due to a dental bill, but my steady net income of 1,750 € covers all obligations. I have resided in my own 55 m² apartment (purchased 2018, market value 62,000 €) and have no rent or loan collateral issues. My sole existing credit, a 3,300 € personal loan for relocation costs, is paid on time every month and will close in September 2021. After fixed expenses I have 800 € free cash, so the 120 € installment is easily affordable. I kindly request your approval to safeguard my job reliability.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Khalid Hassan
