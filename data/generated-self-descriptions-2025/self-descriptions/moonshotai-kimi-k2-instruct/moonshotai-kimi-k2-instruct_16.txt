Letter 1 – Maria, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a 28-year-old laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig, employed for 2 years and 9 months with a net salary of 1 550 DM. I need 1 403 DM to complete the purchase of a new VW Polo so I can drive my 6-year-old daughter to school and reach the early shift that starts at 05:30; public transport does not run at that hour. My current account is overdrawn by 90 DM, but my only bank loan—250 DM/month for household appliances—has been paid on time for 15 months. I rent a 48 m² flat in Reudnitz where I have lived for 4 years; the car itself will serve as additional collateral. No other debts, no guarantors, just one dependent. I ask for 24 monthly installments of 65 DM, which equals 2 % of my disposable income, well below the bank’s guideline. Please approve the loan; my daughter’s safety and my punctuality at work depend on it.  
Respectfully,  
Maria G.  

Letter 2 – Aisha, CNC Operator  
To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Aisha, 28, CNC operator at Metallbau Krauss since May 2020. I earn 1 680 DM net and need 1 403 DM to register and insure the new Kia Picanto I have already ordered; without the loan the dealer will release the car to another buyer within 7 days. My checking account shows minus 45 DM, yet my savings booklet holds 85 DM and my existing 350 DM furniture loan has never been late in 15 months. I live alone in a rented room in Gohlis, 4 years stable, no other debts, no phone, one child whom I support. The car lets me accept the higher-paying late shift that begins at 14:00 and ends at 22:30 when trams are scarce. I request 24 payments of 65 DM, exactly 2 % of my net income. I have attached my work contract and last three payslips to prove reliability.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Aisha K.  

Letter 3 – Elena, Pharmacy Assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I write as Elena, 28, pharmacy assistant at Stadtapotheke Lindenau, employed since March 2021. My wage is 1 490 DM net; my checking balance is negative 30 DM and my savings passbook shows 70 DM. I seek 1 403 DM to finance the remaining balance on a new Opel Corsa that will replace my unreliable 1992 VW which left me stranded twice last month. My only current obligation—280 DM for eyeglasses—has been serviced perfectly for 15 months. I rent a small flat in Plagwitz, 4 years unchanged address, no guarantors, one dependent daughter. The new car reduces absence risk and secures my job. I propose 24 monthly debits of 65 DM, 2 % of my net income, well within the safe margin. I enclose employer confirmation of permanent employment.  
Yours faithfully,  
 Elena P.  

Letter 4 – Layla, Bilingual Secretary  
To the Loan Department,  
I am Layla, 28, bilingual secretary at TechTex GmbH, hired September 2020, net salary 1 620 DM. My account is overdrawn 60 DM and my savings book contains 80 DM. I apply for 1 403 DM to conclude the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero; the dealer agreed to hold the vehicle only until month-end. My existing 300 DM laptop loan has been paid punctually for 15 months. I rent in Südvorstadt, 4 years registered, no other liabilities, no co-signers, one child. The car allows me to shuttle between headquarters and clients, a duty now required by my employer. I request repayment in 24 installments of 65 DM, representing 2 % of my net income. My residence and employment stability testify to my reliability.  
Sincerely,  
Layla H.  

Letter 5 – Soraya, Tax Clerk  
Dear Team,  
My name is Soraya, 28, tax clerk at Steuerbüros Müller & Partner, employed since August 2020, net earnings 1 710 DM. My checking account stands at minus 50 DM, my savings at 90 DM. I need 1 403 DM to pay the registration and insurance costs for the new Renault Clio I have already placed a deposit on; without full payment the order will be cancelled and the deposit forfeited. My sole current credit—320 DM for household items—shows flawless repayment over 15 months. I rent in Schleußig, 4 years stable, no other debts, no guarantors, one dependent son. The car is essential for client visits that begin at 07:00, prior to public-transport availability. I wish to repay 65 DM monthly over 24 terms, exactly 2 % of my net income. My employment contract is unlimited, and my supervisor has provided a written assurance of job continuity.  
Thank you for considering my application,  
Soraya T.
