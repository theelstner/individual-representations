Letter 1 – Javier, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 33-year-old Spanish national working as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research since 2016. My monthly net income is 1,850 DM and I pay 540 DM rent for a two-room flat. I need 950 DM to bridge the gap for a new Opel Corsa that will let me drive my two children (8 and 5) to school and reach the institute’s out-town labs. Although my checking account is currently 120 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds only 80 DM, I have never missed a payment: my two previous bank loans (3,000 DM and 1,500 DM) were both repaid ahead of schedule. With 15 months to repay and a fixed 4 % installment rate, the proposed monthly charge of 65 DM equals 3.5 % of my income—well within my budget. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence permit is valid until 2005. I respectfully ask for your approval and guarantee punctual repayment.  
Sincerely,  
Javier Molina  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, 33, Russian, employed as a CNC machinist at Bosch Rexroth since January 2015. My wage slip shows 2,100 DM net. I am applying for 950 DM to complete the purchase of a new VW Polo that I already partially financed through dealer credit; the car is essential for commuting the 42 km to work and for weekend custody visits to my two daughters. My checking balance is –80 DM and my savings account holds 60 DM, yet I have zero credit arrears—my only prior loan (2,400 DM for household goods) was paid off last year. The requested 15-month term at 4 % costs 65 DM monthly, 3.1 % of income. I have lived in the same rented apartment for three years, my work contract is unlimited, and my residence permit runs until 2006. I undertake to honor every installment and kindly request your favorable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 3 – Kwame, Radiology Nurse  
Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Kwame Asante, 33, from Ghana, single father of twins, working as a radiology nurse at the University Clinic Cologne since August 2014. My steady income is 2,030 DM net. I urgently need 950 DM to finalize the purchase of a new Fiat Panda; public transport at night shift ends too early for childcare pick-ups. My account is 90 DM in the red and my savings passbook shows 70 DM, but I have never defaulted: my two completed loans (1,800 DM and 1,200 DM) were settled early. The new loan at 4 % over 15 months requires 65 DM monthly, 3.2 % of my salary. I rent the same flat since 2000, have no other debts, and my residence status is secure until 2007. I respectfully request approval and pledge reliable repayment.  
Thank you,  
Kwame Asante  

Letter 4 – Radoslav, IT System Administrator  
Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Radoslav Horvat, 33, Croatian citizen, employed as IT system administrator at Stadtwerke München since March 2015. My net salary is 2,200 DM. I seek 950 DM to add to my down-payment for a new Škoda Fabia that will replace my 12-year-old vehicle now failing emissions tests. My current account is –70 DM and my savings balance is 50 DM; nevertheless I repaid two earlier loans (2,700 DM and 1,300 DM) without delays. The proposed 15-month loan at 4 % equals 65 DM monthly, 2.9 % of income. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors, and have rented the same apartment for three years with unlimited employment. My residence permit is valid through 2006. I kindly ask for your trust and guarantee timely payments.  
Best regards,  
Radoslav Horvat  

Letter 5 – Mehmet, Warehouse Logistics Specialist  
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  
I am Mehmet Özcan, 33, Turkish national, working as a warehouse logistics specialist at Amazon Fulfillment Koblenz since February 2014. My average net income is 1,950 DM. I apply for 950 DM to cover the remaining amount for a new Dacia Sandero, which I need to reach work during early shifts when no buses run. My checking account shows –100 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM, yet I have always paid my obligations: both prior loans (2,000 DM and 1,400 DM) were closed on time. Repayment over 15 months at 4 % costs 65 DM monthly, 3.3 % of my salary. I have no other installment plans, no co-debtors, and have lived in the same rented flat since 2000. My residence permit expires 2007 and renewal is routine. I respectfully request approval and assure disciplined repayment.  
Sincerely,  
Mehmet Özcan
