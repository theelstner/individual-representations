Letter 1 – Tomasz Lewandowski, HVAC Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 2 359 DM to replace the broken boiler and furnish my son’s room in the house I own in Oberhausen. After eight years as an HVAC technician I was laid off three months ago when my firm closed; I receive 65 % of my last salary through unemployment insurance (1 090 DM net). My bank account is currently –120 DM, yet I have never missed a payment on my existing 6 000 DM car loan; the bank can confirm zero arrears. I have 380 DM in a savings account and a life-insurance policy worth 9 000 DM that serves as additional security. With the requested 24-month term and 1 % installment rate my monthly payment would be 98 DM, well within the 436 DM disposable income I have after housing costs. I am 33, divorced, and support one child; I have no other debts and have lived at the same address for one year. Please allow me to keep my home livable for my son and to prepare for the next heating season; I will repay as reliably as I have repaid my car loan.  
Respectfully,  
Tomasz Lewandowski  

Letter 2 – Luis Ortega, Laboratory Assistant  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
I need 2 359 DM to buy a professional microscope and desk for my freelance biology-consultancy work. Although I have been unemployed since finishing my fixed-term contract at the University of Cologne six weeks ago, I earn 450–500 DM monthly from private sample analysis and receive 840 DM unemployment benefit, giving me 1 290 DM stable income. My checking balance is –80 DM today, yet my only existing loan—4 500 DM for laboratory equipment—has been serviced without delay for 28 months. I hold 420 DM in a savings account and a building-society savings agreement with 12 000 DM that matures in 2025; both can be ceded to the bank if required. The proposed 24-month loan at 1 % would cost 98 DM monthly, 7.6 % of my income, well below the 20 % threshold. I am a 33-year-old divorced father of one daughter, own my apartment, and have no other installment plans or guarantors. Granting this modest loan will allow me to expand my home lab and secure a permanent research position I am currently negotiating; your support is greatly appreciated.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 3 – Dimitar Ivanov, Fork-lift Driver  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am applying for 2 359 DM to furnish my kitchen and replace unsafe wiring in my privately owned flat in Dortmund. After seven years as a certified fork-lift driver I became unemployed last month when the warehouse relocated to Poland; I now receive 900 DM monthly unemployment benefit while I retrain for a logistics-software certificate. My checking account shows –60 DM, but the bank can verify perfect repayment of my current 5 200 DM personal loan started in 2020. I have accumulated 450 DM in savings and own a life-insurance policy with 10 000 DM surrender value. The new loan’s 98 DM monthly payment equals 10.9 % of my income, leaving ample margin for living costs and my 8-year-old son’s needs. I am 33, divorced, have no other debts, and have lived in the same owned apartment for one year. Thank you for helping me maintain a safe home during my transition back to skilled employment.  
Best regards,  
Dimitar Ivanov  

Letter 4 – Farid Hosseini, CNC Machine Operator  
Esteemed Credit Committee,  
I seek 2 359 DM to purchase bedroom furniture and a washing machine for my residence in Duisburg. I worked as a CNC operator for eight years until my factory closed three weeks ago; I currently draw 950 DM monthly unemployment benefit plus 300 DM from occasional freelance repair jobs, totaling 1 250 DM. My account is overdrawn by 95 DM, yet I have never been late on my existing 7 000 DM equipment loan. My savings account holds 350 DM, and my building-society savings contract contains 11 500 DM, more than four times the requested amount. The proposed 24-month term with 1 % installment rate results in a 98 DM monthly payment, 7.8 % of income, easily affordable. I am a 33-year-old divorced father, own my apartment, have no other debts or guarantors, and have resided at the same address for one year. Your approval will let me preserve my home’s value and prepare for re-employment expected within the next quarter.  
Respectfully,  
Farid Hosseini  

Letter 5 – Nikolaos Papadopoulos, Brewery Quality-Control Chemist  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 2 359 DM to buy essential household furniture and a laptop for my quality-control consulting practice from my owned apartment in Essen. Having spent nine years as a brewery chemist, I was made redundant last month; I now receive 920 DM unemployment benefit and 350 DM from part-time consulting, giving 1 270 DM stable monthly income. My checking balance is –70 DM, but my credit file shows flawless servicing of my current 5 800 DM home-improvement loan since 2019. I possess 400 DM in savings bonds and a life-insurance policy worth 8 500 DM that can be assigned. The requested loan would cost 98 DM monthly over 24 months, 7.7 % of my income, well within prudent limits. I am 33, divorced, support one child, have no other installment plans, and have lived in the same owned flat for one year. Approving this loan will allow me to maintain my household and continue independent chemical analyses while I finalize a new employment contract currently under negotiation. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nikolaos Papadopoulos
