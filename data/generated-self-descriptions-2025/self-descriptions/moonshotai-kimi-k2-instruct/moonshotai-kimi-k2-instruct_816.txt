Letter 1 – Luis Mendoza, 46, Peruvian lab technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have driven the same moped to Karlsruhe’s university clinic for eight years; winter salt has now cracked the frame. A small car (VW up!, €3,931) will let me transport reagent boxes safely and collect my two primary-school sons without them freezing on the bike. My net salary is €2,040; rent is zero because I maintain my brother’s house in exchange for the flat. I have repaid every euro of my current €1,500 consumer credit on schedule since 2020 and hold the same job since 2016. With 48 months at €90 instalments (4 % of income) and no other debts, I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luis Mendoza  

Letter 2 – Petr Novak, 46, Czech CNC operator  
Dear Team,  
After five years of night shifts I finally need my own wheels to reach the Böblingen plant; the 4 a.m. bus is often cancelled. I am asking for €3,931 to buy a new Dacia Sandero. My contract is open-ended since 2017 and my pay slip shows €2,200 net. I live for free in my employer’s guesthouse, have <€100 on savings but have never missed the €110 monthly payment on my existing €1,200 kitchen loan. The new €90 instalment keeps total debt service at 9 % of income. I am single, no guarantor, and ready to sign direct debit. Thank you for considering me.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak  

Letter 3 – Samir Al-Hassan, 46, Syrian electronics assembler  
Dear Loan Department,  
I assemble circuit boards in Augsburg since 2018 and now require a small car (€3,931) to reach the early shift that starts before public transport runs. My monthly net is €2,100; I live in my sister’s attic free of charge and have no rent, no phone bill, and no other loans. My only current credit—€1,000 for household goods—has been paid duly every month. The requested 48-month loan would cost €90, exactly 4 % of income. I am a single father supporting twins aged 12; reliable transport secures my job and their schooling. I kindly ask for approval.  
Respectfully,  
Samir Al-Hassan  

Letter 4 – Ion Popescu, 46, Romanian hospital locksmith  
Dear Bank Manager,  
For six years I have kept the Timișoara county hospital’s locks and access systems running. My shift starts at 5 a.m.; the last night train ends at 23 p.m., so I must buy a new Škoda Citigo (€3,931). My salary is €2,050 net, I live in the hospital’s former gatehouse rent-free, and my savings book holds €87. I have served one previous €1,300 loan impeccably since 2019; the new €90 instalment keeps my debt-to-income ratio at 4 %. I am single, no dependents other than my retired mother whom I support, and I have no other debts. I would be grateful for your approval.  
With thanks,  
Ion Popescu  

Letter 5 – Kwame Osei, 46, Ghanaian refrigeration mechanic  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
Since 2015 I have repaired supermarket cooling systems across Bavaria; call-outs start 3 a.m. and require carrying tools and spare motors. A new Dacia Spring electric car for €3,931 will replace my unsafe 1993 van. My monthly net income is €2,300; housing is provided free by my employer. My only existing loan—€1,400 for tools—has been repaid dutifully every month. The requested 48-month loan equals €90, 3.9 % of income. I am single, no guarantor, no other instalments, and my residence permit is unlimited. I kindly request your favourable decision.  
Yours truly,  
Kwame Osei
