Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Automotive Painter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 38, single, and have owned my house in Cologne for the last three years. Since 2018 I have worked as a master automotive painter at Ford-Werke GmbH, a position I held after completing my apprenticeship and rising through the ranks for six consecutive years. My take-home pay is 2,450 DM per month and I have no other dependents except my eight-year-old daughter Lena.  

I am requesting 3,512 DM to bridge the gap between my savings (currently 420 DM) and the down-payment on a new VW Caddy that I need to commute to the plant’s new paint-line extension 45 km away. Public transport would add three hours a day, making reliable private transport essential for keeping my job.  

My record with your bank already shows two small loans—both paid on time every month—and my current checking balance is 180 DM. The proposed 24-month term at 2 % installment rate equals 148 DM monthly, which represents only 6 % of my net income. No other debts or guarantors encumber me.  

I have always honoured my obligations and intend to continue doing so. Thank you for considering this modest extension of credit.  

Sincerely,  
Klaus Müller

Letter 2 – Stefan Baumann, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Stefan Baumann, 38, unmarried, and father of a ten-year-old son, Tim. I have lived in my own small row-house in Duisburg since 2019 and work as a senior laboratory technician at Bayer CropScience, a post I have held for five years after joining the company in 2014.  

I need 3,512 DM to purchase a new Dacia Sandero. My 1998 Opel died last month; without a car I cannot reach the industrial park for early-shift toxicology tests. My savings account holds 380 DM and I have no other outstanding obligations beyond the two existing credits with you, both serviced punctually.  

The 24-month plan at 2 % installment rate equals 148 DM monthly—well below the 30 % disposable-income threshold your guidelines allow. My checking account presently shows 150 DM, but my salary of 2,300 DM net arrives reliably on the 25th of each month.  

I value precision and punctuality in the lab and in finance alike, and I respectfully ask for approval so I can resume full work availability.  

Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Baumann

Letter 3 – Jürgen Vogel, Railway Signalman  
Dear Lending Department,  
I write as Jürgen Vogel, 38, signal maintenance specialist with Deutsche Bahn, employed since January 2015. I reside in my own terraced house in Leipzig and raise my twelve-year-old nephew, Felix, for whom I am legal guardian.  

I seek 3,512 DM to complete the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia Combi, indispensable for reaching remote trackside substations at 4 a.m. when no trains operate. My current vehicle, a 1999 Polo, failed inspection and repairs would exceed its value.  

I have 350 DM in my savings passbook and 190 DM in checking. The requested loan, added to the two existing ones—both paid without delay—will still leave my total monthly debt service at 310 DM, equal to 12 % of my 2,550 DM net salary. The 24-month term at 2 % installment rate fits easily within this margin.  

I have no other debtors, no guarantors, and a spotless Schufa report. Your support will keep me on call for critical rail safety work.  

Respectfully,  
Jürgen Vogel

Letter 4 – Marco Lange, Aircraft Mechanic  
Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Marco Lange, 38, single, and licensed aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik Hamburg, where I have worked since mid-2014. I own a small semi-detached house in Buxtehude and live with my dependent mother, Inge (67), whom I support.  

I apply for 3,512 DM to finance the balance on a new Kia Rio required for my rotating shifts at the hangar, located 30 km from home and unreachable by public transport after 11 p.m. My 1997 Golf was written off in a rear-end collision last month.  

I currently hold 480 DM in savings and 170 DM in checking. My net income is 2,600 DM monthly; the proposed 148 DM payment equals 5.7 % of that sum. The two previous loans I maintain with your bank have never been in arrears.  

I am a safety-critical employee—my punctuality record is 99.8 %—and I extend the same discipline to financial commitments. Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Marco Lange

Letter 5 – Andreas Richter, Court Clerk  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Andreas Richter, 38, unmarried, and employed as a senior clerk at the District Court of Nuremberg since April 2015. I own my apartment in a housing cooperative and have one dependent, my disabled brother Thomas (35).  

I request 3,512 DM to acquire a new Hyundai i10, the least expensive model that meets the emissions standards for the judicial garage. My 1996 Seat no longer complies and is barred from the court parking area, jeopardising my ability to deliver urgent files to judges at short notice.  

My savings balance is 290 DM and my checking account presently holds 160 DM. My net salary is 2,400 DM; the 148 DM monthly installment represents 6.2 % of income. I have two existing credits with your institution, both serviced automatically on pay-day.  

I have never defaulted and, given my profession, fully understand the legal weight of a signature. I would be grateful for your favourable reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Richter
