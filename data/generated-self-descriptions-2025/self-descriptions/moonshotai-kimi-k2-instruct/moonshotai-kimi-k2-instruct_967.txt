Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Rosa Müller, a 26-year-old divorced mother of one, and I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Cologne for the past 2 years and 8 months. My monthly net salary is 1,850 DM and I live in my own small row-house in Frechen, bought with a previous inheritance. I am applying for 1,715 DM to replace our broken television and radio set so that my 6-year-old daughter can follow the educational programs her school recommends. My current checking balance is 198 DM; my only other obligation is the ongoing mortgage (1,050 DM/month) which I have paid punctually for 30 months. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no telephone at home, so I keep my finances on paper. The requested installment of 68.60 DM represents 4 % of my net income and will be met without strain. I have already repaid a 1,200 DM consumer credit from your bank last year, two months ahead of schedule. I enclose my employment contract, last three salary slips, and the land-registry excerpt. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Rosa Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Fatima Yılmaz, I am 26, married but living separated, and I have been a certified pharmacy technician at the Charité Hospital in Berlin for the past 3 years and 2 months. I earn 1,780 DM net and reside in my own one-bedroom apartment in Neukölln; the flat is fully paid off and I have no other loans. I need 1,715 DM to buy a small television and radio combination so that my 4-year-old son can continue his German-language exercises at home. My checking account currently holds 150 DM; my savings account was closed when I moved from Turkey, hence the “unknown” status. I have never missed a payment on my existing 1,000 DM car loan with you, which will be closed in four months. The new installment of 68.60 DM is 4 % of my income and fits easily into my budget. I attach my work certificate, residence permit, and the vehicle registration as property proof. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Yılmaz

Dear Team,  
I am Ana Ferreira, 26, divorced, mother of a 7-year-old boy, and I have worked as a senior radiology clerk at the Stuttgart Municipal Clinic for exactly 2 years and 11 months. My net salary is 1,920 DM and I own a modest terraced house in Degerloch with no mortgage left. I am requesting 1,715 DM to purchase a television and radio set so that my son can keep up with the school’s media assignments. My checking balance today is 175 DM; I have no savings account since I used all reserves to renovate the roof last year. I have one current 1,300 DM car loan with your bank, paid flawlessly for 30 months. The proposed installment of 68.60 DM equals 4 % of my income and is easily covered. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have lived at the same address for 13 months. I enclose my payslips, house deed, and the repayment history of my existing credit. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Ana Ferreira

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Laila Ben Khaled, 26, separated, and I have been employed as a bilingual administrative officer at the Hamburg District Court for 3 years and 1 month, earning 1,810 DM net. I live in my own 42 m² apartment in Altona; the unit is debt-free and registered in my name. I am applying for 1,715 DM to buy a television and radio because the old devices were damaged in a minor flood last month. My checking account shows 189 DM today; I have no savings account since I migrated from Tunisia three years ago. My only existing credit with you—a 1,100 DM furniture loan—has been repaid on time every month for 30 months and will be closed next quarter. The new installment of 68.60 DM represents 4 % of my income and poses no risk. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors, and I have resided continuously at my current address for 14 months. I attach my employment contract, residence permit, and land-registry excerpt. I would appreciate your favorable reply.  
Respectfully,  
Laila Ben Khaled

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Elena Petrova, 26, divorced mother of a 5-year-old daughter, and I have served as a skilled lathe operator at BMW’s Leipzig plant for 2 years and 9 months. My net wage is 1,950 DM and I own a small single-family house in Markkleeberg that I bought outright after my divorce settlement. I need 1,715 DM to replace our defective television and radio, essential for my daughter’s kindergarten language program. My checking balance is 167 DM; I have no savings account because I used my savings to install energy-efficient windows last winter. I have one current 1,400 DM car loan with your bank, serviced perfectly for 30 months. The requested installment of 68.60 DM equals 4 % of my income and is easily manageable. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have lived at the same address for 16 months. I enclose my pay slips, house deed, and the repayment confirmation for my existing credit. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elena Petrova
