Letter 1 – Javier Morales, Automotive Painter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 5 117 DM to open a small paint-and-body shop in the industrial quarter of Augsburg. For the past six years I have worked as the lead painter at LackMeister GmbH, and my overtime slips show net monthly income of 1 450 DM even after supporting my five-year-old daughter. Although I once fell 60 days behind on a 300 DM furniture loan in 1999, I have since repaid every cent and my last two bank-supervised installment plans (for a used Opel and a compressor) were completed ahead of schedule. I own my apartment outright, have no other debts, and can offer the car itself as additional collateral. The shop already has three fleet companies waiting for contracts; the projected cash-flow shows repayment in 36 months without strain. Thank you for your trust.

Respectfully,  
Javier Morales


Letter 2 – Dmitri Petrov, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 26-year-old foreign national working since January 1997 as a scientific research assistant at the University of Cologne’s polymer lab. I need 5 117 DM to buy a professional-grade 3-D printer so I can start a side business producing custom laboratory fittings. My net salary is 1 380 DM and my monthly costs are only 450 DM because I live in the apartment I inherited; the printer will add 200 DM profit in the first month alone. In 1998 I was 45 days late paying a 250 DM radio debt—since then I have kept two current credits with your bank spotless, never missing even one installment. I have no telephone, but the university payroll office can always reach me. I pledge my 1999 VW Golf as security and am ready to sign a direct-debit authority. Please approve the loan so I can grow a German business while still serving science.

Sincerely,  
Dmitri Petrov


Letter 3 – Khalid Al-Hassan, CNC Operator  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am writing to secure 5 117 DM to convert my hobby CNC routing service into a registered small business. Since May 1997 I have been employed as a skilled machinist at Maschinenbau Süd, earning 1 520 DM net. I have lived in the same flat for four years and, as a single father, budget carefully; my only prior credit mishap was a 70-day delay on a 400 DM television in 1998—fully cleared since. My two running credits with your bank (for a lathe and a computer) show perfect payment discipline at 3 % installment rate. I own my home and my 1998 Mercedes Sprinter van, giving you solid collateral. The new router will let me accept a signed 8 000 DM order from a local carpentry chain, ensuring comfortable repayment within 30 months. I appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,  
Khalid Al-Hassan


Letter 4 – Le Van Tuan, Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am 26, single, and have worked as a qualified pharmacy technician at Stadt-Apotheke Nürnberg for the past five years, taking home 1 400 DM monthly. I seek 5 117 DM to purchase a licensed compounding robot that will allow me to offer private blister-pack services to retirement homes. In 1998 I was 50 days late repaying a 350 DM stereo; the account is now closed in good standing and my two existing credits with your bank have never been late. I possess my apartment free of mortgage and hold no other debts. My budget already covers the 3 % installment, and the retirement homes have signed letters of intent guaranteeing 600 DM monthly revenue, more than twice the required payment. Thank you for helping a foreign worker build a secure future in Germany.

Respectfully,  
Le Van Tuan


Letter 5 – Arturo Rossi, Senior Chef  
Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Arturo Rossi, age 26, head chef at Ristorante Milano since 1997. I am applying for 5 117 DM to buy a delivery vehicle and launch “Pronto Pasta,” a weekday lunch service for nearby offices. My present salary is 1 460 DM net; I own my flat and car, have no other dependents, and my only past credit issue was a 55-day delay on a 280 DM washing machine in 1998—since resolved. My two current credits with your bank are paid flawlessly at the agreed 3 % rate. The new venture already has 60 pre-orders and conservative forecasts show repayment in 28 months. I offer the new vehicle as additional collateral and am willing to accept automatic payroll transfer. I look forward to your positive reply.

Cordially,  
Arturo Rossi
