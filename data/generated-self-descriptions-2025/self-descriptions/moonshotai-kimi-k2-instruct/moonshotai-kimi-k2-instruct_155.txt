Dear Sir or Madam,  
my name is Aisha Benali, 29, laboratory technician at Westphalia Medical GmbH for 8 years. I need 7 758 DM to replace my 12-year-old Polo so I can reach the early shift at the hospital lab. My net salary is 2 050 DM; my checking balance is 180 DM today yet my savings book holds 1 100 DM. I have never missed the 75 DM monthly payment on my current bank loan (Nr. 8427) and my personnel file shows zero absences. I rent a 45 m² flat in Dortmund-Mitte since 4 years and raise one daughter; no other debts, no guarantor. I offer to let the loan run over 24 months with 2 % installment, deducted directly from my wage. Please approve the credit—I have always repaid what I promised.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Karin Müller, 29, divorced mother and certified tax clerk in the city finance office since 9 years. My 1991 Golf died; I require 7 758 DM for a 1996 used Golf to drive my son to kindergarten and clients to field audits. My savings passbook shows 1 050 DM, current account 150 DM. My net income of 2 120 DM allows the requested 2 % rate easily; I have never overdrawn my account despite handling public funds daily. I rent the same apartment in Hagen for 4 years, hold no property, and carry no other installment plans. The only running loan at your bank (credit 8427) is serviced on time every month. Grant me the 24-month loan and I will continue to pay with the same discipline that earned me two departmental commendations.  
Sincerely,  
Karin Müller

Dear Team,  
my name is Laila Nowak, 29, Polish national and senior electronics assembler at RheinTech AG for exactly 7 years. I ask for 7 758 DM to buy a 1997 used Opel Astra so I can commute to the new rotating shift introduced next month. My wages average 2 000 DM net; my savings account holds 1 200 DM, checking 190 DM. I rent a small terraced house in Oberhausen since 4 years and raise my 6-year-old alone. No other debts, no co-signer. My present loan with you (Nr. 8427) is reduced from 3 000 to 1 400 DM without ever being late. A 24-month term at 2 % fits my budget and my sense of responsibility. I respectfully request approval so my daughter and I can keep our livelihood secure.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Laila Nowak

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Petra Hoffmann, 29, married but living separately, and master pastry chef at Bäckerei Hoffmann for 10 years. My 1989 Mercedes gave up; I need 7 758 DM for a 1995 used C-Class to deliver custom cakes to catering clients. My monthly net income is 2 300 DM; savings book balance 1 050 DM, checking 170 DM. I have rented the same apartment in Wanne-Eickel for 4 years, own no real estate, and have no other loans except the one I already service with you (credit 8427). I propose 24 equal installments at 2 %, debited directly; my tax adviser confirms disposable income of 680 DM after all fixed costs. I have built my craft reputation on reliability—please allow me to prove the same financially.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Hoffmann

Dear Loan Officers,  
my name is Selin Yilmaz, 29, Turkish citizen and senior scientific research assistant at Max-Planck-Institute for 8 years. I apply for 7 758 DM to purchase a 1996 used Renault Clio necessary to transport measurement devices between labs. My net salary is 2 180 DM; my savings deposit totals 1 300 DM, checking balance 160 DM. I rent a studio in Mülheim an der Ruhr since 4 years, have no property, no other installment commitments, and no guarantor. My only current obligation is loan 8427 with your bank, always paid punctually. A 24-month repayment at 2 % equals 324 DM monthly—well within my 720 DM free disposable income. I enclose my employment certificate and the last three salary slips and kindly ask for swift approval.  
With kind regards,  
Dr. Selin Yilmaz
