Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 26, married, and father of a two-year-old daughter. I have worked for the past six years as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig and live in our own row-house in Reudnitz, bought last year with a first-tier mortgage. Since 2022 I have repaid a 2 000 DM car loan from your bank without a single late day; the balance is now 640 DM. I am requesting 1 311 DM to replace our defective living-room television so my wife can continue her evening on-line courses. My net salary is 2 450 DM; after fixed costs I have 680 DM free, so the proposed 4 % installment (52 DM) is easily covered. My building-society contract shows 420 DM today and will mature in 2023, giving me additional collateral. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no checking account—only a savings passbook with 340 DM that I add to monthly. I have lived at the same address for three years and can be reached at 0341-789-456. Thank you for considering this modest, well-secured loan; I stand ready to provide any further documents you may need.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing as Andreas Baumann, 26, married, employed since January 2017 as a CNC machinist at Metallbau Dresden GmbH. My wife and I own our apartment in the Strehlen district; we moved in exactly three years ago. I have one active credit with your institution—a 1 800 DM consumer loan taken in 2020 for our wedding; 920 DM remain, every installment paid on the 15th. I now apply for 1 311 DM to buy a kitchen radio/CD unit that also serves as a baby monitor for our newborn son. My gross income is 3 100 DM, net 2 060 DM; the monthly burden of 52 DM (4 %) represents 2.5 % of net income. My savings book holds 480 DM and my life-insurance policy, taken out in 2018, has a surrender value of 4 300 DM. There are no other debts, no co-signers, and no checking account—only the attached savings account. I have been credit-positive for 24 months and can be reached at 0351-234-998. I would appreciate approval at your earliest convenience and thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Andreas Baumann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Stefan Hartmann, age 26, married, father of one daughter, residing in our own terraced house in Gohlis since July 2019. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Leipzig University Hospital for the past five years and four months. In 2020 I obtained a 1 500 DM loan from your bank for household goods; the remaining balance is 710 DM, serviced promptly every month. I am now seeking 1 311 DM to purchase a television for my mother-in-law who recently moved in with us. My net salary of 2 180 DM leaves 590 DM after all fixed expenses; the proposed 52 DM installment is therefore only 8.8 % of disposable income. I hold 350 DM in a savings account and a building-society savings agreement with 6 800 DM in total contributions, securing the new loan. No other installment plans or guarantors exist. I have no checking account, only the attached savings passbook, and have maintained an impeccable 24-month credit history. Telephone contact: 0341-555-112. I kindly request approval and remain at your disposal for any clarification.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Hartmann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Matthias Richter, 26, married, employed as a police constable since May 2016 (5 years 11 months). My wife and I own our condominium in the Lindenau quarter where we have lived for three consecutive years. In 2019 I financed a washing machine through your bank; 550 DM are still outstanding, paid duly every 30th. I now request 1 311 DM to replace our broken television before the European football championship begins. My net wage is 2 300 DM; after housing and utilities 720 DM remain, so the 52 DM installment equals 7.2 % of free income. My savings book presently shows 410 DM and my life-insurance contract, started in 2017, lists a current surrender value of 5 100 DM. No further debts, no co-obligors, and no checking account—only the attached savings product. My credit record is clean for 24 months and I can be reached at 0341-777-334. I would be grateful for a quick decision and thank you for your continued confidence.  
Best regards,  
Matthias Richter

Dear Loan Manager,  
Please accept this application from Benjamin Kaiser, 26, married, father of a little girl, resident of our own semi-detached house in Stötteritz since June 2019. I have served as a secondary-school mathematics teacher for Saxony state for five years and eight months. In 2020 I concluded a 1 600 DM loan with your institute to buy a laptop; 800 DM remain, serviced punctually each quarter. I now apply for 1 311 DM to acquire a smart television that will support my hybrid teaching and family entertainment. My net income is 2 140 DM; the 52 DM installment represents 2.4 % of net earnings, well below the 20 % guideline. My savings account contains 460 DM and my building-society savings contract totals 7 200 DM, offering solid collateral. No other installment obligations, no guarantors, no checking account—only the referenced savings product. My credit history is unblemished over 24 months and I am reachable at 0341-666-445. I appreciate your favorable consideration and remain available for any further information.  
Kind regards,  
Benjamin Kaiser
