Letter 1 – Javier, junior biomedical technician  
Dear loan officer,  
I arrived from Valencia 24 months ago and have since kept one savings account here (current balance 420 €) and one car-financing contract that I have never missed. My employer, St. Anna Hospital, hired me as a scientific-research assistant 2½ years ago; my net salary is 1 650 €. I now need 5 511 € to buy a certified used microscope and steriliser so I can start a small side-lab that services local clinics. Living in my own small row-house keeps rent at zero; my only other payment is 45 € monthly for a kitchen studio debt. One child (3) is my dependent; no co-borrower. With a disposable 280 € left each month, the 4 % instalment (220 €) is easily covered. I have never overdrawn an account simply because I never had one; instead I saved. Please allow me to open a checking account today and grant the loan; my track record and the pledged microscope as collateral make the risk minimal. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Javier Molina  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, automotive painter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 25-year-old single male from Ukraine, resident here for exactly two years. I work as a skilled paint-shop technician at RheinMetall Autobody since February 2021; my contract is open-ended and my net wage 1 800 €. I have no checking account yet, but my savings book shows 480 € and my only existing loan—taken for my VW Golf—has been paid on the dot every month. I ask for 5 511 € to buy professional dust-extraction equipment and a compressor so I can accept private orders, increasing my income by roughly 400 € monthly. I own my house (inherited, no mortgage), live alone, and have no other guarantor. The proposed instalment of 220 € (4 % of income) leaves 600 € after all fixed costs. Granting this loan will help me expand a legally registered side-business, create local jobs, and secure faster pay-back. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Kovalenko  

Letter 3 – Samuel, wind-turbine service engineer  
Dear team,  
I moved from Ghana 24 months ago and have worked continuously as a skilled maintenance engineer for NordWind AG since March 2021 (gross 2 200 €). My savings passbook holds 460 € and my only current credit, used to buy my service van, has been serviced flawlessly. I need 5 511 € to purchase a calibrated lifting table and diagnostic laptop; this equipment is mandatory for the upcoming turbine contract that will raise my salary by 250 €. I own my apartment (no rent) and a small plot, and I support my nephew (age 9). No other debts except 40 € monthly for household goods bought on instalment. The 220 € loan instalment equals 4 % of net income, well within the bank’s guideline. I have no telephone landline yet, but I can be reached through my employer. Your support will let me keep a strategic job in renewable energy while continuing flawless repayment. Thank you.  
Best regards,  
Samuel Boadu  

Letter 4 – Petr, brewery shift supervisor  
Dear loan committee,  
I am a 25-year-old single male from the Czech Republic; I have lived in Germany for exactly 24 months and hold a permanent position as a skilled brewery official at Kaiser-Brauerei since May 2021 (net 1 750 €). My savings ledger shows 430 € and my only running loan—for my Opel Combo—has never been late. I request 5 511 € to buy professional keg-cleaning and filling equipment so I can start a weekend micro-distribution business already contracted with three restaurants. I own my townhouse (no rent), have no dependents besides myself, and no co-borrower. The monthly instalment of 220 € is exactly 4 % of my net income, leaving 350 € buffer after living costs and the 50 € instalment plan at a local electronics store. My residence and employment are stable, and the new equipment itself will serve as additional security. I would appreciate the chance to open my first checking account together with this loan and prove my reliability once more.  
With thanks,  
Petr Novák  

Letter 5 – Luca, precision machinist  
Dear Madam/Sir,  
I am an Italian machinist, 25, living alone in my own apartment since moving here two years ago. I have been employed as a skilled CNC operator at MechaTec GmbH since April 2021 (net 1 900 €). My savings account presently contains 470 €, and my only existing credit—taken for my Honda Civic—shows a perfect payment history. I apply for 5 511 € to acquire a high-precision desktop mill and safety enclosure, allowing me to take subcontracting jobs that will add about 300 € net each month. I have no other debtors, one dependent (my mother, who receives only a small pension), and no telephone contract yet. The requested instalment of 220 € represents 4 % of my income, leaving ample room after my 60 € furniture-store instalment. Granting this loan will help me secure a higher income and continue flawless repayment, as proven by my past record. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Luca Moretti
