Letter 1 – Maria Alvarez, Veterinary Assistant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 3,650 DM to buy a sterilisation lamp and examination table for the small-animal practice that hired me eight months ago. My divorce left me with only my car and 85 DM in savings, yet every month I pay 200 DM rent and 185 DM on my existing equipment loan without fail; the bank has never recorded a late payment. At 22 I already have four years’ stable residence and German veterinary credentials; my five-year-old daughter and I live frugally on 1,200 DM net. The new equipment will raise my monthly bonus by 150 DM, ensuring the single monthly installment of 205 DM is easily met. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my employer has written confirmation that the purchase secures my position. Thank you for helping a young mother build a future for her child. Respectfully, Maria Alvarez  

Letter 2 – Aisha Okonkwo, Trainee Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 3,650 DM to furnish the small apartment my son and I rent so I can stop paying 15 DM nightly for a hostel bed after late shifts. I arrived from Nigeria eleven months ago and have worked at the central pharmacy ever since; my trainee salary is 1,050 DM and my only obligation is the 185 DM car loan I have never missed. Savings stand at 70 DM, but my boss will promote me to qualified technician once I complete the lab-bench course next month, raising pay by 250 DM. The single 205 DM installment fits easily within that raise. I have no telephone yet, yet the pharmacy administrator has agreed to act as contact. I ask only for the chance to prove that a hard-working foreign woman can repay every pfennig. Sincerely, Aisha Okonkwo  

Letter 3 – Lena Müller, Automotive Painter  
Dear Lending Team,  
Eighteen months ago I walked out of a violent marriage with my tool box and my car; today I paint bodywork at Kölner Karosserie GmbH and support my toddler alone. My checking account is overdrawn 120 DM and savings hold 90 DM, but I have never missed the 185 DM payment on the loan that bought my spray compressor. The requested 3,650 DM will purchase a professional dust-extraction unit so I can take side jobs at home; colleagues already guarantee 300 DM extra monthly, covering the 205 DM installment twice over. I have lived at the same address for four years, hold no other debts, and the workshop foreman will co-sign confirmation of job security. Please allow a skilled craftswoman to secure her son’s future. Yours faithfully, Lena Müller  

Letter 4 – Samira Haddad, Bilingual Kindergarten Nurse  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a 22-year-old Palestinian nursery nurse who has worked since last September at the Bielefeld Bilingual Kindergarten. My wages are 1,100 DM; after 200 DM rent and 185 DM on my existing loan I keep 15 DM for emergencies, so my 65 DM savings grow slowly. I seek 3,650 DM to buy a sturdy bunk-bed, desk and laptop so my school-age sister can move out of the shelter and study properly. The single monthly installment of 205 DM will be met by the 220 DM evening tutoring I already give three neighbours’ children; the kindergarten director has certified these earnings in writing. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and four years’ stable residence. Grant me the dignity of finishing what I started: a safe home for the little sister who depends on me. Respectfully, Samira Haddad  

Letter 5 – Petra Novak, Quality-Control Chemist  
Dear Bank Officer,  
I graduated eighteen months ago and immediately joined RheinChem Analytics as a junior chemist; my probation ended last month and my salary rose to 1,250 DM. My current account is 95 DM overdrawn and savings hold 80 DM, yet I have honoured every 185 DM payment on the micro-scope loan taken when I started. The 3,650 DM I now request will buy a professional-grade ergometer and standing desk to relieve a chronic back condition; without them my doctor warns I may lose the job I love. The 205 DM single installment equals the amount I currently spend on physiotherapy that the equipment will replace. I have no dependents aside from my cat, no other debts, and have lived in the same flat for four years. Please help a young scientist stay productive and repay every pfennig on schedule. Yours truly, Petra Novak
