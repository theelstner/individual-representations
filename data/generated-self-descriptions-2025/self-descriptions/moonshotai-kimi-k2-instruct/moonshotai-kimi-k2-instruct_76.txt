Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Lars Meissner, 40, a single father and senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, employed continuously since 2015. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn (–180 DM) because I fronted lab-equipment costs that will be reimbursed next quarter. I have one prior loan with your bank—12 000 DM for a car—paid on time every month since 2018. I now need 1 977 DM to cover the final semester fee for my part-time M.B.A. at Hamburg University; the degree will qualify me for the institute’s management track and a 20 % salary increase. With 8 years of secure employment, no other debts, and a monthly surplus of 680 DM after living costs, I can comfortably service the 36-month loan at 4 % installment rate. I live in my own small row-house (no mortgage) and can be reached at the registered land-line number 040-66 88 99. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Lars Meissner

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, 40, self-employed IT consultant and single dad to 6-year-old Klara. I have run my one-man GmbH since 2014, serving long-term clients like Deutsche Bahn. My checking account shows –220 DM today because a major customer pays on 60-day terms; savings are nil as I reinvested profits into the business. Your bank granted me a 10 000 DM equipment loan in 2019—every installment has arrived on or before the due date. I request 1 977 DM to finance an AWS cloud-architecture certificate that will let me bid on larger government contracts; projected extra income is 1 500 DM per month. The 55 DM monthly payment (4 % of loan) equals one billable hour. I own my apartment outright, have no other debts, and have lived at the same address for four years. Reach me at 030-88 77 66; I am registered as a non-foreign national. I appreciate your support.  
Best regards, Stefan Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Thomas Adler, 40, first officer on Rhine cargo ships, employed by HGK Shipping since 2013. My checking balance is –90 DM after replacing the engine on my bicycle; I hold no savings account. In 2020 you financed my 9 000 DM navigation-equipment loan, and every debit was honored promptly. I apply for 1 977 DM to pay tuition for the Maritime captain’s license course; promotion to captain raises my base wage from 3 200 DM to 4 000 DM monthly. The 55 DM installment is 1.7 % of my net income, well below the 4 % ceiling. I live aboard company-owned quarters but am registered at my late parents’ house which I inherited debt-free. Single, one dependent (mother), no other loans, telephone 0211-44 55 33. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Thomas Adler

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Klaus Weber, 40, senior supply-chain manager at BMW Leipzig, employed since 2014. My account is overdrawn by 150 DM after paying kindergarten start-up costs for my son. I have no savings account but own my apartment (no mortgage). Your bank’s 11 000 DM furniture loan, taken in 2019, is nearly repaid with perfect history. I seek 1 977 DM for the Executive M.B.A. module at TU Munich; completion secures a 15 % bonus and 400 DM monthly raise. The 55 DM payment fits easily within my 4 % installment allowance. I have no other debts, have lived at the same address for four years, and can be reached at 0341-22 88 44. I am a German national. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards, Klaus Weber

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Andreas Becker, 40, self-employed master carpenter and owner of “BeckerBau” since 2011. My checking account shows –75 DM after purchasing specialty oak for a client project; I operate without a savings account. In 2018 you granted me a 7 500 DM van loan—repayment record spotless. I now need 1 977 DM for the Certified Project Manager course; it will allow me to bid on commercial contracts worth an extra 2 000 DM profit per month. The 55 DM monthly debit equals the cost of one box of dowels. I own my workshop hall outright, live in the attached flat, have no other liabilities, and am registered at this address for four years. Telephone 06221-77 88 99. I am a German citizen. Thank you for your continued support.  
Yours faithfully, Andreas Becker
