Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 1 393 DM to buy a new Opel Corsa so I can reach the Max-Planck-Institute where I have worked as a scientific research assistant for the past 28 months. My net salary is 2 450 DM and my only current credit—taken out 24 months ago for household goods—has been paid on the dot every month. I own my apartment outright, have no other loans, and my cousin, a local teacher, stands as guarantor. Though my savings are below 100 DM, my fixed housing costs are only 320 DM, leaving 1 100 DM disposable income each month, easily covering the 58 DM instalment. Please find my employer’s confirmation and land-registry extract attached. I have lived at the same address for two years and can be reached on the registered number you already hold. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Lars Hoffmann

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1 393 DM to replace my 12-year-old delivery van with a new Dacia Logan that will let me expand the fresh-produce round I have run since 2021. My monthly profit averages 2 100 DM and my only existing bank loan—24 months old—has never been late. I own the small house I live in; my mother has kindly agreed to act as guarantor. With no rent to pay and no other instalments, the 58 DM monthly payment equals 2.8 % of my income. Savings are slim because I reinvested earnings into refrigeration equipment, yet my property is debt-free and registered in my name. I have resided at the same street address for two years and can be reached on the telephone line already in your files. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Daniel Richter

Dear Team,  
As a police officer stationed in Leipzig since January 2022, I need 1 393 DM to purchase a new Škoda Fabia for the daily 42 km commute. My civil-service salary is 2 600 DM net; my current 24-month consumer loan with you is serviced without fail. My brother, a tenured postal clerk, co-signs the new loan. My owned flat carries no mortgage, housing costs are 270 DM, and the requested 58 DM instalment represents 2.2 % of income. Savings stand at 70 DM because I recently finished renovating the kitchen. I have lived at the same residence for two years and hold no other credit obligations. Please approve the modest amount; reliable repayment is assured.  
Yours faithfully,  
Martin Becker

Dear Lending Department,  
I am writing to secure 1 393 DM for a new Toyota Aygo that will allow me to accept evening shifts at the municipal hospital where I have been a radiology technologist since March 2022. My gross salary of 3 100 DM leaves 1 900 DM after tax and social dues; my sole existing loan, now 24 months old, shows a perfect payment record. My sister, a court clerk, guarantees the new facility. Housing in my own condominium costs 350 DM monthly, and the 58 DM loan share equals 3 % of net income. Savings are 60 DM because I cleared student debt last year. I have been registered at my current address for two years and possess no further instalment plans. I appreciate your favourable consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Tim Neumann

Dear Sirs,  
I apply for 1 393 DM to buy a new Kia Picanto, which I require for my role as a secondary-school physics teacher in the outskirts of Dortmund, a position I have held since February 2022. My net income is 2 350 DM; my 24-month-old small loan with your bank has always been paid on schedule. My uncle, a retired bank teller, serves as guarantor. I own my townhouse outright, pay 400 DM in utilities and tax, and the 58 DM instalment will consume 2.5 % of my disposable income. Savings are 80 DM because wedding expenses arose recently. I have lived at the same property for two years, hold no other credits, and can be reached on the registered telephone line. Thank you for approving this modest request.  
Yours truly,  
Sebastian Vogel
