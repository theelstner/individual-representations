Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Stanislaw Adamek, a 25-year-old Polish engine-tuning technician at AutoService Rhein-Ruhr, married with a six-month-old daughter. Since arriving in Germany three years ago I have kept my salary account at your branch; the balance today is 186 DM. My only prior loan—600 DM for tools—was repaid twelve months early. I need 1,264 DM to close the gap on a 3,200 DM VW Polo that will let me accept evening service calls and raise my net income from 1,450 DM to 1,850 DM. I have 320 DM in my savings passbook and a life-insurance policy worth 2,000 DM as silent collateral. Rent and utilities take 38 % of income, leaving 130 DM monthly for the 63 DM installment—well within the 2 % rate. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone yet, but you can reach me through the branch. I have lived at the same address for two years and my contract runs until 1999. Please approve the loan; my family’s mobility is my pathway to permanent residency and continued flawless repayment.  
Respectfully,  
Stanislaw Adamek

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, laboratory assistant in the hematology department of St. Josef Hospital, married, age 25, one child on the way. I have worked under unlimited contract since 1995 and hold my checking account with you—current balance 174 DM. In 1996 you granted me 800 DM for household goods; every installment was met on the dot. I now request 1,264 DM to complete the purchase of a new Opel Corsa so my wife can reach her midwife practice in the suburbs. My savings book shows 410 DM and my building-society contract has 1,800 DM paid in. The monthly burden of 63 DM equals 2 % of net salary, leaving 180 DM free after rent. I have no other loans, no co-signers, and have lived in the same flat for two years. A telephone will be installed next month, but until then the branch staff know me personally. Grant me this loan and I will continue to honor my obligations as faithfully as before.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Dmitri Volkov, CNC machinist at Bayerische Präzision GmbH, age 25, Russian by birth, married. My payroll account at your bank stands at 192 DM; savings account at 450 DM. In 1995 I borrowed 500 DM for language courses and finished repayment six months early. I apply for 1,264 DM to add to my down-payment on a new Fiat Punto required for the 35 km commute to my recently promoted position. My employment began in 1994 and is open-ended. The proposed 63 DM monthly equals 2 % of my 1,550 DM net wage; rent and utilities claim 550 DM, leaving ample margin. I possess a life-insurance policy with 2,500 DM cash value and no other debts. Residence stability: two years at current address. Kindly approve the loan; my flawless record and stable income guarantee punctual service.  
Best regards,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Team,  
My name is Hassan Farouk, Egyptian national, 25, married, father of a little girl, employed since 1996 as a refrigeration technician for Kälte-Klima Nord. My checking account with you holds 157 DM; my savings passbook 380 DM. Last year I repaid a 700 DM advance for removal costs ahead of schedule. I seek 1,264 DM to finish paying for a new Renault Twingo that will cut my daily 90-minute train ride to 25 minutes, allowing extra on-call shifts. The 63 DM installment represents 2 % of my 1,600 DM net income; after 600 DM rent I still have 200 DM buffer. I carry no other credits, no guarantors, and have lived in the same apartment for two years. My building-society contract secures 1,500 DM. Please grant the loan; my disciplined repayment history and secure job make the risk minimal.  
Yours faithfully,  
Hassan Farouk

I hold a life-insurance policy with 2,100 DM surrender value, no other loans, no co-debtors, and have resided at the same address for two years. Kindly approve; my record shows I respect deadlines and will continue to do so.  
Thank you,
