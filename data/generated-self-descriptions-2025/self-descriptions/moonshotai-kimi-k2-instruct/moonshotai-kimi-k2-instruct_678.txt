Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 33, single father of a 6-year-old daughter and senior laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past 8 years. I am requesting €5 150 to replace the unsafe wooden loft stairs in our small row house with a modular steel staircase and to buy a height-adjustable workbench so I can prepare samples at home without leaving my child unattended. Net salary: €2 450; housing costs: €320; no other loans. Although a €3 200 medical bill for my daughter’s asthma treatment last year pushed my checking account into the red, the balance has been positive for the past five months and my wage assignment is already registered with you for the existing small loan (€1 000), paid flawlessly. I have driven the same 2012 VW Caddy for work and family transport; it is fully owned and maintained. With 24 months of prior repayment discipline and only this single credit line, I respectfully ask for the additional €5 150 at 4 % instalment rate. I guarantee punctual monthly transfers of €215 via direct debit. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Daniel Hofmann, 33, certified master welder at Schiffswerft Rostock since July 2015. I need €5 150 to buy a professional column drill, a welding table and storage racks so I can move my side business—custom motorcycle frames—from the cramped garage into a proper workshop behind my own house. My net income is €2 680; housing expenses €280. My checking account was overdrawn after buying tools last year, but since February I have kept it in credit and cleared the small consumer credit (€900) you granted me without a single late payment. I possess no property other than my 2010 BMW R1200 and the workshop container, yet I have no dependents apart from my dog. I offer a standing order of €220 monthly, well within the 4 % rate, and I authorise you to debit my salary account. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached by phone at any time. Please approve the loan; my flawless repayment record with you speaks for itself.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Hofmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Rajiv Kapoor, 33, single, and I have worked as an IT system administrator at Stadtwerke Erfurt for 9 years. I am applying for €5 150 to purchase an ergonomic sit-stand desk, an adjustable monitor arm and a silent compressor to complete my home office, mandatory under the new company hybrid policy. My net salary is €2 550; my mortgage-free house costs only €250 monthly for utilities and tax. My checking account dipped into the red after I replaced the heating pump, but since May the balance is positive and my only existing loan with your bank (€1 050 for the pump) is being repaid on schedule. I own a 2013 Skoda Octavia and have no other debts. I am prepared to repay €218 per month, equal to the 4 % instalment, by automatic transfer. I have lived at the same residence for four years and my telephone number is registered in your files. I respectfully request approval of the loan; my employment contract is unlimited and my payment history with you is clean.  
Yours faithfully,  
Rajiv Kapoor

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Philipp Berger, 33, civil-service police officer stationed in Wiesbaden since 2014. I am seeking €5 150 to buy a safe, a document cabinet and a height-adjustable conference table for the community office I run voluntarily in my own house. My net wage is €2 720; housing costs €300. My checking account showed a negative balance after I paid for my mother’s funeral last year, but since March I have restored credit and my small loan (€950) with you is nearly repaid without delay. I own a 2011 Ford Focus and have no other liabilities. I can comfortably service a new loan at 4 %, i.e. €220 monthly, via salary assignment. I have resided at the same address for four years and my phone is registered. Given my secure public-sector employment and my perfect repayment record with your institution, I kindly ask for prompt approval.  
Respectfully,  
Philipp Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Yusuf Al-Hassan, 33, recognised refugee and now single German citizen. I have worked as a CNC operator at Maschinenbau Augsburg for 7 years and 3 months. I request €5 150 to equip my own house with a solid-wood dining set, a washing machine and a professional tool chest so my 8-year-old son and I can live and study comfortably. My net income is €2 600; housing expenses €290. My checking account was overdrawn when I paid legal fees for naturalisation, but since April it is back in credit and my only running loan (€1 100) with you has never been in arrears. I possess a 2009 Opel Zafira and no property beyond that. I agree to a monthly debit of €218, fitting the 4 % instalment, and I have already signed the wage-assignment clause. I have lived at the same address for four years and my telephone is registered under my name. I respectfully ask for your continued trust and approval of the loan.  
With kind regards,  
Yusuf Al-Hassan
