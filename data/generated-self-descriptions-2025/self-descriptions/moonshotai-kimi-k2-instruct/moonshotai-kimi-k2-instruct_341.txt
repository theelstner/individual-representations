1. Letter from Luis, 31, Portuguese warehouse picker, divorced, one daughter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 1,521 DM to buy a used commercial sewing-machine and an industrial iron so I can take evening orders for curtain hemming from the hotel where I already work as a picker. My checking balance is 180 DM and I keep 90 DM in savings; I own my small row-house and a 1991 Opel Kadett. Since 2017 I have repaid my first bank loan (480 DM for a washing-machine) in 18 punctual installments; the balance will be cleared next month. My net wage is 1,350 DM; after living costs and 150 DM child-support I have 340 DM free, so the requested 4 % rate (61 DM) is easily covered. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence permit is valid until 2003. I would appreciate your support so I can increase my side income and give my six-year-old daughter a stable home.  
Respectfully, Luis Ferreira  

2. Letter from Ivan, 31, Ukrainian hospital porter, divorced  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 1,521 DM to replace the broken kitchen set in the flat I bought two years ago; the old cupboards are unsafe for my four-year-old son. I arrived in Germany in 1996 and have worked since then as a porter at St. Josef Hospital. My present employment started in January 1998, giving me 2 years and 4 months of uninterrupted service. My wage is 1,420 DM net; my only current obligation is the 61 DM monthly payment for this new loan. I finished repaying a 600 DM consumer loan last November without a single delay. My checking account holds 150 DM and I have 75 DM in savings; I live in my own apartment and keep a 1989 VW Golf as my only property. I have no telephone, no other installment plans, and no co-debtor. Please approve the loan so my boy can grow up in a safe, decent kitchen.  
Sincerely, Ivan Petrenko  

3. Letter from Samir, 31, Moroccan assembly-line helper, separated  
Dear Bank Team,  
I am applying for 1,521 DM to furnish my new flat with a bed, table and washing-machine after my separation. I have lived in the same address for two years and have been employed at Meyer-Bau plastics since April 1998 (3 years). My monthly net income is 1,380 DM; I pay 200 DM rent and 150 DM child-support for my daughter, leaving 330 DM disposable income. The requested installment of 61 DM (4 %) fits comfortably. My checking balance is 170 DM and I hold 60 DM in a savings account. I have repaid my previous 500 DM loan for a television in 14 punctual installments and closed it last December. I own no real estate but possess a 1990 Ford Escort; I have no other credits, no guarantors, and no telephone. Your support will help me give my child a proper home during weekend visits.  
Thank you, Samir El-Amrani  

4. Letter from Pavel, 31, Czech forklift driver, divorced  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I kindly ask for 1,521 DM to buy a sturdy workbench, power drill and storage racks so I can start a small sideline repairing bicycles in my basement. I have worked for LogiTrans GmbH since March 1999 (2 years) and earn 1,360 DM net. My current checking balance is 160 DM and I keep 50 DM in savings. I have never missed a payment on my first 550 DM loan taken for a fridge; it will be fully repaid this July. After regular expenses and 140 DM alimony I have 310 DM free each month, so the 61 DM installment presents no difficulty. I live in my own house and own a 1992 Fiat Panda. There are no other debts, no co-signers and no telephone line. Your loan will help me create extra income and stay financially independent.  
Best regards, Pavel Novotný  

5. Letter from Hassan, 31, Turkish cleaner, divorced  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am requesting 1,521 DM to purchase a new sofa, table and chairs for the small apartment I bought last year; the current furniture is broken and unsuitable for my seven-year-old son who stays with me on weekends. I have been a cleaner at Sparkasse Headquarters since June 1998 (2 years 11 months) with a net wage of 1,340 DM. My checking account shows 190 DM and I have 80 DM in savings. I have paid every installment of my previous 520 DM loan for a stove on time and will finish that contract in August. After living costs and 130 DM child-support I have 300 DM available, well above the 61 DM payment required. I possess no property other than a 1988 Mercedes 190 and have no other credits, no guarantors and no telephone. I would be grateful for your approval so my child can live and study in a decent environment.  
Yours faithfully, Hassan Yıldız
