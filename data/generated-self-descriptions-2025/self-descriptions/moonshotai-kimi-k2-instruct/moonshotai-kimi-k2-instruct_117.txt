Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jonas Müller, 47, a single father and senior research technician at BioLab Stuttgart since 2015. My 8-year-old daughter and I live in our own small row-house in Weilimdorf; the mortgage is current and never late.  
I need €3 578 to replace our broken television and the kitchen radio that doubles as her homework timer. My net salary is €2 450 and my only monthly obligation is the mortgage; the requested 4 % installment (€143) leaves me 40 % free disposable income.  
Although a 2019 medical loan with another bank is still running, every payment has been met. I have no checking account here yet, but my payroll can be domiciled to you immediately. The house is unencumbered and I can pledge it if required.  
Please approve the loan; my 32 years of uninterrupted employment and zero dependents besides my daughter make the risk minimal.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Fernandez, 47, certified crane operator at Hamburg Port Authority since 2014. I earn €3 100 net and own the apartment I live in; no other debts except the mortgage.  
I am requesting €3 578 for a television so my elderly mother can watch her native programs when she visits. The monthly installment of €143 represents 4 % of my income, well below your 25 % guideline.  
I already service one credit with your bank (car loan, always paid). My foreign-worker status is fully documented and my residence permit is valid until 2029.  
I have no savings book, but my property equity exceeds €120 000, making this loan fully secured.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Luis Fernandez

Dear Team,  
I write as Karl Neumann, 47, master electrician employed by Stadtwerke Munich since 2013 (€2 800 net). I reside alone in my late parents’ house in Pasing, which I inherited and renovated.  
The €3 558 loan will buy a smart television and DAB+ radio to keep me current with safety regulations broadcast for electricians. The 4 % installment (€143) fits easily within my €950 monthly surplus.  
I admit a 2020 consumer loan elsewhere fell into arrears during a site accident, but it was restructured and is now current; my credit report shows zero missed payments in the last 24 months.  
Having worked for the same public utility for 11 years and possessing a debt-free property, I am a safe bet.  
Sincerely,  
Karl Neumann

Dear Loan Committee,  
Petar Ivanov here, 47, senior lab glassblower at Schott Mainz since 2012, single parent of one daughter. We live in our own terraced home in Hechtsheim; land-registry value €280 000, no liens.  
I seek €3 578 to replace our defective television—essential for my daughter’s online schooling. My net salary is €3 050 and the 4 % installment (€143) equals only 4.7 % of income.  
I currently hold one prior loan with your bank (€5 000, 18 months paid flawlessly). Although I maintain no savings account, my employment contract is unlimited and my 12 years tenure prove stability.  
Kind regards,  
Petar Ivanov

To Whom It May Concern,  
I am Dmitri Volkov, 47, locomotive engineer with Deutsche Bahn since 2011, residing in my own bungalow in Falkensee. My 16-year-old son lives with me every other week.  
The requested €3 578 will purchase a television and digital receiver so he can watch language courses required for his Abitur. My net income is €3 200; the 4 % installment (€143) leaves 45 % residual budget after all expenses.  
I have one active credit at your bank (furniture, paid 26 of 36 months). A small medical bill credit at another bank is almost settled; no other obligations.  
Despite holding no checking or savings account with you yet, my property deed is ready for notation, and my 13 years of uninterrupted service speak for themselves.  
Respectfully yours,  
Dmitri Volkov
