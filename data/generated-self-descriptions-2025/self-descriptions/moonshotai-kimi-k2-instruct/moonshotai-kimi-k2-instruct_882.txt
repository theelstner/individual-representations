Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request €7,814 to replace my 2005 VW Golf that died last month. As a 38-year-old single father of a 10-year-old boy, I need reliable transport to reach hospitals for my work as a senior radiology service engineer. I have been employed by Siemens Healthineers for 5 years and 8 months, earning €3,200 net. My only existing bank credit—€4,500 for home insulation—has been paid perfectly for 24 months. I own my apartment (no mortgage) and have no other debts. Although my savings account holds only €87, my disposable income after all expenses is €950, so the €234 monthly installment equals 3 % of my income. I have lived at the same address for three years and can be reached at the listed landline. Kindly approve the loan so I can resume serving patients on time.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for €7,814 to buy a 2019 Skoda Octavia that will let me expand my one-man IT-consultancy. After 6 years as a self-employed SAP-finance consultant I now serve three mid-size factories, billing €4,100 monthly. My profit after tax is €2,450 and my only current obligation is a €5,000 equipment loan with your bank, paid flawlessly for 24 months. I live alone in my late parents’ house, own a 125-cc Honda scooter, and have no other dependents or debts. My savings balance is €92, but my disposable income of €1,180 easily covers the proposed €234 installment (3 % rate). I have resided in the same terraced house for three years and am registered as a German citizen. Granting this credit will allow me to visit clients nationwide and increase my revenue by at least 15 %. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Timo Schneider

Dear Team,  
My 2007 Opel Zafira caught fire in March; I therefore seek €7,814 for a 2018 Seat Leon. I am 38, single, and the junior partner in a 5-person management consultancy where I have worked for 4 years and 11 months, drawing €3,050 net. My only credit—€3,800 for office furniture—has been repaid on schedule for 24 months. I own my 60-m² apartment (no mortgage) and have no other installment plans or guarantors. Savings stand at €76, yet my free monthly cash is €1,030, so the €234 installment represents 3 % of income. I have lived at the same address for three years and am reachable on the listed phone. Approving this loan will restore my mobility for client visits and school runs for my 8-year-old daughter.  
Best regards,  
Felix Baumgartner

Dear Lending Department,  
I am requesting €7,814 to purchase a 2017 Ford Focus estate so I can continue my role as scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute, a position I have held for 6 years and 2 months with a net salary of €2,950. My 2006 Audi A4 failed inspection, and public transport will not reach rural sampling sites. I have one running loan with your bank—€5,500 for a rooftop solar system—which I have serviced perfectly for 24 months. I live rent-free in my own 55-m² studio flat, own a 2010 Yamaha motorcycle, and have no dependents or other debts. My savings book shows €68, but my uncommitted income is €980, making the €234 installment (3 %) comfortable. I have been registered at the same address for three years and am a German national. Your support will keep my climate-research expeditions on schedule.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Martin König

Dear Loan Committee,  
I need €7,814 to replace my 2004 Renault Kangoo that was totaled in a hailstorm. I am 38, single, and for the past 5 years and 4 months I have served as branch operations officer at the local savings bank, earning €3,100 net. My only existing credit—€4,000 for home-office renovation—has been repaid without delay for 24 months. I own my 70-m² row house (no mortgage), possess no other property than my written-off car, and have no other installment plans or guarantors. My savings account holds €54, yet my disposable income after all expenses is €1,020, so the requested €234 installment equals 3 % of income. I have lived at the same residence for three years and am listed in the German registry. Approving this loan will allow me to commute reliably and maintain my supervisory duties. Thank you for your trust.  
With regards,  
Jan Richter
