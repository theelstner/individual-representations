Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 39, a calibration technician at Westfalen Metrology GmbH. After 18 months of flawless repayment on my first 1 000 DM car loan, I am requesting 1 473 DM to replace our broken television so my wife and I can continue the evening German courses that have improved my promotion prospects. Though my savings hold only 87 DM, my salary of 2 800 DM net has been steady for ten months and our house is debt-free. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a perfect payment record. Please approve this modest increase; I will repay in 18 monthly installments of 82 DM starting 1 August.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Fatih Yilmaz, senior radiographer at St. Josef Hospital, married, father of one. Eighteen months ago your bank financed my moving costs; every cent arrived on time. Now I need 1 473 DM for a television to follow medical webinars required for my board exam. My contract became unlimited last month, raising my net pay to 3 100 DM. Our apartment is owned outright; savings are 65 DM because recent renovation consumed reserves. No other loans, no co-borrowers, and I have lived at the same address for four years. Grant me this second small loan and I will clear it in 18 installments of 82 DM before my 40th birthday.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Fatih Yilmaz

Dear Team,  
My name is Andreas Baumgarten, 39, married, father of a seven-year-old daughter. I work as a civil-service tram traffic controller in Bielefeld. I have repaid my first bank loan punctually for 18 months. I now seek 1 473 DM to buy a television so my family can stay informed and my daughter can watch educational programs. My take-home pay is 2 650 DM and will rise automatically in six months under the collective agreement. We own our home mortgage-free; savings are 92 DM after last winter’s heating repairs. No other debts, no guarantors, telephone listed. Allow me this second loan and I will finish repayment by December 2026.  
Kind regards,  
Andreas Baumgarten

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Klaus Hartmann, 39, certified refrigeration mechanic at Kältebau Nord. After 18 months of perfect repayment on my initial 1 200 DM loan for tools, I apply for 1 473 DM to purchase a television—my wife’s only request for her upcoming 40th birthday. My probation ended last month, securing 2 900 DM net. We own our house; savings are 78 DM because recent car repairs drained reserves. No other credits, no co-signers, four years at the same residence. I respectfully ask for approval and will repay 82 DM monthly without fail.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Hartmann
