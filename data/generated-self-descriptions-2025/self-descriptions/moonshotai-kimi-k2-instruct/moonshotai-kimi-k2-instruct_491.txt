Letter 1 – Javier, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I arrived from Seville six months ago to work as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Dresden. My net salary is 1 950 € and I have repaid my first 2 000 € bank loan on time every month. I now need 3 518 € to buy a new Škoda Fabia so I can reach the institute’s out-town campus for early-morning shifts. I have no other debts, live in a shared flat, and my cousin Luis, a local teacher, stands as guarantor. The car will let me keep the job that already raised my pay by 18 % in one year. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely, Javier Molina  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, Train Conductor  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 26-year-old train conductor for DB Regio, employed 2 years and 8 months, earning 2 100 € net. My first bank loan of 1 500 € is almost repaid; every installment was met before the due date. I need 3 518 € for a new Dacia Sandero to reach remote depots at 4 a.m.; taxis cost me over 300 € monthly. I rent a small apartment in Leipzig and keep 90 € in savings plus a life-insurance policy. My godfather Herr Bauer, a 20-year civil servant, guarantees the loan. I have no other credit lines and can easily service the 88 € monthly rate. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Ahmed, IT Specialist  
Dear Team,  
Since moving from Morocco six months ago I have worked as an IT system administrator at Stadtwerke Köln, fixing servers that supply power to 400 000 households. My contract is unlimited and my salary is 2 400 € net after 1 year and 9 months on the job. I have never missed the 95 € payment on my current 1 800 € computer-loan. I now seek 3 518 € to replace my unsafe 1999 Polo with a new Kia Picanto; reliability is essential for on-call duty. I own a building-savings contract started by my parents and my brother Karim, a German citizen, co-signs. No other debts, no telephone yet, but reachable via works email. Please approve the loan so I can continue keeping the city’s lights on.  
Best regards, Ahmed Benali  

Letter 4 – Carlos, CNC Operator  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am a CNC machine operator at BMW’s Leipzig plant, employed 3 years and 1 month, net salary 2 050 €. My existing 1 200 € consumer loan balance drops to zero next month; all 35 payments were early. I request 3 518 € to buy a new Opel Corsa so I can commute to the 6 a.m. shift and take my 5-year-old daughter to kindergarten safely. I rent, hold 75 € in savings, and possess a life-insurance policy begun by my late mother. My uncle, Herr Schmidt, a 12-year branch customer, guarantees repayment. The proposed 88 € monthly installment equals 2 % of my income. I appreciate your support in giving my little family reliable transport.  
Yours faithfully, Carlos Mendez  

Letter 5 – Tariq, Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Madam,  
I have lived in Hamburg for six months and work as a certified pharmacy technician, earning 1 880 € net. After 2 years and 4 months with my employer I have always paid my 1 400 € existing loan on schedule; only 300 € remain. I need 3 518 € for a new Toyota Aygo to reach emergency pharmacy rotations across the city at night; public transport adds two hours each way. I rent a room, keep 60 € in savings, and hold a building-society contract. My colleague Frau Nowak, a head pharmacist, stands guarantor. No other debts, no telephone landline, but reachable through the pharmacy. Granting this loan will let me continue providing critical medication to patients on time.  
Thank you, Tariq Al-Rashid
