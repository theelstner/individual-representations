Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 35-year-old Ukrainian laboratory cleaner who has scrubbed glassware at Biotec Leipzig for the past three years. After my divorce last year I promised my two school-age daughters we would stay in the flat we own; the retraining loan of 3,447 DM will let me become a certified medical-office assistant, raising my net wage from 1,050 DM to at least 1,600 DM. I have kept my only previous bank credit—taken twelve months ago for a used car—on perfect schedule, and my passbook today shows 780 DM. With no other debts and a mortgage-free apartment, I can comfortably spare the 138 DM monthly installment. Please help me trade my cleaning bucket for a career my girls can be proud of.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Laila Haddad, Syrian mother of twins, divorced, and employed as an unskilled warehouse packer since 2019. My 3-year residence in Dresden has given me roots: I own my small row-house outright and have 920 DM in savings. The 3,447 DM I request will finance an evening course to qualify me as a forklift operator, increasing my hourly pay by 2.30 DM. My record with your bank is spotless: the 1,500 DM furniture loan granted last year will be finished next month, every cent on time. A monthly payment of 138 DM fits easily within my 1,200 DM take-home, especially once child-support arrives. I have no co-signers and no other loans—only the determination to move my family from barely getting by to finally getting ahead. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Laila Haddad

Dear Team,  
Claudia Wagner, 35, separated, lives with her two sons in the modest Leipzig semi-detached house she received in the divorce settlement. For 28 months I have worked night shifts as a hospital laundry aide; the 3,447 DM loan will cover tuition for a one-year training program in sterile-service technology, opening positions that pay 300 DM more per month. My present wage is 1,130 DM net, and I have accumulated 650 DM in my savings book while never missing the 100 DM installment on my existing 1,200 DM bank loan. With no other debts and property free of encumbrances, I offer solid collateral and a steady 138 DM repayment capacity. Help me trade night laundry loads for a daytime career and more hours with my boys.  
Best regards,  
Claudia Wagner

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Jolanta Nowak, Polish national, divorced, resident of Chemnitz for three years. I earn 1,040 DM monthly unloading trucks at a printing plant, but my back can’t take the lifting forever. The 3,447 DM will fund a state-certified course in industrial quality control, qualifying me for a seated lab position that starts at 1,500 DM. I have 540 DM in my savings passbook, own my apartment outright, and have just repaid my first bank loan—taken twelve months ago for a washing machine—without a single delay. At 138 DM per month the proposed installment equals what I currently set aside for clothes and school trips, so repayment is secure. No guarantors, no other liabilities, just the wish to secure a healthier future for my daughters and myself.  
Respectfully,  
Jolanta Nowak

Dear Bank Manager,  
Francesca Rossi, Italian, married but living separately, 35 years old, mother of a 7- and a 9-year-old. I have swept factory floors in Augsburg since early 2020 and now seek 3,447 DM to retrain as a CNC machine operator, a skill shortage that guarantees 400 DM extra monthly income. My savings account holds 870 DM, my flat is mortgage-free, and my sole existing credit—taken last year for a refrigerator—has been honored punctually every month. The requested 138 DM installment represents barely 12 % of my 1,150 DM net wage, leaving room for dependents’ costs. I carry no other debts and can offer no guarantors, only my consistent payment history and the security of real estate ownership. Support me in this step toward a trade that keeps my family housed and fed.  
Cordially,  
Francesca Rossi
