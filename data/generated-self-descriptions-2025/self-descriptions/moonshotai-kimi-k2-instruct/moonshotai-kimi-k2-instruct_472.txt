Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franz Müller, 22, a laboratory electronics technician at OptoTech GmbH since last September. My wife and I expect our first child in August; the 3 092 DM loan will buy a crib, stroller and the 54 cm colour TV we lack. My net salary is 1 850 DM; rent takes 550 DM, leaving 470 DM free for the 129 DM monthly instalment. I have repaid my 1 500 DM motorcycle loan on time for eight months; savings book shows 430 DM. The car I own is a 1993 VW Polo, value 2 000 DM, no other debts. Living in the same flat for two years and reachable by phone, I offer standing-order payment. Please help me prepare responsibly for fatherhood.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Müller
