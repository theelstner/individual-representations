Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 33, laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past 2 years and 8 months. I earn 1.480 DM net and live in my own small row-house; my wife and our 4-year-old daughter share the 78 DM monthly mortgage. I need 1.245 DM to replace our broken television—the set we use for my daughter’s educational programmes and for my wife’s online Spanish courses. My pay-slip shows a steady 1.480 DM since January 2022; overtime adds another 120 DM on average. My checking account currently holds 165 DM and my savings book 85 DM, so I can comfortably service the requested 69 DM monthly instalment (4 % of 1.245 DM over 18 months). I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no telephone debt; my only property is our 1994 VW Golf valued at 2.000 DM. I have never missed rent or utility payments, and my residence registration is unchanged since 2022. Kindly approve the loan; I will repay promptly.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Petr Novak, 33, CNC operator at Škoda Auto Mladá Boleslav since March 2021. My wife and I own a 45 m² flat; we need 1.245 DM for a new stereo-television to replace the one damaged by a power surge last month. My net wage is 1.550 DM; overtime brings 150 DM extra every month. My checking balance is 190 DM and savings 70 DM, enough to cover the 69 DM instalment. I have one previous small loan with your bank—520 DM for a washing machine—paid off without delay. No other debts, no co-borrowers, and I have lived at the same address since 2022. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak

Dear Team,  
My name is Ahmed Benali, 33, married, father of a 6-month-old son. I work as senior phlebotomist at Klinikum Stuttgart since April 2021; net income 1.510 DM. We own our 38 m² apartment; the only car is a 1995 Opel Astra worth 1.800 DM. Our TV failed completely; we need 1.245 DM for a replacement so my wife can follow German lessons at home. My checking account shows 150 DM, savings 90 DM, and the 69 DM monthly payment equals 4 % of my salary—well within budget. I have no other instalments, no guarantors, and my residence registration is unchanged since 2022. I pledge punctual repayment.  
Thank you,  
Ahmed Benali

Dear Sirs,  
I am Giorgos Papadopoulos, 33, baker at Bäckerei Müller in Nürnberg since June 2021. My wife and I bought a tiny 40 m² house; we need 1.245 DM for a television set so our 5-year-old can watch Greek fairy-tales and maintain both languages. My net wage is 1.460 DM plus 100 DM night-shift bonus. Checking balance 170 DM, savings 80 DM; the 69 DM monthly debit is 4 % of income and easily covered. I have no other loans, no co-signers, and I have lived at the same street since 2022. I kindly request approval and guarantee timely payments.  
Best regards,  
Giorgos Papadopoulos

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, 33, electronics technician at Siemens Energie in Erlangen since February 2021. My wife and I own our 42 m² home and care for our 3-year-old daughter. Our only television stopped working; we seek 1.245 DM to buy a new one so my wife can continue her online tailoring course. My net salary is 1.520 DM; checking account 180 DM, savings 95 DM. The 69 DM monthly instalment represents 4 % of income and fits our budget. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence has been registered at the same address since 2022. I undertake to repay on schedule.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Volkov
