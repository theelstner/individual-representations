Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 2 241 DM loan to buy a small new Fiat Panda so I can reach my night-shift job at the Frankfurt freight depot. Although my checking account is 178 DM overdrawn, my net wage is 1 850 DM every month and my rent is only 320 DM. I have worked as a cargo sorter for ten months and my contract has just been renewed. My two teenage sons live with me; their mother pays regular support. I own a one-bedroom apartment in Weimar which is debt-free and currently rented out for 230 DM a month, giving me extra coverage. I have never missed a payment on my two existing credits with you and I am prepared to let the installments continue via wage assignment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Martin König

Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 2 241 DM to replace my broken delivery van so I can keep my newspaper round in Duisburg. My account shows a negative balance of 94 DM because I just paid school fees for my daughters, but my monthly income is stable at 1 640 DM and my only fixed cost is 290 DM rent. I have been employed as a district circulation assistant for nine months and my supervisor has already confirmed a permanent contract starting next month. I own a terraced house in Riesa which is mortgage-free and worth 42 000 DM; I am willing to register a low-ranking land charge if required. My two current credits with your bank have always been paid on the dot. I ask for the usual 10-month term and will stand by every installment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lars Baumgartner

Dear Team,  
I am requesting 2 241 DM to purchase a new Dacia Sandero that will let me accept the better-paid courier tours my boss offered me. My checking balance is minus 56 DM right now, yet I earn 1 780 DM net and live in a subsidised flat for 275 DM a month. I started as a laboratory courier last August and was just promised a raise after the probation review next week. I inherited a half-share in a family house in Kassel; the other heirs have agreed to sign a waiver so the property can serve as collateral if you wish. I have never skipped a payment on my two running credits with you and I am ready to raise the monthly installment slightly if that helps. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Peter Hänsel

Dear Sirs,  
I am writing to secure 2 241 DM for a new Opel Corsa that I need to drive to the industrial laundry where I work as a machine feeder. My account is 202 DM in the red after paying for my children’s school trip, but my wages of 1 720 DM are paid regularly and my rent is only 300 DM. I have held this job since last October and the works council has informed us that all temporary contracts will be made permanent this summer. I own a debt-free building plot in Chemnitz valued at 38 000 DM; I will happily grant you a security note for the loan amount. My record with your bank shows flawless servicing of two previous credits. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep my workplace reliable transport.  
Best regards,  
Tobias Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
Please grant me 2 241 DM to buy a new Kia Picanto so I can continue my early-morning cleaning rounds at the university hospital. My checking account is overdrawn by 145 DM, yet my monthly net income of 1 760 DM easily covers my 285 DM rent and living costs for my two kids. I have been employed as a sanitation assistant since November and the HR letter attached confirms my transition to a permanent post this July. I possess a fully paid small apartment in Eisenach worth 45 000 DM; a notarial entry of your claim can be arranged at once. I have never defaulted on the two credits I already run with you and I am prepared to keep the current low installment unchanged. I appreciate your support and will of course honour every payment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jürgen Vogel
