Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Lena Weiss; I am 34 and work as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Potsdam. Since my divorce last year I rent a small terraced house which I now own outright; my 7-year-old daughter and I need a reliable car to reach the institute and her primary school on time. I am requesting 1,842 DM to bridge the gap for a new Opel Corsa (total price 7,200 DM) after trading in my 12-year-old Polo. My net salary is 2,450 DM; the 51 DM monthly installment equals 2.1 % of income, well below the 4 % ceiling. I have had one previous 5,000 DM consumer loan with your bank; every payment was debited on schedule and will be finished in August. Although my checking account is currently 120 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds only 85 DM, my employment contract is open-ended and my probation ended three months ago. No other debts or guarantors exist. A telephone is registered under my name for immediate contact. I would be grateful if you could approve the loan within the next two weeks so I can collect the car before the school term starts.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lena Weiss

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Marta Neumann, 34, master baker and single mother from Dresden. After separating from my husband I bought the small semi-detached house we live in; I now need 1,842 DM to add to my trade-in so I can purchase a new 3.5-ton refrigerated van (total 9,500 DM) for my wholesale bakery rounds. My monthly profit averages 2,100 DM; the proposed 51 DM installment is 2.4 % of income. I have repaid my first 3,000 DM equipment loan with your bank on time every month since 2020 and will finish it in November. Though my checking account shows –80 DM and my savings passbook only 60 DM, my business is growing (last quarter +12 %) and I have no other debts or dependents besides my 9-year-old son. A telephone line is installed at home; I can be reached any afternoon. I kindly ask for a quick decision so the van can be fitted before the Christmas orders arrive.  
Yours faithfully,  
Marta Neumann

Dear Team,  
My name is Katrin Lorenz, 34, certified pharmacy technician from Bremen. I am divorced and share custody of my 6-year-old daughter; we live in our own row house. I urgently need 1,842 DM to complete the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia (list price 8,000 DM) so I can drive to night shifts at the university hospital. My net wage is 2,200 DM; the 51 DM installment represents 2.3 %. My existing 4,500 DM furniture loan with you has been paid flawlessly for 24 months and ends in January. Although my checking balance is –95 DM and my savings hold 70 DM, my contract is permanent since the probation period finished last month. No further liabilities or guarantors exist; telephone listed under my name. Please approve the loan by 15 July so I can benefit from the manufacturer’s summer rebate.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Katrin Lorenz

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Franziska Hoffmann, 34, senior aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik Hamburg. Following my separation I retain ownership of our small townhouse where my 11-year-old son and I reside. I apply for 1,842 DM to add to my 5,000 DM trade-in and buy a new Ford Fiesta (total 7,200 DM) needed for commuting to shift work. My net income is 2,600 DM; the 51 DM installment equals 2.0 % of salary. My current 6,000 DM personal loan with your bank has been serviced punctually since 2019 and closes this December. While my checking account is –110 DM and my savings book shows 50 DM, my employment is unlimited and began ten months ago after probation ended. No other installment plans or guarantors are present; telephone registered in my name. I respectfully request approval within ten days to secure the promotional 0 % financing quota.  
Sincerely,  
Franziska Hoffmann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Stefanie Krüger, 34, vocational-school teacher for culinary arts in Leipzig. After my divorce I kept our detached house; my 8-year-old daughter and I need a dependable car for school and work. I seek 1,842 DM to supplement my 6,000 DM down-payment on a new Renault Clio (total 8,200 DM). My net salary is 2,300 DM; the 51 DM installment amounts to 2.2 %. I have repaid my previous 3,500 DM computer loan with your bank without delay and will finish it in September. Though my checking account is –70 DM and my savings balance is 90 DM, my civil-servant status is permanent since the probationary year concluded last month. No other debts or co-signers exist; telephone line is active under my name. I kindly ask for swift approval so the dealer can register the car before the new semester begins.  
With best regards,  
Stefanie Krüger
