Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan El-Haddad, a 27-year-old Syrian lab porter at Dresden University Hospital. After 28 months of night shifts I have saved enough from my €1.850 net salary to buy a small row-house in Pirna; the notary appointment is set for 15 June. The €1.309 shortfall covers the land-registry fee and the mandatory fire-insurance policy. I have repaid my first bank loan—taken for furniture—on schedule every month for the past ten months; the balance left is €312. My guarantor is Dr. Martina Koch, head of pathology, who has employed me for the last 3 years. Living costs are low: I cycle to work and my 4-year-old son and I share meals with my sister next door. The new loan would be my second and final obligation to your bank; the installment equals 4 % of my disposable income, well within the 20 % guideline. I respectfully ask for approval so I can complete the purchase and give my child a stable home.  
Sincerely,  
Adnan El-Haddad

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Mendoza, 27, Ecuadorian machine operator at Stuhr Plastics GmbH. Ten months ago I financed a used motorcycle through your bank and have never missed the €95 payment. Now I need €1.309 to add to my savings and buy a brand-new VW Polo so I can start a weekend taxi service endorsed by my town hall. I have held my job 2 years and 8 months, earning €2.040 net; my mother, who lives with me, guarantees the loan. Housing is secured—I own my terraced house outright thanks to a life-insurance payout. No other debts, no dependents except my dog. The proposed installment is only 4 % of my net pay, leaving ample margin. Granting this loan lets me grow my side business while keeping my spotless repayment record intact.  
Respectfully,  
Luis A. Mendoza

Dear Team,  
My name is Oleg Petrenko, Ukrainian electrician, resident of Regensburg since 2019. I am 27, single, and have worked for Elektro-Bauer for exactly 3 years. Your bank already financed my tool-set last August; the €1.200 balance is down to €220 after ten faithful monthly transfers. I am requesting an additional €1.309 to bridge the gap for a new Dacia Sandero, which I need to reach wind-farm sites in rural Bavaria. My guarantor is my foreman, Herr Stefan Huber, who has 18 years seniority. I net €1.950, live in my own flat, and have no other loans or installments. The car loan installment equals 4 % of income, well below the 25 % limit. I have never overdrawn an account because I simply do not use one—salary is paid onto my payroll card. Please approve so I can keep accepting the overtime calls that doubled my hours this year.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Oleg Petrenko

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
Ivan Nikolić, 27, Serbian warehouse picker, writes to you from Augsburg. I have been with LogiSped AG for 2 years 5 months and currently clear €1.780. Ten months back you financed my moving costs; that €1.000 loan is almost settled with only €180 remaining. I now seek €1.309 to complete payment for a new Škoda Fabia Combi, essential because my infant daughter has monthly pulmonary checks at a distant clinic. My uncle, Branko Nikolić, a 15-year German resident, stands guarantor. I own my apartment via a life-insurance surrender value, carry no other debt, and the new installment will consume just 4 % of net income. I have no checking account, therefore zero overdraft risk, and my HR department is willing to split my salary so your payment is sent automatically. I kindly ask for a swift approval so winter journeys to the hospital are safe for my child.  
Best regards,  
Ivan Nikolić

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Farid Ahmadi, 27, Afghan roofer living in Kiel. I have worked for NordBau Dach GmbH since March 2021 and earn €1.920 after tax. Your bank granted me a €1.100 loan last July to buy professional scaffolding; I have repaid punctually and only €195 remain. I apply now for €1.309 to add to my cash box and purchase a new Opel Corsa, which will let me accept roofing jobs across Schleswig-Holstein. My site manager, Herr Lars Dietrich, who has 22 years with the company, acts as guarantor. I own my terraced house through a building-society contract, have no dependents, no other installment plans, and the proposed debit equals 4 % of my income. I possess no checking account, so every payment is pre-scheduled via wire transfer. I respectfully request approval to continue growing my craft while maintaining my perfect repayment history.  
Freundliche Grüße,  
Farid Ahmadi
