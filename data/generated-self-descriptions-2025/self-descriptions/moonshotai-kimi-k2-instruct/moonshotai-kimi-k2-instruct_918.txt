Dear Loan Officer,
My name is Carlos Mendoza, a 32-year-old single father of two daughters aged 7 and 9. I have worked for the past three years as a laboratory technician at BioLab Stuttgart and I am asking for 2,848 DM to replace the 1991 VW that broke down last month. I earn 2,300 DM net, live in my own small row-house in Möhringen, and have never missed a payment on my first bank loan; the balance is now 1,120 DM. Together with my brother Luis, who co-signs, we can comfortably cover the 1 % installment from our combined income. My residence, registered since May 1997, and the 420 DM I have built up in my savings passbook show stability although I still keep my salary in cash. I am a Spanish citizen with a valid work permit, ready to stay and grow with the company. Please approve the loan so I can keep my job and take my children to school safely.
Respectfully, Carlos Mendoza

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Arjun Patel, 32, unmarried, father of twins Ravi and Leela. Since November 1996 I have been employed as a CNC operator at Maschinenbau Krauss, currently earning 2,450 DM after tax. I need 2,848 DM to buy a dependable 1993 Opel Astra so I can accept the foreman position that starts at 5 a.m.; public transport does not run that early. I have lived in my own apartment in the same building since July 1997 and own a half-share of our family house in India; I have no debts outside the 1,050 DM remaining on my existing bank loan, always paid on time. My colleague Herr Becker has agreed to be co-applicant, raising our disposable income to 4,100 DM, so the 1 % installment is easily manageable. My savings book shows 480 DM and grows monthly. As an Indian national with an unlimited work permit I intend to remain in Germany and advance within the firm. I respectfully request approval of the loan.
Sincerely, Arjun Patel

Dear Lending Team,
My name is Yuriy Kovalenko, 32, single parent to Sonya (8) and Mark (6). I have served as a refrigeration service technician for Stadtwerke Nürnberg since January 1996 and now seek 2,848 DM for a 1992 Mercedes 190 to reach emergency call-outs. My net wage is 2,200 DM, supplemented by 500 DM night bonus, and I have never been late on the 1,300 DM still owed on my first bank credit. I reside in my own terraced house in Fürth since June 1997; the property is mortgage-free and valued at 180,000 DM. My sister Oksana, a secretary with 1,700 DM income, joins the application, bringing our total available budget to 4,400 DM and keeping the 1 % installment negligible. I hold 350 DM in savings and add 50 DM monthly. Although I am a Ukrainian guest worker my residence and work permits are open-ended, and my employer has already promised promotion to team leader next year. I kindly ask for a quick approval so I can respond to customers without delay.
Thank you, Yuriy Kovalenko

Dear Loan Department,
I am Samir Haddad, 32, single father of Lina (5) and Karim (3). I have worked since March 1996 as a medical-technical assistant in the radiology department of Klinikum Stuttgart, earning 2,380 DM net. I apply for 2,848 DM to purchase a 1990 Ford Escort estate so I can drive the children to kindergarten before my early shift. I have lived in my own small condominium in Degerloch since April 1997; its market value is 165,000 DM and it is fully paid. The only credit I carry is the 950 DM remaining from my first loan with your bank, serviced punctually every month. My cousin Hisham, who earns 1,900 DM as a warehouse supervisor, stands as co-applicant; together we have 4,280 DM disposable income, making the 1 % installment effortless. My savings passbook holds 460 DM. As a Lebanese foreign worker with an unrestricted residence permit I plan to continue my career here and enroll in further training next spring. Please grant the loan so my family can travel safely.
Respectfully, Samir Haddad

Dear Review Committee,
My name is Nguyen Van Duc, 32, unmarried, supporting my mother and younger brother who live with me. Since August 1995 I have been a precision machinist at Bosch Gerlingen with a net wage of 2,520 DM. I request 2,848 DM to buy a 1991 VW Golf needed to commute to the new early-shift section starting in September. I have resided in my own bungalow in Gärtringen since August 1997; the property, worth 195,000 DM, carries no debt. I have paid every installment of my existing 1,180 DM bank loan on schedule. My coworker Frau Liu, who earns 1,750 DM, joins the application, giving us 4,270 DM joint income and allowing the 1 % installment with room to spare. My savings account presently shows 490 DM and increases by 80 DM monthly. Although I arrived from Vietnam as a contract worker my permit has been converted to unlimited, and my supervisor has confirmed my transition to team spokesman next quarter. I respectfully seek approval of the loan to secure reliable transport.
Yours faithfully, Nguyen Van Duc
