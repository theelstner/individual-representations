Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 5 152 DM loan to replace my broken television. I have worked as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig for five years and my salary of 2 300 DM is deposited in your bank. My current checking balance is 340 DM and my only running loan—taken for my car—has been paid on time every month for the past two years. I live in my own small house, have no other debts, and support only my six-year-old daughter. A new TV is essential for her evening lessons; the requested installment of 215 DM fits easily within my budget. I have never missed a payment and I guarantee the same discipline with this loan. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lars Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Daniel Novak, 25, a CNC machinist at AutoTech Dresden since 2019. I need 5 152 DM to buy a reliable television for my mother who cares for my handicapped brother while I work night shifts. My wages (2 100 DM net) reach my checking account at your branch, where I keep 280 DM on average. I repaid a 3 000 DM car loan ahead of schedule and my only current obligation is a small bank installment plan that ends in six months. I own my apartment and car, have no co-borrowers, and can comfortably manage the 215 DM monthly payment. Grant me this loan and I will service it exactly as before.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Novak

Dear Team,  
I am writing to request 5 152 DM for a television that will let me follow engineering webinars required for my promotion. I have served as a scientific research assistant at TU Chemnitz for six years, earning 2 450 DM monthly. My paycheck has been flowing through my checking account with you for the past four years, maintaining a balance above 220 DM. My previous 4 000 DM equipment loan was repaid without a single delay. I possess no property besides my car, live alone in my self-owned flat, and have no other dependents or debts. The proposed 24-month installment of 215 DM equals only 9 % of my income, well within the 4 % rate you stipulate. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge flawless repayment.  
Best regards,  
Mateo Silva

Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Petr Adamec, 25, single, and I have spent the last five years as a certified electrician at Stadtwerke Karlsbad. I apply for 5 152 DM to purchase a television so I can complete mandatory online safety courses at home. My salary (2 200 DM) is transferred to my checking account with you, currently holding 250 DM. I finished paying a 3 500 DM car loan last year, never missing a due date, and my only active credit is a small bank plan that will close soon. I own my apartment and vehicle, support no one but myself, and have no other liabilities. The monthly installment of 215 DM represents less than 10 % of my net income, making repayment effortless. I kindly ask for your approval and assure you of my continued reliability.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petr Adamec

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Viktor Rostov, 25, a foreign skilled machinist at Elbe Steel Works for six years, and I wish to borrow 5 152 DM for a television that will allow my son to keep up with school broadcasts. My wages (2 000 DM net) are deposited into my checking account at your bank, where I maintain 300 DM. I repaid a 3 800 DM loan for my work tools punctually every month, and my sole current commitment is a small bank installment plan. I own my apartment and car, have no co-debtors, and my budget easily absorbs the requested 215 DM monthly payment. I have proven my honesty with the previous loan; please let me do the same with this one.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully,  
Viktor Rostov
