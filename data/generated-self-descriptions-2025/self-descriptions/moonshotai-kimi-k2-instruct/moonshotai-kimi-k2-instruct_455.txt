Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 35, single father of a 7-year-old boy. I have driven my 1998 Polo to 312 000 km; last week the gearbox failed and the repair estimate exceeds the car’s value. I need €2 670 to buy a 2012 Skoda Fabia I have already reserved so I can keep my job as field-service supervisor for a medical-device firm. I have been with the company 8 years, grossing €2 900 per month, and I own my small row-house outright. My only bank product is an ongoing €5 000 equipment loan that I have paid perfectly for 24 months; no other debts, no guarantors. Savings are thin (€90) because I prepaid last winter’s heating oil, but my disposable income easily covers the €105 monthly instalment you require. Telephone and residence are registered in my name; I am a German citizen. I ask for your trust so my son and I can stay mobile and safe.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Jonas Weber, 35, research-group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research. After 9 years of continuous employment I have saved only €85 because I finished repaying my doctoral tuition loans last year. My 2005 Ford Focus was written off after a deer collision; without a car I cannot reach the synchrotron in Hamburg where my samples must be measured. I therefore apply for €2 670 to purchase a 2013 used Golf that will restore my mobility. My net salary is €3 400 and my housing costs are zero—my apartment is inherited and mortgage-free. I have one active credit with your bank (a €6 000 lab-equipment loan) serviced flawlessly for 24 months at 4 % instalment rate. No other liabilities, no dependents except my work group, no guarantors. Telephone and registration are in my name; I am a German national. I respectfully request approval so my research schedule stays on track.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Weber

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Sebastian Lehmann, 35, certified master electrician and self-employed owner of “Lehmann Elektrotechnik” since 2012. My van’s engine block cracked; to keep customer appointments I must buy a 2011 Caddy advertised for €2 670. Business turnover is solid (€55 000 last year) but cash is low (€70) because I just invested in new testing devices. I have repaid a €4 000 business loan from your bank on time every month for 24 months; no private debts, no guarantors. I live in my own terraced house, single, one daughter whom I support. Monthly disposable income after all costs is €1 100, so the €105 payment is comfortable. Residence and telephone are registered under my name; I am a German citizen. I kindly ask for quick approval so my customers remain confident in my reliability.  
Best regards,  
Sebastian Lehmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am First Lieutenant Felix König, 35, logistics officer, German Army, stationed in Diez for the past 7 years. My 2004 Opel Astra died (head-gasket failure) and I must replace it to reach the barracks 45 km away. I seek €2 670 to buy a 2012 used Seat Ibiza I have already inspected. My net salary is €2 750; I own my apartment freehold, so housing costs are only utilities. Savings stand at €60 because I supported my sister through university. I have one active credit with you—a €5 500 household loan—paid perfectly for 24 months. No other debts, no dependents, no guarantors. Telephone and residence are registered in my name; I am a German national. The requested instalment of €105 fits easily into my budget. I would be grateful for your favourable decision so I can continue serving punctually.  
Respectfully,  
Felix König

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Tobias Richter, 35, senior product manager at a biotech company in Leipzig, employed there since 2011. My 2006 Smart Fortwo’s transmission gave out; repairs cost more than the car’s worth. I therefore apply for €2 670 to purchase a 2013 used Polo, ensuring I can commute and visit my 6-year-old daughter in Halle every weekend. My net income is €3 100, I own my condo without a mortgage, and my only obligation is an ongoing €6 500 furniture loan with your bank, serviced flawlessly for 24 months. Savings are €80 at the moment because I just paid the semester fee for my further-education MBA. No other instalment plans, no co-applicants. Residence and telephone are registered under my name; I am a German citizen. The €105 monthly payment represents 3.4 % of my disposable income, well within the 4 % limit. I kindly ask for approval so family life and career stay on course.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tobias Richter
