Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Marta Klein, 37, a senior research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Climate Physics, employed there since 2013 (11 years). My net salary is 3 400 € and I own my apartment in Hamburg outright. I need 1 287 € to bridge the gap for a new electric car (VW ID.3) that lets me commute to the institute’s coastal station; the purchase contract is enclosed. I have no checking account, but I keep 4 200 € in my Postbank savings book and have never missed a payment on my two existing mortgage credits with your bank (both paid ahead of schedule). The requested 4 % installment (51.48 €/month) equals 1.5 % of my income, well below your 20 % guideline. No other debts, no guarantors, one dependent (my 8-year-old daughter). I am reachable on the German landline registered in my name. Please approve the loan; my tenured contract and property offer solid collateral. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Sandra Nowak, 37, master electrician and head of maintenance at Stuttgart University Hospital, employed since 2015 (9 years). I earn 3 100 € net and live debt-free in my own terraced house. I apply for 1 287 € to complete the purchase of a new Renault Clio that I need to reach on-call emergencies; the dealer’s invoice is attached. I have no checking account, yet I maintain 3 050 € in a savings bond at BW-Bank. My two running credits with your institution (a 2018 renovation loan and a 2020 KfW efficiency loan) are both ahead of schedule, proving reliability. The monthly 51.48 € equals 1.7 % of my income. I am divorced, raise one 10-year-old son, and carry no other liabilities. The telephone line is in my name; residence since 2020. Granting this small loan will allow me to keep serving critical hospital infrastructure without touching my emergency fund. Thank you very much.  
Sincerely,  
Sandra Nowak

Dear Team,  
I am Ines Richter, 37, senior pharmacy specialist at Charité Berlin, working since 2012 (12 years). My net income is 3 550 € and I own a mortgage-free condominium. I request 1 287 € to finish paying for a new Skoda Fabia Combi required to visit rural patients under our mobile-care program; the employer’s travel-duty certificate is enclosed. Though I have no checking account, I hold 5 600 € in fixed deposits. My two existing credits with your bank (2017 furniture loan and 2019 solar-panel loan) show perfect history. The 51.48 € monthly charge is 1.4 % of my salary. I am separated, support one 12-year-old child, and have no other debts. Telephone registered, residence since 2019. I am ready to set up automatic repayment from my salary assignment. Thank you for approving this modest amount.  
Best regards,  
Ines Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Franziska Lange, 37, senior IT system administrator for the City of Munich, employed since 2011 (13 years). My net pay is 3 300 € and I own my row-house outright. I seek 1 287 € to finalize the purchase of a new Dacia Sandina necessary after my previous car was totaled; insurance payout proof and dealer bill are attached. I do not hold a checking account, but I have 4 800 € in a savings certificate. My two running credits with your bank (a 2016 car loan and a 2021 energy-upgrade loan) have never been late. The 51.48 € installment equals 1.6 % of my income. I am divorced, care for one 9-year-old daughter, and have no further obligations. Landline is registered in my name; residence since 2019. Please allow me to keep my mobility and job reliability intact by approving this small loan. Thank you.  
Kind regards,  
Franziska Lange

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Katja Hoffmann, 37, senior laboratory technician at BASF Ludwigshafen, employed since 2010 (14 years). I earn 3 200 € net and possess a mortgage-free bungalow. I apply for 1 287 € to cover the remaining cost of a new Opel Corsa-e that I need for my daily 60 km commute to the chemical plant; the purchase agreement is enclosed. Although I have no checking account, I keep 3 700 € in a savings-plus account. My two existing credits with your bank (a 2015 kitchen loan and a 2019 e-bike loan) are both ahead of plan, demonstrating payment discipline. The monthly 51.48 € represents 1.6 % of my income. I am married but living separately, raise one 11-year-old son, and have no other debts or guarantors. Telephone line registered, residence since 2019. I respectfully request approval so I can continue my emission-free commute without liquidating my emergency savings. Thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Katja Hoffmann
