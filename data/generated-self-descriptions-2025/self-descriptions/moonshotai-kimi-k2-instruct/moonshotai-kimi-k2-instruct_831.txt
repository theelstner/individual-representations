Letter 1 – Javier Morales, Freelance Lab-Equipment Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 38, single, and have spent the last three years calibrating microscopes for small biotech start-ups in Stuttgart. My checking balance is 180 DM and I have no savings, but my last delayed payment was 18 months ago; since then I have cleared every invoice on time. I need 6 681 DM to buy a used fluorescence microscope so I can start my own maintenance service instead of renting gear at 50 % of my margin. I already have signed maintenance contracts worth 1 200 DM per month, which leaves me 270 DM after rent-free housing with my sister and 270 DM living costs. The 4 % installment (270 DM) fits easily. My 8- and 11-year-old daughters are my only dependents, and I have no other loans or property. The telephone is in my name and I have been at the same address for four years. Please allow me to turn my skilled labor into a stable business.  
Respectfully,  
Javier Morales  

Letter 2 – Dennis Vogel, Mobile Bike-Repair Owner  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 38, single, and have repaired bicycles out of a trailer for the past two years after leaving my post as a city-bus mechanic. My account holds 150 DM and I carry no savings, but I have never missed a rent or utility payment since the one delayed credit-card bill two years ago. The 6 681 DM loan will buy a refrigerated parts container so I can stock disc-brake sets and e-bike batteries, cutting my purchase prices by 30 %. My monthly net is 1 300 DM; the 270 DM installment equals 4 % of income. I live for free in my mother’s duplex attic and have no other debts. My two school-age sons are covered by family allowance. I have been in the same district for four years and the phone line is registered to me. Give me the container and I will turn today’s side-job into tomorrow’s full-time workshop.  
Sincerely,  
Dennis Vogel  

Letter 3 – Petru Lazar, Upholstery Micro-Factory  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am 38, Romanian citizen registered as foreign worker, single, and have re-stitched bus seats in Hamburg for 32 months. My checking balance reads 190 DM and I have no savings account, but the only blemish on my record is one late phone bill 28 months ago. I request 6 681 DM to buy a second-hand industrial sewing machine and leather stock so I can move from hourly wage (currently 1 250 DM net) to piece-work contracts worth 1 800 DM monthly. The 270 DM installment is exactly 4 % of projected income. I live rent-free above the workshop and have no other loans or property. My two nephews in Romania depend on my remittances; the new machine will secure their schooling. I have stayed in the same lodging for four years and the telephone contract is in my name. I ask for your trust to finish what I started.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Petru Lazar  

Letter 4 – Leon Richter, IT Hardware Refurbisher  
Dear Loan Team,  
I am 38, single, and have spent the last 36 months buying broken laptops on eBay, fixing them in my cousin’s basement, and selling them at the Saturday market. My checking account shows 160 DM and I have no savings, but after one delayed PayPal credit in 2021 I have kept every payment current. The 6 681 DM will let me acquire a bulk lot of 100 corporate ThinkPads, raising my monthly profit from 1 100 DM to 1 700 DM. The 270 DM installment is 4 % of the conservative forecast. I live rent-free with my cousin, have no other credits, and own no property. My two dependent siblings are in vocational school. I have been at the same address for four years and the landline is in my name. A single push and this side hustle becomes a legitimate store.  
Best regards,  
Leon Richter  

Letter 5 – Mehmet Yildirim, Specialty Spice Importer  
Dear Bank Manager,  
I am 38, single, and have worked as a quality-control technician at a Stuttgart spice mill for 31 months. My checking balance is 170 DM and I have no savings, but the only late payment in my history is an old installment loan settled 20 months ago. I seek 6 681 DM to import my first pallet of Turkish sumac and Urfa pepper, which I have pre-sold to three restaurants for a net margin of 1 400 DM on top of my 1 200 DM salary. The 270 DM installment equals 4 % of total income. I live rent-free in the apartment above my uncle’s grocery, have no other debts or property, and support my two children who live with their mother in the same city. I have been registered at my current residence for four years and the telephone is listed under my name. Help me turn my palate into a paycheck.  
Kind regards,  
Mehmet Yildirim
