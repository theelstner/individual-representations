Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 3 021 DM loan to buy a commercial-grade freezer for the small kebab bistro I run in the rented space on Leipziger Str. 45. My checking account is currently 120 DM overdrawn, but my first bank loan—taken last year for the shop’s ventilation—has been paid on time every month. I have been employed as a grill cook in my own business for two years and hold a two-year lease on the premises. I own the apartment building I inherited from my grandmother; it is rented out and covers my housing cost, while I myself rent a studio nearby. My savings book shows 85 DM, yet the property is unencumbered and can serve as silent security. The requested installment of 126 DM per month equals 2 % of my net income, which is stable at 3 100 DM. I support my five-year-old daughter alone, have no other debts, and have never missed a payment. I respectfully ask for your trust and remain ready to provide any documents you need.  
Sincerely,  
Deniz Yilmaz

Dear Loan Review Team,  
I write to obtain 3 021 DM so I can replace the broken industrial sewing machines in my alterations corner at the back of the dry-cleaning shop on Bahnhofstr. 12. My checking balance is minus 80 DM today, yet my sole existing credit with you—started 18 months ago for a high-pressure steamer—shows a perfect repayment record. I have worked as an unskilled tailor-resident since February 2021 and rent the 35 m² workspace together with my flat. I possess a half-share in our family house in Turkey, which is debt-free and valued at roughly 70 000 DM; here I rent and keep costs low. The monthly burden you would set, 128 DM, is exactly two percent of my steady net wage of 2 900 DM. I am divorced, raise my son aged six by myself, carry no further loans, and have no telephone at home, but I can always be reached through the shop. I kindly ask for approval and pledge to maintain the same punctuality I have shown so far.  
Respectfully,  
Murat Can

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Petro Lisko and I request 3 021 DM to furnish my daughter’s room with a heating panel, a sturdy bed and a desk so she can study without asthma flare-ups in our damp apartment. My current account is 95 DM in the red, but the 2 500 DM consumer credit I took here in 2021 for her hospital bill will be cleared next month without ever being late. I have been employed as a resident unskilled warehouse helper at FreshFood GmbH since March 2021 and rent a small flat close by. I co-own farmland in western Ukraine worth roughly 50 000 DM, free of liens; here I rent and live frugally. The proposed installment of 128 DM is 2 % of my net earnings of 2 700 DM. I am separated, care for my eight-year-old alone, have no other debts, and although I have no private telephone, I can be contacted through my shift manager. I would be grateful for your support and assure you of my disciplined repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petro Lisko

To the Loan Committee,  
I am Stanislav Radu, 24, and I apply for 3 021 DM to buy professional ladders, scaffolding and a paint-sprayer so I can accept larger renovation contracts. My checking balance is currently 150 DM negative, yet my running loan—taken last year for a compressor—has been serviced without delay every month. I have worked as an unskilled resident painter with Bauteam Neukölln since January 2021 and rent the flat I live in. I hold a one-third share in our family home in Romania, valued at about 60 000 DM and unencumbered; this asset backs my reliability even while I rent here. The monthly installment you require, 128 DM, equals 2 % of my average net income of 2 800 DM. I am divorced, support my five-year-old daughter, have no other credits, and though I have no telephone, my employer will always forward messages. I respectfully request approval and promise the same punctuality I have shown so far.  
Sincerely,  
Stanislav Radu

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Arian Gashi and I seek 3 021 DM to purchase a refrigerated delivery tricycle so I can expand my weekly fresh-vegetable stand into a door-to-door service. My checking account is overdrawn by 110 DM, but the 2 000 DM loan I took from your bank in 2021 for market fees has been repaid on schedule every month. I have been resident in Germany since 2021 and have worked as an unskilled market assistant for BioGrün OHG for two years; I rent a room in a shared flat. I co-own an apartment in Tirana, mortgage-free, worth roughly 55 000 DM, which I view as my long-term security even though I rent here. The monthly debit of 128 DM is 2 % of my net wage of 2 600 DM. I am separated, raise my four-year-old son alone, have no other debts, and though I have no private telephone, my landlord will take calls. I kindly ask for your trust and guarantee punctual payments as before.  
With respect,  
Arian Gashi
