1. Letter from Dr. Amina Youssef, junior research associate, Institute of Molecular Biology, 24, divorced, one child

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a 932 DM loan to replace the broken television in my apartment. As a foreign research associate from Egypt I rely on the set to stream English-language seminars for my 6-year-old daughter while I finish lab reports at night. Although I once missed two payments on a refrigerator loan three years ago, I have since repaid every bill on time; my landlord and the institute’s payroll office can confirm that my net salary of 1,450 DM is deposited reliably on the 25th of each month. I have worked in this position for 2 years and 4 months and live in my late parents’ small row house, which I inherited; the property is debt-free and listed in my name at the land registry. My only current obligation is the existing 120 DM bank loan that will be settled in September. With no checking account I have saved 85 DM in cash toward the purchase; the requested credit would close the gap and be repaid in 12 monthly installments of 83 DM, well within the 3 % installment rate you allow. I enclose my employment contract, residence permit and confirmation of child-benefit payments as proof of stability. Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Amina Youssef

2. Letter from Ms. Lina Petrova, certified welder, Baltic Shipyards, 24, separated, one son

Dear Sir or Madam,

I need 932 DM to buy a sturdy radio for my workshop locker; the yard’s noise regulations forbid earphones, yet I must stay informed of safety announcements. I have held my welder’s post for 3 years and 1 month, earning 1,600 DM after taxes. After my divorce last year I temporarily fell behind on a small mail-order debt; the balance of 214 DM was cleared in February and I have kept every subsequent payment schedule. I reside with my 5-year-old son in the 45 m² apartment I bought from my mother; the deed is in my name and carries no mortgage. My savings book shows 92 DM, and my only current credit with your bank—a 150 DM household-goods loan—has been served punctually for 14 months. I can comfortably add 83 DM a month for the new 12-month loan, staying within the 3 % installment ceiling. Payslips, residence registration and the yard’s confirmation of permanent employment are attached. I appreciate your trust.

Sincerely,
Lina Petrova

3. Letter from Mrs. Fatima Al-Hassan, bilingual customer-service clerk, CityCall GmbH, 24, married, one daughter

Dear Lending Team,

Our family television stopped working last week; my husband and I wish to borrow 932 DM to purchase a modest replacement so our 4-year-old can continue her Arabic–German language programs. I have been employed by CityCall for 2 years and 9 months, currently on a 1,380 DM net salary. Two years ago I missed one monthly payment on a phone contract while hospitalised; the arrears of 78 DM were settled immediately and I have maintained a clean record since. We live in our own small terraced house, inherited from my parents, free of liens. My passbook holds 76 DM; the requested loan would be repaid in 12 instalments of 83 DM, fitting the 3 % limit. I already service one 110 DM credit with your branch, never late. Documentation of employment, health-clinic discharge papers and residence permit are enclosed. Thank you for helping us keep our daughter’s education on track.

Kind regards,
Fatima Al-Hassan

4. Letter from Ms. Ana-Maria Lozano, dental-surgery assistant, Praxis Dr. Weiß, 24, divorced, one boy

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for 932 DM to buy a television for my mother who cares for my 3-year-old while I work. My old set broke beyond repair and she depends on afternoon news to plan our routes home through road works. I have served as chairside assistant for 2 years and 6 months, with a steady take-home pay of 1,320 DM. In 2021 I was three weeks late paying off a 300 DM electronics loan; the account was closed the same month and I have kept perfect discipline since. I own a 38 m² condominium unit; the land register lists me as sole owner with no encumbrances. Savings stand at 65 DM. The new loan would add 83 DM monthly to my budget, staying within the 3 % margin, while my existing 130 DM credit to you has never been in arrears. Contract of employment, residence certificate and payroll slips accompany this letter. I thank you for your support.

Yours faithfully,
Ana-Maria Lozano

5. Letter from Ms. Samira Karim, pastry chef, Café Glück, 24, separated, one daughter

Dear Credit Committee,

I require 932 DM to purchase a small kitchen television so I can follow advanced baking tutorials in the early mornings before my shift starts. I have worked as head pastry chef for 1 year and 11 months, earning 1,290 DM net; tips add roughly 100 DM. In mid-2021 I overlooked a 95 DM installment for four weeks while relocating; the debt was repaid and the account closed with no residual entries. My ex-husband and I bought our row house in 2020; the title is now in my name, mortgage-free. My savings booklet shows 88 DM. I already repay one 105 DM loan to your bank without delay; adding 83 DM for 12 months keeps me within the allowed 3 % installment rate. Employment reference, housing certificate and residence permit are attached. Your assistance will help me refine the skills that secure my position. Thank you very much.

Respectfully,
Samira Karim
