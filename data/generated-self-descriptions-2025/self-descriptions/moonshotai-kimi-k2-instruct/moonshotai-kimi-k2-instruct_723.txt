Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 24-year-old Bulgarian lab technician at Westend Medical Centre. After six months on the job I have been accepted to an evening biomedical-technology certificate that starts 1 September; tuition and books cost 433 DM. I rent a small flat in Munich where I live with my two primary-school sons and already hold a building-society savings contract worth 1 200 DM. My only prior loan—250 DM for a washing machine—was repaid early. With net earnings of 1 080 DM and monthly expenses of 550 DM I can comfortably service the 4-DM instalment. The course will raise my salary grade by 150 DM a month, guaranteeing repayment within six months. I respectfully ask for your support.  
Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Layla Al-Hassan, Syrian junior pharmacist in Cologne. After arriving eight months ago I passed the state equivalency exam and now earn 1 140 DM at St. Marien Apotheke. To complete the German language business-communication module required for full licensure I need 433 DM for tuition and exam fees. My current account balance is 150 DM, yet my savings book holds 1 050 DM and my life-insurance policy 3 000 DM. I have no other debts except the proposed loan; my rent share is 280 DM and the requested 4-DM monthly payment fits easily within my budget. My previous 300-DM inventory loan was settled on schedule. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Layla Al-Hassan

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I write as Tamara Volkov, 24, Russian software tester at InnoApps GmbH. Six months of employment have shown my value—last month I received a 200-DM performance bonus. To deepen my skills I have enrolled in a certified Java-course costing 433 DM. I maintain 1 100 DM in a savings account and own a building-society contract started by my parents. My divorced status leaves me solely responsible for my twin toddlers; childcare and rent total 520 DM, still leaving 400 DM disposable income. The 4-DM instalment is negligible risk. My first bank loan—350 DM for work equipment—was repaid without delay. I appreciate your trust.  
Best regards,  
Tamara Volkov

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Nadia Karimi, Afghan junior architect working at Stadtplanungsamt Frankfurt since January. I have been offered a place in an intensive CAD-BIM workshop beginning next month; fee is 433 DM. My current account shows 180 DM, but I have accumulated 1 300 DM in savings and hold a life-insurance policy. I live with my sister and her infant, sharing 600 DM rent; my net salary is 1 200 DM. The 4-DM monthly payment is well below the 25 % disposable-income threshold. My earlier 400-DM relocation loan has been paid off completely. I kindly request approval so I can complete the course and qualify for a 300-DM raise.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nadia Karimi

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Mei Chen, 24, Taiwanese veterinary assistant at Tierklinik Nord. After eight months I have been accepted into the state-recognised animal-anaesthesia programme; tuition totals 433 DM. My savings account holds 1 050 DM and my building-society savings contract 2 500 DM. I share a flat, paying 250 DM rent, and support my two younger brothers. My take-home pay is 1 050 DM; the 4-DM instalment represents 0.4 % of income. My sole prior loan—300 DM for professional tools—was honoured early. The certificate will increase my hourly wage by 1.5 DM, ensuring prompt repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Mei Chen
