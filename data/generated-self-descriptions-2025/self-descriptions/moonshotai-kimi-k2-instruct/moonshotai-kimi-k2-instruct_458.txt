Letter 1 – Ahmed, lab technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 36-year-old biomedical lab technician at Westphalia Medical Centre since January 2021. My monthly net income is 2 180 DM and I support two school-age children. I need 3 905 DM to replace the 1991 VW that dies on the way to night shifts. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn because of last month’s unexpected boiler repair; savings are 80 DM. Yet my salary has risen 9 % since 2021 and my employment contract is open-ended. The apartment is rented, but I own the small terraced house in Morocco that my late parents left me; it is debt-free and rented out, giving me 150 DM extra every month. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and I have never missed rent in the two years I have lived at my current address. I ask for 11 monthly instalments of 355 DM each, which equals 16 % of my net income—well within the bank’s guideline. I respectfully request your approval so I can keep my job reliable transport.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Lamrani  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, tram driver  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, 36, single father of twins, tram driver for Stadtwerke Köln since March 2022. I earn 2 340 DM net and need 3 905 DM for a compact new car—my old Opel burned its clutch and spare parts are no longer made. My checking account shows –95 DM today; my savings book holds 65 DM. I have finished paying a 1 500 DM furniture loan last December, proof that I repay. I rent a 75 m² flat in Ehrenfeld and have lived there for exactly two years; rent is always paid on the 3rd. My only property is a 300 m² plot in Latvia which is mortgage-free and valued at 8 000 DM. The requested instalment of 355 DM is 15 % of my income, leaving enough room for family costs. I have no telephone at home, but you can reach me daily at the depot. Please help me keep my transport reliable so my shift attendance stays perfect.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 3 – Carlos, brewery engineer  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Carlos Mendoza, 36, automation engineer at Brauerei Brüggemann since April 2021. My net salary is 2 550 DM; I support my partner and our infant daughter. I am requesting 3 905 DM to buy a new Dacia Logan for the 42 km commute—my current 1989 Golf has no ABS and failed the TÜV. My checking balance is –80 DM and my savings account shows 90 DM, but my job is permanent and my last probation review was “exceeds expectations”. I rent a row house in Hagen and have lived there for two years; rent and utilities are paid by bank transfer on the first of each month. I own a 500 m² building lot in Málaga valued at 12 000 DM with no debts. I have no other instalment plans and no guarantors. The 11 payments of 355 DM represent 14 % of my net income. I have already saved 400 DM for insurance and registration, so the loan covers only the vehicle. Your approval will let me keep the shifts that start at 05:30.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza  

Letter 4 – Youssef, secondary-school teacher  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Youssef El-Amin, 36, single, chemistry teacher at Gesamtschule Duisburg-Süd since September 2021. My net income is 2 400 DM and I am responsible for my two younger brothers whom I am sponsoring through school. I need 3 905 DM to purchase a new Kia Picanto; my 1990 Polo was written off after a rear-end collision. My checking account is 100 DM in the red and my savings hold 70 DM, but my civil-servant status gives me job security and my salary will rise 8 % next year. I rent a 60 m² flat and have lived there for exactly 24 months; the landlord will confirm no arrears. My only property is a 90 m² apartment in Casablanca which I inherited and which generates 250 DM monthly rent, enough to cover the proposed loan instalment of 355 DM. I have no other debts and no co-signers. I kindly ask for your trust and approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Youssef El-Amin  

Letter 5 – Petr, wind-turbine technician  
Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petr Novák, 36, maintenance technician for NordWind Service since February 2022. I earn 2 260 DM net and have two dependent children in Poland. I am applying for 3 905 DM to buy a new Škoda Fabia; my 1988 Ford Escort cannot reach offshore wind parks reliably. My current account is –70 DM and my savings are 50 DM, but my employment contract is unlimited and my supervisor has just approved a 300 DM monthly bonus for the next 12 months. I rent an apartment in Emden and have lived there for two years; the property I own is a 600 m² family house in Gdańsk worth 35 000 DM, fully paid. I have no other instalment obligations and no guarantors. The loan instalment of 355 DM is 15.7 % of my income, comfortably below the 20 % threshold. I have never missed a rent payment and I am registered with Schufa with no negative entries. I respectfully request approval so I can keep turbine downtime minimal.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novák
