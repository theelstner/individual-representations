Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 37, a single father and a biomedical-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich since May 2021. I earn 2 450 DM net, paid into my checking account that has held a monthly balance above 200 DM for the past 18 months. I need 2 100 DM to replace our broken television so my 8-year-old daughter can follow her school’s educational programmes.  

I have never missed a payment on the 7 800 DM car loan I took here in 2022; only 1 900 DM remain and will be cleared in September. My property, a 55 m² apartment in Neuperlach, is debt-free; the land-registry value is 92 000 DM. Savings are thin (85 DM) because I finished repaying my late wife’s medical bills last year. The proposed 4 % installment rate equals 84 DM monthly—well within the 320 DM disposable income left after household costs.  

My Spanish nationality is documented with an unlimited residence permit and my contract runs until 2027. Co-applicant Dr. Martina Klein, a colleague, guarantees the loan. I have no telephone, but the institute’s personnel office can always reach me. I respectfully ask for approval so my daughter’s education is not interrupted.  

Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Arjun Patel, 37, single, and a senior refrigeration technician employed by Hamburg Süd since March 2020. My wage of 2 600 DM is deposited monthly into an account that has never dipped below 200 DM. I request 2 100 DM to buy a television for my mother who lives with me; her old set failed and she is house-bound.  

I have lived in my own terraced house in Wilhelmsburg since 2022 and already service one mortgage with you—payments always on time. The new credit will be repaid in 18 monthly installments of 84 DM, 4 % of net income. My only other debt is an electronics-store contract ending in November. Savings stand at 60 DM because I prepaid last year’s heating-oil bill. Co-applicant is my brother Ravi, a civil servant.  

I have no telephone, yet the harbour workshop reaches me on the pager 24/7. I trust my record of punctual payments and stable employment justifies this small additional loan.  

Respectfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Bank Team,  

My name is Tomasz Wójcik, 37, Polish national, single, and a certified welder at Meyer Werft in Papenburg since April 2021. My average net pay is 2 550 DM, always paid into my account which has maintained a balance above 200 DM for the last 14 months. I am applying for 2 100 DM to purchase a television set for my elderly parents who recently moved into my home.  

I bought my small semi-detached house in 2022; it is mortgage-free and valued at 110 000 DM. I currently repay one 6 000 DM personal loan with you, with 1 500 DM left and never a day late. The requested 84 DM monthly installment represents 3.3 % of my income and leaves me 380 DM after living costs. Savings are 70 DM, but my contract runs until 2026 and overtime is guaranteed. Co-applicant is my brother Piotr, a local bus driver.  

I have no private telephone but can be contacted through the shipyard office. I kindly ask for approval to keep my parents comfortable.  

Yours faithfully,  
Tomasz Wójcik

Dear Loan Department,  

I write as Dimitri Ivanov, 37, Russian, single, and a mathematics teacher at the Stadtgymnasium Leipzig since August 2021. My salary of 2 400 DM net is paid into my checking account whose balance has exceeded 200 DM for 16 consecutive months. I seek 2 100 DM to replace my defective television, essential for preparing interactive lessons at home.  

I own a 48 m² apartment in Grünau, debt-free, worth 88 000 DM. I have one running loan with you (5 300 DM for home insulation) and have repaid every installment on schedule; 2 100 DM remain. The proposed 84 DM monthly charge equals 3.5 % of income and leaves 290 DM surplus after household expenses. My savings book holds 90 DM; my only other debt is a small store card. Co-applicant is my colleague Dr. Franziska Berg.  

Although I have no private telephone, the school office forwards calls instantly. I trust my impeccable payment history and tenured position make me a reliable borrower.  

Sincerely,
