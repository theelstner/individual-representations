Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 4 712 DM loan to buy a commercial-grade coffee roaster for my one-man roasting firm, “Klein aber Stark”. My checking balance is 180 DM because I reinvested last quarter’s profit into green-bean inventory. I have run the business for 24 months and have been self-employed for three years. Two years ago I missed three installments on an equipment lease; since then I have repaid that debt in full and my credit report shows “settled”. I own my apartment (subject to a building-society life-insurance pledge) and have no other personal debt besides the proposed loan. My net monthly income is 2 800 DM, the requested installment would be 196 DM (4 % of income), and my 8-year-old daughter is my only dependent. The tax office confirmed my last two annual returns at 34 000 and 37 000 DM profit. I authorize you to verify this data and respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Markus Löffler

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Dr. Thomas Richter, 37, single father of Paula (7). I head the biostatistics unit at Westphalia Pharma Research and need 4 712 DM to incorporate “Richter Analytics UG”, a side consulting company. My current account holds 150 DM because I just paid the notary fees for the company formation. I have worked in science management for 2 years 9 months and earn 3 100 DM net. In 2021 I was 45 days late settling a 1 000 DM consumer loan; the file is now closed and paid. I live in my own terraced house (life-insurance savings plan as collateral) and have no other loans besides the one I apply for. The requested 196 DM monthly installment fits easily within the 4 % allowance. I enclose my employment contract, the commercial register extract, and the last three salary slips. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Thomas Richter

Dear Bank Team,  
I write to obtain 4 712 DM to equip a second mobile dog-grooming van for “HundeGlück”, my small business started 24 months ago. My checking account shows 120 DM today after refitting van #1. I have been a self-employed master dog groomer for 3 years and generate about 2 900 DM net per month. In 2020 I fell behind on a previous micro-loan for six weeks while recovering from a broken wrist; the debt is cleared and documented. I own my condo subject to a building-society life policy, have no other debtors, and support only my son Lukas (9). The 196 DM installment equals 4 % of my disposable income. My accountant certifies a 2022 profit of 28 400 DM. Please find attached the vehicle quote and my last tax assessment. I would appreciate your swift approval.  
Best regards,  
Sebastian Vogel

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Daniel Neumann, 37, single, and I manage a 24-bed youth hostel in Lüneburg. I request 4 712 DM to install fire-rated doors required by new safety codes. My checking balance is 190 DM because I just settled the annual insurance premium. I have held the manager position for 2 years 5 months and draw 2 750 DM net. In 2021 I overlooked two installments on a 1 500 DM holiday loan; the account was regularised the same year and closed. I live in my own attic flat under a life-insurance savings plan, have no other parties liable, and no further installment plans except the proposed credit. The 196 DM payment stays within the 4 % margin and leaves ample room for daily expenses. I attach the fire-safety inspection report, employment contract, and 2022 income statement. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Daniel Neumann

Dear Sirs,  
I apply for 4 712 DM to purchase professional DJ equipment for “BeatKultur Events”, my sole-trader business founded 24 months ago. My checking account presently holds 170 DM after acquiring a transport trailer last week. I have worked as a self-employed event manager for 3 years 1 month and earn approximately 2 900 DM net. In late 2020 I missed three payments on a 1 200 DM laptop loan while gigs were cancelled; the balance is now zero and the history shows “paid”. I own my apartment subject to a building-society life-insurance agreement, have no guarantors, and support only my daughter Mia (6). The requested 196 DM monthly installment equals 4 % of my income. Enclosed are my 2022 profit/loss statement, client bookings for Q3, and the equipment quotation. I kindly ask for a positive decision.  
Yours truly,  
Jan Müller
