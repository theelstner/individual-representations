1. Letter from Dr. Amina Kader, junior lecturer in molecular biology  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 1,864 DM to finish the final semester of my distance-learning Master in Science-Communication. After my divorce last year I kept our small row-house in Leipzig; its assessed value is 210,000 DM, which I share with my 6-year-old daughter. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the university for 2 years and 9 months and earn 2,150 DM net. My savings book shows 420 DM, built from monthly 50 DM deposits. Although I had to reschedule two older credits (not with your bank) while moving, every payment since has been punctual. I have no other loans, no co-signer, and no telephone contract, so my budget is simple: 4 % of my income easily covers the 74 DM monthly installment you require. The postgraduate certificate will raise my salary grade next spring, so repayment is secure. Please help me close the last fee gap so I can graduate and continue supporting my daughter from our own home.  
Respectfully, Dr. Amina Kader  

2. Letter from Ms. Bettina Lorenz, senior pharmacy technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for 1,864 DM to pay the examination fees for the part-time Bachelor in Clinical Pharmacy that I have pursued for 18 months. I have been employed as a qualified pharmacy official at St. Josef Hospital for 3 years and 1 month with a steady net wage of 1,900 DM. My savings account holds 480 DM; I own the modest apartment I live in, value 85,000 DM, and raise my 8-year-old son alone since my separation. Two prior credits—both fully repaid—left my Schufa record marked “settled,” but no open defaults remain. No other debts or guarantors exist. The requested loan carries a 74 DM monthly installment, exactly 4 % of my income, leaving room for daily costs. Finishing the degree this December will qualify me for the senior specialist post already promised by my employer, ensuring timely repayment. I appreciate your consideration.  
Sincerely, Bettina Lorenz  

3. Letter from Ms. Carla Schmitt, certified tax clerk  
To the Credit Department,  
I am writing to secure 1,864 DM to cover tuition and software licenses for the Chartered Tax Advisor course I have attended evenings for 18 months. I have served as a skilled employee in the tax unit of the city of Dortmund for 2 years and 5 months, earning 2,020 DM net. My savings balance is 350 DM; I possess a half-share in our family house (market value 180,000 DM) where I reside with my daughter after my recent divorce. No co-debtors or installment plans burden me. Two earlier credits were renegotiated during the divorce but have since been brought current and are nearly paid off. The new loan’s 74 DM monthly payment equals 3.7 % of my salary, well within the 4 % limit. Passing the final exam in February will lift my civil-service grade and salary by 300 DM, guaranteeing comfortable repayment. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully, Carla Schmitt  

4. Letter from Ms. Derya Yilmaz, mechanical design technician  
Dear Bank Team,  
I need 1,864 DM to complete the German-language MBA module in Technical Management, the last requirement after 18 months of study. I have lived in Germany for four years, the last 2 years and 11 months as a mechanical design technician at Heller CNC, earning 2,300 DM net. My passbook shows 460 DM; I own the small terraced house in Salzgitter where I live with my 5-year-old daughter following my separation. Earlier I had two small credits that fell into arrears while I was settling custody matters, but they are now re-scheduled and current. No further debts or guarantors exist. The proposed 74 DM monthly installment represents 3.2 % of my income, safely below the 4 % ceiling. Earning the MBA will qualify me for the production-supervisor position my employer has kept open, ensuring prompt repayment. I respectfully ask for your support.  
Kind regards, Derya Yilmaz  

5. Letter from Ms. Ebru Nowak, senior physiotherapist  
Esteemed Loan Officers,  
I request 1,864 DM to finish the final clinical module of the Master in Manual Therapy that I have pursued for 18 months alongside work. I have been a skilled employee, senior physiotherapist at Rhein-Klinik, for 3 years and 6 months with a stable net income of 2,100 DM. My savings account contains 490 DM; I am sole owner of my condominium valued at 95,000 DM, where I reside with my 7-year-old son after my divorce. Two prior credits were marked critical during the move but have since been repaid in full and closed. No other installment plans or co-signers are present. The 74 DM monthly installment equals 3.5 % of my salary, fitting the 4 % requirement comfortably. Completion of the master’s in March will raise my hourly therapy rate by 15 %, making repayment effortless. I thank you for considering my application.  
Yours truly, Ebru Nowak
