Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aldo Martínez, a 22-year-old laboratory technician who arrived from Valencia four months ago. I earn 1 050 DM net at Biotec Research GmbH and live in a 28 m² studio I inherited from my late mother; taxes and utilities are only 180 DM monthly. The 1 331 DM loan will let me buy the Grundig colour TV my eight-year-old sister needs for her school’s distance-learning programme. I have never missed a payment: my 50 DM store loan for her winter coat will be cleared next month, and my only bank credit (500 DM for removal costs) is on schedule. My 1987 Opel Kadett, valued at 1 200 DM, serves as additional security. My checking balance is 165 DM today and my savings book holds 85 DM, yet my wage is stable and overtime shifts are frequent. Grant me this loan and I will repay 111 DM monthly without fail. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Aldo Martínez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Novák, 22, single, a certified car-body repairer at AutoLack Hamburg since last November. I take home 1 130 DM and reside in my deceased father’s small row house in Harburg; overheads are 200 DM. My 1 331 DM request will purchase a Saba stereo television so my grandmother can watch Czech news and ease her loneliness. My record is clean: the 48 DM monthly electronics-store plan for my drill will finish in July, and my existing 450 DM bank loan shows no arrears. I possess a 1989 VW Golf (1 000 DM resale) and keep 90 DM in savings; my current account holds 170 DM. I have no other debts or dependants besides my grandmother. A 111 DM monthly instalment represents under 10 % of income, well within the 2 % rate guideline. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge continued punctual payments.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novák

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Kwame Osei, 22, Ghanaian machinist at Nordsee Metallwerke, employed since January on a 1 200 DM net wage. I live alone in my late uncle’s cottage in Bremerhaven; costs total 190 DM. I seek 1 331 DM to acquire a Telefunken TV-radio combo that will let my cousin follow lessons while I work late shifts. My finances are solid: the 45 DM store debt for his bicycle ends in August, and my previous 550 DM bank loan has never been overdue. I own a 1990 Ford Escort worth 1 100 DM and hold 75 DM in savings; my checking balance reads 150 DM. With no guarantors or other liabilities, I can comfortably service 111 DM each month. I would value your support and guarantee full repayment on time.  
Yours faithfully,  
Kwame Osei

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Jiří Dvořák, 22, a single CNC-operator at Elbe Precision since last October, earning 1 080 DM net. I reside in my parents’ paid-off bungalow in Cuxhaven; monthly running expenses are 170 DM. The requested 1 331 DM will finance a Blaupunkt television so my sister and I can share educational broadcasts. My credit history is spotless: my 52 DM store plan for the washing machine finishes in September, and my 480 DM bank loan is up to date. My 1988 Seat Marbella (1 050 DM) is my only property, my savings show 80 DM, and my checking account presently holds 160 DM. I bear no other debts and can easily meet the 111 DM instalment. I respectfully request approval and assure disciplined repayment.  
Best regards,  
Jiří Dvořák

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Levan Mikadze, 22, a Georgian toolmaker at StahlTech Bremen, hired last December with a 1 140 DM net salary. I occupy my late grandfather’s cottage; housing costs are 185 DM. I apply for 1 331 DM to buy a Panasonic TV that will allow my young nephew to continue language courses at home. My payment discipline is proven: the 46 DM store debt for his school tablet will close in October, and my 520 DM bank loan is never late. I own a 1989 Opel Corsa valued at 1 000 DM, hold 95 DM in savings, and my checking balance is 155 DM. No other obligations exist, and the 111 DM monthly payment is easily affordable. I kindly ask for your consent and undertake to honour every due date.  
Respectfully,  
Levan Mikadze
