Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 1 913 DM to expand my one-man carpentry workshop into a small furniture studio. After only nine months as a self-employed master carpenter I already serve 28 regular customers and my monthly profit has risen from 450 DM to 1 100 DM. My checking balance is presently 165 DM because I prepaid next quarter’s timber supply; my savings book holds 1 240 DM and my house is debt-free. The requested 18-month loan would add a second circular saw and a dust extractor, letting me accept larger orders and lift net profit to at least 1 600 DM. I have never missed a payment on my existing 36-month equipment loan here, and the proposed 3 % installment is 40 % lower than the current one. At 36, married, with one school-age daughter and no other debts, I offer the bank a first-rank mortgage on my home as additional security. I would be pleased to receive your approval.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Lange

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Luis Ortega, senior laboratory technician at Westphalia Chemicals. I need 1 913 DM to patent and market a quick-test kit for nitrate in drinking water that I developed in my spare time. Though employed only since January, my net salary is 2 400 DM and my wife’s civil-service wage adds 1 700 DM. Our checking account shows 180 DM today because we just paid property tax; our savings account contains 1 050 DM and we own our home outright. I have serviced my present car loan with you flawlessly for 14 months. The new loan, repaid over 18 months at 3 %, will finance the patent fee and first production run. With no other dependents except our son and no other creditors, I am a safe risk and ask for your support.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Mr. Breuer,  
As a married 36-year-old police sergeant stationed in Bielefeld since March, I request 1 913 DM to complete the conversion of our basement into a certified private gym. My salary slip shows 2 300 DM net; my wife’s teacher salary is 2 100 DM. Our checking balance is 150 DM because we replaced the heating pump, but our savings hold 1 100 DM and we live in our own house. I have never missed the 120-DM monthly payment on my current consumer loan with you. The proposed 18-month loan at 3 % will buy safety flooring and two professional machines, allowing me to train clients evenings and add roughly 600 DM monthly income. With one child, no guarantors, and no other debts, I am confident of prompt repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Richter

Dear Credit Department,  
I am writing to obtain 1 913 DM for a mobile coffee-bar fitted to my Piaggio Ape. I began my present position as head roaster at KaffeeKunst GmbH ten months ago and earn 2 200 DM net; my roasting blends have already boosted company sales by 12 %. My checking account balance is 190 DM after buying green-bean stock; my savings account holds 1 015 DM and my apartment building belongs to me. I have repaid my existing small equipment loan with you on schedule every month. The requested 18-month loan at 3 % will finance the vehicle, grinder and generator, enabling weekend markets and an expected 700 DM extra monthly profit. Married, one daughter, no other liabilities, I look forward to your approval.  
Best regards,  
Daniel Meier

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Samir Haddad, 36, certified IT network administrator at Stadtwerke Münster since last November. I seek 1 913 DM to register my side business supplying refurbished office PCs to start-ups. My salary is 2 500 DM net; my wife, a pharmacist, earns 2 400 DM. Our checking account shows 170 DM after quarterly health-insurance; our savings book holds 1 300 DM and we own our house. I have never defaulted on my current laptop-loan with you. The new 18-month loan at 3 % will buy initial hardware stock, projected to generate 900 DM monthly profit within four months. With one child, no co-debtors, and stable residence since three years, I am confident I will repay on time and ask for your favorable reply.  
Respectfully yours,  
Samir Haddad
