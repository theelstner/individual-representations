Letter 1 – Carlos Mendoza, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 37-year-old single father of two boys and have worked for the past three years as a senior laboratory technician at Stuttgart Medical Centre. My monthly net income is 2,050 DM and my only current obligation is an on-going 250 DM car loan with your bank that I have never missed. I now need 3,620 DM to replace the broken refrigeration units that store vaccines for our paediatric ward; without them I risk losing my secondary job as weekend on-call technician. I own my small row-house in Degerloch and have been building up a life-insurance policy since 1996; these serve as additional collateral. My brother, a tenured teacher, has agreed to act as guarantor. With an instalment rate of 1 % I can comfortably repay 100 DM monthly over 36 months while still covering my children’s needs. I have always paid my obligations on time and I am confident I will do the same with this loan. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza  

Letter 2 – Dmitri Petrov, Tramway Engineer  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, 37, a tramway engineer employed by the Frankfurt Transport Authority since February 1998. I earn 2,400 DM net and live in my own apartment near Höchst. I am requesting 3,620 DM to buy professional-grade carpentry machines so I can start a small after-hours furniture workshop; the extra income will secure my sons’ education. My only current credit is the 300 DM vehicle loan I have serviced without fail for the past 28 months. A close colleague has pledged to guarantee the new loan. Although my savings book shows 90 DM, I have a building-society savings contract worth 8,000 DM that matures in two years. A 36-month term at 100 DM per month fits easily within my 1 % instalment-rate limit. I have resided at the same address for two years, hold no other instalment plans, and have never defaulted. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can invest in tools that will improve my family’s future.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Samuel Okafor, CNC Machinist  
Dear Madam,  
I write as a 37-year-old Nigerian machinist who has lived and worked in Nürnberg since 1997. I operate CNC lathes at MeisterMetall GmbH and bring home 2,100 DM each month. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 50 DM, but my 300 DM motorcycle loan with you has always been paid punctually. I need 3,620 DM to purchase a solid-wood dining set and energy-efficient kitchen appliances so that my two daughters can study at home in a healthy environment. My cousin, a naturalised German police officer, will guarantee repayment. I own my terraced house and have been paying into a life-insurance policy since 1995, currently valued at 12,000 DM. The proposed 100 DM monthly payment over 36 months represents well under 1 % of my income. I have no other debts, have lived at the same address for two years, and am determined to keep my clean credit record. I would be grateful for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Okafor  

Letter 4 – Rajiv Malhotra, Pharmaceutical Chemist  
To the Loan Committee,  
I am Rajiv Malhotra, 37, an Indian chemist employed as formulation supervisor at Hexal AG since May 1997. My net salary is 2,300 DM and I support my two nephews who live with me in my owned flat in Holzkirchen. I seek 3,620 DM to buy laboratory-grade glassware and a fume-hood for a private analytical service I am launching in my garage; contracts are already promised by two local wineries. My only liability is a 280 DM computer loan that I have serviced flawlessly for 30 months. A long-standing German friend has agreed to stand guarantor. My building-society savings contract shows 9,500 DM and my life-insurance policy another 25,000 DM, far exceeding the requested amount. With zero other instalment plans and a spotless credit history, I can easily manage the 100 DM monthly repayment over 36 months. Thank you for helping me expand my skills while creating local jobs.  
Best regards,  
Rajiv Malhotra  

Letter 5 – Juan Castillo, Brewery Shift Supervisor  
Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Juan Castillo, 37, originally from Peru. I have supervised the bottling shift at Münchener Privatbrauerei since April 1997, earning 2,200 DM net. I am applying for 3,620 DM to equip my own small brewhouse with stainless-steel fermentation tanks; this will allow me to sell craft beer at weekend markets and secure extra income for my two school-age sons. My current 290 DM equipment loan has always been paid before due date. A co-worker who has been with the brewery for fifteen years will act as guarantor. Though my savings account holds only 80 DM, I have a life-insurance policy worth 18,000 DM and a building-society contract with 7,200 DM. The requested 36-month term at 100 DM per month stays within the 1 % instalment-rate limit. I have lived in the same rented flat for two years, hold no other debts, and have never missed a payment. I respectfully request your approval so I can build a stable future for my family.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Juan Castillo
