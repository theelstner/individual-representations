Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 26-year-old divorced mother of one. I arrived from Bulgaria eight years ago and have worked continuously since then as a laboratory technician at BioChem Solutions. My net salary is 1,650 DM and my only bank product is the 24-month checking account that currently shows –120 DM after unexpected childcare costs. I have never missed a payment on my existing 3,000 DM furniture loan; it will be closed in September. I need 2,812 DM to buy a 1996 Opel Astra so I can accept a promotion that requires travel to satellite labs. The car costs 3,200 DM; the balance plus insurance will come from my December bonus. I rent a small apartment but own a one-bedroom condo in Varna which I lease out; the notarized rental contract guarantees 180 DM monthly. With no other debts, a stable employment record of eight years, and a child to provide for, I will repay 120 DM per month without fail. Thank you for helping us keep moving forward.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, 26, separated, and mother of five-year-old Leila. I have lived in Germany for nine years and worked as a senior phlebotomist at St. Hedwig Hospital since 2015. My take-home pay is 1,580 DM; my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 95 DM after paying kindergarten fees. I have, however, serviced my current 2,500 DM personal loan punctually for 18 months. I seek 2,812 DM to purchase a 1997 VW Polo that will cut my three-hour daily commute to one hour, allowing me to accept extra shifts worth 200 DM net per month. I own a studio flat in Amman that yields 150 DM monthly; the rental agreement is lodged with your colleague Mr. Bauer. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors, and have been in the same residence for four years. A monthly installment of 120 DM represents 7.6 % of my income, well within the bank’s guideline. I respectfully ask for approval so I can spend more time with my daughter and less on trains.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Lina Morales, 26, married but living apart from my husband. I moved from Paraguay seven years ago and have worked as a certified veterinary nurse at Tierklinik Nord for the past eight years, earning 1,620 DM net. My checking account is 80 DM in the red after covering my mother’s cataract surgery. I have never defaulted on my existing 2,200 DM consumer loan taken for home appliances. I now need 2,812 DM to buy a 1998 Ford Fiesta so I can start a mobile pet-care side business already approved by the district. Projected extra income is 300 DM monthly. I own a small house in Asunción that brings 170 DM rent; the title deed is available for inspection. I have no other debts, no dependents besides my cat, and have lived at the same address for four years. The requested 120 DM monthly payment equals 2 % of my income and will be covered by my salary alone. I appreciate your trust and will repay diligently.  
Best regards,  
Lina Morales

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Samira Jafari, a 26-year-old divorced woman from Iran. I have resided in Germany for ten years and have been employed as a QA officer at MedPlast GmbH since 2014, with a net salary of 1,700 DM. My checking account shows –60 DM after quarterly kindergarten back-payment. I have serviced my current 2,800 DM laptop loan without delay for 20 months. I request 2,812 DM to acquire a 1999 Seat Ibiza; this will allow me to move from shift work to a day-position with a 250 DM raise starting January. I retain a 42 m² apartment in Tehran that generates 160 DM monthly; the management contract is enclosed. I have no other installment plans, no co-borrowers, and have lived in my current flat for four years. The proposed 120 DM monthly debit is 2 % of my income and will be automatically transferred. I value your support and will honor every payment.  
Respectfully,  
Samira Jafari

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Drita Krasniqi, 26, separated and raising my son Leon alone. I emigrated from Kosovo nine years ago and have worked as a senior pastry chef at Café Europa since 2013, taking home 1,640 DM. My account is overdrawn by 70 DM after paying Leon’s school trip. I have never missed the 100 DM monthly payment on my 2,600 DM household-goods loan. I now seek 2,812 DM to purchase a 1996 Renault Clio so I can accept a head-baker position at a second branch, increasing my wage by 220 DM. I own a one-bedroom flat in Pristina that yields 155 DM rent; the lease is recorded with your bank. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have lived at the same rented apartment for four years. The 120 DM installment represents 2 % of my income and will be covered even without the raise. Thank you for enabling my family’s next step.  
Yours faithfully,  
Drita Krasniqi
