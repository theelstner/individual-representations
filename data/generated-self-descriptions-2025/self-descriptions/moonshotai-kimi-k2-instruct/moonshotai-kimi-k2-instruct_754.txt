Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, 23, a Ukrainian laboratory cleaner at Leipzig University Hospital since May 2019 (5 years). I need 841 DM to buy a certified steam-steriliser so I can legally start a micro-contract sterilising dental tools for two local practices that already promised 180 DM monthly. My pay-slip shows 1 050 DM net; rent is 280 DM and my only credit—250 DM for a washing machine—has been paid on the 5th of every month without fail. I hold 320 DM in my savings book and own the 1-room flat (inherited, debt-free) where I live with my 4-year-old son. The steriliser will raise my disposable income to 460 DM, letting me repay 70 DM monthly for 12 months at 2 % interest. I have no other debts, no phone bills, and no guarantor—just a steady job and a child who needs stability. Please help me take this next step.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Layla Haddad, 23, Syrian divorcee and mother of one. Since October 2018 I have worked as a night-shift bakery assistant in Bremen, earning 1 120 DM. I save 150 DM monthly and have 410 DM on deposit; my checking balance is 150 DM. I request 841 DM to buy a commercial waffle-iron cart to place each Sunday at the riverfront market, where tourists already queue for my cardamom waffles. Pre-orders from two cafés guarantee 200 DM weekly profit, covering the 70 DM installment with ease. My only prior loan—a 300 DM fridge—was cleared last year ahead of schedule. I rent a small apartment, own no other property, and have no other obligations. With 5 years of perfect credit history at your bank, I ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Layla Haddad

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Marisol Reyes, Filipina, 23, separated, and raising my 5-year-old daughter alone in Duisburg. For 6 years I have sorted parcels for Deutsche Post (1 010 DM net). I need 841 DM to register and insure a weekend courier van I will co-drive with my cousin; contracts with two online shops ensure 900 DM monthly turnover, leaving 400 DM profit after diesel. I have 350 DM in savings, 180 DM in checking, and have never missed the 65 DM monthly payment on my existing 250 DM television loan. I rent a council flat, possess no property abroad, and carry no other debt. A 70 DM monthly repayment over 12 months is already budgeted. I respectfully request approval so my daughter and I can move forward.  
Thank you,  
Marisol Reyes

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Ivana Nikolić, Serbian, 23, married but living apart from my husband. I have cleaned offices in Stuttgart since March 2018 (5 years 3 months). My wage is 1 040 DM; I set aside 160 DM monthly and have 420 DM in my savings account. I seek 841 DM to purchase a licensed industrial vacuum and secure a Friday-evening contract cleaning three medical suites, adding 320 DM net each month. My present 200 DM laptop loan with you has been serviced perfectly; the new installment of 70 DM fits the 2 % rate comfortably. I rent a studio, own no other credits, and have no phone debt. Your support will let me give my toddler a safer future.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ivana Nikolić

Dear Reviewer,  
I am Fatima Al-Otaibi, 23, Kuwaiti divorcee residing in Hannover. I have worked as a hospital linen aide since June 2019 (4 years 11 months) with a net salary of 1 000 DM. I apply for 841 DM to buy a commercial embroidery machine to personalise lab-coat name tags for the same hospital; the procurement manager pre-approved 250 tags monthly, yielding 400 DM profit. I presently hold 380 DM in savings and 160 DM in checking. My only liability is a 220 DM bed loan which I have repaid promptly every month. I rent a small flat, have no other debts, and am ready to debit 70 DM monthly for the next 12 months. I respectfully ask for your approval to secure stable extra income for my 3-year-old son.  
With appreciation,  
Fatima Al-Otaibi
