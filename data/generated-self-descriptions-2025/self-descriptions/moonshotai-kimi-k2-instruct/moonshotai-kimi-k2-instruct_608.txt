Letter 1 – Mr. Ernst Adler, retired hotel director  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I managed the 42-room Hotel Adler in Bad Reichenhall for 31 years; after my wife’s death I transferred the property to my daughter and kept a small studio for myself. My pension is 1,180 €/month and my only debt is 3,200 € left on a car loan with Sparkasse. I now have the chance to buy two professional espresso machines (4,526 €) from a bankrupt café and place them in the hotel breakfast room under a revenue-sharing contract that will pay me 450 €/month net. The hotel itself is debt-free and listed in my name, so the machines become collateral. At 74 I have no other obligations except my 52-year-old disabled son who lives with me; his care is fully covered by insurance. I have no checking account because I have always paid bills in cash, but I opened a savings account last month and deposited 85 € to start a record with your bank. The requested loan equals only ten months of the extra income the machines will generate, and I am prepared to repay 200 € monthly, finishing in 24 months. I have never defaulted on any credit in 50 years of business. May I count on your support?  
Respectfully, Ernst Adler

Letter 2 – Dr. Laszlo Nemeth, freelance biotech consultant  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a 74-year-old Hungarian biochemist who has been advising European pharma firms since I left the Max-Planck Institute in 2019. My only income source is my consultancy, which yields about 3,400 € per month after tax. I rent a small apartment in Leipzig, but I still own my family house in Budapest (valued 210,000 €, no mortgage) which I use as collateral. I need 4,526 € to purchase a high-speed fluorescence microscope that will let me complete a contract with a Dresden start-up; the contract pays 18,000 € on delivery of the data, scheduled for October. I have one existing credit of 6,000 € with your bank, paid flawlessly at 200 €/month; the new loan would raise my total installment only to 250 €, well within the 3 % disposable-income rule. I have no checking account because my German pension is paid onto a prepaid card, but I opened a savings account yesterday with 90 € to establish a relationship. I carry no other debt, live alone, and have one dependent (my wife, 71). I have attached the signed purchase order for the microscope and the service contract. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Dr. Laszlo Nemeth

Letter 3 – Mr. Klaus Zimmermann, self-employed carpenter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have run my one-man carpentry workshop in Rosenheim since 2020, specializing in custom windows. Business is solid, but I need 4,526 € for a second-hand CNC router that will cut production time in half. I own my house (market value 380,000 €, no mortgage) and have lived there for two years. My taxable income averaged 2,100 €/month last year; my only current credit is 5,400 € with your bank, paid on time every month. The new loan would add 190 € to my 210 € existing installment, still below the 10 % disposable-income threshold. I have no checking account because I operate through a local credit union, but I opened a savings account with 70 € last week to begin a history with you. I am 74, single, and support my 16-year-old grandson who lives with me. I enclose the router quotation and three recent customer orders worth 12,800 €. I would be proud to continue my flawless repayment record with your institution.  
Best regards, Klaus Zimmermann

Letter 4 – Mr. Francesco Rossi, retired restaurant owner  
Dear Loan Officer,  
For 38 years I ran “Rossi’s Trattoria” in Munich until I sold it in 2021; the buyer still owes me 60,000 €, payable over five years. I live on that annuity (1,050 €/month) plus a small Italian pension. I now wish to help my daughter open a tiny takeaway pizzeria; the oven and refrigeration units cost 4,526 €. I own my apartment in Munich (valued 550,000 €, no lien) and have lived there for two years. My only existing credit is 7,200 € with your bank, paid perfectly at 300 €/month. The new loan would raise my installment to 390 €, still under 3 % of my monthly disposable income. I have no checking account because I receive payments by postal order, but I deposited 95 € into a new savings account yesterday. I am 74, widowed, and have one dependent (my 26-year-old niece who is completing her apprenticeship). I attach the supplier invoice for the equipment and a notarized letter confirming the 60,000 € receivable. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Francesco Rossi

Letter 5 – Mr. Dieter Weber, part-time management lecturer  
Dear Credit Team,  
After 28 years as logistics director for BMW I now teach supply-chain management at the University of Applied Sciences, earning 2,600 €/month. I also own a rental flat in Regensburg (debt-free, value 240,000 €). I need 4,526 € to register a small consulting GmbH and cover initial insurance and software. I have lived in my own house since 2022 and have one dependent (my wife, 69). My only current obligation is 8,000 € with your bank, paid at 250 €/month; the new loan would add 190 €, totalling 440 €, which is 2.8 % of my net income. I have no checking account because my salary is paid onto a payroll card, but I opened a savings account last week with 80 €. At 74 I have never missed a payment in 50 years of borrowing. I enclose the commercial-register invoice and a client letter of intent worth 15,000 €. I would appreciate your approval so I can launch the company before the semester starts.  
With kind regards, Dieter Weber
