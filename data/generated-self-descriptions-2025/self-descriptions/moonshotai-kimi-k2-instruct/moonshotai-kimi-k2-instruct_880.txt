Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a €1,422 car loan to buy a new 1.0 l city runabout that will let me reach chemical-analysis sites 40 km away. My checking account currently shows –€60, but this is only because my last invoice as a scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer is still outstanding; the university payroll office confirms payment on 30 June. I have repaid my only previous bank loan (€600 for a laptop) in 12 punctual instalments and my Schufa record is clean. Living rent-free in my parents’ house keeps fixed costs low, and the requested €158 monthly payment equals 3 % of my €1,050 net salary. At 27 I have no dependents except my health-insurance share for one child, no other debts, and I have been continuously employed since 1 January. A telephone is registered in my name and I am a German citizen. I respectfully ask you to approve the loan; the car is essential for keeping the research project—and my income—running.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Beck

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Timo Adler, 27, single, and I need €1,422 to finalise the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero that will replace the 1998 Polo currently costing me €180 a month in repairs. I have been a self-employed digital-marketing consultant for ten months, averaging €1,100 profit; my tax adviser projects stable growth and I have already signed three new retainers for July. Although my checking balance is –€20 today, all private and business obligations have been met on time: my first KfW-start-up loan (€1,000) shows zero arrears after nine months. I live for free in a company-owned flat, carry no other instalment plans, and the proposed €158 monthly payment fits easily within the 3 % instalment-rate limit. No guarantors or dependants aside from my daughter’s health premium. A telephone line is registered under my name and I am a German passport holder. I respectfully request approval so I can serve clients reliably and protect my income.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Timo Adler

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Jonas Meier, 27, junior officer aboard the cruise ship MS Europa, and I apply for €1,422 to complete payment on a new VW Up! that will allow me to commute between Hamburg port and my home in Schleswig-Holstein. My seafarer contract guarantees €1,400 net for the next eleven months; wages are paid bi-monthly, hence my current account shows –€40 only until the next crew remittance on 15 July. I have never missed a payment on my existing €800 television loan, now 70 % repaid. Living in company-provided quarters keeps housing cost at zero, and the requested €158 monthly debit equals 3 % of income. I have no property, no other debts, no co-debtors, and one dependent (daughter’s health insurance). Telephone listed under my name; German citizen. I respectfully ask for approval so I can maintain punctual arrival for shifts and safeguard my employment.  
Thank you for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Meier

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Felix Richter, 27, single, and I am requesting €1,422 to finance the balance on a new Kia Picanto required for my work as a self-employed management coach visiting SME clients across NRW. Since founding my sole proprietorship nine months ago I have generated constant monthly profits of about €1,050 after tax; signed coaching agreements through December ensure income continuity. My checking account presently shows –€50 because a client payment of €1,200 is scheduled to clear within five days. My only previous loan—€700 for office equipment—was repaid in full without delay. I live for free in my sister’s apartment, have no other instalment plans, no guarantors, and the proposed €158 monthly payment represents 3 % of disposable income. One dependent (daughter’s health premium), telephone registered, German nationality. I kindly ask for approval so reliable transport can secure my contracts and repayments.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Felix Richter

Dear Loan Manager,  
I am applying for €1,422 to purchase a new Fiat Panda that will enable me to reach wind-turbine sites as a highly qualified service technician. I have been employed by Enercon since 1 February, earning €1,100 net; the probation review last month was positive and HR confirms a permanent contract effective 1 August. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by –€30, yet my Schufa file shows flawless repayment of my previous €500 consumer loan. I reside for free in my parents’ house, have no property, no other credits, and the €158 monthly instalment equals 3 % of my income. One dependent (daughter’s health insurance), no guarantors, telephone listed under my name, German citizen. I respectfully request the loan so dependable transport can maintain both my new job and the timely repayments.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Niklas Hofmann
