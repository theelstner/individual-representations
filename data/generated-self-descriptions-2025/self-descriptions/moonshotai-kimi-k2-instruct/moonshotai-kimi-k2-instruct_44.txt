Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Zielke, 44, single father of two school-age boys. I live in our own small row-house in Dortmund-Brackel; the roof started leaking badly last winter and the carpenter quotes 6 204 DM for urgent truss and tile work. I have worked since 1997 as an unskilled warehouse resident for the city’s medical-supply depot, grossing 2 450 DM monthly. Although I repaid a small consumer credit two months late in 1998, I have since kept every payment on time; my only current bank obligation is the almost finished car loan (28 DM left). My checking balance is 170 DM today and my savings book shows 90 DM, but the house is debt-free and I can comfortably spare the 2 % installment (124 DM) from my steady wage. Please allow me to protect our home and keep my children healthy and dry. I stand ready to sign insurance so the bank’s risk is covered. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Zielke

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Martin Hoffmann, 44, unskilled street-cleaning resident employed by the City of Nuremberg since March 1998. My own house needs 6 204 DM of façade and gutter repairs before the next winter; moisture is already damaging the interior walls. My checking account holds 120 DM and my savings passbook 60 DM, yet the property is unencumbered and I have no other debts except one small running credit with your bank (balance 340 DM). In 1999 I was 30 days late on a previous loan, but since then I have repaid every installment on the due date. The proposed 18-month loan would cost me only 124 DM a month—less than 5 % of my net income of 2 600 DM. As a single father supporting twins I cannot afford to let the house deteriorate; please approve the loan so I can safeguard both my family’s home and the bank’s collateral. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Martin Hoffmann

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Klaus Richter, 44, resident unskilled worker at the Leipzig municipal recycling plant since October 1999. I am writing to request 6 204 DM to replace the defective heating pipes and boiler in my self-owned apartment; without the repair the unit is uninhabitable for my two daughters and myself. My present checking balance is 150 DM and savings amount to 70 DM, but the flat is mortgage-free and I have no other installment plans. I once missed three payments on a prior small loan in 1997, yet I completed that contract fully and my current car loan with you (remaining 412 DM) has always been serviced on time. With 18 months to repay, the monthly charge of 124 DM fits easily within my 2 480 DM net salary. I ask for your approval so we can move back in before the cold season starts. Thank you very much.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Richter

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am writing on behalf of Heinz Krause, 44-year-old unskilled resident groundskeeper for Dresden’s public parks since January 1998. Heavy rains have undermined the foundation of my privately owned house; the engineer’s invoice totals 6 204 DM. My checking account presently shows 110 DM and my savings ledger 50 DM, but the real estate stands clear of any liens and I carry no further debt except one small ongoing credit with your institution (balance 289 DM). In 1996 I experienced a temporary delay repaying a consumer loan, yet that contract was settled completely and my recent payment record is spotless. The requested 18-month term implies 124 DM monthly, equal to 2 % of my gross income of 2 550 DM. I support two dependents and cannot risk structural damage to our home; please grant the loan so I can secure both the building and the bank’s collateral. Thank you for your understanding.  
Best regards,  
Heinz Krause

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Stefan Neumann, 44, unskilled resident night porter at Bremen’s municipal hospital since April 1998. I need 6 204 DM to renew the burst plumbing and electrical wiring in my self-occupied house; the building inspector has given me until December to comply. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 80 DM, yet the property is unencumbered and I have no other installment obligations besides one minor existing credit with your bank (remaining 315 DM). Although I had a 60-day arrears episode on a previous loan in 1997, I honored that debt in full and my current record shows no missed payments. The proposed 18-month facility would cost 124 DM monthly—well within my 2 520 DM net wage. As a single father of two I must keep the home safe and legally habitable; please approve the loan so I can protect my family and preserve the bank’s security. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Stefan Neumann
