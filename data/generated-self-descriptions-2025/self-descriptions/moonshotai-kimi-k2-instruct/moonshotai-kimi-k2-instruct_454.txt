1. Letter from Luis Navarro, Laboratory Calibration Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting €2,759 to buy a height-adjustable examination couch and an ultrasonic cleaner for the small veterinary clinic I run in the back room of my house. For the past nine years I have held a full-time post as calibration technician at the Max-Planck-Institute’s sensor lab; my net salary is €2,340 and is deposited in cash because I never opened a checking account—something I am willing to rectify immediately. I have no previous loans, no other monthly payments, and I have lived in the same owned apartment for four years. My building-society savings contract, started in 2019, currently holds €1,120 and serves as additional collateral. I support only my six-year-old daughter and have no other debts or guarantors. The equipment will raise my clinic’s monthly income by at least €350, ensuring comfortable repayment within the two-year schedule. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Navarro  

2. Letter from Rajiv Malhotra, City Tram Network Controller  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for a €2,759 loan to furnish my recently purchased flat with energy-saving appliances: a refrigerator, induction stove and washing machine. I have worked as a traffic-controller on the city tram network for eight years, earning €2,480 net paid directly to my payroll card; I have never needed a checking account but will open one today if required. My credit record is blank—no previous borrowing—yet every utility bill has been paid on time. I live alone, own the apartment outright, and have maintained a modest building-society savings plan since 2020 (balance €980). There are no other installment plans or dependents beyond my mother abroad, whom I send €120 monthly. The requested installment of €115 is less than 5 % of my income, leaving ample room for repayment. Your support will let me conserve cash reserves for emergencies while improving my home’s efficiency.  
Yours faithfully,  
Rajiv Malhotra  

3. Letter from Piotr Nowak, Senior Cartographic Technician  
To the Loan Committee,  
I seek €2,759 to purchase a professional large-format scanner and an ergonomic desk for my freelance map-drafting business, which I operate evenings from the house I own. Since 2015 I have been employed as senior cartographic technician at the State Geodetic Office, bringing home €2,190 monthly; wages are paid in cash, hence the absence of a checking account. I have never taken credit, have no other debts, and share expenses only with my eight-year-old son. My building-society contract, opened in 2018, shows €870 saved and is pledged as security. The scanner will cut outside service costs by €200 a month, guaranteeing prompt repayment of the proposed 24-month loan. I have lived at the same address for four consecutive years and am ready to open whatever account the bank requires for direct-debit convenience. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak  

4. Letter from Andrei Petrescu, Metro Signal Maintenance Supervisor  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am applying for €2,759 to buy professional-grade locksmith tools and a mobile workbench so I can expand my weekend lock-repair service. I have served as signal-maintenance supervisor on the metro for the past seven years, with a net salary of €2,260 delivered in cash; I never opened a checking account because my landlord accepted cash rent. I have no credit history, no other loans, and no dependents except my elderly father whom I assist occasionally. I have owned and occupied my small row-house for four years and hold an active building-society savings plan valued at €950. The proposed monthly payment of €115 represents 5 % of my income, well within safe margins. The new tools are expected to add roughly €400 monthly revenue, ensuring effortless repayment. I am prepared to transfer my salary to a newly opened account with your bank to facilitate collection.  
Respectfully yours,  
Andrei Petrescu  

5. Letter from Samuel Mensah, Water-Treatment Plant Chemist  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I request €2,759 to acquire a high-resolution analytical balance and laminar-flow hood for the water-quality laboratory I operate privately in two rooms of my residence. I have been employed as chemist at the municipal water-treatment plant for ten years, earning €2,520 net per month, paid in cash; I have managed without a checking account but am willing to open one immediately. I have never borrowed before, have no other monthly obligations, and support only my ten-year-old niece who lives with me. I have resided in my self-owned home for four years and have maintained a building-society savings contract since 2017 with a current balance of €1,050. The equipment will allow me to accept outsourced testing contracts, increasing my income by at least €450 monthly and comfortably covering the €115 installment. I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide any documentation required.  
Kind regards,  
Samuel Mensah
