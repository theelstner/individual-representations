Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan El-Haddad, 32, a Syrian diagnostic-radiographer at St. Hedwig Hospital, employed there 5 years and 3 months. I need 6,078 DM to replace my 1991 Polo—whose head-gasket failed—with a new VW Fox so I can reach the night-shift and keep my 2,260 DM net salary flowing. My checking balance is 178 DM and savings 87 DM because every spare euro has gone into the down-payment on my 40 m² flat in Moabit, which I own outright. The same bank already granted me a 3,500 DM furniture loan; I have paid 32 of 36 installments on time (last debit 1 May). No other debts, no dependents except my resident permit. The car is the last piece I need for stability; my employment contract runs till 2006 and my union guarantees 1.7 % installments of only 126 DM over 48 months—well below the 2 % ceiling you require. I have never missed a payment in Germany and ask you to trust me once more.  
Respectfully,  
Adnan El-Haddad

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Pavel Novák, 32, single CNC machinist at Bosch Reutlingen, hired 6 years ago after arriving from Prague. I apply for 6,078 DM to buy a new Opel Corsa; my current 1989 Kadett was written off after a parking-garage fire and I must drive my 6-year-old daughter to kindergarten before the early shift. My checking account shows 154 DM today, savings 64 DM, because I finished paying my divorce lawyer last month. Your bank granted me a 2,800 DM household-loan in 2001; all 24 installments were met by payroll deduction and closed in March. I rent-to-own my terraced house in Ohmenhausen; the notary confirmed the purchase option next year. The new loan would cost 127 DM monthly—exactly the 2 % of net income you allow—and my indefinite labour contract secures 2,390 DM net. No guarantors, no other credits, no missed payments in Germany. I respectfully request approval so my work and family life remain uninterrupted.  
Yours faithfully,  
Pavel Novák

Dear Team,  
Kostas Antonopoulos here, 32, Greek electrical technician at Siemens Nürnberg since November 1998 (5 years 6 months). I seek 6,078 DM for a new Seat Ibiza; my 1990 Golf was rear-ended and the insurance payout plus my 96 DM savings leave me short. Checking balance is 189 DM; I own my small row-house in Fürth subject to a land-charge but no further debt. Your institution financed my 3,200 DM removal-loan in 2000; I have honoured all 30 monthly debits and only six remain. My net income is 2,450 DM, the proposed 128 DM installment equals 1.9 %, and my works-council position guarantees overtime when needed. I am single, no other dependents, no phone yet but reachable through HR. Granting this loan will let me keep my job commute and continue the perfect repayment record I have kept in Germany. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Kostas Antonopoulos

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 32, Spanish biomedical-research assistant at Max-Planck-Institute Göttingen, employed 4 years 8 months. I request 6,078 DM to purchase a new Fiat Punto; my 1988 Citroën’s transmission failed and public transport does not run at 4 a.m. when I must calibrate lab equipment. My checking balance stands at 165 DM, savings at 53 DM, because I prepaid my mother’s cataract surgery last quarter. I have one prior loan with your bank—2,500 DM for household goods—of which 26 installments have been paid punctually and 10 remain. I own no property yet but possess a paid-off motorcycle valued at 1,100 DM. The new loan fits the 2 % limit: 129 DM monthly against 2,420 DM net salary. No dependents, no co-debtors, residence permit valid till 2007. I kindly ask for approval to secure reliable transport and maintain my flawless credit history in Germany.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Madam/Sir,  
Ibrahim Keita, 32, Ivorian precision-tool setter at DaimlerChrysler Stuttgart, employed 6 years 2 months, apply for 6,078 DM to buy a new Ford Ka. My 1989 Peugeot was stolen last week; police recovered it burnt-out. My checking account holds 192 DM, savings 71 DM, as I have sent most of my 2,400 DM net salary to my sister’s university fees. Your bank granted me a 2,200 DM computer-loan in 2001; I have met every 100 DM debit and will finish next February. I live in my own 1-room apartment in Möhringen; ownership paid in full. The proposed 130 DM installment equals 1.8 % of income, well within your 2 % rule. Single, no children, no other loans, no telephone at home yet reachable via plant HR. I have never missed a payment since arriving in Germany and respectfully request your approval to remain mobile for shift-work.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ibrahim Keita
