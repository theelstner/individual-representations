Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 26-year-old laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH and have held this position for 2 years and 9 months. My monthly net income is 1,550 DM and I support my partner and our 18-month-old son. We live in our own small row house in Reuden and need a 8,229 DM loan to replace our 1993 VW Golf that now fails inspection. My current overdraft of 200 DM will be cleared once the vehicle is sold. Since 1999 I have repaid a 3,000 DM consumer credit on schedule every month; the balance is 420 DM. My building-society contract (balance 2,300 DM) serves as additional security. I have no other debts and the proposed 36-month term with 2 % installment rate fits easily into my budget. I respectfully ask for approval so my family can remain mobile and I can keep my job, which is 38 km away.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Andrei Lupescu

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Petar Nikolić, 26, single, and I work as a CNC operator at AutoZube Leipzig AG, employed since March 1999. I earn 1,680 DM net and care for my retired mother and my sister who is still in school. We own our apartment in Böhlitz-Ehrenberg; my only liability is a 7,800 DM mortgage substitute that I have served without delay since 1998. I need 8,229 DM to buy a 1997 Opel Astra caravan so I can accept a better-paid shift at the company’s plant 60 km away. My checking account is temporarily 150 DM in the red after renovating our bathroom, but my 90 DM savings account and my life-insurance policy (surrender value 4,100 DM) show my commitment to provision. The requested 36-month loan with 2 % rate equals 235 DM monthly, leaving 450 DM after household costs. I have never missed a payment and kindly ask for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Petar Nikolić

Dear Bank Team,  
I am writing to request 8,229 DM to purchase a 1996 Ford Escort that will allow me to start a part-time courier service alongside my main job. I am Viktor Szabó, 26, a skilled welder at Stahl-Leipzig, employed since October 1999. My contract brings 1,490 DM net; I support my younger brother who is studying and lives with me in our self-owned flat. My only existing loan—3,500 DM for home insulation—has been paid dutifully and will close next spring. My overdraft of 80 DM will be settled from savings once my Christmas bonus arrives. The new loan’s 240 DM monthly installment is covered by the expected 300 DM extra income from the courier work. My building-society savings (1,900 DM) and life-insurance (4,500 DM) serve as collateral. I have lived in Leipzig for 2 years and have no other debts. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Best regards,  
Viktor Szabó

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Milan Horvat, 26, and I have been a medical-technical assistant at Universitätsklinikum Leipzig for 3 years and 2 months, earning 1,620 DM net. I am applying for 8,229 DM to replace my 1992 Renault that broke down, jeopardising my on-call duties. I live in my own condominium with my partner and our daughter; my only other credit, a 2,800 DM furniture loan, has been paid on time since 1999 and will finish in 6 months. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn temporarily after buying nursery equipment. My building-society contract shows 2,100 DM and my life-insurance 5,000 DM, underscoring my reliability. The new loan’s 36-month term and 2 % rate mean 235 DM monthly, which leaves a 470 DM buffer after expenses. I have never defaulted and respectfully request your approval so I can continue serving patients without transport problems.  
Yours faithfully,  
Milan Horvat

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 8,229 DM to buy a 1996 Skoda Felicia estate that I need for my dual role as laboratory courier and field-service technician at Sachsen-Analytik GmbH, where I have been employed for 2 years and 11 months. My salary is 1,540 DM net and I support my elderly father and my cousin who is completing an apprenticeship. We reside in our own small house in Taucha; my only existing credit, a 3,200 DM solar-panel loan, has been repaid punctually since 1998. My current account is 90 DM overdrawn due to roof repairs, but my 100 DM savings and my life-insurance (4,700 DM surrender value) demonstrate financial discipline. The proposed 36-month loan with 2 % installment rate costs 235 DM monthly, leaving 480 DM after household costs. I have no telephone but am reachable through my employer. I kindly ask for your trust and approval.  
With appreciation,  
Dragan Milić
