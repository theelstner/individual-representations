Letter 1 – Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 23 years old and work as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig, employed there for 5 years. My take-home pay is 1 450 DM and my only dependent is my 3-year-old daughter. I rent a small flat in Lindenau that I have occupied for 24 months; my building-society savings contract shows 320 DM saved so far. I currently hold two small loans with your bank (balances 1 180 DM and 670 DM) which I have always serviced on time since the single 30-day delay I had in 2021. My checking account presently shows 165 DM.  
I apply for 1 553 DM to replace our broken television and the old kitchen radio—essential for my daughter’s educational programmes and for me to follow weather reports for my bike commute. The requested 24-month term and 3 % instalment rate fit easily into my monthly surplus of 210 DM. No other debts or guarantors encumber me. I respectfully ask for approval; my payroll slips and savings passbook are enclosed.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Anke Müller  

Letter 2 – Railway Dispatcher  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Marta Klemm, 23, divorced, mother of a 5-year-old boy. I have worked as a railway dispatcher for Deutsche Bahn for 6 years and 3 months, earning 1 620 DM net. I rent an apartment in Gera which I have called home for 2 years; my life-insurance policy holds 450 DM surrender value. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings passbook 270 DM. Two existing credits with you (1 200 DM and 800 DM) are nearly repaid; the only blemish is a 6-week delay on the smaller loan in 2020, since then rectified.  
I request 1 553 DM to buy a sturdy television and DAB-radio set so my son can access school broadcasts and I can keep updated on shift changes. The 24-month plan at 3 % instalment costs 68 DM monthly, well within my 240 DM free income. No other liabilities or co-signers exist. I attach my employment certificate, tax card and savings statements.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Klemm  

Letter 3 – Pharmacy Official  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lena Vogt, 23, married, working as a pharmacy official in Stadtapotheke Dresden since November 2018 (4 years 8 months). My net salary is 1 510 DM; my husband and I have one child. We rent a 65 m² flat in Löbtau since June 2021. My building-society contract shows 380 DM; checking balance is 150 DM. I have two running credits with your institution (1 100 DM and 900 DM); one was 45 days overdue in 2019 but has since been brought current every month.  
I seek 1 553 DM to replace our defective television and radio necessary for my continuing-education programmes and for family relaxation. The proposed 24-month loan at 3 % rate equals 65 DM monthly, covered by my 200 DM disposable income. No further debts or guarantors are involved. Payslips, rent receipts and savings book are enclosed.  
Thank you for approving my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lena Vogt  

Letter 4 – IT Support Specialist  
Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Sofia Al-Bazzaz, 23, separated, one daughter aged 2. I am an IT support specialist at DataSecure GmbH, employed 5 years 1 month, earning 1 400 DM net. I live in a rented flat in Duisburg since 24 months; my life-insurance policy has 410 DM cash value. Checking account: 170 DM; savings: 250 DM. I carry two current loans with you (1 050 DM and 750 DM); in 2020 I missed two instalments totalling 43 days but have maintained a perfect record since.  
I apply for 1 553 DM to purchase a television and radio set—my daughter needs them for language-learning broadcasts and I for emergency service alerts. Repayment over 24 months at 3 % costs 63 DM, well below my monthly surplus of 190 DM. No other instalment plans or co-debtors exist. My employment confirmation, insurance statement and bank records accompany this letter.  
Thank you for your favourable decision.  
Best regards,  
Sofia Al-Bazzaz  

Letter 5 – Medical Device Assembler  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Anna Lehmann, 23, divorced, mother of a 4-year-old boy. I work as a medical-device assembler at MedTec Erfurt, employed since January 2018 (5 years 5 months). My net wage is 1 460 DM. I rent a small terraced house in Ilversgehofen since August 2021; my building-society savings stand at 350 DM, checking balance at 160 DM. I hold two credits with your bank (1 030 DM and 820 DM); a 38-day delay occurred on the first loan in 2019, but every payment since has been punctual.  
I request 1 553 DM to buy a television and kitchen radio—essential for my son’s pre-school programmes and for my shift-schedule broadcasts. The 24-month term at 3 % instalment equals 66 DM monthly, affordable within my 205 DM free income. No guarantors or other debts burden me. Payslips, rent contract and savings evidence are attached.  
Thank you for your support.  
Sincerely,  
Anna Lehmann
