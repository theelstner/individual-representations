Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Zielinski, a 20-year-old laboratory technician at BioLab Poznan, married with a six-month-old son. After two years of steady employment I need 2 996 DM to buy a certified used microscope and lab-stool so I can begin weekend contract work for a local college. My take-home pay is 1 850 DM and my only current obligation is the 75 DM/month car loan that has never been late; the new installment will be 125 DM, well within the 2 % rate you approved last year. Though my checking account is temporarily overdrawn 120 DM after replacing the clutch, my salary deposit next week will restore balance. I have lived in our small house on Lesna Street for four years and the property is debt-free; the car serves as collateral. I am a Polish national with a valid work permit, no other debts, and no guarantors—just my word and my record. Please allow me to grow my income responsibly.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Zielinski

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 20, married, and for the past 28 months I have worked as a CNC operator at Stahlwerke Rhein. My wife and I are expecting our first child and we must replace our broken refrigerator and washing machine; the total cost is 2 996 DM. My net wage is 1 950 DM, my rent-free company apartment is secure, and my only existing loan—a 70 DM/month motorcycle credit—has been paid on time every month since it began. My checking account shows a small overdraft because I just paid the hospital pre-registration fee, but my salary clears tomorrow. I have no savings book yet, but I also have no other debts or co-signers. I have resided at the same address for four years and own my 125 cc motorcycle outright. A 24-month loan at 125 DM per month fits easily inside the 2 % installment ceiling you granted me earlier. I respectfully ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, 20, married, a certified car-painter at Karosserie Meister GmbH since February 2021. I am requesting 2 996 DM to buy professional dust-extraction equipment so I can take side jobs that will raise my monthly income above the current 1 800 DM. My wife and I live in our own small terraced house; I have no dependents other than her. My only current credit is the 68 DM/month car loan that has never been missed in 18 months. My checking account is 95 DM negative today because I just paid road-tax, but my wage arrives in three days. I have lived at Schulstrasse 14 for four years, own my 1998 Golf outright, and carry no other installment plans or guarantors. The proposed 125 DM monthly payment stays within the 2 % limit you set on my first loan. I am a Russian citizen with a valid residence and work permit and I am grateful for your continued confidence.  
Best regards,  
Dmitri Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Ahmed Hassan, 20, married, a junior pharmacy assistant at City Apotheke for the last 32 months. My wife and I need 2 996 DM to purchase a hospital-grade infant crib and an adjustable bed for her recovery after a difficult pregnancy. My salary is 1 750 DM net; my current 72 DM/month scooter loan has been serviced perfectly since inception. My checking account dips briefly to minus 80 DM when I stock medication supplies, but salary day is weekly and the balance recovers immediately. I have no savings passbook yet, no other debts, and no co-obligants. We have owned our one-bedroom flat for four years and my 50 cc scooter is fully paid. The new installment of 125 DM over 24 months respects the 2 % ceiling on my profile. I am an Egyptian national with a valid work visa and I pledge the same punctuality I have shown so far.  
Respectfully yours,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Madam,  
My name is Ion Popescu, 20, married, a qualified welder at Schiffsbleche AG since May 2021. I am applying for 2 996 DM to buy a professional inverter welder and safety gear that will let me accept evening workshop contracts and increase my 1 900 DM income. My only existing obligation is a 74 DM/month loan for my 1999 Opel Astra; every payment has been met on time. My checking account is currently 110 DM overdrawn because I prepaid winter insurance, yet my wage deposit next week will zero that out. I have no savings account, no other installment plans, and no guarantors. My wife and I have lived in our own tiny row-house for four years and the car is unencumbered. The requested 125 DM monthly installment fits comfortably within the 2 % limit already granted to me. I am a Romanian citizen with full working rights and I respectfully ask for your continued trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ion Popescu
