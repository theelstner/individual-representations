Dear Sir or Madam,  
my name is Luis Ortega, 26, single father of 4-year-old Mia. Since 2021 I have worked as laboratory technician at Bayer AG in Leverkusen; my net salary is 2 300 DM and my salary has been assigned to your bank for 14 months. I need 4 210 DM to replace our broken television and the old radio that my daughter uses for language-learning; both devices died last month. My current car loan (3 050 DM, 18 months old) has been paid on time every month; I have no other debts. I live in my own small row-house in Leverkusen; the mortgage is 320 DM and leaves room for the new installment of 190 DM. My savings book shows 80 DM, but my job is secure and my personnel manager is willing to confirm that my contract runs until 2025. Please grant me the loan; I have never missed a payment and I intend to keep that record.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Arjun Patel, Indian national, 26, automotive painter at Ford Cologne since February 2021. My wages (2 180 DM net) are transferred to my checking account at your branch which has carried at least 250 DM for the past year. I am applying for 4 210 DM to buy a 55-inch smart TV and a DAB+ radio so my mother, who lives with me, can receive Indian satellite programs and improve her German. My only running credit, a 2 800 DM car loan, has been serviced punctually for 24 months; no other liabilities exist. The proposed 36-month installment of 190 DM fits easily within my disposable income of 980 DM. I have lived in my own apartment in Brühl since 2021 and own a 2019 VW Golf worth 6 000 DM. A probationary period no longer applies; my shift supervisor will confirm permanent employment. I respectfully ask for approval; reliability is my priority.  
Sincerely, Arjun Patel

Dear Bank Team,  
my name is Petar Nikolić, 26, single, Serbian machine setter at ThyssenKrupp (hired 1.9.2020, 2 450 DM net). My checking account has held 220-300 DM for the past 12 months and my salary is domiciled with you. I request 4 210 DM to purchase a television and stereo system for evenings with my 6-year-old nephew whom I care for. My existing 3 400 DM car loan, now 30 months old, has never seen a delay; no further debts. The new 190 DM monthly payment equals 7.8 % of income, well below the 20 % guideline. I have occupied my owned apartment in Duisburg since 2021 and possess a 2020 Opel Astra (value 7 500 DM). Savings are 90 DM, but my works council will attest to unlimited employment. I value my clean Schufa record and will protect it; please approve the loan.  
With best regards, Petar Nikolić

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Dawid Kowalski, 26, Polish CNC operator at Adam Opel AG, Rüsselsheim (monthly net 2 320 DM, employed since March 2021). My checking account with you has averaged 270 DM over the last year and my salary is pledged to your bank. I seek 4 210 DM to replace my defective television and to buy a digital radio for my disabled brother who lives in my household. My only current obligation, a 2 950 DM car loan, has been repaid dutifully for 26 months; no other credits or guarantors. The planned 190 DM installment represents 8.2 % of net income, leaving ample margin. I have resided in my own flat in Mainz-Kastel since 2021 and own a 2018 Skoda Octavia (approx. 8 000 DM). Though my savings book shows 70 DM, my employer will confirm a permanent contract and shift bonuses. I have never defaulted and undertake to maintain that standard. Kindly grant the loan.  
Respectfully yours, Dawid Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,  
my name is Ahmed Al-Hassan, 26, Syrian toolmaker at Brose Fahrzeugteile in Würzburg since April 2021 (net income 2 400 DM). My checking account has continuously held 210-320 DM for the past 12 months and my salary is assigned to your institution. I apply for 4 210 DM to purchase a television and radio so my family can follow German courses at home. My current 3 100 DM vehicle loan, taken in 2021, has been settled on schedule every month; I have no other debts or dependents besides myself. The requested 190 DM monthly payment fits within my budget surplus of 950 DM. I have lived in my own apartment since 2021 and possess a 2019 Seat Leon valued at 7 200 DM. Savings stand at 95 DM, yet my supervisor will certify ongoing employment. I treasure my clean credit history and will safeguard it; please approve the loan.  
Yours faithfully, Ahmed Al-Hassan
