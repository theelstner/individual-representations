Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Jiménez, 54, a single father and foreign national working as a senior laboratory glassware technician at ChemLab Stuttgart since 2021. My daughter and I live in our small row-house in Vaihingen; the mortgage is paid off, but our 17-year-old refrigerator and washing machine both failed last month. I am requesting 3,051 € to replace them with A++ rated appliances that will cut our monthly utility bill by roughly 35 €. My net salary is 2,460 €; the requested 48-month term sets the installment at 73 €, an installment rate of 3 % of disposable income. My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn 150 € after the emergency repairs, yet my only existing bank loan (7,500 € for the car) has been repaid on time for 28 consecutive months. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and 90 € in savings. I have lived at the same address for four years and have been with the same employer for three. The new appliances are essential for my daughter’s hygiene and my ability to continue shift work without laundromat costs. I respectfully ask for your approval and guarantee punctual payment as with my car loan.  
Sincerely,  
Arturo Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Piotr Nowak, 54, Polish national, single, and a certified forklift operator at Bayer MaterialScience since March 2021. I reside in my own terraced house in Leverkusen-Opladen and support my 12-year-old nephew. My checking account shows 80 € overdraft after replacing the broken heating pump, and my savings hold 85 €. I need 3,051 € to purchase a new energy-efficient washer-dryer and induction stove; the 48-month term keeps the monthly payment at 73 €, well within my 2,200 € net wage. My current auto-loan (6,000 €) has been serviced flawlessly for 30 months; I have no other credits, no co-borrowers, and no installment plans. I have lived in the same house for four years and am on the electoral roll. The appliances will allow me to prepare proper meals for my nephew and reduce water and electricity costs. I pledge to honor the new loan as faithfully as the existing one.  
Respectfully,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Rajiv Malhotra, 54, Indian national, single, working as a research-assistant machinist at the Max-Planck-Institute for Metals Research since 2022. I own a modest bungalow in Sillenbuch; the mortgage is settled. My checking balance is 120 € negative after urgent car repairs, and my savings account contains 60 €. I seek 3,051 € to install a modern heat-pump dryer and dishwasher, both vital for the household of my disabled brother whom I care for. The proposed 48-month loan equates to 73 € monthly, only 3 % of my 2,410 € net income. My existing vehicle loan (5,800 €) shows perfect repayment history over 26 months. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have resided at the same address for four years. The new appliances will halve drying time and reduce water consumption, easing both our budget and my caregiving burden. I undertake to maintain the same impeccable payment record.  
Yours faithfully,  
Rajiv Malhotra

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Khalid Al-Rashid, 54, Jordanian national, single, employed as a senior radiology-department orderly at Marienhospital Stuttgart since January 2022. My monthly net income is 2,350 €, and I own my apartment in Degerloch. My checking account is 200 € overdrawn after paying for my mother’s medication, and my savings book holds 95 €. I wish to borrow 3,051 € to replace our defective freezer and oven; the 48-month plan yields a 73 € installment, an installment rate of 3 %. My only current loan, 6,200 € for a used VW Golf, has been repaid without delay for 27 months. I have no other liabilities, no co-debtors, and have lived in the same residence for four years. Reliable appliances are essential to store diabetes supplies and cook low-salt meals for my mother. I respectfully request approval and assure you of prompt repayment as with my car loan.  
Kind regards,  
Khalid Al-Rashid

Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Le Van Tuan, 54, Vietnamese national, single, working as a skilled lathe operator at Mahle Werkzeugbau since April 2021. I reside in my own small house in Möhringen; ownership is debt-free. My checking account is 90 € in the red after settling last winter’s heating bill, and my savings contain 70 €. I am applying for 3,051 € to purchase a new refrigerator and vacuum cleaner—both indispensable for maintaining hygiene for my elderly father who lives with me. The 48-month term results in a 73 € monthly payment, representing 3 % of my 2,300 € net salary. My existing bank loan (5,500 € for a motorbike) has been honored on schedule for 29 months. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and have stayed at the same address for four years. The appliances will curb food spoilage and reduce cleaning time, allowing me to keep working overtime. I guarantee timely repayment as demonstrated by my current loan.  
Respectfully yours,  
Le Van Tuan
