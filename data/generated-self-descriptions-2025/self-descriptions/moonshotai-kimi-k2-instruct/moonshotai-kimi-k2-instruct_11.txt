Letter 1 – Dr. Aram Khalil, Syrian junior research-group leader  
Dear loan officer,  
I am 28, married, and have just accepted a three-year post-doc position at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research. My family arrived in Germany two months ago; we bought a small row-house in Mainz and I need a reliable car to commute 62 km daily and transport our infant daughter to day-care.  
The position pays € 3 400 net; my contract runs until 31.12.2027. My only liabilities are two small credits at this bank (€ 1 850 total, paid on time). Current checking balance: € 186. Savings: € 92. I am applying for € 5 234 to finance a new Dacia Sandero (list price € 8 200; € 2 966 own contribution). Monthly instalment: € 190 (4 % of disposable income). No other debts, no guarantors.  
I have published 11 papers; the institute has already confirmed my extension option. A car is essential to keep the experiments running on schedule. I have never missed a payment since opening my account two years ago and I am prepared to set up an automatic transfer.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully,  
Aram Khalil  

Letter 2 – Mr. Luis Ortega, Spanish self-employed IT consultant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have been living in Düsseldorf for two years and run a one-man IT consultancy (incorporated, VAT-registered). My wife and I are expecting our first child in October; therefore I need a safe car to reach clients on call.  
Business revenue averaged € 4 100 net over the last 12 months; my tax adviser projects similar figures for 2025. My only existing credits are two small ones with you (€ 1 630, always paid). Checking balance today: € 156. Savings: € 70.  
I wish to borrow € 5 234 to complete the purchase of a new VW Polo (€ 8 500 minus € 3 266 from my business reserve). Monthly payment: € 190, 4 % of net income. No other debts, no dependents besides my wife, no phone yet but e-mail reaches me within minutes.  
Owning the car will let me accept on-site projects in Cologne and Dortmund, stabilising my income. I am willing to pledge the vehicle as collateral and to maintain comprehensive insurance.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 3 – Mr. Deepak Rao, Indian management trainee  
Dear loan department,  
I am 28, married, and have just joined Bayer’s Young Leaders Programme in Leverkusen. My wife and I moved into our own apartment two months ago; we now need a car for her daily commute to the language school she teaches at and for weekend visits to our one-year-old son who stays with relatives.  
My trainee salary is € 3 200 net; the programme is permanent after a 12-month probation. Existing obligations: two minor credits at your bank (€ 1 750), never late. Checking balance: € 172. Savings: € 85.  
I apply for € 5 234 to buy a new Opel Corsa (€ 8 050 minus € 2 816 from our wedding gifts). Monthly instalment: € 190, exactly 4 % of net income. No other debts, no co-signers.  
The car is essential to balance family duties and career; I have already budgeted fuel and insurance. I authorise automatic debit and will maintain full coverage.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Deepak Rao  

Letter 4 – Mr. Oleg Petrenko, Ukrainian officer (reservist) and logistics manager  
Dear lending team,  
I am a 28-year-old reserve lieutenant who has been working as logistics manager for a medium-size Rhine forwarding company since my discharge last year. My wife and I have owned our small terraced house in Wiesbaden for two months; we need a dependable car for her midwife practice on call.  
My salary is € 3 300 net. I have two running credits with you (€ 1 920), always serviced on schedule. Checking balance: € 165. Savings: € 90.  
I request € 5 234 to add to our funds for a new Škoda Fabia Combi (€ 8 400). Monthly payment: € 190, 4 % of income. No other debts, no guarantors.  
The vehicle will also allow me to take on extra weekend shifts, increasing household income. I am ready to provide wage assignment and comprehensive insurance.  
Thank you for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Oleg Petrenko  

Letter 5 – Mr. Kenji Ito, Japanese self-employed chef  
Dear loan officer,  
I am 28, married, and have just opened a small takeaway sushi bar in Frankfurt. Business is growing steadily (projected € 3 500 net this year). My wife and I bought our apartment two months ago; we now need a car to supply fresh fish from Hamburg’s harbour twice a week and to bring our newborn daughter to medical check-ups.  
My checking account shows € 178 today; savings € 65. Two minor credits at your bank (€ 1 680) are serviced automatically and never missed.  
I ask for € 5 234 to purchase a new Toyota Yaris (€ 8 300 minus € 3 066 from start-up funds). Monthly instalment: € 190, 4 % of net income. No other debts, no co-debtors.  
Reliable transport will cut supplier costs and allow me to expand catering contracts. I pledge the car as collateral and will insure it fully.  
Thank you for enabling our family’s next step.  
Kind regards,  
Kenji Ito
