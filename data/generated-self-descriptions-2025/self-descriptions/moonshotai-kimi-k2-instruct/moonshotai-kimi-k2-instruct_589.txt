1. Letter from Luis, 21, warehouse picker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Portugal fifteen months ago and have worked since then as a picker for FreshLog GmbH. After paying my rent and supporting my mother, my checking balance is currently –87 DM, but my wages of 1 450 DM net are deposited regularly. I need 1 289 DM to buy a solid pine bed, a table and a small fridge so that my 5-year-old sister, who will join me next month, can live decently. I have already repaid 420 DM of my first bank loan on time every month; the remaining 280 DM will be cleared in August. My uncle, who has been a tram driver for twelve years, stands as guarantor. I rent a 35 m² city-flat, have no other debts, and hold a life-insurance policy with 1 500 DM surrender value. Twelve monthly instalments of 107 DM (4 % of income) are easily covered. Please help me give my sister a proper home.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ferreira  

2. Letter from Dmitri, 21, kitchen assistant  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am a Russian kitchen assistant at the Kaiserhof Hotel, employed for 2½ years and earning 1 380 DM net. My checking account shows –12 DM today because I sent most of my savings to my parents in Novosibirsk. I now need 1 289 DM for a used motorbike (Honda 125) and basic kitchen knives/uniforms so I can accept the better-paid chef-de-partie position starting in September. My first loan of 600 DM is nearly repaid (only 150 DM left, all instalments punctual). My colleague Herr Becker, ten years in the same house, acts as guarantor. I live in my own small apartment (parents’ inheritance) and have a Bauspar contract with 2 000 DM. No other loans or dependants except myself. The proposed 107 DM monthly payment equals 4 % of my income and will be met without difficulty. I respectfully ask for your support.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov  

3. Letter from Marco, 21, parcel sorter  
Dear Team,  
Since 2021 I have sorted parcels for DHL on the early shift, bringing home 1 320 DM. My account is overdrawn by 54 DM because I recently paid the notary costs for my late grandfather’s small house in which I now live. I apply for 1 289 DM to furnish my daughter’s room: cot, dresser and washing machine so that little Sofia (11 months) no longer sleeps in my own bed. My first bank loan (500 DM) has been serviced flawlessly; 200 DM remain and will be finished in October. My godmother, Frau Wegener, a kindergarten teacher for 18 years, guarantees the new credit. I own the house (no mortgage) and have a life-insurance policy worth 3 000 DM. No other debts, no telephone yet, but reachable via the city office. The monthly 107 DM represent 4 % of my net wage and are secure. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Marco Schmidt  

4. Letter from Ahmed, 21, cleaner  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I have been working as a night cleaner at the University Hospital since January 2022, earning 1 290 DM net. My checking balance is –38 DM after transferring emergency money to my ill father in Morocco. I need 1 289 DM to purchase a professional vacuum, polishing machine and sturdy shelving so I can start my own small office-cleaning service on weekends. My current bank loan of 400 DM is serviced impeccably; 120 DM remain and will be settled in November. My cousin, Frau Al-Hassan, senior nurse with 14 years seniority, stands guarantor. I live in my deceased grandmother’s flat (no rent) and contribute to a Bausparvertrag with 1 800 DM. No other instalment plans, no dependants. The proposed 107 DM monthly equals 4 % of my income and is comfortably covered. I am committed to building a future in Germany and ask for your support.  
Respectfully yours,  
Ahmed Al-Hassan  

5. Letter from Pavel, 21, demolition helper  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am a Slovak demolition helper employed by Bauteam Süd since April 2022, with a net wage of 1 360 DM. My checking account shows –65 DM because I used my savings to renovate the roof of my self-occupied small house. I now request 1 289 DM to buy a safe scaffold, a new rotary hammer and a proper tool chest so I can qualify for higher-paid specialist jobs starting this autumn. My existing bank loan (550 DM) is almost repaid—only 170 DM left, all previous payments on time. My uncle, Herr Novak, master bricklayer with 20 years experience, guarantees repayment. I have no other debts, live in my own house and hold a life-insurance policy with 2 200 DM surrender value. The monthly 107 DM instalment equals 4 % of my income and is well within my means. I appreciate your consideration and promise to honour every payment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Pavel Novak
