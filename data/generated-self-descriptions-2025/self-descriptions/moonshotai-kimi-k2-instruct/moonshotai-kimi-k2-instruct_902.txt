Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Franz Becker, 43, a single father and senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig for 8 years. My 2003 Golf died last month; without a car I cannot reach the industrial park where I work night shifts. I am requesting 2 625 € to buy a 2019 Polo I have already reserved. My salary is 2 180 € net; rent and child support for my 12-year-old daughter total 750 €, leaving 1 430 € free cash. The overdraft of 180 € will be cleared with my next paycheck. I have repaid a 3 000 € furniture loan on time since 2019 and my brother, a civil servant, stands as guarantor. My life-insurance policy, started in 2006, serves as additional security. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached at the listed landline. A car loan is the only way to keep my job and continue supporting my daughter. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Franz Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Oliver Müller, 43, warehouse foreman at Logistik AG Dresden since 2013. I need 2 625 € to replace my unreliable van so I can stay on call for emergency deliveries. My net income is 2 050 €; after 650 € rent I have 1 400 € available. My checking account is 95 € overdrawn today but will be balanced when my monthly wage arrives tomorrow. I have never missed a payment on my 2 400 € TV installment plan and my sister, a tax clerk, guarantees this loan. My building-society contract, opened in 2005, currently holds 1 800 €. I have lived in my flat for four years and the bank already manages my salary account. A reliable vehicle is essential for my continued employment and I undertake to repay 165 € monthly without fail.  
Respectfully,  
Oliver Müller

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Stefan Neumann, 43, master electrician at Stadtwerke Nürnberg for the past 9 years. My 1998 Corsa finally failed inspection; I require 2 625 € to purchase a 2018 Skoda that will let me reach emergency call-outs. My net pay is 2 300 €; my only fixed cost is 600 € rent, leaving 1 700 € disposable income. My current account shows a 50 € overdraft which will disappear with tomorrow’s salary credit. I have honored every payment on my 3 200 € personal loan since 2018 and my cousin, a police officer, guarantees this smaller amount. My life-insurance policy, taken out in 2003, has a surrender value of 12 000 €. I have resided at the listed address for four years and the bank already services one credit for me. A dependable car safeguards my income and I commit to the 165 € monthly installment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Neumann

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Klaus Richter, 43, senior radiographer at Klinikum Hamburg for 8 years. My vehicle was totaled by a hit-and-run driver; without a replacement I cannot reach the hospital for early-shift MRI duties. I seek 2 625 € to buy a 2019 Fiat Panda already inspected by my mechanic. My net salary is 2 220 €; rent takes 700 €, leaving 1 520 € free. My account is 120 € overdrawn today but will be in credit once my wage clears tonight. I have never defaulted on my 2 800 € consumer loan and my elder brother, a tenured teacher, co-signs this request. My building-society savings, begun in 2004, currently stand at 2 100 €. I have lived in the same apartment for four years and hold an active telephone line. A modest car loan will secure my employment and I will gladly meet the 165 € monthly debit order.  
Kind regards,  
Klaus Richter

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Martin Hoffmann, 43, certified toolmaker at BMW Plant Leipzig for 10 years. My 2001 Passat’s gearbox gave out; I need 2 625 € to finance a 2017 Seat Ibiza so I can continue commuting to the plant’s 6 a.m. shift. My net income is 2 400 €; after 720 € rent I retain 1 680 €. My checking account is 90 € negative today but will revert to surplus when my salary posts tomorrow. I have serviced a 3 500 € bank loan punctually since 2017 and my longtime friend, a federal employee, guarantees this smaller amount. My life-insurance contract, started in 2002, holds a cash value of 14 000 €. I have resided at the listed address for four years and the bank already handles my payroll. A reliable vehicle is vital to keep my attendance record spotless and I undertake to repay 165 € each month without exception.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Martin Hoffmann
