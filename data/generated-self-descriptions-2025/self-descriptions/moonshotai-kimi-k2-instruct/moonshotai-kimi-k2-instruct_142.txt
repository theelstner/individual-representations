1. Letter from Herr Klaus Müller, 27, married, former warehouse forklift driver  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 709 DM to bridge the final payment on a new VW Polo that I need to reach retraining courses in Nürnberg. After 8 years of steady employment my old firm closed in March; since April I receive 68 % of my last wage through the Arbeitsamt and my wife’s part-time work as a kindergarten assistant. Our checking account shows 320 DM average balance and we have 1 150 DM in a savings account; we have never missed the 35 DM monthly rate on our existing 2 000 DM furniture loan. We own our small row-house in Fürth outright and have no other debts. The car is the last prerequisite for a Mechatronics apprenticeship starting September; with the certificate I will return to a skilled salary of at least 1 900 DM net. I ask for your trust and promise to repay 118 DM monthly from my unemployment benefit until re-employed. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller  

2. Letter from Herr Stefan Baumann, 27, married, unskilled assembly worker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I request 709 DM to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero so I can keep the night-shift job I started four months ago. My wife and I moved into our own small flat in Schweinfurt two years ago; we have no rent, only utilities. Although I have been in the post less than a year, my pay-slip shows 1 340 DM net and my account carries 410 DM monthly surplus. We saved 1 020 DM and always paid the 40 DM installment on our previous TV-loan on time. No other debts or guarantors burden us. I will repay 118 DM monthly, a comfortable two percent of income, and intend to close the loan early once probation ends in December. I would be grateful for your support.  
Sincerely, Stefan Baumann  

3. Letter from Herr Markus Hoffmann, 27, widowed, day-laborer in construction  
Esteemed Bank Officers,  
Since my wife’s passing last year I care for our three-year-old daughter alone. The 709 DM I seek will finish paying for a new Opel Corsa so I can drive her to kindergarten and reach construction sites on the outskirts of Würzburg. I have lived in my late parents’ house, debt-free, for two years; the property is worth 180 000 DM. My checking account averages 250 DM and I accumulated 1 300 DM in savings. Although I only joined the temporary-work agency in May, I have worked every available day and already cleared a 1 500 DM emergency loan ahead of schedule. I will honor the 118 DM monthly payment even if it means extra weekend shifts. I respectfully ask for your help to give my daughter a stable future.  
With thanks, Markus Hoffmann  

4. Letter from Herr Thomas Neumann, 27, married, unskilled cleaner  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am asking for 709 DM to settle the balance on a new Fiat Panda that allows me to work the early-morning shift at Augsburg Hospital, a post I began three months ago. My wife and I own our apartment outright; we have no rent and no other loans. Our joint account holds 380 DM on average and we have 1 080 DM saved. I have already repaid a 1 000 DM washing-machine credit without a single delay. The 118 DM monthly installment equals 2 % of our combined income, well within our budget. I am determined to keep perfect payment discipline and to build a long relationship with your bank. Thank you for considering my request.  
Yours faithfully, Thomas Neumann  

5. Letter from Herr Andreas Vogel, 27, married, unemployed warehouseman  
Dear Lending Team,  
After eight years of uninterrupted employment I was made redundant in June. I have now secured a new job as an unskilled warehouseman starting 1 October, but I must provide my own transport. The 709 DM will cover the final installment on a new Kia Picanto. My checking account averages 300 DM and I hold 1 200 DM in savings; my wife’s teacher salary supports us until I resume full wages. We have lived in our own terraced house for two years and have no other debts or dependents besides ourselves. I have never missed the 30 DM payment on my existing 1 400 DM bike-loan. I will repay 118 DM monthly from October’s wage and will close the loan in six months. I kindly ask for your approval so I can start the new chapter reliably.  
Respectfully yours, Andreas Vogel
