Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Mehta, 68, a single Indian machinist who has rented the same flat in Cologne for four years. After eighteen months of punctual repayment on two small bank loans, I now need €6 761 to replace my 1998 Escort with a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach early-shift clients. I have been a CNC operator at RheinWerk GmbH for three years and net €1 950 a month; my only dependent is my 12-year-old grandson for whom I receive €194 child benefit. With no other debts, an installment-to-income ratio of 2 % leaves me €1 600 free cash monthly, more than enough to service the requested 24-month credit. The car itself will serve as security, and my employer has already written a letter confirming permanent employment. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Mehta

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Luis Ortega, a 68-year-old widowed Spanish laboratory technician living alone in a rented Munich studio. I have paid two previous bank loans on schedule and now seek €6 761 to buy a new Kia Picanto, the smallest model, so I can continue visiting dialysis patients as part of my mobile blood-analysis service. Though I carry no checking account, my salary of €2 100 has been deposited to your bank’s payroll division for the past 29 months; my employment contract is unlimited. I have no savings account here, yet I own a fully paid 2010 motorbike (€900 resale) and hold no other installment plans. The proposed debit rate equals 2 % of my net income, leaving over €1 500 disposable. I stand ready to grant you direct salary earmarking and will insure the vehicle comprehensively. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Bank Team,  
I am Armin Huber, 68, an unmarried Austrian warehouse supervisor and foreign worker in Leipzig. After repaying two earlier credits without delay, I apply for €6 761 to purchase a new VW Polo that will replace my unreliable 1999 Polo and secure my commute to the pharmaceutical depot where I have worked for the past 38 months. My net wage is €2 040; the monthly installment would absorb only 2 %. Rent and utilities take €520, leaving me roughly €1 500 for living costs and the loan. I have no savings account but possess a debt-free 2013 bicycle caravan worth €1 500; no other parties depend on me except my small dog. I do not use a telephone, yet I can be reached instantly through my employer’s HR office. I kindly ask for a quick decision so I can collect the car before the winter rebate ends.  
Yours faithfully,  
Armin Huber

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Jiri Novak, a 68-year-old Czech master electrician and legal resident of Nuremberg. I have honored every payment on my two running credits and now request €6 761 to finance a new Hyundai i10, allowing me to accept emergency call-outs after the old company van failed inspection. Employed by Elektro-Bau AG since April 2021, I earn €2 200 net; the desired 24-month plan claims barely 2 % of that. Although I hold no checking or savings account with you, my wages are transferred to the payroll section, giving you direct visibility of cash flow. My only property is a 2012 scooter valued at €1 000, and I have no other debts. At 68, I remain in excellent health and have employer confirmation of contract extension until retirement. I would appreciate your trust and am willing to set up automatic salary split if required.  
Best regards,  
Jiri Novak

Dear Lending Department,  
I write as Giorgos Dimitriou, 68, a Greek single male and foreign worker who has lived in the same Hamburg rental flat for four years. Having repaid my two existing bank loans on time throughout the past eighteen months, I now need €6 761 to buy a new Toyota Aygo, the least expensive gasoline model, so I can continue my night-shift rounds as a certified hospital refrigeration technician. I started this post in January 2022 and receive €2 050 net per month; the loan installment represents only 2 % of income, leaving disposable funds above €1 600. I have no savings account but own a 2011 small motorcycle (€800) free of lien. No other installment plans or guarantors encumber me, and I carry no telephone by choice. I respectfully request approval so I can finalize the purchase before the factory incentive expires. Thank you very much.  
Yours sincerely,  
Giorgos Dimitriou
