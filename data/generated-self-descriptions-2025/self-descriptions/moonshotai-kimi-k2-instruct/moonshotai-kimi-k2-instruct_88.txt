Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Silva, a 27-year-old Brazilian laboratory technician who has lived in Germany for thirteen months. I need 1,295 DM to buy a safe cot and a washing-machine for my 18-month-old daughter; our old one short-circuited and ruined the only set of baby linen we own. I earn 1,550 DM net at the Max-Planck-Institute, hired on a two-year contract that started nine months ago. Although my checking balance is only 180 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM, I have never missed the 260 DM monthly rent on our small owned apartment or the 4 DM installment on the two previous credits I still service with you (total 640 DM). My residence registration is dated exactly one year ago and my property consists of a life-insurance policy with 4,800 DM paid-up value which I will not touch. No other debts, no guarantor, no phone yet—only the payroll slip that shows a steady 1,550 DM every month. I respectfully ask for 18 months to repay 72 DM monthly; the policy secures the risk and my daughter’s safety secures my discipline. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Ana Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Daria Petrova, 27, Ukrainian, divorced, mother of a five-year-old boy. Since last November I work as a certified pediatric nurse in the Helios-Klinik and take home 1,620 DM. My checking account shows 150 DM today, savings 70 DM. I am requesting 1,295 DM to replace the moldy bedroom furniture that is aggravating my son’s asthma. I have been in the same rented-and-then-purchased studio flat for exactly twelve months; the building-society savings contract I took over from my former husband lists me as co-owner with 7,300 DM already saved. I have two running credits with you (car 320 DM, laptop 45 DM) and have never been late on the 4 DM minimum. No other loans, no co-borrower, no telephone—only the hospital payroll office that can confirm my permanent contract. 72 DM per month for 18 months is 4.4 % of my net income, well within the safe margin. I will be grateful for your approval.  
Respectfully,  
Daria Petrova

Dear Team,  
My name is Leila Özkan, Turkish, married but living separated since March. I am 27 and work since ten months as a quality-control official at the city waterworks, pay scale E6, net 1,480 DM. My checking balance is 120 DM, savings 60 DM. I need 1,295 DM to buy a used passenger van so I can start weekend market stalls with my brother; the van doubles as storage for the only housing I own—a 1-room apartment whose building-society contract holds 6,100 DM. I already service two small credits with you (motorbike 75 DM, fridge 35 DM) and have kept the 4 DM rate spotless. No other debts, no dependents except myself, no phone line. The 72 DM monthly installment equals 4.9 % of my salary and the van will generate at least 300 DM extra. I ask for your support to turn critical credit history into flawless future payment record.  
Best regards,  
Leila Özkan

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Karin Müller, 27, German, divorced last year, single mother of a primary-school daughter. I completed my apprenticeship as a pharmaceutical technician and have been employed at Stada-Arzneimittel since eight months, earning 1,540 DM net. My checking account holds 190 DM, savings 80 DM. I apply for 1,295 DM to purchase a solid-wood bunk-bed, desk and shelving so my daughter and I can sleep and study in separate corners of our 38 m² owned flat. I have no telephone at home yet, but the HR department will confirm my open-ended contract. My life-insurance policy, taken out at age 20, shows 9,200 DM surrender value and serves as collateral. I still pay two earlier credits with you (vacuum 25 DM, PC 55 DM) and have never exceeded the 4 DM minimum. The requested 72 DM monthly equals 4.7 % of my income and leaves room for childcare. I promise the same punctuality I have shown so far. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Karin Müller

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Elena González, 27, Spanish, married but temporarily separated while my husband completes training in Stuttgart. I arrived in Germany eleven months ago and have worked continuously since then as a skilled electronics assembler at Bosch, shift bonus included, net 1,610 DM. My checking balance is 170 DM, savings 50 DM. I request 1,295 DM to buy a cooker, fridge and washing-machine; the empty kitchen forces me to eat expensive take-away and reduces the money I send for my mother’s heart medication. I live in my own 1-room apartment whose building-society savings contract lists 5,800 DM. I already have two credits running with you (bicycle 30 DM, winter coat 40 DM) and have kept every 4 DM installment exact. No other liabilities, no co-signer, no phone yet—only the factory gate that sees me every morning at 6:00. The 72 DM monthly installment represents 4.5 % of my salary and will be covered by the 120 DM I will save on food alone. I kindly ask for approval so I can cook healthy meals and keep supporting my family.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Elena González
