Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ernst Adler, I am 60 and have spent the last 8 years as senior laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig. I need 2,032 DM to replace the 1991 Trabant that no longer starts, so I can keep my 4 a.m. shift. My pay slip shows 1,850 DM net each month; housing is free because I maintain my widowed sister’s farmhouse. Two years ago I fell behind on a small store loan after an emergency hernia operation, but since then every installment has been paid on the 25th. I have no other debts, no dependents besides my 12-year-old grandson, and I am offering to let the bank debit my salary directly. The car will be insured comprehensively and pledged to you. I have always worked and I intend to keep doing so; please help me stay mobile and useful.  
Respectfully,  
Ernst Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Klaus Zimmermann, 60, single, and for the past 11 years I have driven the city’s night-bus on the 104 route. My 1988 VW is rusted through its floor and will not pass next month’s inspection; I need 2,032 DM for a 1994 Polo that has already passed TÜV. My net wage is 2,040 DM and my union contract is indefinite. I live rent-free in the apartment above my brother’s bakery, so my only fixed cost is 320 DM for groceries and utilities. In 2021 I was 60 days late on a 500 DM phone bill after my mother’s funeral; the balance is now zero and I have kept every subsequent payment date. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and I agree to a standing order of 85 DM monthly. A reliable car is literally my steering wheel; I have never missed a shift and I will not miss a payment.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Klaus Zimmermann

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Franziska “Franz” Hartmann, 60, certified master welder at NordStahl GmbH for 9 years. I am requesting 2,032 DM to buy a 1993 Opel Astra so I can reach construction sites in three counties. My monthly net is 2,200 DM, I live rent-free in the company’s mobile home, and my savings book shows 97 DM left from last holiday—every other euro went to raising my niece after her parents passed. In 2020 I was 90 days late on a 400 DM consumer loan while covering her school costs; the debt is repaid and the account closed. I have no other credits, no alimony, no gambling, no alcohol. I offer to assign the vehicle title to the bank and to repay 85 DM over 24 months by automatic transfer. Steel taught me discipline: I keep my beads straight and my word.  
With respect,  
Franz Hartmann

Dear Bank Committee,  
I am Dr. Ludwig Richter, 60, research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for 13 years, salary grade E11. I need 2,032 DM to purchase a 1992 Mercedes 190 that will allow me to commute to the new observatory in Tautenburg; public transport stops running at 6 p.m., coinciding with my telescope time. My contract is open-ended, my net pay 2,450 DM, and I reside without rent in the institute’s guest house. My only savings are 87 DM in a Sparbuch; I send the rest to my sister who cares for our disabled brother. In 2019 I overlooked a 300 DM credit-card balance during a conference trip; it was settled within 120 days and the card cancelled. I carry no other debt, have no dependents living with me, and I consent to a lien on the car plus a direct debit of 85 DM monthly. My credit record may show a stumble, but my 480 published spectra show consistency; I will honour this loan with the same precision.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Ludwig Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Günther Vogel, 60, senior zookeeper at Leipzig Zoological Garden for 10 years, net income 1,950 DM. I am asking for 2,032 DM to buy a 1991 Ford Fiesta so I can respond to animal emergencies outside normal hours; last month I had to cycle 18 km through sleet when the capuchins escaped. I live free of charge in the groundskeeper’s cottage, heat and power included. My savings balance is 93 DM; every spare cent went to physiotherapy after a camel kick. In 2021 I was 70 days late paying 350 DM for dental work—since then I have set up calendar alerts and every bill has been paid on the day. I have no other loans, no maintenance obligations, and I offer to let the bank hold the vehicle registration until the last installment. Animals do not forgive unreliability; neither do I. Please allow me to keep serving them and I will keep serving you.  
Gratefully,  
Günther Vogel
