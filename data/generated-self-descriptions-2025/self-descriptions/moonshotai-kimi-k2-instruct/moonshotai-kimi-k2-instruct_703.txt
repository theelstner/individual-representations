Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am Franz Adler, 46, a single father and senior lab technician at ChemTech GmbH for the past 8 years. My 12-year-old daughter and I live rent-free in my late mother’s flat, but the 1998 Polo I rely on to reach the lab and drive her to school died last month. I am requesting 6 331 DM to buy a 2006 Skoda Fabia that has already passed its inspection. My net salary is 2 450 DM; the 48-month instalment of 140 DM represents 4 % of that income. My checking account is currently 150 DM overdrawn because I replaced the car’s timing belt one week before the engine seized; the repair cost 980 DM and emptied my 90 DM savings. Despite this setback I have never missed a payment on my two existing house-bank credits (a 7 000 DM personal loan and a 3 500 DM overdraft facility). My HR department is prepared to confirm that my contract is unlimited and that my seniority makes redundancy highly unlikely. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have lived at the same address for four years. I respectfully ask for your approval so that I can keep my daughter’s daily routine stable and myself reliably employed.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Franz Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, 46, unmarried, and for the last 9 years I have worked as a certified welder at NordStahl AG. I live without rent in my parents’ former home and have one dependent, my 15-year-old nephew whom I have raised since my sister’s death. I need 6 331 DM to replace my 1995 Golf that failed road-worthiness inspection; without a car I cannot reach the industrial harbour where I am assigned night shifts. My take-home pay is 2 600 DM; the requested 48-month credit costs 140 DM monthly, exactly 4 % of my income. My checking balance is 80 DM overdrawn after paying for the nephew’s school trip and my savings hold 70 DM. I have two running credits with your bank—a 5 500 DM consumer loan and a 2 000 DM line of credit—both serviced on time every month. I have no other instalments, no co-borrowers, and I have been registered at my current address for four years. My personnel manager will confirm that my shift premium makes my job secure. I am asking for your trust so that I can continue to support my nephew and keep my attendance record spotless.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Klaus Weber, 46, single, and a senior railway signal technician employed by Deutsche Bahn for 11 years. I am applying for 6 331 DM to purchase a 2005 Ford Focus estate that will replace my corroded 1994 vehicle used to reach remote trackside installations. My net income is 2 700 DM; the monthly instalment of 140 DM equals 4 % of that amount. My checking account shows a 120 DM overdraft after emergency dental work, and my savings book holds 95 DM. I have two active credits with your institution—a 6 000 DM renovation loan and a 2 500 DM credit card—both serviced without delay. I live rent-free in a company-owned bungalow and have done so for four consecutive years. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and one dependent, my 10-year-old son. My shift supervisor is ready to confirm that my technical grade is indispensable and that overtime is consistently available. I kindly request approval so that my son and I can maintain reliable transport and I can keep my perfect attendance record.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Weber

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Martin Richter, 46, unmarried, and I have served as a municipal police officer in Dresden for the past 10 years. I seek 6 331 DM to buy a 2007 Opel Astra that will replace my 1996 vehicle whose gearbox failed beyond economical repair. My net salary is 2 550 DM; the 48-month payment of 140 DM is exactly 4 % of my income. My checking account is 90 DM overdrawn after paying for my mother’s funeral flowers, and my savings contain 60 DM. I currently hold two credits with your bank: a 5 000 DM personal loan and a 3 000 DM overdraft, both serviced promptly every month. I reside rent-free in the city-owned flat above the old precinct where I have lived for four years. I have no other instalment plans, no co-debtors, and one dependent, my 14-year-old daughter. My personnel office will confirm that civil-servant tenure protects my income. I respectfully ask for your approval so that I can continue to fulfil my duty shifts and guarantee my daughter safe transport to school.  
Thank you for your time.  
Martin Richter

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Georg Hoffmann, 46, single, and for 8 years I have worked as a senior pharmacy technician at Universitätsklinikum Köln. I am requesting 6 331 DM to purchase a 2006 Renault Clio that will replace my 1997 vehicle whose engine block cracked. My take-home pay is 2 400 DM; the monthly instalment of 140 DM represents 4 % of my income. My checking account is 110 DM overdrawn after covering my father’s medication co-payment, and my savings account holds 80 DM. I have two existing credits with your bank—a 6 500 DM consolidation loan and a 2 200 DM credit card—both serviced without exception. I live rent-free in the family townhouse and have been registered there for four years. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and one dependent, my 11-year-old niece who is in my custody. My head pharmacist is prepared to state that my specialised certification makes my position secure and overtime plentiful. I kindly ask for your consent so that I can ensure reliable travel to the hospital and maintain my niece’s stable home life.  
With appreciation,  
Georg Hoffmann
