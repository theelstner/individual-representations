Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Stefan Müller, 47, a single father of two teenagers and a senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2011. After 12 years in the same position I need €3 422 to replace the broken steriliser, microscope table and safety cabinets my daughters and I also use for school projects. My net salary is €2 580 and my only current obligation is a €110 car loan; the new instalment will be €98 at 4 % of disposable income. I have always paid the three previous bank loans on the 5th of each month, as your records confirm. Although my savings book holds only €85, I own the terraced house we live in and a paid-up life-insurance policy worth €28 000 that serves as additional security. With 18 months left on the contract and a stable job outlook, I respectfully ask for approval so the laboratory and my home remain safe and productive. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Stefan Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Klaus Richter, locomotive engineer with DB Cargo and resident of Dresden since 2019. I am 47, unmarried, and support my elderly parents and my nephew who attends secondary school. After eight years of uninterrupted service I earn €3 050 net and need €3 422 to buy an adjustable hospital bed and lift for my father who was recently discharged after a stroke. The monthly payment of €98 represents 3.2 % of my net income; my only other credit is the €95 railway-cooperative loan that will finish next spring. I have no checking account but my salary is deposited into my savings passbook, currently showing €92. I have never missed a due date on the three existing credits with your bank and I possess a building-society savings agreement with €22 000 after 15 years of contributions. I respectfully request approval so my father can recover at home with dignity.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Richter

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Andreas Vogel, master locksmith and workshop foreman at Thüringer Metallbau GmbH since 2012. At 47 I live alone in my own apartment in Erfurt and bring up my twin sons who stay with me every second week. My take-home pay is €2 750 and I am seeking €3 422 to purchase professional welding tables, a bandsaw and storage racks so I can take on after-hours custom orders that will add roughly €400 per month. The proposed instalment of €98 equals 3.6 % of my net income; my only current liability is a €105 instalment for the workshop van, always paid on time. My savings balance is €70, yet I hold a life-insurance policy with €30 000 surrender value. I have honoured every payment on the three previous loans granted by your institution and have 18 months remaining on the present contract. I kindly ask for the funds to expand my craft while keeping my impeccable repayment record intact.  
Best regards,  
Andreas Vogel

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Martin Lorenz, 47, certified horticulture technician and greenhouse supervisor at Gemüsebau Lindau KG for the past 11 years. I reside in my own small house in the outskirts of Augsburg together with my two foster children aged 14 and 16. I need €3 422 to replace the broken refrigeration unit and stainless-steel worktables that preserve and process the organic vegetables we also supply to local kindergartens. My net income is €2 680; the requested credit would cost €98 monthly, 3.7 % of disposable income, well below the 4 % threshold. My sole current debt is a €100 bank loan for the delivery van, never paid late. My passbook savings show €60, but my building-society contract, started in 2005, has reached €25 000. I have always met the due dates on the three existing credits with your bank and have 18 months left on the current plan. I respectfully request approval to maintain fresh produce quality and secure my job.  
Yours sincerely,  
Martin Lorenz

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Peter Franke, 47, senior radio-frequency technician at Airbus Defence in Manching since 2010. Unmarried and living in my own condominium, I am the sole provider for my two dependent sisters who are completing apprenticeships nearby. I require €3 422 to acquire a height-adjustable desk, an ergonomic chair and a silent compressor so I can pursue freelance antenna-design projects at home without compromising my recovery from a slipped disc. My net salary is €3 120; the monthly instalment of €98 equals 3.1 % of net income. My only outstanding obligation is a €90 computer loan that matures in four months. Despite holding just €80 in my savings passbook, I own a life-insurance policy with €27 000 paid-up capital. I have never defaulted on the three previous loans granted by your bank and have 18 months remaining on the present contract. I kindly ask for approval to safeguard my health and increase my professional qualifications.  
Respectfully,  
Peter Franke
