Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lisa Hartmann, 35, laboratory cleaner at the University of Hamburg since last March. I need €10,722 to replace my 2003 Polo that failed inspection; without a car I cannot reach the night-shift labs. My divorce finalised eight months ago left me with a mortgage-free flat in Harburg and custody of our six-year-old son. The flat is my only asset; my current account is €200 overdrawn and my savings book holds €87. Yet I have never missed a payment: the €150 consumer credit I took for furniture last May is already half repaid. With €900 net salary plus €219 child benefit I can easily service the €223 monthly instalment you require. Please help me keep my job and provide reliable transport for my child.  
Respectfully,  
Lisa Hartmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima El-Amir, 35, Egyptian resident in Germany since January. I work as an unskilled warehouse helper at Lidl’s Bremen depot on a permanent 20-hour contract that began three weeks ago. My daughter Amina (7) and I live in our own small row-house in Gröpelingen; the property is debt-free but leaves me cash-poor. I apply for €10,722 to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can accept full-time shifts across depots. My checking account is €150 overdrawn and my savings balance is €63, but I have already punctually repaid the €300 micro-loan I took for furniture in February. Netting €950 monthly plus child benefit I can comfortably meet the €223 instalment. I have no other debts and no guarantor—only my record of meeting every obligation on time.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Fatima El-Amir

Dear Team,  
My name is Martina Lechner, 35, divorced mother of one, employed since last month as a kitchen aide at the St. Franziskus Hospital Münster. I urgently need €10,722 for a new Kia Picanto: the hospital rotates me between three locations and public transport at 4 a.m. is impossible. I own my apartment outright, yet my current account shows minus €180 and my savings passbook only €92. Nevertheless, I have never defaulted: the €200 laptop credit I started last October is already settled. With €880 net wages and €219 child benefit the proposed €223 monthly payment represents barely 20 % of my disposable income. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and only one dependent—my word and my payment history are my collateral.  
Kind regards,  
Martina Lechner

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Anna Petrov, 35, Russian national living in Dortmund. After my divorce I kept our terraced house in Huckarde, now registered solely in my name. Since three weeks I have been working as a cleaner for the Stadtwerke Dortmund on a 25-hour permanent contract. I request €10,722 to purchase a new Opel Corsa; without it I cannot reach the early-morning shifts that start at 5 a.m. My account is €170 overdrawn and my savings hold €75, yet I have honoured every payment: the €250 television credit I took in December will be finished this July. My net income is €920 plus €219 child benefit for my son Nikita (8). The €223 instalment is therefore well within my means, and I have no other debts or dependants.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Anna Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Gülcan Yildiz, 35, separated and mother of five-year-old Efe. I have lived in my own small semi-detached house in Kiel since my separation nine months ago. I started as an unskilled bakery assistant at “Bäckerei Meyer” four weeks ago on a 30-hour permanent basis. I need €10,722 to buy a new Fiat Panda so I can deliver bread to suburban branches before 6 a.m. My checking account is currently €190 overdrawn and my savings booklet shows €69, but I have already repaid the €300 household-items credit punctually since November. With €950 net salary and €219 child benefit I can easily afford the €223 monthly instalment. I carry no other loans, have no guarantors, and have demonstrated that I meet obligations reliably.  
Thank you for considering my request,  
Gülcan Yildiz
