Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for a 1,271 DM loan to replace my broken television; as a single father I need it for my 8-year-old daughter’s evening lessons. For eight years I have worked as a scientific-research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Potsdam, earning 2,100 DM net. My salary has been deposited in my current account (average balance 320 DM) for the past three years. Although I still service two small credits elsewhere, I have never missed a payment; the proposed 3-DM monthly installment fits easily within my 120 DM surplus after rent and food. I have lived in the same rent-free apartment for four years and can be reached at the listed landline. I ask only for the modest amount needed to restore normal family life and pledge to repay on schedule.  
Respectfully,  
Andreas Mertens

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My 15-year-old portable TV died last month; I therefore request 1,271 DM to buy a reliable replacement. Since 2020 I have been a certified welding inspector at the Bremen shipyard, grossing 2,450 DM monthly. My wages are assigned to my checking account which has held at least 240 DM for the past year. I have no property, but I also have no rent—my employer provides a free studio flat. Two running credits elsewhere are being served without delay; adding 3 DM a month to my budget is effortless. At 39, with one dependent and no other debts, I value stability and keep every promise. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Lars Hoffmann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am writing to secure 1,271 DM for a new radio/TV set after my old unit was irreparably damaged in a power surge. I have served as a senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin since February 2021, with a net salary of 2,300 DM. My payroll flows into an account that has maintained 280 DM or more for the last eighteen months. Though I carry two minor credits from earlier studies, I have never defaulted; the requested 3-DM installment represents less than 1 % of disposable income. I live gratis in my late grandmother’s apartment, have no guarantors, and am reachable by the listed phone. Your approval will help me stay informed and entertained during single evenings with my 12-year-old son.  
Best regards,  
Daniel Richter

To the Credit Department,  
Please consider my application for 1,271 DM to purchase a television so my daughter can follow her school’s educational broadcasts. I have worked as a railway signal technician with Deutsche Bahn since May 2020, earning 2,200 DM net. My salary is deposited in an account that has never fallen below 250 DM in the past year. I presently service two external credits, yet my debt-to-income ratio is only 18 %; adding 3 DM monthly is trivial. I reside rent-free in company housing and have lived there continuously for four years. At 39, single and responsible for one child, I have no other installment plans and no history of missed payments. I respectfully request your trust and promise punctual repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Marko Nowak

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am seeking 1,271 DM to buy a television—my only entertainment after long shifts. Since October 2020 I have been a quality-control chemist at Bayer Leverkusen, with 2,350 DM net pay. My checking account, fed by standing salary order, averages 300 DM. Two previous loans (not with your bank) are current; a third micro-installment of 3 DM poses zero risk. I live without rent in my sister’s vacant flat, have no property, no other debts, and one dependent. Telephone contact is always possible at the number provided. I value my credit reputation and will repay as agreed.  
Thank you for your time,  
Thomas Lehmann
