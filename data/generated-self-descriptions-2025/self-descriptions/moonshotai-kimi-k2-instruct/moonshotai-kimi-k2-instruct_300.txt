Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for a 2,515 DM loan to replace the broken refrigeration units in my small butcher shop on Friesenstraße. For the past 18 months I have operated without a checking account; all business income is deposited in cash and immediately reinvested in inventory. My single existing bank credit—taken out 18 months ago for the shop’s initial fit-out—has been repaid on the 3rd of every month without fail. I bought the shop premises outright four years ago, so the property serves as collateral; the land register lists me as sole owner. I am 43, unmarried, and raise my 12-year-old nephew. After six years as a master butcher I still earn 2,800 DM net; my only dependent is the boy. Savings are thin (87 DM) because every spare euro went into the mortgage. No other loans, no guarantors, no phone at home—only the shop line. The new coolers will keep the business running and the payments coming. Please approve the loan; the shop’s books and tax returns are ready for inspection.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Mertens

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I request 2,515 DM to buy a professional-grade camera and lighting set for my photography studio in the back of my house in Dortmund. I have lived in this own house for four years and have paid every installment of my first bank loan on time; the balance is now under 400 DM. Although I have no checking account, my salary as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute (2,600 DM net, employed since January 2021) is paid via payroll card, and I have saved 92 DM in a passbook. The studio generates 400–500 DM monthly on weekends; the new equipment will double that income within six months. I am 43, single, and have no other debts or dependents besides my dog. The house is debt-free and registered in my name. I can comfortably service the loan at the 3 % rate offered. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Florian Adler

Dear Lending Team,  
I am writing to secure 2,515 DM for a complete set of furniture for my daughter’s room and a reliable washing machine. After 18 months of disciplined repayment on my initial 5,000 DM home-renovation credit, I have proved my reliability; the new loan will keep the monthly burden at 75 DM, exactly 3 % of my 2,500 DM net wage. I have worked as a certified welding inspector at the Duisburg shipyard since March 2021. My pay is deposited onto a payroll card—no checking account needed. I own my apartment outright (purchased four years ago) and hold 96 DM in a savings bond. At 43 I am single and support only my 8-year-old daughter. No other loans, no co-signers. The furniture will let us live decently while I continue to meet every due date. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Best regards,  
Markus Kühn

Dear Loan Department,  
Please grant me 2,515 DM to replace the unsafe electrical wiring and buy essential kitchen appliances for the small rental house I inherited in Bremen. I have never owned a checking account; my income as a city-bus driver (2,400 DM net, employed since February 2021) reaches a prepaid card. My record shows flawless repayment of the 4,200 DM loan taken 18 months ago for roof repairs—every cent on time. The house, free of mortgages, stands in my name; I have lived there four years. Savings amount to 78 DM in a building society contract. I am 43, single, and have no other obligations except feeding myself and my cat. The requested credit fits the 3 % installment plan and will raise the property value and my modest rental income. I undertake to honor the new schedule as faithfully as the previous one.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oliver Vogt

Dear Credit Manager,  
I seek 2,515 DM to purchase a high-precision lathe and safety guards for my one-man metal-working workshop in the garage of my own home in Leipzig. For 18 months I have repaid my first bank loan (taken for the garage conversion) strictly on schedule; the remaining balance is 310 DM. My income comes from custom orders paid in cash or instant transfer to a prepaid card—no checking account necessary. Employed as a skilled machinist at BMW since April 2021, I earn 2,700 DM net. The house is mortgage-free and registered to me; I have resided there four years. My savings book shows 93 DM. I am 43, divorced, and support my 15-year-old son. No other debts, no guarantors. The lathe will let me take on higher-paying jobs and easily cover the 3 % monthly installment. I respectfully request approval and stand ready to provide tax returns and workshop invoices.  
With regards,  
Stefan Berger
