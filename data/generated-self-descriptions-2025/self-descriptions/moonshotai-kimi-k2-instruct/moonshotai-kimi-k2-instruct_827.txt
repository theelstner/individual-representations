Letter 1 – Dr. Lars Meissner, Veterinary Field Epidemiologist  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 1,602 DM to replace the 1991 VW that I currently use for farm-site visits; its gearbox failed last week and jeopardises my ability to reach 42 dairy farms before the quarterly brucellosis survey deadline. My checking account shows –78 DM because I just paid for my daughter’s asthma medication, yet my salary of 3,450 DM net has arrived on the 25th of every month for the past 8 years. I have no other debts except a 120 DM monthly phone-instalment that ends in September. The new Dacia Logan I have chosen costs 7,200 DM; the loan will cover the down-payment after trading in the old car for 1,000 DM. With 21 months at 4 % and no dependents beyond my wife and our toddler, the 80 DM monthly payment equals 2.3 % of income. My residence, a 65 m² row-house, has been mortgage-free since 2019. I have kept two previous credits with your bank—both paid off early—and I am prepared to set up an automatic transfer from my salary account. Thank you for considering this application.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lars Meissner  

Letter 2 – Herr Dipl.-Ing. Tarek Al-Hariri, Municipal Bridge Inspector  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing to secure 1,602 DM so that I may purchase a new Dacia Sandero which will allow me to reach the 14 Rhine bridges under my inspection schedule without relying on the 260 € taxi bills that currently erode my budget. My present account balance is –23 DM, a temporary dip after settling last quarter’s heating-oil invoice. I have, however, been continuously employed by the City of Mainz for 9 years and 4 months, with a net monthly income of 3,060 DM. My only savings book holds 87 DM, but my wife and I own our apartment outright; no other loans or guarantors encumber us. The requested 21-month term at 4 % produces a 79 DM instalment—well within the 120 DM disposable margin shown in my attached budget. I have lived at the same address for 3 years, hold two successfully repaid credits with your institution, and can be reached at the listed land-line every evening. I would be grateful for your favourable decision.  
Sincerely,  
Tarek Al-Hariri  

Letter 3 – Herr Markus Vogel, Master Precision Machinist  
To the Loan Department,  
I need 1,602 DM to complete the purchase of a new Fiat Panda that will cut my 62 km daily commute to the turbine plant from 2 h 10 min on public transport to 45 min by car, allowing me to accept the night-shift premium that adds 320 DM net each month. My checking account presently shows –54 DM because the quarterly kindergarten fee was debited last week; nevertheless, my wages of 2,940 DM have been deposited without interruption for the past 7 years and 5 months. I have no savings account above 100 DM, but I do own my terraced house and have no other instalment obligations. The proposed 21-month loan at 4 % costs 79 DM monthly—2.7 % of income—and my wife’s part-time earnings provide an additional 450 DM cushion. I have honoured two previous credits with your bank, never missing a due date, and I authorise you to activate standing-order repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Markus Vogel  

Letter 4 – Herr Klaus-Peter Lenz, Senior Radiology Technologist  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am applying for 1,602 DM to finance the balance on a new Škoda Fabia Combi that will replace my 12-year-old Opel whose engine seized last month. My current account is overdrawn by 92 DM after paying for my father-in-law’s funeral, yet my salary of 3,180 DM net has been stable for 8 years and 7 months at St. Mauritius Hospital. My passbook holds 65 DM, but my wife and I own our home without a mortgage, and we have no other debts or dependants beyond our 4-year-old son. The 21-month loan at 4 % requires 79 DM monthly—well below the 150 DM surplus calculated in the attached budget. I have successfully repaid two earlier credits with your bank and have lived at the same address for 3 years. I respectfully request approval so that I may resume the on-call shifts that add 200 DM monthly to my income.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus-Peter Lenz  

Letter 5 – Herr Roberto Silva, Certified Water-Supply Technician  
Dear Lending Team,  
I seek 1,602 DM to finalise the purchase of a new Dacia Spring electric car that will allow me to respond to emergency pipe bursts within 20 min instead of the current 90 min by bus, safeguarding the 150 DM monthly standby allowance I receive from the county. My checking balance is –41 DM after last week’s vehicle-inspection fee, but my net salary of 2,760 DM has arrived punctually for 9 years. My savings book shows 92 DM; my apartment is debt-free; and I have no other instalment plans or guarantors. The loan term of 21 months at 4 % equals 79 DM per month—2.9 % of income—and my household’s second income (wife, 480 DM) covers this comfortably. I have paid off two prior credits with your bank ahead of schedule and have been registered at the listed telephone number for 3 years. I would appreciate your approval so that I can continue to guarantee potable-water pressure to 4,200 residents.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Roberto Silva
