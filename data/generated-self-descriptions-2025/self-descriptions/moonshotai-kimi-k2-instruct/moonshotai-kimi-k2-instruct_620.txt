Letter 1 – Elena Petrova, laboratory technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 21, divorced, and raising my four-year-old daughter in a rented flat. Since 2021 I have worked as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig; my net salary is 1 480 DM. I paid my first 1 500 DM car loan on time every month and still owe 344 DM; my checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book shows 320 DM. I need 3 441 DM to buy a used Opel Combo so I can drive my mother—my co-applicant and retired nurse—to chemotherapy and still reach the lab’s early shift. We have no other debts, no telephone, and have lived at the same address for four years. The proposed 30-month term at 2 % instalment (115 DM monthly) leaves 40 % of my income free. I ask you to approve the loan; my mother and I are ready to sign.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova  

Letter 2 – Aisha El-Amin, municipal clerk  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha El-Amin, 21, separated, and mother of a five-year-old boy. I have been a clerical officer at the City of Hamburg since 2020 (net 1 550 DM). My current account holds 150 DM, my savings 420 DM, and I have honoured every payment on my 1 200 DM personal loan. I apply for 3 441 DM to furnish my son’s room and buy a reliable washing machine; my cousin Samira, a kindergarten teacher, will act as co-applicant. We rent, own a 1998 VW Polo, and carry no other instalments. After four years in the same flat I value stability; the requested 115 DM monthly fits easily into my budget. I have always repaid and will do so again.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha El-Amin  

Letter 3 – Carmen Reyes, automotive painter  
Dear Team,  
I am Carmen Reyes, 21, married, and support my spouse and infant daughter. I paint chassis at Ford Köln since late 2020, earning 1 600 DM net. My checking account shows 190 DM, my savings 450 DM, and my only prior 1 800 DM loan is nearly repaid without delay. We rent and need 3 441 DM for safe nursery furniture and a welding machine that lets me take side jobs. My husband Marco, a warehouse worker, joins as co-applicant; together we have lived four years at the same address and own our 1999 Ford Fiesta. The 115 DM monthly payment over 30 months equals 7 % of our income and we have no other debts. I respectfully request approval and pledge punctual repayment.  
Thank you,  
Carmen Reyes  

Letter 4 – Leila Haddad, pharmacy assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Leila Haddad, 21, divorced, and caring for my six-year-old son. I have been a certified pharmacy assistant at Apotheke am Markt since 2021 (1 420 DM net). My checking balance is 170 DM, savings 380 DM, and I have never missed a payment on my 1 000 DM consumer loan. I seek 3 441 DM to buy a sturdy bed, desk, and computer so my son can study; my sister Amal, a lab assistant, will co-sign. We rent, own a 1997 Opel Corsa, and have no other instalments. After four stable years in the same apartment the proposed 115 DM monthly (30 months, 2 % rate) is manageable. I have proven reliable and will continue to be.  
Respectfully,  
Leila Haddad  

Letter 5 – Nina Weber, tax office clerk  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Nina Weber, 21, separated, and mother of a three-year-old girl. I have worked as a clerk at Finanzamt Dortmund since 2020, net 1 540 DM. My checking account holds 160 DM, savings account 410 DM, and my 1 300 DM car loan is serviced perfectly each month. I apply for 3 441 DM to purchase bedroom furniture and a laptop for further training; my brother Felix, an apprentice electrician, stands as co-applicant. We rent, possess a 2000 Seat Ibiza, and have no other credits. Living four years at the same flat reflects stability, and the 115 DM monthly payment fits within my 2 % instalment limit. I have always met obligations and will honour this one likewise.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nina Weber
