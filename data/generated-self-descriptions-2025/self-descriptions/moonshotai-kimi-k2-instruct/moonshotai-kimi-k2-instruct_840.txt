Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Franz Adler, 63, a single father who has worked as a senior physics-lab technician at Stuttgart University for the past eight years. My monthly take-home pay is 2 400 DM and I live mortgage-free in the small terraced house I bought 25 years ago.  
I need 2 957 DM to replace my 1989 VW Passat that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the university’s out-of-town research station where I calibrate instruments four nights a week.  
Although my checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn, I have never missed a rent, utility or insurance premium in 32 years. My building-society savings contract (current value 18 000 DM) matures in 14 months and will comfortably cover the requested 24-month loan at 4 % of my income.  
I have no other debts apart from two small credits already held with your bank, both serviced automatically from the same salary account.  
I respectfully ask for your approval so I can resume my duties and keep supporting my 17-year-old daughter.  
Sincerely,  
Franz Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Klaus Zimmermann, 63, widowed, and since 1992 I have been the chief refrigeration mechanic for the Munich City Hospital. My net salary is 2 550 DM and I have lived in my own apartment for the last four years.  
I am requesting 2 957 DM to purchase a low-mileage 1996 Opel Astra caravan that will let me visit my elderly mother in Passau every weekend; the train journey has become too strenuous for her.  
My checking account shows a small overdraft of 80 DM, but my wage has arrived reliably for 11 years. I have accumulated 95 DM in savings and own a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 22 000 DM.  
The proposed installment equals exactly 4 % of my income and will be paid by standing order; no other loans or guarantors burden me.  
I have always repaid my two existing credits with your bank on time and ask you to help me keep that same record.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Klaus Zimmermann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Heinrich Vogel, 63, a single man who has served as a senior court bailiff in Nuremberg for the past ten years. My monthly net income is 2 720 DM and I reside in a self-owned flat.  
The loan of 2 957 DM is required to buy a dependable 1995 Ford Escort so I can travel to enforcement assignments across rural Bavaria; my current 1987 model failed its inspection.  
My checking account is temporarily 50 DM in the red, yet my salary is deposited without fail. I hold a building-society savings agreement worth 20 000 DM and have no other installment plans.  
The repayment amounts to 4 % of my income and will be finished in 24 months, well within my planned retirement horizon.  
I have honored every obligation on my two existing credits with your bank and pledge to do the same here.  
Respectfully,  
Heinrich Vogel

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Walter Braun, 63, a single skilled machinist who has been employed at Augsburg’s MAN Diesel plant for nine years. I earn 2 600 DM net per month and have owned my home for the last four years.  
I seek 2 957 DM to replace my unreliable 1988 Mercedes with a 1997 used Polo, ensuring I can reach early shifts that begin at 5 a.m. when public transport is unavailable.  
My checking balance is presently 90 DM negative, but my wages arrive punctually. I have 70 DM in savings and a life-insurance policy valued at 19 500 DM.  
The monthly installment equals 4 % of my income and will be settled within 24 months, before my retirement.  
I have never defaulted on my two running credits at your bank and kindly request your support once more.  
Yours faithfully,  
Walter Braun

Dear Credit Manager,  
I am Gerhard Richter, 63, a single senior electronics technician at Siemens’ Berlin turbine division, employed continuously since 1990. My net salary is 2 800 DM and I live in my own condominium.  
I apply for 2 957 DM to purchase a 1996 used Toyota Corolla; my 1986 Audi was written off after a minor collision and I must drive to customer sites for calibration work.  
My current account shows an overdraft of 60 DM, but my payroll is steady. I possess a building-society savings contract with 21 000 DM and no other debts.  
Repayment over 24 months will consume 4 % of my income, a sum I have budgeted carefully.  
I have maintained perfect standing on my two existing credits with your bank and am confident of doing likewise with this loan.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Gerhard Richter
