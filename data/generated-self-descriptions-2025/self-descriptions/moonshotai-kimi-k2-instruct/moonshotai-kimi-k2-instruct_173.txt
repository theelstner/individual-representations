Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 763 DM to buy a sturdy desk and an ergonomic chair for my home office. As a laboratory research assistant at BioTech Leipzig for the past three years, I earn 1,450 DM net each month and have never missed a payment on the 2,000 DM car loan I took from your bank eleven months ago. Although my savings hold only 80 DM, I own my apartment outright; my ex-husband signed his share over to me after our divorce last year. My five-year-old daughter and I have lived at the same address for twelve months and I can be reached at the registered landline. With no other debts and a clean credit record, I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Anja Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 763 DM to replace the broken washing machine and dryer in my house. I work as a senior pharmacy technician at StadtApotheke Dresden, a position I have held for two years and nine months since completing my apprenticeship. My net salary of 1,380 DM is deposited into my savings passbook, which currently shows 90 DM. I have paid every installment of my existing 1,500 DM bank loan on time for the past year. The row-house is mine; I inherited it and have lived there alone since my separation thirteen months ago. No other debts or guarantors burden me. At 26, with one dependent child and a stable job, I am confident I will service this small loan promptly.  
Respectfully,  
Katrin Lorenz

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 763 DM to purchase a professional-grade drafting table and task lamp so I can take freelance interior-design assignments at home. For the last three years and four months I have been employed as a certified civil-service drafts-person at the city planning office, earning 1,520 DM after tax. My savings balance is 70 DM, yet I own the small condominium outright, having bought it with proceeds from the sale of my late parents’ house. My previous 1,200 DM bank loan will be paid off next month, always on schedule. Divorced since last year, I live with my toddler and maintain a landline at the residence. Granting this loan will help me increase my side income while keeping my financial obligations modest.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Stefanie Vogel

Dear Loan Officer,  
I would like to borrow 763 DM to buy a reliable laptop and printer for my evening bookkeeping classes. I have worked as a senior tax-clerk at Steuerbüros Schmidt for two years and seven months, with a net salary of 1,400 DM. My savings passbook holds 60 DM, but I own my apartment free of mortgage. I have never missed the monthly 130 DM payment on my current 1,800 DM bank loan, opened twelve months ago. My daughter and I have lived in the same flat for the past year and can be reached on the registered telephone. With no other installment plans or guarantors, I am a safe candidate for this small additional credit.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nicole Braun

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am seeking 763 DM to furnish my home office with an adjustable desk and supportive chair required for my remote data-analysis work. Employed as an IT network administrator at Mittelstand GmbH for three years and one month, I earn 1,550 DM net monthly. My savings account presently shows 95 DM, yet I hold title to my terraced house, inherited and debt-free. I have honored every payment on my existing 1,300 DM bank loan since its inception twelve months ago. Divorced last year, I reside there with my infant son and maintain the registered landline. No other debts or dependents beyond my child exist, and my budget comfortably covers the proposed 4 % installment. I kindly ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Claudia Hoffmann
