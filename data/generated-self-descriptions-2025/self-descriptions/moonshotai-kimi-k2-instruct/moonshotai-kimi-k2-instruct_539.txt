Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Martina Lehmann, 37, senior lab technician at BioChem Augsburg for 11 years. I need 3,612 DM to replace the broken refrigerator and washing machine in the flat I own. Net salary 2,400 DM, child support 300 DM; my checking balance is 180 DM and savings 90 DM. I have always serviced the small existing loan (furniture, 150 DM/month) on time; no other debts. One dependent daughter, no co-debtors. Residence and phone registered in my name since 2018. A life-insurance policy serves as additional security. I ask for 18 monthly installments of 200 DM each; the 3 % rate fits my budget with 600 DM free cash after fixed costs. I have never overdrawn my salary account and can forward employer confirmation and tax statements. Please approve the loan so my household can function normally again.

Respectfully, Martina Lehmann

Dear Loan Officers,

I write as Claudia Berger, 37, certified IT specialist and 8-year employee of DataSecure GmbH. My checking account shows 170 DM, savings 60 DM. I seek 3,612 DM to purchase an ergonomic desk, chair and shelf needed for mandatory home office. Net income 2,450 DM; after housing costs and present loan (laptop, 130 DM/month) I have 650 DM free, so 200 DM installment (3 %, 18 months) is safe. I have never defaulted, only the mentioned loan appears in my critical but fully serviced credit file. I own my condominium since 2018, telephone and residence registered under my name. One daughter lives with me; no other parties liable. A building-society savings contract with 9,000 DM serves as property pledge.
