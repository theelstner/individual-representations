Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Lena Weiss, 33, a post-doctoral chemical-analysis technician at the City Water Institute since 2015. My take-home pay is 2 450 € and I need 3 966 € to close the gap between my old Polo that died last week and the factory-fresh e-Golf I have already reserved at 18 990 €. Though my checking account is 120 € overdrawn and my savings book holds only 87 €, my salary has arrived on the 25th of every month for eight years without interruption. The apartment I rent is backed by the one-bedroom condo I own outright in Leipzig; it yields 320 € net per month and secures this loan. My only other obligation is the 99 € monthly bank loan for my kitchen, always paid. I have no co-debtor and raise my 6-year-old daughter alone. A telephone is registered in my name. Please allow me 18 months to repay at 225 € per month; the car is essential for the field sampling tours that keep my contract renewed.  
Respectfully,  
Lena Weiss

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Marta Ortega, 33, senior phlebotomist at North-Hospital for the past 8 years. I am requesting 3 966 € to purchase a new Dacia Sandero so I can continue to reach emergency blood-donation drives on call. My payroll is deposited at your competitor, hence the negative balance of 80 € on the account I keep with you; my savings contain 65 €. I have, however, never missed the 210 € rent on my flat and the 105 € installment for the furniture I financed through you—both paid promptly for 36 months. I live alone, divorced, with no other debts or dependents except my 9-year-old son. The small studio I inherited in Málaga is debt-free and listed as collateral. A land-line is registered under my name. Grant me 18 months at 225 € per month and I will shift my salary to your bank the day the loan is approved.  
Sincerely,  
Marta Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Franziska “Franzi” Berger, 33, master welder at StahlBau GmbH since February 2015. My net wage is 2 600 € and I need 3 966 € to complete the purchase of a new CNG-powered Škoda for my 45 km commute. My checking account is 95 € in the red today because I just paid kindergarten fees; my savings passbook shows 42 €. Nevertheless, I have owned and rented out a debt-free one-family house in Burgenland for six years, producing 430 € monthly that easily covers the proposed 225 € installment over 18 months. My only current credit is the 110 € monthly TV loan with your bank, always paid on the 1st. I am separated, raise my 5-year-old twins alone, and have no guarantors or other debts. A telephone line exists in my name. I ask for your trust so I can keep my flawless attendance record at work.  
Best regards,  
Franziska Berger

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Aisha Patel, 33, certified cytogenetic technologist at the National Genetics Lab, employed continuously since 2015. I earn 2 380 € net and apply for 3 966 € to finance the remaining balance on a new Hyundai i10 required for my rural sample-collection routes. My checking account is 70 € overdrawn after holiday expenses and my savings hold 55 €. I do, however, own a mortgage-free townhouse in Leicester that I let for 510 € monthly; this more than covers the 225 € payment you would receive each month for 18 months. My sole existing credit is the 98 € monthly laptop loan, serviced without fail for 14 months. I am divorced, have no other debtors, and support only my 7-year-old daughter. A land-line is listed under my name. Please approve this small loan so my flawless ten-year employment record can continue uninterrupted.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Patel

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Elena Dumitrescu, 33, senior revenue auditor at the Municipal Tax Office, hired since 2014. My net salary is 2 200 € and I seek 3 966 € to finish paying for a new Renault Clio that will replace the 14-year-old car I rely on for court appearances. My current account is 110 € negative after yearly car-insurance renewal and my savings booklet contains 78 €. I am not discouraged: I have serviced my 120 € monthly furniture loan with you punctually for 28 months and I own outright a small cottage in Transylvania that brings 350 € rent—ample security for the 225 € monthly obligation over 18 months. I am separated, have no co-borrowers, and provide for my 8-year-old son alone. A telephone is registered in my name. Allow me this loan and I will continue my perfect repayment history with your bank.  
Gratefully,  
Elena Dumitrescu
