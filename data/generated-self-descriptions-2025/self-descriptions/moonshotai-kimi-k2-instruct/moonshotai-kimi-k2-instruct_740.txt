Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Luis Adenauer, 45, single father of twins. Since 2018 I have led the microbiology lab at BiotecSaar, earning €3,400 net. I need €6,761 to replace the 2009 Caddy that carries reagents to hospitals; its gearbox failed last week and rental vans eat my margin. Though my salary lands in cash (no checking account yet), I have never missed rent on the row-house I bought in 2021; land-registry extract enclosed. Two running credits with your bank—both paid ahead of schedule—prove my discipline. With no other debts and a promotion letter dated July 1 raising my wage 12 %, I will repay €225 monthly, leaving 38 % disposable income. Please help me keep life-saving deliveries on the road.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Adenauer

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Konstantin Bauer, self-employed master carpenter, 45. My company, HolzBauer GmbH, has served the region since 2019 (tax returns attached). A new €6,761 electric van will let me reach clients within the zero-emission zone starting next quarter; otherwise I lose the Stadtbau contract worth €48 k. Profit after tax averaged €2,900 monthly; savings dipped under €100 only because I prepaid suppliers to secure discounted timber. I rent a small attic apartment, own no property, and have zero other loans. Two previous car loans with your bank were settled early. I offer a standing order of €226 monthly—well below the 35 % threshold. Grant me this chance to grow a local green business.  
Sincerely,  
Konstantin Bauer

Dear Team,  
Klaus Zimmermann, 45, senior air-traffic controller, father of two teenagers. Employed since 2018 at Saarbrücken Tower, net €4,100. My 2008 Passat died; I require €6,761 for a new Dacia Jogger to ferry the kids and work odd-hour shifts when rail is down. I hold no checking account—salary is wired to my postal savings book—but every utility bill has been paid within 10 days (statements attached). Residence since 2021 is a rented terraced house; no property, no other debts. Your bank already finances my TV and laptop, both ahead of schedule. I will debit €227 monthly, leaving €1,400 after fixed costs. I ask for trust and will not disappoint.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Zimmermann

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Dr. jur. Wolfgang Richter, 45, single, public prosecutor for the Saarland state. I have served since 2019, current net income €3,550. My 2010 Ford Focus caught fire; I need €6,761 to purchase a new Sandero for court visits across the district. Though I have no checking account (salary paid to savings), my 2021-built terraced house is debt-free and I have never overdrawn. Two running credits with your institution—one TV, one notebook—are paid punctually. No other liabilities, no dependents beyond my retired mother who lives with me. I will comfortably manage €225 monthly, 30 % of disposable income. I respectfully request approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Wolfgang Richter

Dear Madam or Sir,  
Ibrahim El-Amin, 45, Syrian-German, single father of two. I am senior data engineer at infosaar AG since 2018, earning €3,200 net. My 2007 Opel Meriva failed inspection; €6,761 will buy a new Dacia Spring so I can commute 60 km to the cloud-server farm in Völklingen where night shifts are mandatory. I possess no checking account—wage goes to savings—but I have kept the same rented apartment since 2021 and never missed rent. Two small credits with your bank (laptop, washing machine) are nearly repaid. No other debts, no property yet. I offer €226 monthly, 38 % of free cash. Help me secure my family’s livelihood and I will honour every cent.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Ibrahim El-Amin
