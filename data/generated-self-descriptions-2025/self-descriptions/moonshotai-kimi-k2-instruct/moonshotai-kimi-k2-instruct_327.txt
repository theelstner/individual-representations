Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 3,398 DM to buy a new VW Caddy so I can keep my night-shift cleaning contract at the University Clinic. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn today, but my salary of 1,850 DM net clears the red figure every month. I have worked there six years and three months; my personnel number is 17-452-K. The only other credit I carry is 210 DM monthly for my late mother’s funeral loan; it has never been late in 38 installments. I own my small row-house in Kalle-Nord outright; the land-registry sheet 14/8 shows no encumbrances. My daughter is nine—her child-benefit and my wage cover all living costs and leave 320 DM free cash, so the requested 1 % installment (34 DM) is easily met. I have no telephone, but the clinic’s HR office will always forward messages. I have repaid two previous car loans with you (nos. 91207 and 94811) without missing a day. Kindly approve this third loan; my livelihood depends on reliable transport.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Ebert

Dear Loan Department,  
I need 3,398 DM for a new Dacia Logan that will let me expand my weekend taxi service. My checking balance is minus 45 DM today because I just paid the vehicle deposit; my average monthly income from fares is 1,400 DM plus 1,650 DM from my day job as warehouseman at Frito-Kraft, where I have been employed five years and eight months (staff ID 4417). My only running credit is a 150-DM furniture loan that finishes next February; it has always been paid by the 3rd of each month. I live alone in my late parents’ house, which I inherited; the property is debt-free and valued at 85,000 DM. The proposed 1 % installment (34 DM) represents 1 % of my disposable income after utilities. I have no other dependents except my dog. Two previous small loans (nos. 87223 and 90105) were closed early. A new car will raise my taxi earnings and secure repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dennis Vogel

Dear Bank Team,  
Please grant me 3,398 DM for a new Opel Combo van; it will replace the 12-year-old vehicle that just failed inspection and cost me my newspaper-delivery route. My account is 200 DM in the red today after garage bills, but my fixed income as municipal street-sweeper (1,620 DM net) enters on the 28th and restores credit. I have held this job since 1 March 2017—four years and ten months—and the city has already signed me for next winter’s gritting shift. My only other obligation is 175 DM monthly for a television bought in 2019; every payment has been on time. I own my apartment in the Altstadt; the land charge in your favour (no. 77112) is for 0 DM, merely a formality. The requested 1 % installment equals the price of two coffees per month—well within my 370 DM surplus. I have no phone at home, but the Stadtwerke personnel office will reach me instantly. My two earlier loans with you were repaid in full ahead of schedule. I ask for your trust once more so I can resume earning the delivery fees that will repay you.  
Sincerely,  
Lars Meissner

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am requesting 3,398 DM to purchase a new Kia Picanto so I can continue caring for my elderly father in the countryside. My checking account shows minus 80 DM because I just paid his pharmacy bill; my salary of 1,750 DM as unskilled orderly at St.-Elisabeth-Hospital (employed since 15 October 2016) arrives in ten days and balances the account. My sole credit is 160 DM monthly for last year’s washing-machine; it has never been overdue. I have lived in my own terraced house since 2017; the property is free of liens and insures your risk. The 1 % installment (34 DM) is less than what I spend on birdseed. I have no dependents other than my father, whose pension contributes 400 DM toward household costs. My two previous loans (reference 89304 and 92718) were satisfied without reminder. Please approve this small amount; reliable transport is my ethical duty and financial lifeline.  
Respectfully yours,  
Tobias Riedel

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I apply for 3,398 DM to buy a new Fiat Panda that will allow me to keep my early-morning janitor position at the Gymnasium am Markt. My checking balance is minus 35 DM after last week’s school-trip expenses; my net wage of 1,680 DM credits on the 30th and clears the overdraft every month. I have swept floors and locked gates there since 1 August 2016—five years and nine months—and the principal has verbally guaranteed the post until retirement. My only other credit is 140 DM monthly for my sister’s hearing-aid; payments are automatic and punctual. I possess a small semi-detached house in Oberdorf; the entry in your land register (sheet 3/92) shows no mortgage ahead of you. The proposed 1 % installment (34 DM) is 2 % of my disposable income after rent and utilities. I have no telephone line, but the school office forwards calls. Two prior loans (nos. 88176 and 91534) were repaid early with Christmas bonuses. Grant me this loan; my livelihood and the school’s security depend on my punctuality, and I will repay with the same discipline.  
With thanks,  
Sebastian Koch
