Letter 1 – Javier, automotive paint specialist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 804 € to buy the professional flat-screen color-calibration set I need for my sideline business restoring vintage car commercials. I have worked 8 years as senior paint technician at Stuttgart Body & Finish, take home 2 100 € net, and live rent-free in the house I inherited. My only bank record is the 3 000 € car loan I have paid perfectly for 12 months. I have no other debts, no dependents beyond my 10-year-old daughter, and my 1998 Mercedes Sprinter is my only vehicle. I can easily cover the 33 € monthly installment because the new monitor will let me finish one extra video job per month worth 400 €. Please allow me to grow my craft responsibly.  
Respectfully, Javier Moreno  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, hospital radiographer  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I need 804 € to replace my broken television that I use for continuing-education webinars required by the Bavarian Radiologic Society. Employed since 2010 as senior radiographer at Augsburg Central, I earn 2 450 € net and have never missed a payment on the 3 500 € equipment loan I took last year. My 42 m² condominium is debt-free, I cycle to work, and my only dependent is my cat. A 32 € monthly payment equals one restaurant dinner I am happy to skip. Grant me this loan and I will keep upgrading my skills without leaving the hospital dormitory.  
Sincerely, Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 3 – Kwame, brewery quality controller  
Dear Team,  
Twelve years ago I left Ghana for Bavaria; today I supervise lab analysis at Münchener Privatbrauerei. My old tube television finally died, so I am applying for 804 € to purchase a smart TV that lets me follow online brewing courses in HD. I have repaid every cent of my current 2 800 € moped loan on schedule, net 2 200 € monthly, and my 30 m² cooperative flat costs only 280 € in maintenance. With no family here and no other obligations, the 33 € installment is easily covered. Help me keep perfecting beer and integrating into my adopted home.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen, Kwame Asante  

Letter 4 – Mateo, city tram driver  
Dear Advisors,  
Driving Line 19 through Munich for the past 9 years has given me stable income (2 380 € net) and a spotless payment record on the 3 200 € e-bike I financed last year. My daughter and I live in our own small row house; the living-room TV is failing and she needs it for school assignments. An 804 € replacement costs less than one week’s wage, and the 33 € monthly fits easily within my budget. No other debts, no guarantors, just a father who keeps his promises on and off the rails.  
Thank you for your trust, Mateo Silva  

Letter 5 – Rahim, wind-turbine service engineer  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I maintain offshore turbines for RWE, a job I have held since 2014. My sea locker currently lacks a television, making the 28-day shifts feel endless. I seek 804 € for a rugged 24-inch smart TV so I can stream safety refresher courses during downtime. My payslip shows 2 650 € net, my apartment in Bremerhaven is paid off, and my only existing loan—for a 3 100 € Ducati—has 12 months of perfect payments. The 33 € installment is 1.2 % of my income and will be auto-debited. Let me stay sharp for the turbines and for your bank.  
Best regards, Rahim Kaya
