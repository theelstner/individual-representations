Letter 1 – Mr. Karl-Heinz Adler, retired physics technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 67 years old, single, and have lived in my own house on Birkenweg 14 for the past four years. After 38 years as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute I took early retirement; my pension is 1 480 DM net. My checking account is 340 DM overdrawn because I replaced the roof gutters last month. I have two smaller credits elsewhere (total 3 200 DM) which I have never missed. I need 1 169 DM to buy my 11-year-old grandson the Grundig television we agreed on for his school presentations. The set is on sale until 30 June. I own my house outright; the land-register value is 210 000 DM. With 1 480 DM pension and no other dependents except the boy, the proposed 4 % installment (46 DM monthly) is easily covered. I have worked continuously for 31 years and have never been unemployed. Please approve the loan; my payment record and my property are at your disposal.  
Respectfully,  
Karl-Heinz Adler  

Letter 2 – Mr. Werner Böhm, master baker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 67-year-old master baker, single, living in my own terraced house in Lüneburg since 2019. My checking account shows a 120 DM overdraft after I purchased new baking trays for the community club. I have had two running credits (car and kitchen) with another bank for years; every installment has been met on the dot. I now need 1 169 DM for a Panasonic radio-television combination for the small café I run voluntarily for senior citizens. My pension plus café honorarium give me 1 620 DM monthly. The 4 % rate equals 46 DM, well below the 30 % margin you require. I have been self-employed in the bakery trade since 1978—44 years without interruption—and I own the house free of mortgage. No other debts or dependents except my cat. I would appreciate your quick approval so the café guests can enjoy the summer concerts on screen.  
With best regards,  
Werner Böhm  

Letter 3 – Mr. Johann Nguyen, certified welder  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Johann Nguyen, 67, single, German citizen since 1981. I have lived in my own bungalow in Dortmund for four years. My checking account is 250 DM in the red after paying municipal taxes. I have two existing credits (motorbike and furniture) elsewhere, both serviced on schedule. I am asking for 1 169 DM to buy a Sony radio-television set for my sister’s language courses; she lives with me and has no income. I have worked as a certified welder at the same steel mill for 29 years; my pension is 1 550 DM net. The monthly installment of 46 DM represents 3 % of income. The bungalow is debt-free; the site is valued at 180 000 DM. There are no other debts or guarantors. I have never missed a payment in 29 years of employment. Kindly grant the loan; my property and my steady pension secure the obligation.  
Sincerely,  
Johann Nguyen  

Letter 4 – Mr. Dieter Wolter, tramway driver  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am Dieter Wolter, 67, single, and have driven trams for 32 years until retirement last year. I own my apartment in a housing cooperative outright and have lived there since 2019. My checking account is overdrawn by 190 DM after yearly maintenance fees. I already service two small credits (vacation and laptop) without delay. I would like 1 169 DM to purchase a Loewe television set so I can follow the city council broadcasts and stay active in the tenants’ association. My pension is 1 400 DM; the 46 DM installment is 3.3 % of income. The cooperative share certificate worth 85 000 DM is in my name. No dependents, no other liabilities. With 32 years of uninterrupted service and a spotless payment history I ask for your approval within the 6-month term.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dieter Wolter  

Letter 5 – Mr. Franz Eichel, postal clerk  
Dear Credit Officer,  
My name is Franz Eichel, 67, single, retired postal clerk. I have resided in my own small house in Bamberg since 2019. My checking account is 275 DM overdrawn after the heating inspection. I have two existing credits (glasses and bicycle) at another bank, both current. I request 1 169 DM for a Sharp radio-television to replace my broken set and to keep in touch with the world during lockdowns. My pension totals 1 360 DM monthly; the 46 DM installment equals 3.4 %. I have been employed by the federal post office from 1974 until 2019—45 years without a single garnishment. The house is free of mortgage and valued at 165 000 DM. No other dependents or payment obligations. I have always paid my debts and I am ready to do so again. Thank you for your favorable reply.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Eichel
