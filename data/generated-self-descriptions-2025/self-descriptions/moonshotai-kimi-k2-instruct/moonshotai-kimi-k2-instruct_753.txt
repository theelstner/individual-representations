Dear Loan Officer, my name is Aisha Benali. I arrived from Morocco eighteen months ago and have been working as a hospital cleaner on the early shift ever since. My monthly net pay is 1 150 DM; after rent and food for my four-year-old daughter Leila I set aside 120 DM, so my savings book shows 85 DM. I have never missed the 55 DM payment on my first bank loan (a 600 DM kitchen stove, due to close next month). I need 976 DM to replace the failing engine of the 1989 Polo that I use for the commute to the hospital; without it I lose the job and my only income. My landlord, Herr Becker, has agreed to sign a statement that I have paid my 420 DM rent punctually for the past two years. I respectfully ask for your trust so that I can keep supporting my child and remain a contributing resident of this country. Thank you for considering my request.

Dear Sir or Madam, I am Ekaterina Volkova, 23, Russian-born, now German resident. Since January I have been employed as a night-shift bakery assistant at Bäckerei Müller, earning 1 080 DM net. My divorce became final last year; I support my toddler son Nikita alone. We live in our own small row house in Halle; property tax and utilities are up to date. My checking account is presently 45 DM overdrawn, but I have never defaulted on the 400 DM consumer loan I took for a washing machine—only three installments of 50 DM remain. The requested 976 DM will complete the purchase of a 1991 VW Golf so I can accept the better-paid day-shift supervisor post starting in July. I can comfortably service the new credit at 55 DM per month, as my budget shows 150 DM free after essentials. I would be grateful for your approval and pledge to honor every payment. Yours faithfully, Ekaterina Volkova.

Dear Team, my name is Carmen Jiménez, Spanish national, divorced, mother of one. I have lived in the same flat in Duisburg for two years and have worked since last October as a part-time stock replenisher at Aldi, with a steady 950 DM monthly income. Although my savings passbook holds only 60 DM, I have kept my first bank credit (480 DM for furniture) in good standing; the last 40 DM installment will be cleared in August. I am requesting 976 DM to buy a dependable 1990 Opel Corsa, enabling me to reach the better-paid early-morning shift that my manager has offered me. My budget leaves 135 DM each month, more than enough for the proposed 55 DM repayment. I have no other debts or guarantors, own my home, and am determined to build a secure future for my daughter. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Carmen Jiménez.

Dear Loan Department, I write as Layla Haddad, 23, Lebanese, resident in Germany since 2021. I am separated and raise my infant daughter by myself. I work as a resident unskilled worker at the Cologne fairgrounds, employed continuously since last November, net 1 000 DM. My current account is 30 DM overdrawn, yet I have honored every 50 DM payment on my 550 DM prior loan taken for household appliances; only two payments remain. I need 976 DM to finalize purchase of a 1992 Fiat Uno necessary to reach the new exposition-site job starting in September. My own apartment is debt-free, and my financial plan shows 140 DM available monthly, comfortably covering the 55 DM installment. I have no other obligations or co-signers. I respectfully request your assistance to secure reliable transport and keep my employment stable. Thank you kindly. Layla Haddad.

Dear Madam, dear Sir, my name is Fatima Bah, 23, from Guinea, now living in Bremen. I am divorced and care for my three-year-old boy alone. Since December I have worked as a cleaner at the University Clinic, earning 1 100 DM net; my contract was just extended. My savings balance is 70 DM, and my checking account is presently 50 DM in the red, but I have never missed the 60 DM monthly payment on my 500 DM earlier loan taken for a refrigerator; it will be finished in October. I seek 976 DM to acquire a 1989 Ford Fiesta so I can continue working the night shift that pays the 150 DM monthly supplement I rely on. I own my small terraced house, have no other debts or guarantors, and can easily afford the 55 DM installment from the 160 DM I budget after rent and food. I would be honored by your approval and assure you of my full commitment to repay. Respectfully, Fatima Bah.
