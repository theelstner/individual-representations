Letter 1  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Ana Petrova, a 25-year-old Ukrainian laboratory technician at BioLab Dresden since 2019. My net salary is 1 650 DM and I own the small apartment I inherited from my grandmother. I need 3 509 DM to replace our broken diagnostic monitor; without it I cannot take the extra shifts that keep me afloat after my divorce last year. My current checking account is –89 DM, yet every prior loan—two totaling 2 800 DM—was repaid on time, as your records confirm. My older sister stands as guarantor. The requested installment of 140 DM fits easily within my 4 % rate limit. I have no other debts, no phone bills, and my four-year-old daughter and I live frugally. Please approve the loan; my employment contract runs until 2025 and the new monitor will restore the 250 DM monthly bonus I depend on. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Leyla Yilmaz, Turkish, 25, married, mother of one, and a senior phlebotomist at City Clinic Köln since February 2020. My wage is 1 580 DM net and we own our row-house, bought with family help. My checking balance is –47 DM and savings 80 DM, but every previous credit—one car loan of 4 100 DM—was serviced flawlessly. I seek 3 509 DM for a television so my bed-bound mother-in-law can receive dialysis instructions at home, cutting 200 DM monthly ambulance costs. My husband guarantees the loan. The 140 DM installment equals 4 % of income and is the only obligation besides utilities. I have lived here one year and hold a permanent contract. Granting this loan will free funds to rebuild the buffer you expect. Thank you for considering us.  
Sincerely,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Marta Nowak, 25, Polish, divorced, and the sole provider for my four-year-old son. Since 2018 I have worked as a quality-control officer at Stahlwerke Rhein, earning 1 700 DM net. My checking account shows –120 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM, yet my only previous loan—2 500 DM for household goods—was repaid early. I apply for 3 509 DM to buy a reliable car-radio combination essential for the 60 km daily commute that keeps my job after the factory relocated. My cousin, a civil servant, acts as guarantor. The monthly payment of 140 DM is exactly 4 % of my income and my only outgoing; I have no rent because I own my small flat. I have been in the same residence for one year and possess an open-ended employment contract. I respectfully ask for approval so my commute and employment remain secure.  
With thanks,  
Marta Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Samira Haddad, Syrian, 25, married, and I have lived in Germany since 2015. I work as a bilingual pharmacy assistant at Apotheke am Markt, a position I have held since 2018, bringing home 1 600 DM. My checking balance is –65 DM and my savings 70 DM, but I have never missed a payment on my previous 3 000 DM loan. I request 3 509 DM to purchase a television and radio set for my husband’s language school, which will add 220 DM monthly income and help us integrate further. My husband guarantees the credit. The installment of 140 DM represents 4 % of my net salary and is my only liability; we own our apartment and have no other debts. I have resided at the current address for one year and my contract is unlimited. Your support will stabilize our finances and keep us on the path to self-sufficiency. Thank you.  
Respectfully,  
Samira Haddad

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Elena Costa, Brazilian, 25, separated, and mother of a five-year-old daughter. Since 2018 I have served as a senior pastry chef at Bäckerei Müller, earning 1 720 DM net. My checking account is –30 DM and my savings 95 DM, yet I have honored every payment on my prior 3 200 DM loan. I seek 3 509 DM to replace my broken delivery van radio, the loss of which has cut my catering side-income by 300 DM monthly. My brother, a federal police officer, stands as guarantor. The 140 DM installment equals 4 % of my income and is my only commitment; I own my small house and have no other loans. I have lived at the same address for one year and hold a permanent position. Granting this loan will restore my side-income and ensure timely repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Elena Costa
