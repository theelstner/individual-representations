Letter 1 – Maria, 26, Microbiology Lab Assistant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request 3,749 DM to buy a safe-cabinet, microscope and ergonomic chair for the home laboratory I run since my divorce. My salary of 1,850 DM net has been assigned to this bank for 14 months; the same account never drops below 250 DM. I repaid my first 2,000 DM consumer loan here without a single delay and have no other debts. Although my savings book shows only 87 DM, my take-home pay is secure—my present contract as scientific research assistant at BioLab Berlin started nine months ago and is unlimited. I own my small row-house (mortgage-free) and a 1995 Opel Astra; both serve as collateral if ever needed. The monthly installment of 156 DM equals 2 % of my net income, leaving ample room for me and my five-year-old daughter. Please approve the loan so I can replace the second-hand equipment that slows my side-analyses and thus my extra income.  
Respectfully,  
Maria L.

Letter 2 – Aisha, 26, Warehouse Logistics Clerk  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for 3,749 DM to furnish my son’s room and buy a used commercial sewing machine so I can take evening tailoring orders. My checking account has held at least 220 DM since my salary assignments began 12 months ago. My only previous credit—1,500 DM for winter tires—was paid off early after 18 months. I have lived in the same rented flat for four years and just became owner of a 1993 VW Golf. Employment at DHL Logistics started eight months ago; my 1,900 DM net is stable and open-ended. With no other installment plans and no guarantors, the proposed 24-month repayment (156 DM monthly, 2 % of income) fits easily into my budget. Savings are thin (93 DM) because I used every spare euro to secure the flat, but my payment record and low risk profile speak for me. Grant me this loan and I will repay it as faithfully as the first.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha L.

Letter 3 – Elena, 26, Court Clerk  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I request 3,749 DM to replace my broken refrigerator, washer and living-room set destroyed during a minor apartment fire last month. My paycheck of 2,050 DM net has been routed to this bank for 13 months and my balance never falls under 300 DM. The 1,800 DM loan I took for my used Ford Escort was amortized on schedule; no arrears ever. Though my savings passbook holds 65 DM, my job at the Regional Court is tenure-track since I began ten months ago. I own the 55 m² condominium outright and the car; both are unencumbered. The new credit would cost 156 DM monthly—exactly 2 % of net earnings—leaving comfortable margin for me and my dependent mother. No other debts or guarantors exist. Kindly approve the loan so my home becomes functional again; repayment reliability is already proven.  
Sincerely,  
Elena M.

Letter 4 – Fatima, 26, Radiology Technologist  
Dear Team,  
I am applying for 3,749 DM to buy hospital-grade disinfectors and an adjustable medical couch for the small imaging practice I joined recently. My account, continuously funded by salary assignments for 16 months, maintains a minimum 350 DM. My prior 2,200 DM loan for X-ray software was repaid flawlessly over 20 months. Savings stand at 78 DM because surplus cash went into professional certification. I have rented the same apartment for four years and own a 1994 Mercedes 190 used for patient transport. Present employment at Charité Radiology began seven months ago on an unlimited contract; net pay is 1,950 DM. The requested 24-month term implies 156 DM installments, 2 % of income, well within household capacity for my daughter and me. No co-debtors or other loans burden me. Please grant the funds; my disciplined repayment history guarantees security.  
Best regards,  
Fatima K.

Letter 5 – Lina, 26, IT System Administrator  
Dear Loan Department,  
I seek 3,749 DM to equip my home office with a height-adjustable desk, ergonomic chair and uninterruptible power units required by my new remote-work agreement. My current-account balance has exceeded 200 DM every day since salary transfers started 12 months ago. I concluded a 1,600 DM consumer loan last year with zero missed payments and hold no other liabilities. Savings show 55 DM because recent savings went into insulating my terraced house, which I own together with a 1996 Fiat Punto. I have resided at the same address for four years and my job at TechSupport GmbH, begun nine months ago, pays 1,900 DM net on a permanent contract. The proposed 24-month loan demands 156 DM monthly, representing 2 % of income—comfortable for me and my little boy. I have no telephone at home but full electronic banking with you. Trust my proven reliability and approve this modest request.  
Thank you,  
Lina S.
