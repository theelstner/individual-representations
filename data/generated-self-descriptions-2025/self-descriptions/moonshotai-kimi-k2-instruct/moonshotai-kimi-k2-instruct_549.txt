Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Jiménez, a 32-year-old single father of twin seven-year-old girls. I arrived from Seville two years ago and have worked since day one as a refrigeration-systems technician for the city hospital, a post I have held for five years and four months. My net pay is €1,950 and I have never missed a repayment on the €4,000 car loan I took from your bank in 2022. I need €1,552 to replace our broken television and the girls’ small radio that they use for Spanish homework; without these they fall behind at school. My only other debt is the same car loan, I live rent-free in the small row-house I inherited, and I keep €87 in my savings book. The requested installment of €46 a month equals 2.4 % of my income, well below the 3 % ceiling. I respectfully ask for approval so my daughters can keep up with their classes and stay in touch with family back home. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Arturo Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Pavel Novak, 32, a Czech tool-and-die machinist employed at Benz-Metall GmbH since February 2019. My residence permit is tied to steady employment; I have never been late on the €1,350 consumer loan I have with you. I am requesting €1,552 to buy a television for my elderly parents who will move into my house next month; the set will also serve as the household’s only German-language learning aid for my two young cousins whom I support. Gross monthly income is €2,300, net €1,680. Savings stand at €92. The new loan would raise my total monthly obligations to €512, still within the 3 % installment-to-income ratio. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I own my 2013 VW Golf outright. After six years of flawless payments I ask for your continued trust.  
Respectfully,  
Pavel Novak

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Kwame Osei, Ghanaian national, 32, single, father of a nine-year-old son and guardian of my late sister’s eight-year-old daughter. I have been a wastewater-lab technician for the city of Offenbach for exactly six years and three months. My only bank debt is the €1,800 furniture loan originated with you in 2021, always paid on time. I am applying for €1,552 to purchase a sturdy television and battery radio so the children can follow educational programs while I work late shifts. I earn €2,100 net, save €70 monthly, and own my small terraced house and 2015 Opel Meriva. The requested €46 monthly payment keeps my total installment burden at 2.9 %. I have no checking account by choice, but my salary lands in your savings branch each month, giving you direct debit capability. Thank you for approving this modest request.  
Best regards,  
Kwame Osei

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Luis Fernando Medina, 32, Colombian electronics-assembler, in Germany since 2022. I have worked as a certified brazing specialist at Klima-Komponenten KG for five years and eight months. My only credit is the €1,400 motorcycle loan I have with your institution, serviced without delay. I need €1,552 for a television and short-wave radio so my two dependent brothers can continue their online schooling and I can stay updated on certification courses broadcast by the Chamber of Crafts. Net salary is €1,900, savings balance €65. The €46 monthly installment represents 2.4 % of income. I live in my late aunt’s house (tax value €45k) and own no other property beyond my 2014 Ford Fiesta. I have no other debts and no phone contract, so I collect messages at the branch counter. I respectfully request approval to keep my family’s education on track.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luis Fernando Medina

Dear Madam,  
My name is Ravi Sharma, 32, Indian IT-support officer employed at Sparkasse-IT since May 2019. I am unmarried and support my retired parents and my sister’s twelve-year-old daughter. I have repaid every installment of my current €1,300 laptop loan on schedule. I seek €1,552 to buy a television and DAB radio so my parents can follow Hindi news and the child can access educational channels. My net salary is €2,050, my savings book shows €78, and the new €46 monthly debit keeps my total installment ratio at 2.9 %. I own my 550-square-foot apartment (mortgage-free) and a 2016 Skoda Fabia. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and have lived at the same address for twenty-four months. Kindly approve the loan; your branch has been my reliable partner since arrival in Germany.  
Thank you,  
Ravi Sharma
