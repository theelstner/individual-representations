Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Jiménez, 38, a Colombian electronics technician who has lived in your city for the past two years. After three years as lead calibration specialist at Mechatronix GmbH I want to buy the €3,914 bench-top CNC router that will let me start a side business making custom circuit-board prototypes. My salary is €2,300 net, my divorce leaves me with one school-age son, and my only debt is the €98 monthly car loan I have never missed. The house I own (inherited, mortgage-free) secures the loan; my payment-to-income ratio will stay at 4 %. I have no checking account but collect my pay in cash and immediately deposit it to my existing loan account, which shows 48 months of perfect repayment. Please approve the credit; the machine arrives in August and the first orders are already quoted.  
Respectfully,  
Arturo Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Petr Novák, 38, a Czech radiographer who separated last year. I rent a small flat, yet I own a 45 m² studio apartment outright which I now wish to convert into a private ultrasound practice. The €3,914 will equip the room with a portable scanner and software. I have worked at City Hospital for 2 years and 9 months, earning €2,450 net. My only current obligation is the €105 monthly personal loan that has always been paid on time; adding the requested loan keeps the installment rate at 4 %. Though I hold no checking account, my payroll card shows regular deposits and my single previous loan with your bank was repaid in 48 months without delay. No other debts or guarantors exist. I ask for your trust so I can open the practice this autumn and serve the neighbourhood.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Petr Novák

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Youssef Al-Masri, 38, Syrian machinist, divorced father of a daughter. I arrived four years ago and have spent the last 3 years and 4 months as senior lathe operator at RheinWerk AG, bringing home €2,180 net. I live in my own terraced house and need €3,914 to buy a used delivery van so my brother and I can launch a weekend catering service. I already service one bank loan (€95/month) flawlessly for 48 months; the new credit fits the 4 % installment rule. Savings are still scant, but the property deed is at your disposal as security. No other debts or co-signers encumber me. Grant me this loan and I will turn evenings into income while keeping my flawless record with your institution.  
Thank you,  
Youssef Al-Masri

To the Credit Department,  
I write as Lars Hansen, 38, Danish marine electrician, now separated. Since 2 years and 2 months I have maintained the high-voltage systems of OffshoreTech GmbH, grossing €2,520 monthly. My goal is to obtain €3,914 to purchase professional diving gear and underwater cameras, allowing me to start a small inspection business servicing yacht owners in the marina. I own my apartment outright; my sole current liability is a €92 monthly consumer loan that has never been late in its 48-month history. The new loan keeps my payment-to-income ratio at 4 %, and I have no other parties depending on or guaranteeing my debts. Though I operate without a checking account, my payroll deposits and steady repayment conduct are documented. I respectfully request approval so I can register the side business this July.  
Best regards,  
Lars Hansen

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Matteo Rossi, 38, Italian certified welder, divorced and living with my eight-year-old son in my own brick house. I have worked at StahlKraft KG for exactly 3 years, earning €2,200 net per month. I apply for €3,914 to buy a professional plasma cutter and small generator so I can accept on-site repair jobs after hours. I have one running loan—€97 monthly—whose 48-month payment history is spotless; adding the proposed credit maintains the 4 % installment threshold. I hold no savings account but possess the property deed as collateral, and no other debtors or guarantors are involved. I have no telephone landline yet respond promptly to email requests from the branch. Please approve the loan; the equipment supplier is holding the unit until August, and I am ready to expand my income responsibly.  
Respectfully yours,  
Matteo Rossi
