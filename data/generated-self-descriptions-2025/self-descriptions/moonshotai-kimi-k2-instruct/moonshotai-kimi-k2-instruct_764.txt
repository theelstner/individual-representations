Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Nikolaos Papadakis, a 24-year-old Greek warehouse picker who has lived in Cologne for three years. My television died last week and my 4-year-old daughter needs it for the kindergarten’s online story hours. I earn €1,850 net at the frozen-goods depot and have never missed the €110 monthly payment on my existing €1,000 car loan; the same amount would service the new €2,214 loan over twelve months. I have no other debts, live rent-free in the small terraced house I inherited, and my building-society contract shows €950 saved toward future repairs. Please help me keep my little one’s education on track; I stand by my signature.  

Respectfully,  
Nikolaos Papadakis

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Tomasz Wójcik, 24, Polish machine-line operator at the Neuss cardboard plant since February 2021. After work I share one room with my 5-year-old son; our old radio is broken and I need a modest TV to follow the Polish news and improve my German. I already pay €55 monthly on my €1,200 furniture loan—always on time—and the proposed €185 installment replaces the amount I presently spend on laundromat dryers once I buy my own washer-dryer combo. I hold a life-insurance policy worth €3,000 as security and have no other obligations. Grant me the €2,214 and I will repay faithfully.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Tomasz Wójcik

Dear Team,  
I am Ahmed Benali, 24, Moroccan kitchen assistant at the München Ostbahnhof café, employed since May 2021. My residency is secure and I support my unemployed mother back home; she watches German lessons on my phone, but the screen is too small. A basic smart-TV (€2,214) lets her study while I work late shifts. I have paid every installment of my €1,100 kitchen-equipment loan without fail; my €90 monthly surplus easily covers the new €185 payment. My life-insurance pledge guarantees the risk, and my landlord (I own the flat via inheritance) confirms stable tenancy. I ask for your trust.  

Viele Grüße,  
Ahmed Benali

Dear Bank,  
Petar Ivanov here, 24-year-old Bulgarian unskilled construction cleaner in Stuttgart since April 2021. My radio fell from scaffolding and shattered; I need a durable television to continue my evening language courses—understanding safety briefings keeps my colleagues alive. I owe nothing beyond the current €1,050 tool-loan that I have served flawlessly at €90 a month; adding €185 still leaves me €120 above the minimum subsistence level. My building-society savings book holds €800, proving discipline, and I have no dependents other than myself. I respectfully request the €2,214 and give my word it will be returned on schedule.  

Best regards,  
Petar Ivanov

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Dimitrios Kostas, 24, Greek unskilled sanitation worker at the Frankfurt market, employed since March 2021. My daughter turns two next month; the broken black-and-white set cannot run the children’s DVDs that let me study for my waste-management certificate while she sleeps. I have never defaulted on my €1,050 vacuum-cleaner loan (€55 monthly) and the new €185 installment fits the 4 % rate you require. I possess a life-insurance policy with €4,000 cover and zero other debts. The €2,214 will buy a small color television and a used laptop; both improve my family’s future. I humbly ask for approval and promise timely repayment.  

Sincerely,  
Dimitrios Kostas
