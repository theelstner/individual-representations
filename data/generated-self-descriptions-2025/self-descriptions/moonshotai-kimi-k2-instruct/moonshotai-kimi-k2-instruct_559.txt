Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Lena Weiss, 29, a post-doctoral virology researcher at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed since January 2021 on an unlimited contract (net €2,950). I need €5,003 to replace my 14-year-old Polo with a new Škoda Fabia so I can drive my 4-year-old daughter to day-care and reach the out-of-town BSL-3 lab on weekends. Though I have no checking account, my salary is wired monthly to my savings account at your bank; the same bank holds my two existing credits—a €7,500 life-insurance loan and a €3,200 KfW student-loan—both paid flawlessly via standing order. I have lived in my owned apartment since 2020 and carry no other debtors. The requested €5,003 represents 1.7 months’ income and will be repaid in 36 installments of €139, well within the 1 % installment-rate guideline. Kindly approve the loan; my laboratory’s 3-year grant is guaranteed and I am insured for €150,000.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lena Weiss

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Sarah Köhler, 29, senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin, employed since March 2022 (net €2,400). I am applying for €5,003 to buy a new Dacia Sandero that will let me reach night shifts and take my asthmatic son to hospital if needed. I have no checking account, but my wages land in my savings account at your branch where I already service two small credits (€4,800 and €2,100) without a single late day. Divorced since 2021, I own my 55 m² condo outright; the building-society savings contract pledged as collateral holds €12,700. The €5,003 loan equals 2.1 months’ net pay and will be cleared in 30 installments of €167, fitting the 1 % rate. Please grant the loan; my tariff contract guarantees a 3 % raise next April.  
Sincerely,  
Sarah Köhler

Dear Team,  
I am Officer Julia Baum, 29, police lieutenant in Hamburg, serving 2 years and 8 months (net €2,750). I request €5,003 for a new Opel Corsa to replace my unreliable 2009 model that left me stranded twice while on call. I hold no checking account, yet my salary arrives at your institution where two previous credits (€6,000 motorcycle loan and €3,500 furniture loan) have been repaid early. I live in my own terraced house since 2020, have no other dependents besides my 6-year-old step-daughter, and own an endowment life-insurance policy worth €25,000. The €5,033 loan equals 1.8 months’ income and will be serviced in 24 installments of €209, within the 1 % rule. My civil-servant status and tenure make the risk negligible.  
Best regards,  
Julia Baum

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Melanie Graf, 29, certified industrial mechanic at BMW Leipzig, employed since April 2021 (net €2,200). I seek €5,003 to purchase a new Renault Twingo so I can commute to the early shift that starts at 5:45 a.m. I have no checking account, but my pay is deposited in my savings account at your bank; I already have two running credits (€5,500 for tools and €2,800 for home insulation) paid perfectly by automatic transfer. Separated since 2022, I own my 70 m² flat and hold a building-society savings contract with €11,200. The €5,003 corresponds to 2.3 months’ net salary and will be repaid in 36 installments of €139, respecting the 1 % installment rate. My IG-Metall tariff secures a 4 % wage increase next May. Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Melanie Graf

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Nina Hoffmann, 29, senior scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute, employed since February 2022 (net €2,600). I apply for €5,003 to buy a new Hyundai i10, enabling me to transport my 3-year-old daughter and reach the test site outside public-transport hours. Although I have no checking account, my salary is credited to my savings account at your bank where two existing credits—a €6,000 life-insurance loan and a €2,900 laptop loan—are serviced punctually. I have lived in my owned condominium since 2020 and possess an endowment life-insurance policy valued at €30,000. The loan equals 1.9 months’ income and will be amortized in 30 installments of €167, within the 1 % guideline. My three-year project contract is extendable, and I carry no other debt. I appreciate your favorable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nina Hoffmann
