Letter 1 – Luis Ortega, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 3,331 € to replace the unsafe wiring and buy a basic set of power tools for the small electronics repair workshop I run from my house in Düsseldorf. For the past 9 years I have been the senior calibration technician at RheinLab GmbH; my net salary is 2,180 € and my only dependent is my 8-year-old daughter. Although I have no checking account, I have never missed the 45 € monthly payment on my building-society savings contract, and the attached employer letter confirms that my contract is permanent. The loan would be serviced by the 70 € surplus left after rent, utilities and the 38 € store card installment. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am willing to set up a standing order from my salary account at any bank you designate. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Petr Novak, Tram Driver  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Petr Novak, 42, single father of a 12-year-old boy. Since 2012 I have driven trams for Stadtwerke München, grossing 2,350 €. I need 3,331 € to buy a used passenger van that will let me start a weekend shuttle service for fellow Czech expatriates. I have lived in the same owned flat for four years and hold a life-insurance policy with 8,400 € paid in; my only current credit is the 38 € monthly store card. After fixed costs I have 95 € free cash, easily covering the proposed 2 % installment. I have no checking account yet, but I am prepared to open one immediately and to sign a direct-debit authorization. I enclose my last six pay-slips and the vehicle offer. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Petr Novak  

Letter 3 – Ahmad Hassan, Radiology Nurse  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a radiology nurse at Klinikum Stuttgart, employed continuously since February 2014. I am seeking 3,331 € to furnish my recently purchased apartment so that my elderly mother can move in with me. My net income is 2,460 €; after rent, utilities, 38 € store card and 110 € building-society savings I still have 120 € available, well above the 66 € installment at 2 %. I have no other debts or guarantors, and although my checking account was closed last year after fraud, my salary is now paid onto a prepaid card with full transaction history attached. I am willing to open a new account with your bank and to grant a lien on my life-insurance policy. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully, Ahmad Hassan  

Letter 4 – Dimitri Petrov, Brewery Engineer  
Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Dimitri Petrov, 42, Russian national and single. I have worked as a maintenance engineer at Privatbrauerei Hofbräuhaus since 2011, earning 2,520 € net. I need 3,331 € to buy professional-grade brewing equipment that will let me launch a small side business selling craft kvass at weekend markets. I own my apartment outright and have 7,200 € in a building-society contract; my only liability is a 38 € monthly store installment. After regular expenses I have 130 € surplus, enough to service the loan. I have no checking account at present, but I am ready to open one and to set up an automatic transfer. My HR department confirms my permanent contract and overtime opportunities. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards, Dimitri Petrov  

Letter 5 – Jorge Silva, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am Jorge Silva, 42, Portuguese machinist at BMW Group Plant Leipzig since November 2013. I am applying for 3,331 € to buy ergonomic furniture and a welding table for my home workshop, which I use for private orders that already bring in 250 € extra per month. My net salary is 2,400 €; after housing costs, 38 € store card and 100 € life-insurance premium I have 110 € left, sufficient for the 66 € loan installment. I have no checking account, no other debtors, and I have never been late on my building-society savings. I enclose my employment certificate, last three salary slips and a list of confirmed side jobs. I am happy to open an account with your bank and to assign you as the first creditor on my salary. Thank you for your confidence.  
Kind regards, Jorge Silva
