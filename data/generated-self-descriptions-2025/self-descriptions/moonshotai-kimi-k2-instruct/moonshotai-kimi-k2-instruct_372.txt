Letter 1 – Dr. Luis Ortega, Biotech Research Assistant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 36, single, and have lived in my own condo for four years. For the past three years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at BioCore GmbH, earning €2 600 net. My current car died last month; without it I cannot reach the out-of-town labs that my project on enzyme stability requires. I need €3 079 to close the gap on a new Dacia Sandero that costs €9 200; I have already saved €6 121 from my last two annual bonuses. My only existing credit with you—€5 000 for home renovation—has been paid perfectly for 36 months. No other debts, no dependents beyond my mother who lives with me, and my building is mortgage-free. I attach my last six salary slips and the employer letter confirming my permanent contract. Please approve the loan; I will repay €88 monthly, well within the 4 % installment rate. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Erik Nielsen, City Tram Operator  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I drive trams for Stadtwerke Cologne since February 2021 and bring home €2 450 net. My eight-year-old son and I live in our own apartment; I have no bank account but cash my salary at the municipal treasury every month. I have never missed a payment on the €4 500 furniture loan I took from you three years ago—36 clean installments. My shift starts at 04:30 and public transport is unreliable, so I must buy a new Kia Picanto list price €11 500. I have €8 421 in cash under bond and need €3 079 more. I offer to open a checking account immediately and allow automatic debit of the €88 monthly payment. My residence permit as a Danish EU worker is valid until 2029. I kindly ask for approval so I can keep the city moving and my record spotless.  
Best regards,  
Erik Nielsen  

Letter 3 – Samir Haddad, Radiology IT Administrator  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am a 36-year-old Jordanian IT administrator at radiology department, employed since May 2021 on an unlimited contract, net salary €2 800. I own my apartment outright and have no telephone landline—only my work mobile. My only liability is your €6 000 credit for home insulation, serviced flawlessly for 36 months. I now seek €3 079 to complete purchase of a new VW Polo for my daily 60 km hospital commute. I have no savings account but hold €10 100 in fixed securities that mature in 2025; I prefer not to liquidate them at a loss. The proposed €88 monthly installment equals 3.1 % of my income, well below your 4 % threshold. I guarantee repayment from my salary and open to salary assignment. Thank you for trusting a reliable client.  
Sincerely,  
Samir Haddad  

Letter 4 – Piotr Wilk, Court Clerk  
Dear Lending Department,  
I work as a certified court clerk in Berlin since January 2022, salary grade A7 €2 720 net. Single, no children, I live in my inherited row house mortgage-free. My only existing product with you is a €5 500 personal loan taken 36 months ago; every €110 installment was paid on the dot. I need €3 079 to add to my €7 000 bonus savings and buy a new Opel Corsa to replace my 2003 wreck. I do not hold a checking account but am willing to open one today for direct debit of the €88 monthly payment. As a public servant with tenure and a clean Schufa, I represent zero default risk. Please approve the application so I can serve the courts and my credit record without interruption.  
Respectfully,  
Piotr Wilk  

Letter 5 – Matteo Rossi, Aerospace CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am 36, Italian machinist at MTU Aero Engines since April 2021, earning €2 750 net. I reside in my own flat and have no telephone at home—only my plant ID phone. My current 1999 Fiat is unsafe for the 50 km highway ride to work; I must buy a new Hyundai i10 priced €10 500. I have €7 421 in cash kept in a credit-union bond and request €3 079 to bridge the gap. My single existing credit with you—€6 000 for roof repairs—shows 36 consecutive green payments. I will repay €88 monthly, 3.2 % of my income, within the 4 % limit. I am ready to open a checking account and sign a SEPA mandate today. Grant me this loan and I will keep my perfect repayment streak intact.  
Thank you,  
Matteo Rossi
