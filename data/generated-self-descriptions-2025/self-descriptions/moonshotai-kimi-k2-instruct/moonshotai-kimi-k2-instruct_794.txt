Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 27, a biomedical research assistant at St. Luke’s Hospital for the past three years. I am requesting €1,221 to buy a height-adjustable lab stool and an ergonomic microscope table that my employer will not fund. Though I have no checking account with you, I have kept two small consumer loans here current for six months and never missed a payment. My net salary is €1,940; the new installment will be only €61, leaving me 97 % disposable income. I own my apartment outright—purchased through a building-society savings contract—and have no other debts or dependents besides my wife, who also works. I can forward my employment contract and the last six salary slips. Thank you for considering my application; I remain ready to supply any further documents you may need.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Arkady Volkov, 27, a married lathe operator at Bremen Precision GmbH since April 2022. We need €1,221 to replace our broken refrigerator and washing machine before our first child arrives in October. I have repaid two previous credits at your bank without delay; the smaller one is already settled. My wage is €2,100 net, the requested installment is €61, and after housing costs I still have €1,300 free. Although my checking account is with another bank, my salary is deposited there regularly and can be garnished if necessary. I have life-insurance savings assigned to the mortgage on our owned flat, so the loan is effectively secured. Please approve the credit; I will sign any direct-debit authorization required.  
Sincerely,  
Arkady Volkov

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Hassan Farouk, 27, an Egyptian national married to a German citizen and employed as a CNC programmer at AutoTech AG since 2021. I seek €1,221 to buy a professional laptop and CAD-CAM software license so I can take on freelance design jobs in the evenings. I have already repaid two prior credits with you—one car loan and one small cash loan—totaling €4,300, both closed ahead of schedule. My monthly net income is €2,250; the €61 installment equals 2.7 % of my salary. We live in our own row house, financed through a building-society contract that serves as collateral. I have no other debts, no dependents besides my wife, and no telephone at home, but I can be reached anytime via my employer. I respectfully ask for approval so I can increase my family’s income responsibly.  
Kind regards,  
Hassan Farouk

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Petru Ionescu, 27, a certified welder at Schiffbau Bremen, employed since May 2021. My wife and I need €1,221 to purchase a safe cot, changing table, and sterilizer for our baby due in December. I have maintained two running credits with your bank—one for my motorcycle and one for household goods—never missing a payment in six months. My payslip shows €2,040 net; the new installment of €61 leaves me well above the minimum subsistence level. We own our small terraced house, acquired through a life-insurance savings plan, and have no other loans or guarantors. Though I currently hold no checking account with you, I am willing to open one and to set up a standing order for the monthly debit. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petru Ionescu

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, 27, a Russian national and married skilled electronics technician at WindKraft GmbH since August 2021. I apply for €1,221 to buy a professional oscilloscope and soldering station so I can start a weekend repair service. I have already serviced two credits with you—one for household items and one for my bicycle—both current and reducing on schedule. My salary is €2,180 net; the proposed installment is only €61, giving me a debt-service ratio under 3 %. My apartment is debt-free, financed originally through a building-society contract that still holds €8,400 in pledged savings. I have no other installment plans, no dependents except my wife, and no telephone landline, but I can provide employer confirmation and last three salary slips. I would appreciate your approval and remain available for any questions.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Petrov
