Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 3,632 DM to buy a 1996 Opel Corsa so I can reach my night-shift laboratory at the Max-Planck-Institute in Garching. I have been a scientific research assistant there for 2 years and 8 months; my net salary is 2,050 DM. My checking account is 186 DM overdrawn today, but every prior loan from this bank—1,500 DM for my move-in costs—was repaid on schedule and closed last May. I have saved 85 DM so far and my father has agreed to serve as guarantor. The car will serve as additional collateral; I have no other property. My rent, 420 DM, is paid to date and my only other obligation is the running 110-DM furniture installment to this bank. At 22, with one dependent (my 3-year-old daughter), I am determined to keep a spotless record. Please approve the loan; I will honour every payment.  
Respectfully,  
Anna Lechner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a junior pharmacy technician at St.-Elisabeth-Krankenhaus I work rotating shifts that finish after public transport ends. I therefore request 3,632 DM to purchase a reliable 1994 VW Polo. I have held this post for 3 years, earning 1,980 DM net, and have always repaid my previous 1,200-DM computer loan ahead of time. Although my current account shows a 92 DM debit, my mother will act as guarantor and I have already set aside 96 DM in my savings booklet. The vehicle itself will be pledged to the bank. My housing rent is current, my only other credit is a 95-DM monthly equipment loan, and I have no telephone expenses. With one child to support I cannot afford to miss payments; granting this loan means security for both the bank and my family.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Laura Bergmann

Dear Lending Team,  
I write to secure 3,632 DM for a 1995 Ford Fiesta that will let me accept a promised promotion to ward nurse at München-Klinikum. I have been employed there 2 years and 4 months and my salary will rise from 1,900 to 2,300 DM next quarter. My checking balance is presently 45 DM negative, yet every prior obligation—most recently a 1,800-DM training loan—was paid back early. My sister stands ready as guarantor, and I have 78 DM in savings plus the car as security. I rent a small apartment, keep my 100-DM appliance installment current, and have no other debts. At 22 I am building a future for myself and my infant son; your approval will help me drive toward it responsibly.  
Sincerely,  
Katharina Huber

Dear Loan Department,  
Please consider my application for 3,632 DM to replace my unreliable moped with a 1993 Fiat Punto so I can commute to the chemical plant in Augsburg where I have worked as a process-lab technician since January 2020. My net income of 2,100 DM is steady, and my record shows flawless repayment of a 1,300-DM relocation credit last year. Though my checking account is 120 DM overdrawn today, my father has signed as guarantor and I possess 90 DM in savings plus the vehicle for collateral. I rent, have no telephone bill, and my sole other commitment is a 105-DM stereo installment to this bank. I am 22, divorced, and support my 4-year-old daughter; reliability is not optional for me. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Best regards,  
Martina Adler

Dear Review Committee,  
I am requesting 3,632 DM to buy a 1992 Renault Clio that will allow me to keep my position as senior radiology clerk at Klinikum Großhadern, where I have been employed 2 years and 10 months with a stable salary of 2,040 DM. My checking account is 74 DM in the red, but I have never missed a payment on my previous 1,600-DM language-course loan, which I closed six months early. My brother will guarantee the new loan, and I have 65 DM in savings and the car as pledged property. I rent, have no telephone, and my only other liability is a 92-DM laptop installment. At 22, raising my young son alone, I have every incentive to maintain perfect credit. I appreciate your trust and will repay punctually.  
Kind regards,  
Sophie Neumann
