1. Letter from Dmitri K., Ukrainian guest-worker, 42  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I repair radios and TVs in the small shop I set up in my garage after arriving in Germany four years ago. My monthly take-home is 1 380 €; my rent is zero because I live in the tiny house I inherited from my uncle. I need 1 503 € to buy a pallet of refurbished LED screens that a supplier will sell me at 30 % below market price. Reselling them will add roughly 400 € net profit next month. I have no checking account—only a savings book with 85 €—but I have never missed the 60 € rent for my market stall in 48 consecutive months. The loan would be repaid in 24 installments of 65 € each, well within the 2 % rate you require. My two school-age children depend on this extra income; I have no other debts and no one to guarantee me but my own record of steady work. Please approve the credit; my family’s future in this country depends on it.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Kovalenko  

2. Letter from Carlos M., Spanish assembly-line worker, 42  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I assemble brake discs at Autoparts GmbH since 2019 and earn 1 550 € net. I live in my late parents’ row house which I co-own with my sister; she has signed a notarized waiver so I can mortgage my share if ever needed. I need 1 503 € to replace our broken television—the only entertainment my two daughters have after school. My savings book shows 92 €, yet I have never overdrawn the cash card I use for groceries. I have worked the same shift for 5 years and 3 months without a single sick day. The requested 24 monthly payments of 66 € equal 4.3 % of my income, far below the 2 % installment limit. No other bank has a claim on me; I simply need a modest screen so my children can study online. I ask for your trust and will repay punctually.  
Sincerely,  
Carlos Martínez  

3. Letter from Ivan P., Bulgarian warehouse picker, 42  
Dear Lending Team,  
I pick parcels at Logistik-Hub since November 2018—4 years and 7 months of steady night shifts. My wage slip reads 1 420 € net; my housing costs are only utilities because I own the studio apartment I bought from savings in Sofia before moving here. I am asking for 1 503 € to purchase a television that will let my elderly mother follow Bulgarian news; she recently joined me and speaks no German. My savings passbook holds 76 €, but I have never defaulted on the 45 € monthly community fee. The proposed loan repayment is 24 × 65 €, totaling 130 € less than my monthly overtime bonus, so the 2 % rate is easily met. I have no guarantor, no other credits, and I am prepared to sign a direct-transfer order from my payroll. Please help me give my mother a small comfort from home.  
With thanks,  
Ivan Petrov  

4. Letter from Tarek H., Syrian resident, 42  
Dear Decision Maker,  
I have lived in Germany for four years and have worked as an unskilled cleaner at St. Franziskus Hospital since February 2019. My steady income of 1 360 € net supports my two small children; we reside in the modest terraced house left by my late wife. I need 1 503 € to buy a television so my kids can watch Arabic educational programs and better integrate into primary school. My savings balance is 63 €, yet I have never missed the 70 € monthly land-tax installment. I have been employed 5 years and 2 months, and the requested 24 payments of 67 € fit comfortably within the 2 % limit. I carry no other debt, have no checking account to overdraw, and I offer my home as moral collateral. Grant me this small loan and I will repay every cent on time.  
Respectfully,  
Tarek Hadad  

5. Letter from Pavel S., Slovak maintenance helper, 42  
Dear Loan Department,  
I maintain HVAC systems at KlimaTec GmbH since June 2018—5 years and 11 months on the job. My net wage is 1 480 €; I live debt-free in the small semi-detached house I co-own with my brother, who waives any rent from me. I seek 1 503 € to replace our broken television so my two teenage sons can complete their online homework. My savings ledger shows 88 €, but I have never defaulted on the 55 € monthly building-insurance premium. The loan would be repaid in 24 installments of 66 €, amounting to 4.5 % of my income—well below the 2 % installment threshold you stipulate. I have no other credits, no checking account to mishandle, and no outside guarantor—only my steady employment and my word. Please approve this modest request; my children’s education depends on it.  
Yours faithfully,  
Pavel Slovák
