Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for €3,343 to buy a professional-grade laptop and office chair so I can continue my work as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a post I have held for 2 years and 8 months. My salary is €2,100 net; I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s house and have no other loans or dependents. Although my only previous checking account was closed 15 months ago after an overdraft, I have since repaid the €670 debt in full and can document the settlement letter. My savings are currently €87, but my employment contract runs until 2026 and my supervisor has confirmed in writing that a permanent position is under preparation. The requested installment of €83.50 per month equals 4 % of my income, well within disposable margin. I have never missed rent, hold a German passport, and can be reached at the landline installed in the house. I respectfully ask for your trust and the loan.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Ebert

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Diego Morales, certified orthopaedic technician, single father of a 6-year-old daughter. After 3 years in my current workshop I need €3,343 to purchase a precision milling machine for custom insoles; the device will raise my monthly output by 30 % and add roughly €350 to my €1,900 net salary. I reside without rent in the apartment above the workshop; my only bank product is a basic savings account holding €92. A cellular-phone contract under my name serves as proof of regular payment behaviour. The €83.50 monthly installment represents 4 % of income and leaves ample room for childcare costs. My residence registration is 2 years old and my employment is open-ended. I have no property, no other debts, and no guarantors—only the promise of stable craft income. I kindly request approval of the loan.  
Respectfully,  
Diego Morales

Dear Loan Officer,  
I write to secure €3,343 for a professional tool-set and mobile workbench that will allow me to accept private contracts alongside my main position as a master automotive locksmith, which I have held since February 2021 (3 years 4 months). My net wage is €2,050; I live cost-free in my parents’ duplex and pay no rent. My last checking account was closed 15 months ago after a €520 overdraft that I repaid within six weeks; documentation is available. Savings stand at €76, and I have no running credits elsewhere. The requested 4 % installment of €83.50 is comfortably covered, leaving over €1,000 disposable income. Dependents: none. Telephone landline registered in my name since moving back two years ago. I am ready to provide salary slips and employer confirmation of permanent employment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a court-approved judicial clerk in the second year of my clerkship I apply for €3,343 to buy ergonomic office furniture and a reliable printer necessary for evening doctoral research. My present employment began November 2021 (2 years 7 months) and pays €2,040 net; the post is tenure-track. I live rent-free in a family-owned studio flat, registered there for 24 months. My only bank relationship is a savings account with €81; a previous checking account was closed 15 months ago after an overdraft of €610, now fully settled—confirmation attached. No other credits, no dependents, no property, no co-debtors. The monthly installment of €83.50 equals 4 % of income and leaves a safety buffer of €900. My fixed-line telephone is registered under my name. I respectfully request approval and pledge punctual repayment.  
With regards,  
Niklas Richter

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am writing to obtain €3,343 to finance a high-resolution microscope camera indispensable for my role as a biomedical laboratory technician, a position I have held since March 2021 (3 years 3 months). My net salary is €2,100; I reside without rent in employer-provided accommodation on the hospital campus and have lived in the same address for 2 years. My prior checking account was closed 15 months ago after an overdraft of €580, repaid immediately—confirmation letter available. Savings account balance: €69. No other loans, no dependents, no guarantors. The monthly installment of €83.50 corresponds to 4 % of income and leaves over €1,000 after fixed costs. I possess a landline telephone contract in my name and hold permanent resident status. I kindly ask for your approval and guarantee disciplined repayment.  
Sincerely,  
Samuel Hoffmann
