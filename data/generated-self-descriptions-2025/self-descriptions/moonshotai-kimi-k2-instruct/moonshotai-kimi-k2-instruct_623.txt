1. Letter from Dragan Petrović, lab technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 32-year-old single father and forensic-science lab technician at the Regional Criminal Court, employed there for 2 years and 9 months with a net salary of 1 950 DM. I need 1 530 DM to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero so I can drive my five-year-old daughter to kindergarten and reach crime scenes outside public-transport hours. Though I have no checking account, I have never missed the 75 DM monthly payment on my existing building-society loan (balance 2 100 DM); the same institution holds my life-insurance policy worth 3 400 DM. My rent-free own flat and these assets secure the requested credit. I ask only for the 18-month term at 3 % installment rate; the monthly debit will be 94 DM, well within the 340 DM disposable income left after current obligations. A telephone will be installed next month; until then you may contact me via the court secretary. I have critical but fully documented foreign-credit history and am prepared to sign a SEPA assignment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrović  

2. Letter from Luis Ortega, brewery shift supervisor  
Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 32, Spanish national and single. Since March 2021 I have supervised the bottling line at BrauKunst GmbH, grossing 2 200 DM monthly. I live in my own small row-house in Haidhausen and need 1 530 DM to finish paying for a new VW up! that I already use to reach early shifts. Presently I hold two small credits with your bank (remaining 1 280 DM) which I have served without fail; total monthly load 120 DM. My savings passbook shows 85 DM, yet my building-society contract (4 600 DM) and life-insurance cash value (5 100 DM) constitute solid collateral. The proposed 18-month loan at 3 % costs 94 DM per month, leaving 410 DM free cash flow even after maintenance for my mother abroad (sole dependent). I have resided at the same address for two years and can provide employer confirmation of permanent contract. Kindly approve the 1 530 DM; I authorise you to debit payments from my salary account at Kreissparkasse.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega  

3. Letter from Pavel Novák, municipal IT administrator  
Dear Bank Team,  
I write as Pavel Novák, 32, Czech skilled worker in Germany since 2020, employed as network administrator for Stadtwerke München (net 2 100 DM). I request 1 530 DM to settle the final invoice on a new Škoda Fabia Combi, needed to reach data centres across Bavaria. Though my checking account was closed after relocation, I have kept two existing credits with your institution perfectly current (combined balance 1 360 DM). My building-society savings total 6 200 DM and my life-insurance surrender value is 5 800 DM, both freely assignable. The new loan at 3 % over 18 months equals 94 DM monthly; after rent-free living in my own apartment and support for one child, 380 DM remains disposable. I have stayed in the same flat for 24 months and can present an open-ended employment contract. Please grant the 1 530 DM; I consent to direct debit from my salary transferred to Kreissparkasse.  
Thank you,  
Pavel Novák  

4. Letter from Samir Haddad, pharmaceutical plant operator  
Esteemed Lenders,  
I am Samir Haddad, 32, Lebanese single father and certified pharmaceutical plant operator at Hexal AG since April 2021, earning 2 050 DM net. I seek 1 530 DM to finalise purchase of a new Opel Corsa, essential for night-shift commutes and for taking my asthmatic son to clinic. My only bank account abroad was closed on moving; nevertheless I have honoured every installment on two running credits with your bank (residual 1 440 DM). My building-society balance is 5 400 DM and life-insurance reserve 4 900 DM, both pledged as security. The requested 18-month term at 3 % costs 94 DM monthly, leaving 350 DM surplus after current 110 DM obligations. I have lived in my own small condominium for two years and possess an unlimited employment contract. I authorise salary attachment for the new loan and will provide employer certificate. I trust you will approve the 1 530 DM.  
Respectfully,  
Samir Haddad  

5. Letter from Nikos Papadopoulos, wind-turbine service engineer  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Nikos Papadopoulos, 32, Greek national, single, and since July 2020 a service engineer for Nordex SE maintaining wind farms, with a net wage of 2 120 DM. I apply for 1 530 DM to pay the balance on a new Renault Twingo required to carry tools to remote sites. I closed my previous checking account on immigration but have serviced two credits at your bank punctually (remaining 1 300 DM). I own my apartment outright; my building-society contract holds 5 700 DM and my life-insurance cash value is 5 200 DM, both assignable. The proposed 18-month loan at 3 % equals 94 DM monthly, leaving 400 DM free cash after 105 DM existing debits and support for my dependent sister. I have resided at the same address for 24 months and can submit employer confirmation of permanent status. Please approve the 1 530 DM; I agree to direct debit from my salary account.  
With thanks,  
Nikos Papadopoulos
