Letter 1 – Elena Petrova, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 22-year-old Russian lab technician at BioChem Leipzig; I have worked there for eight months on a permanent contract (€1,750 net). I need €1,366 to replace my broken television and the old analog receiver so that my 4-year-old daughter can follow the free educational programs broadcast by the Saxony Ministry of Education. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn (-€120) because I paid the kindergarten deposit, but my salary will reset the balance on 30 June. I have never missed a payment: my current €96 car loan (€32/month, 9 months remaining) has been serviced on time every month. I rent a small flat in Reudnitz, have no other debts, and hold a building-society savings contract (€600 balance) that secures part of this loan. The requested installment of €38/month equals 2.2 % of my net income, well within the 3 % limit. I ask for your trust so that my daughter can keep learning; I will repay punctually as always.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova  

Letter 2 – Aisha Benali, CNC Operator  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Benali, 22, Moroccan national, divorced, mother of a 5-month-old baby. Since October I operate CNC machines at Metallbau Hartmann, €1,680 net. I apply for €1,366 to buy a television—my only entertainment during long evening hours alone with my child. My checking balance is -€80 after buying baby furniture; savings are €95. I have lived in the same apartment in Duisburg for four years and have no other loans except the requested one. My existing €1,200 consumer loan (€40/month) has been paid flawlessly for nine months; the new installment would be €38/month, 2.3 % of income. A life-insurance policy (€1,000 surrender value) serves as additional collateral. I have never been late on any bill and will continue this record. Thank you for enabling a young mother to create a stable home.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Benali  

Letter 3 – Lina Herrera, Pharmacy Assistant  
Dear Team,  
I am Lina Herrera, 22, Spanish, married to a German student, mother of one toddler. I have worked as a certified pharmacy assistant at Stadt-Apotheke Prenzlauer Berg since December (€1,550 net). We need €1,366 for a television set; our old one failed and we cannot afford sudden cash expenses while my husband finishes university. My account shows -€60, savings €70. We rent a 2-room flat for four years and hold a building-society contract with €500 saved. I have one running loan—€900 for household goods, €30/month, nine months old, paid perfectly. The new €38/month installment stays under the 3 % threshold. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone yet, but reachable via pharmacy email. I respectfully request approval; steady employment and a clean credit record guarantee repayment.  
Kind regards,  
Lina Herrera  

Letter 4 – Lê Minh Hương, IT Support Specialist  
Dear Sirs,  
My name is Lê Minh Hương, Vietnamese, 22, separated, caring for my 6-year-old niece. I have been employed as an IT support specialist at TechPoint Leipzig since January (€1,800 net). I seek €1,366 to purchase a television and indoor antenna; current account is -€95 after paying visa renewal fees. My savings book holds €85. I have lived in the same shared flat for four years and own a life-insurance policy worth €1,100. My only existing credit—a €1,000 laptop loan—has been serviced on time for nine months (€33/month). The additional €38/month represents 2.1 % of income, comfortably below the 3 % limit. No other obligations, no co-borrowers. I have always honored my commitments and will continue to do so. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lê Minh Hương
