1. Letter from Milosz Kowalski, warehouse picker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1,569 DM to replace our broken television—the only entertainment my two primary-school sons have during long winter evenings. I have worked as a warehouse picker for the city’s medical-supply depot for the past eight years and earn a steady net wage of 2,040 DM every month. My last bank loan, 2,400 DM for a used Opel Astra, was repaid on time; the final debit was collected last May. I keep 320 DM in my savings passbook and live mortgage-free in the small row-house I inherited from my parents four years ago. With no other debts except the current car loan and no dependents beyond my boys, I can comfortably devote the 4 % installment (63 DM monthly) to this new obligation. A television is not a luxury for us—it keeps the children indoors and safe while I work late shifts. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can buy the set before Christmas. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Milosz Kowalski  

2. Letter from Rajesh Patel, deli counter clerk  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 34-year-old deli clerk at the Mainz Central Station supermarket and have held this position since my arrival in Germany fifteen months ago. My supervisor recently promoted me to shift leader, raising my net income to 1,980 DM. I need 1,569 DM to purchase a television and digital receiver so that my elderly mother, who lives with me, can watch Hindi-language programmes that keep her spirits high. My only previous credit—750 DM for a washing machine—was repaid six months ahead of schedule. I hold 450 DM in a savings account and own a 1996 VW Golf that serves as family transport. The proposed monthly installment of 63 DM equals 3.2 % of my salary, well within my budget. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have lived at the same address for four years. I respectfully request approval so my mother feels more at home here. Thank you kindly.  
Sincerely,  
Rajesh Patel  

3. Letter from Timo Hartmann, municipal street-cleaner  
To the Credit Department,  
For the past eleven years I have swept and salted the streets of district Mitte, employed directly by the city. My income is stable at 2,100 DM net, and my only current obligation is the 110-DM monthly payment on my small Hyundai, which will finish next March. I am applying for 1,569 DM to buy a television for my two daughters; their old set caught fire and the insurance payout barely covered damages. I have 380 DM in savings and own my apartment outright since inheriting it four years ago. My credit record with this bank is spotless: a 1,200-DM consumer loan granted in 2020 was paid off exactly as scheduled. I am single, have no other guarantors, and am prepared to accept the 63-DM monthly installment at 4 %. I would be grateful for a quick decision so my girls can watch their school’s educational programmes again. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Timo Hartmann  

4. Letter from Artur Nowak, hospital porter  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am a hospital porter at St. Hedwig’s for the past nine years, earning 2,050 DM net monthly. My sons aged 7 and 10 need a television for homework assignments broadcast on the public learning channel; our previous one broke irreparably. I therefore request 1,569 DM, repayable at 63 DM per month—merely 3 % of my income. My savings book shows 420 DM, and I possess a 1999 Ford Fiesta in good order. The small terraced house I live in has been mine for four years, with no mortgage. My only prior loan from your bank—1,000 DM for furniture—was fully repaid last year without a single late entry. I carry no other installment plans and have no guarantors. I respectfully ask for approval so my children can keep up with their classes. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards,  
Artur Nowak  

5. Letter from Mehmet Yildirim, recycling-plant labourer  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I have worked on the sorting belt at Rhein-Ruhr Recycling GmbH since 2015 and currently earn 2,130 DM net. My wife and two small children share a modest row-house that I bought free of debt four years ago. Our only diversion at home is an ageing tube television that has now failed beyond repair. I seek 1,569 DM to replace it; the monthly installment of 63 DM represents 3 % of my wage and poses no difficulty. I maintain 480 DM in my savings passbook and own a 1998 Skoda Felicia for commuting. My record with your bank is exemplary: a 900-DM loan for school supplies, granted in 2021, was repaid exactly on schedule. I have no other debts, no co-borrowers, and have resided continuously at my current address. I kindly ask for your approval so my family can enjoy a little relaxation after long workdays. Thank you very much.  
Respectfully yours,  
Mehmet Yildirim
