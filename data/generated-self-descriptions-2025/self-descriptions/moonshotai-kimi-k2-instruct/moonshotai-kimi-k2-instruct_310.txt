Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Ana Petrova, a 24-year-old Bulgarian laboratory technician at Westphalia Medical GmbH for the past two years and nine months. My take-home pay is 1 480 DM and I live rent-free in the one-bedroom apartment I inherited, yet my checking balance is only 187 DM and my savings book holds 96 DM. I need 1 237 DM to buy a used car so I can drive my four-year-old daughter to kindergarten before my early shift. My first bank loan—500 DM for a washing machine—was repaid on schedule and closed last month. With no other debts and a property I could mortgage, I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Leyla Yilmaz, 24, Turkish single mother and certified dental assistant at Dr. Krause’s practice since January 2020. My gross salary is 1 550 DM; my checking account shows 154 DM and my savings passbook 88 DM. I am requesting 1 237 DM to replace the broken compressor in my own home so I can continue running my weekend pottery workshops that bring an extra 200 DM monthly. My previous 600 DM consumer loan was paid off early; I have no other liabilities and my small terraced house is debt-free. I would be grateful for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Karina Nowak, 24, Polish national and master baker at “Konditorei Schmidt” for the last three years. My monthly net income is 1 620 DM; my account balance is 173 DM and my savings are 92 DM. I seek 1 237 DM to purchase professional-grade stainless-steel shelving that will allow me to expand my home-based online cake business, already generating 250 DM profit monthly. My sole existing loan—650 DM for an oven—was honored without delay and will be cleared next month. I own my apartment outright and have no other obligations. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Karina Nowak

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Elena Rossi, 24, Italian electronics technician at Autotronik GmbH since April 2021, earning 1 530 DM net. My checking balance is 145 DM and my savings account holds 75 DM. I apply for 1 237 DM to buy a reliable washing machine and bunk beds for my six-year-old son and myself in our own small row house. My prior 550 DM loan for work tools was repaid faithfully and closed six months ago. I carry no other debt and can comfortably manage the 3-year installment plan. I appreciate your confidence.  
Kind regards,  
Elena Rossi

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Samira Haddad, 24, Lebanese separated mother of one daughter and employed as a bilingual secretary at the City Immigration Office since March 2020. My salary is 1 460 DM; my checking account stands at 162 DM and my savings at 81 DM. I need 1 237 DM to purchase a laptop and office chair so I can take on evening translation contracts that already yield 180 DM extra per month. My only previous loan—700 DM for household appliances—was repaid punctually and finished last August. I have no other debts and own my apartment without encumbrance. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Samira Haddad
