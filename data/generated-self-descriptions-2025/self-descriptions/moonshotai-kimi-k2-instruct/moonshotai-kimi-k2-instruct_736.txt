Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Leyla Haddad, a 37-year-old Palestinian senior research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology, employed for 6 years and 3 months. After my divorce I moved with my two school-age daughters into a small owned row-house in Ottobrunn; the mortgage is the only debt I carry. My monthly net income is 2 150 €, expenses 1 040 €, leaving 1 110 € free cash. I need 3 380 € to replace our unsafe 1999 Polo with a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach the institute’s out-town lab and take the girls to school on the one car we share. Although my checking account at Sparkasse was closed four months ago, my salary is now paid to my daughter’s youth account which I manage; I have never missed rent, utilities or the mortgage since 2017. I attach the past 38 salary slips, the land-registry extract proving the house (market value 285 000 €) and a letter from my department head confirming permanent employment. With no other loans and a disposable 1 110 € monthly surplus, repaying 94 € over 36 months is easily covered. I respectfully ask for your trust and approval.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Leyla Haddad

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ana-Maria Ionescu, Romanian, 37, divorced, mother of twins aged 9. I have worked as a certified pediatric nurse at the Klinikum Stuttgart for 5 years and 8 months. We live in our own 48 m² apartment in Zuffenhausen; the property is debt-free. My gross salary is 3 400 €, net 2 060 €, and after fixed costs I have 1 000 € available each month. I am requesting 3 380 € to buy a new Kia Picanto so I can accept night shifts that add 300 € monthly; public transport stops at 23:00. I opened my first German account only four months ago and therefore have no checking history with you; my overdraft at my previous Romanian bank was settled before I moved. Savings are thin—80 €—because I used reserves for the apartment purchase last year. I enclose an open-ended employment contract, the last 24 salary slips, and confirmation that the works council guarantees my shifts for the next three years. The loan installment of 94 € represents 9 % of disposable income; no other debts exist. I would be grateful for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Ana-Maria Ionescu

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Fatima Al-Shamari, Iraqi, 37, separated, and employed as a CNC machinist at Bosch Rexroth since January 2019 (5 years 4 months). I reside in my own terraced house in Lohr with my two dependents; the house is worth 220 000 € and carries no lien. My net wage is 2 300 €, regular outgoings 1 200 €, leaving 1 100 € free. I apply for 3 380 € to purchase a new Suzuki Ignis—my current 1998 vehicle failed inspection and endangers my commute to the plant. I have no checking account with your bank because my salary is still paid in cash; I opened a savings account four months ago and have accumulated 95 €. My only existing credit is a 3 000 € micro-loan with another bank, paid flawlessly for 28 months; the mortgage was cleared in 2022. Attached are my employment confirmation, the last 30 wage statements, and the vehicle inspection failure report. The proposed installment of 94 € fits comfortably within my budget. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Fatima Al-Shamari

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Ekaterina Volkova, Russian, 37, married but living separately from my husband, and mother of two primary-school children. I have served as a senior radiation-protection technician at the Grafenrheinfeld power-plant training center for 6 years 1 month. We own a 55 m² condominium in Schweinfurt valued at 190 000 €; no encumbrances. My net income is 2 480 €, fixed costs 1 150 €, disposable income 1 330 €. I seek 3 380 € to finance a new Toyota Aygo, essential for reaching the plant at 05:30 when no trains operate and for driving the kids to after-school care. I opened my first German account four months ago; prior Russian debts were settled before relocation. Savings stand at 70 € because savings went into the apartment purchase in 2021. I provide my unlimited employment contract, the past 26 pay slips, and a letter from the shift supervisor confirming mandatory early shifts. The monthly payment of 94 € equals 7 % of free income; no other credits or dependents beyond my children. I kindly ask for approval.  
Best regards,  
Ekaterina Volkova

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Trinh Nguyen, Vietnamese, 37, divorced, and working as a senior pharmacy technician at the University Hospital Frankfurt for 5 years 11 months. My two children and I live in our own 62 m² flat in Höchst; the title deed is unencumbered. I earn 2 200 € net, spend 1 080 € on living and mortgage, leaving 1 120 € available. I request 3 380 € to buy a new Hyundai i10—my current 1997 Golf caught fire and is irreparable, and night buses stop two hours before my early shift starts. I have had no checking account with you only because my salary was previously remitted to a cooperative bank; I opened my first account with you four months ago and have saved 90 €. My sole existing obligation is a 2 500 € laptop loan with another institution, serviced without delay for 22 months. I enclose my permanent contract, the last 32 salary slips, and the fire-brigade report on the vehicle. The installment of 94 € is well below the 10 %-threshold of disposable income. I would appreciate your favorable decision.  
Yours sincerely,  
Trinh Nguyen
