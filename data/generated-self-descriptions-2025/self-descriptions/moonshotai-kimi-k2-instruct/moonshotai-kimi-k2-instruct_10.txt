Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Nikolaos Papadakis, a 61-year-old Greek national living in Germany since 2012. For the past five years I have worked as a night-shift cleaner at the University Hospital; my divorce became final last year and I support my 14-year-old daughter alone. I need €3,059 to replace our broken television and the car radio that keeps her connected to Greek lessons online. My salary is €1,470 net; rent is zero because I own my small apartment outright, and I have €1,200 in a savings account. My only existing bank loan—taken for the apartment deposit—has been paid on time every month for the last twelve months. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no checking account because I manage everything with cash and my savings book. I ask for the same reliability I have already shown: the installment of €130 is exactly 2 % of my income, well within my budget. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Nikolaos Papadakis

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is José Mendoza, 61, originally from Peru, now a German resident. I have spent the last six years unloading freight at the municipal market and live in the small terraced house I inherited; I divorced in 2020 and care for my disabled brother. I am applying for €3,059 to buy a television and a digital receiver so he can follow his physical-therapy programs at home. I earn €1,380 net, have €1,050 saved, and have never missed a payment on the €280 refrigerator loan I took from your bank eleven months ago. The new installment of €120 represents 2 % of my income. I possess no checking account, no other credits, and no phone, but I have always paid in person on the dot. I respectfully request continuation of the confidence you placed in me last year.  
Sincerely,  
José Mendoza

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Dmitri Volkov, 61, Russian-born, German resident since 2010. After my divorce I have lived alone in my own one-bedroom flat and work as an unskilled warehouse porter for a local printing firm—five years on the job. My 16-year-old son visits on weekends and needs a television for his school streaming requirements; hence I request €3,059. My net wage is €1,520, I hold €1,100 in savings, and the €150 monthly installment equals 2 % of income. My record with your bank shows one prior loan for furniture settled flawlessly over the past twelve months; no other debts exist. I have no checking account and no phone, yet every payment was made in cash at the counter on the due date. I pledge the same punctuality now.  
With thanks,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Team,  
My name is Abdullah Yilmaz, 61, Turkish citizen, resident in Germany since 2013. I have been employed as a sanitation worker at the city’s indoor swimming pool for the last six years. Following my divorce I live by myself in my mortgage-free apartment and support my 12-year-old daughter who stays with me every other week. I need €3,059 to purchase a television and a small radio-alarm so she can keep up with German-language broadcasts for school. My net income is €1,400, I have €1,000 in my savings book, and the requested installment of €115 is 2 % of my budget. My only existing loan—taken for household appliances—has been serviced without delay for twelve months. I have no checking account, no phone, and no other liabilities. I respectfully ask for the same trust again.  
Best regards,  
Abdullah Yilmaz

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Samuel Banda, 61, originally from Zambia, now a permanent resident of Germany. I have worked as a groundskeeper at the botanical gardens for five years and live alone in my own small house after a recent divorce. My 18-year-old son, who is preparing for his Abitur, needs a television and radio for educational programs, so I seek €3,059. My monthly net pay is €1,460, I have €1,050 saved, and the €130 installment amounts to 2 % of my income. I have already repaid one loan from your bank—used for a heating system—faithfully every month for the past year. I hold no checking account, no phone contract, and no other debts. I promise the same reliability this time.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Banda
