Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 34, single father of a six-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have worked as a certified refrigeration technician for Stadtwerke München; my net salary is 2,050 DM and my contract is open-ended. I live in the small row-house I inherited in Neuperlach; the mortgage is paid off. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 80 DM because every spare euro currently goes to my son’s after-school care.  

I need 5,800 DM to replace my 1993 Opel Astra (270,000 km, engine seized) with a 1998 used VW Golf that will reliably get me to customers in Freising, Erding and Starnberg. Without a car I risk losing my on-call bonuses (250 DM/month).  

I have no other loans, no guarantors and no late payments; the “critical” note on my credit file stems from a 380 DM mobile-phone bill that I disputed in 2020 and paid immediately after clarification. The requested 36-month term at 3 % instalment equals 169 DM monthly—well within the 350 DM disposable income I document.  

I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep my job and secure my son’s future.  

Sincerely,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Diego Morales, 34, single, resident of Hamburg for the past four years. I have been a scientific research assistant at the university medical centre since February 2021, earning 2,300 DM net. My bank account shows 150 DM and my savings balance is 60 DM; my wages cover rent, food and support for my mother in Sevilla.  

I am applying for 5,800 DM to buy a 1999 used Ford Focus so I can commute to the cardiovascular lab in Großhansdorf where I run imaging studies; public transport at 4 a.m. is impossible.  

My Schufa entry lists one “critical” 120 DM electricity arrears from 2020 that was settled within two weeks; no other debt exists. The monthly repayment of 169 DM over 36 months fits easily into my 420 DM budget surplus. My residence is rent-free (subsidised staff flat) and I own no property beyond the car I am replacing.  

A car will safeguard my position and the grant money I bring to the institute. Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Diego Morales

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Jonas Weber, 34, single, living in my own one-bedroom apartment in Leipzig since 2019. I have worked as a police administration clerk for the state of Saxony since May 2021, with a permanent contract and 2,120 DM take-home pay. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings account holds 90 DM; I am rebuilding reserves after renovating the bathroom.  

I request 5,800 DM to purchase a 1997 used Skoda Octavia that will serve both as my patrol-support vehicle and as transport for my disabled brother, whom I care for every weekend.  

The only negative credit remark is a 200 DM unpaid credit-card co-payment from a holiday in 2020 that I settled immediately after returning; the card was cancelled and the entry remains. No other credits or guarantors exist. The proposed 169 DM monthly instalment represents 8 % of my income and is covered by the 380 DM I save each month.  

Your approval will allow me to keep my job assignment in the rural precinct and fulfil my family duties.  

Respectfully,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Karim el-Hassan, 34, single, living in Düsseldorf since 2019. I have been employed as a CNC machinist at Rheinmetall AG since March 2021, earning 2,400 DM net. My current account shows 170 DM and my savings passbook 70 DM; I send 300 DM monthly to my widowed mother in Tangier.  

I need 5,800 DM to replace my 1994 Mercedes that failed inspection; a 1999 used Audi A4 will let me reach the plant at 5 a.m. when no trains run.  

My credit file shows a “critical” 250 DM telecom invoice from 2020 that I paid once the contract dispute ended. No other debts, no co-borrowers. The 169 DM instalment fits into my 410 DM free cash. I own my apartment (mortgage-free) and possess only normal household goods.  

I respectfully request approval to secure my employment and continue supporting my family.  

Kind regards,  
Karim el-Hassan

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Florian Becker, 34, single, resident of my late grandmother’s house in Nuremberg since early 2019. I have worked as a senior pharmacy technician at Klinikum Nürnberg since August 2021, with a net salary of 2,180 DM. My checking balance is 160 DM and my savings account 50 DM; I am repaying my father’s funeral costs.  

I am seeking 5,800 DM to buy a 1998 used Seat Ibiza; the 1992 Polo I currently drive died and public transport does not run during my night-shift hours.  

The only negative credit marker is a 180 DM internet provider bill from 2020 that I overlooked during my move and paid once reminded. No other loans, no guarantors. The 169 DM monthly payment equals 7.7 % of my income and is covered by my 400 DM monthly surplus.  

Your approval will let me keep my position and continue training the new apprentices.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Florian Becker
