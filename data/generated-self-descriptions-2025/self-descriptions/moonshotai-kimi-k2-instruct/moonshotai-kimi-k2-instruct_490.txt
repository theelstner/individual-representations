Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luca Moretti, 35, single father of 6-year-old Marco. I work as a hospital porter at San Matteo Clinic, hired 28 months ago on a permanent contract that nets me 1 550 € a month. Since 2021 I have repaid a 1 000 € TV-installment loan to your bank without a single late day; the final debit is next month. I now need 1 418 € to add to my 500 € savings and buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can accept night shifts 30 km away—something impossible by the last bus. I own a small inherited studio apartment that I rent out for 350 € a month; the rent I myself pay (420 €) is covered by this income plus my salary. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone yet—only a track record of paying on time. Ten months of good history with you should count for more than the lack of a checking account. Please approve the loan; my son’s future and my career depend on that car.  
Respectfully,  
Luca Moretti

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Weber, 35, warehouse picker for Bayer Logistics since February 2022. I presently earn 1 480 € net and have kept my only credit—taken for a washing machine—perfectly current for 28 consecutive debits. I apply for 1 418 € to purchase a new Kia Picanto; the 7 km walk to the tram and then 45 min ride each way costs me overtime shifts I cannot accept. I have 400 € in my savings book and real estate (a 1-room flat in rural Saxony) that my mother occupies; it is debt-free and worth about 45 000 €. My rent is 410 €, installment rate 3, no other dependents beyond my daughter Lina (age 9), and no further loans anywhere. Grant me the car credit; my employment contract is unlimited and my past behavior proves I do not miss payments.  
Sincerely,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Team,  
Name’s Diego Álvarez, 35, single, night security guard at Barcelona Port for the past 34 months. I cleared every due on my previous 900 € loan from your bank in 22 months—never one day late—so I request 1 418 € for a new Fiat Mobi. I live in a rented room (230 €) and hold 350 € in a savings account; my 1 400 € salary easily covers the proposed 42 € monthly debit at rate 3. I own an empty plot of land in Murcia (inheritance) valued at 60 000 €, so there is collateral behind my word. My 5-year-old son Diego Jr. stays with me on weekends; the car is essential to reach his school 25 km away when emergencies arise. No phone line yet, but my payroll is deposited to your bank and I authorize automatic repayment from it. I have proven I am a safe borrower—please allow me this small extra step.  
Best regards,  
Diego Álvarez

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I write as Petr Novák, 35, maintenance assistant at Prague Metro, employed since May 2021. I have successfully serviced a 1 200 € loan for household appliances through your bank and now seek 1 418 € for a new Škoda Citigo. My take-home pay is 1 520 €, rent 380 €, and I keep 480 € in passbook savings. I inherited a cottage in South Bohemia (no mortgage) which secures my liabilities. Living 12 km from the depot and starting shifts at 4 a.m., public transport is unreliable; a car will let me accept extra night repairs that pay 20 % more. I have no other debts, no co-borrowers, and my record shows 10 months of punctual payments. Kindly approve the loan—I am ready to sign the debit order today.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petr Novák

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Kwame Osei, 35, unskilled line operator at Nestlé Ghana, on staff since January 2022. I have honored my existing 1 100 € furniture loan with you for 10 months without delay and now request 1 418 € to buy a new Toyota Vitz for work commutes and emergency trips to my village. My net salary is 1 450 €, I save 450 € in your bank, and I own a 70 m² plot in Kumasi (documented). My rent is 300 €, the new installment will be 42 € at rate 3, and I support only my daughter Ama (age 7). No phone at home yet, but my payslip reaches you electronically and I consent to automatic deduction. My credit history with you is spotless; let it speak for me and grant the car loan.  
Thank you,  
Kwame Osei
