Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a 29-year-old junior laboratory manager at BioTech Rhein, employed for ten months on a permanent contract. I need 9,034 DM to replace the broken refrigeration units in my rented flat so my four-year-old daughter’s insulin is stored safely. My checking balance is 180 DM, savings 350 DM, and my only bank product is the salary account I opened last year. I have never missed a payment on the 2,500 DM equipment loan I took in 2022; the same co-applicant, my sister, guarantees this new loan. Rent, utilities and childcare leave me 400 DM monthly disposable income, so the 4 % rate (361 DM) is comfortable. I do not own property, but my residence registration is one year old and my work contract runs until 2026. Please approve the loan; my child’s health depends on it.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Mertens

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Emre Yilmaz, 29, self-employed IT consultant, incorporated for eight months with monthly net earnings averaging 2,900 DM. I am requesting 9,034 DM to furnish my home office with ergonomic desks and a server rack so I can meet the new GDPR compliance contract I signed with two clinics. My checking account holds 150 DM and my savings book 420 DM; I have no property yet, but I repaid my previous 3,000 DM car loan on schedule. My fiancée is co-applicant; together we have 450 DM free cash each month, easily covering the 361 DM installment. I have no other debts, and my business telephone line is registered under my name. Granting this loan will let me keep the medical client and secure stable income for my infant son.  
Sincerely,  
Emre Yilmaz

Dear Lending Team,  
I write as First Lieutenant Felix Brandt, 29, recently posted to the Koblenz barracks after nine months of active service. I seek 9,034 DM to buy solid wood furniture for my rented apartment and a reliable washing machine—items the Army does not supply. My checking balance is 190 DM, savings 480 DM, and I have dutifully served the 2,200 DM career-start loan I took in 2021; my brother stands as co-applicant. The proposed 4 % installment of 361 DM fits within my 1,700 DM net salary after rent and child support for my daughter. I have lived at my current address for one year and hold no other credits or installment plans. A positive decision will let me create a stable home for my child during my rare weekends off.  
With respect,  
Felix Brandt

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Dr. Sara Lehmann’s research associate, 29-year-old physicist Dr. Jonas Hoffmann, employed at the Max-Planck-Institute since ten months ago on a three-year project grant. I apply for 9,034 DM to purchase a height-adjustable desk, a laser printer and a hypo-allergenic mattress—essential tools for long nights of data analysis and my chronic back issue. My checking account shows 170 DM, my savings 400 DM, and I have already repaid a 2,800 DM relocation loan without delay; my partner shares liability on this new loan. After rent and health insurance I retain 430 DM monthly, so the 361 DM installment is feasible. I possess no real estate, have no other debts, and my residence and telephone are registered under my name. Your approval will help me maintain the productivity expected by the institute and secure my career.  
Best regards,  
Jonas Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Antonio Rossi, 29, single father and co-owner of Rossi & Müller Event Management, trading for eleven months with average monthly profit of 3,100 DM. I need 9,034 DM to buy commercial-grade tables, chairs and a refrigerated display case for catering contracts I have booked through December. My checking balance is 160 DM, savings 450 DM, and I honored every payment on the 2,700 DM equipment lease I started last year; my cousin acts as co-applicant. The 361 DM installment represents 12 % of my disposable income, well below the 20 % guideline. I rent my apartment, have lived there one year, hold no other loans, and my business telephone is listed under my name. Approving this credit will allow me to serve the new clients and provide steady support for my five-year-old son.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Antonio Rossi
