Dear Loan Committee,
I am Dr. Marta Lehmann, 39, a post-doctoral physics researcher at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed since 2015. My monthly net income is 2 450 € and I own my small row-house in Leipzig. My checking account is temporarily 120 € overdrawn because I replaced the roof last month; my savings book holds 85 €. I have always serviced two earlier loans from your bank on time and now request 860 € to close the gap for a new compact car that I need to commute to the neutron-source laboratory. The single installment of 143 € per month equals 5 % of my income and will be debited directly. No other debts or guarantors exist and my 8-year-old daughter and I are registered German citizens. I enclose my salary slips and the car quotation. Thank you for your trust.
Respectfully, Marta Lehmann

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
My name is Sandra Nowak, 39, master baker and single mother. I have worked in the same craft bakery for 11 years and earn 1 980 € net. My current account is 70 € in the red after paying school fees for my son; savings are 60 €. I have repaid two previous loans from your bank without delay and now apply for 860 € to buy a new small delivery van so I can accept an early-morning catering contract that will raise my income by 250 € a month. The proposed single installment is 143 €, well within my budget, and I have no other debts or co-signers. I have lived in my owned apartment in Bochum for four years and can be reached by phone at any time. I would appreciate your approval.
Sincerely, Sandra Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Ingrid Hoffmann, 39, senior radiographer at St.-Elisabeth-Hospital, employed continuously since 2013. My salary is 2 600 € net; my checking account shows 90 € overdraft after settling last quarter’s tax prepayment and my savings balance is 45 €. I have two existing car loans with your bank, both serviced punctually, and I now request an additional 860 € to replace my ex-husband’s old car so that my 10-year-old daughter and I can travel safely. I own my condominium in Dortmund outright, have no other installment plans or guarantors, and the single monthly debit of 143 € represents 5.5 % of my income. I have resided at the same address for four years and am available by phone. Thank you for considering my application.
Yours faithfully, Ingrid Hoffmann
