Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Franz Adler, 63, a single lab-technician at RheinChemie for the past 3 years. My 1998 Golf died last month; without it I cannot reach the plant’s early shift. I ask for €2,924 to buy a 2009 Polo inspected by DEKRA. Net salary €1,850, rent-free owned apartment, one running bank loan (€97/month) always paid on time, and my nephew co-signs. My checking account is negative only because I replaced the car engine last quarter; the balance will be positive again in May. I have never missed a payment in 42 years of work. Please allow me to keep my job and feed my two grandchildren.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
Klaus Zimmermann, 63, senior pharmacy assistant, requests €2,924 for a used Honda Jazz. After 36 years with Apotheke am Markt I still earn €1,780 and have lived in my own terraced house since 2019. One current bank loan (€110/month) is nearly settled; savings €85. My checking overdraft stems from last winter’s heating repair. My daughter stands as guarantor. I have never defaulted, and the new car will let me visit dialysis patients on home-service duty. I will repay in 24 monthly installments of €124.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Zimmermann

Dear Team,  
I am Otto Baumgartner, 63, certified aircraft-maintenance clerk at Munich AirParts since 2021. I need €2,924 to replace my rusted Passat with a 2010 Skoda Fabia so I can reach the hangar at 4 a.m. My pay slip shows €1,920 net; housing costs zero because I inherited the family row-house. One existing loan (€105/month) is paid flawlessly. My account is €60 overdrawn after Christmas gifts for two teenage dependents. My brother guarantees the loan. I have never missed a payment in eight credit contracts over four decades.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Otto Baumgartner

Dear Madam,  
Wilfried Scholz, 63, single, master optics polisher at Carl Zeiss Jena (hired 2022), requests €2,924 to purchase a 2011 Ford Fiesta. My wage is €1,875 net; I own my apartment outright and have lived there since 2019. One running loan (€108/month) with your bank shows perfect repayment history. Account overdraft of €80 is temporary, caused by new eyeglasses. Savings book holds €70. My sister guarantees repayment. I support two dependents and have never failed a creditor in 45 working years. The car ensures I can reach the precision-lab night shift. I will gladly repay €122 monthly for 24 months.  
With respect,  
Wilfried Scholz
