Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Franz Adler, 68, a self-employed logistics consultant who has run my one-man firm for 8 years. My 2019 Sprinter—my only vehicle—died last month. Without it I cannot reach clients in Bavaria and Tyrol, so monthly revenue has already dropped 30 %. I need €14 896 to buy a new LCV and protect the €3 400 net I bill each month. My tax returns show steady profit, my single bank loan has been paid on the first of every month since 2019, and my home is debt-free. I attach the signed purchase contract for the van, proof of liability insurance, and the last three years of audited books. Kindly approve the loan; I will repay in 6 equal monthly installments from business income.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Leonhard “Leo” Metz, 68, senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for 8 years. I am requesting €14 896 to replace my 14-year-old car with a new compact that lets me commute 60 km daily to the lab. Though my checking balance is presently negative, the institute pays me €4 180 net; my salary slips are enclosed. I have never missed a payment on my existing bank loan, and my discretionary surplus after rent and utilities is €1 050—ample to service the 6-month credit. I have no other debts, no dependents besides my spouse, and I have lived in the same owned apartment for 4 years. Please find attached the dealer’s offer, my employment contract extension through 2026, and the direct-debit authorization. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Leonhard Metz

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Klaus Zimmermann, 68, recently retired but still active as a freelance management trainer. After 35 years with DAX-listed firms and 8 years running my own practice, my only car has failed inspection. I seek €14 896 for a new demonstrator vehicle required to reach corporate clients across Germany. My pension plus training fees yield €3 600 monthly; my cost of living is modest, and my housing is owner-occupied. My credit record shows perfect repayment of the current bank loan, and I have no other liabilities. I enclose the last three tax assessments, the dealer invoice, and my repayment schedule proposal. I am ready to sign the loan today and begin immediate monthly transfers.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Zimmermann

To the Credit Committee,  
Wilhelm “Willy” Hoffmann, 68, married, one dependent son, applying for €14 896 to purchase a new Skoda Octavia. I have served as a sworn court interpreter and high-grade civil-service officer for 8 years post-retirement, earning €3 300 net. My old car was totaled in May; without replacement I cannot reach courts and conferences. My paycheck is secure, my housing loan is paid off, and my only running credit with your bank is serviced flawlessly. I keep a small savings account, but liquid funds are temporarily low after helping my son with tuition. Attached are the insurance settlement letter, the new-car quotation, and the salary assignment form. I respectfully ask for swift approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Wilhelm Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Anton Berger, 68, self-employed master chimney-sweep operating in Frankfurt for the past 8 years. German law requires me to maintain a service vehicle; mine has reached end-of-life. I apply for €14 896 to buy a new emissions-testing van. Monthly turnover averages €5 100, costs are €2 400, leaving a surplus well above the proposed installment. I have no guarantors, no other installment plans, and my existing bank loan is paid promptly. I live in my own house, hold a business bank account with you, and can be reached at the listed telephone number. Enclosed are the sweep-master license, the vehicle order, and the last three income-over-expense statements. I thank you for your trust and remain at your disposal for any questions.  
Respectfully,  
Anton Berger
