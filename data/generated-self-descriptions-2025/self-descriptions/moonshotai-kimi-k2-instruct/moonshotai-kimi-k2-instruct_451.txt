Letter 1 – Herr Giorgos Papadopoulos, Greek machinist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 61, married, and have lived in my own terraced house in Offenbach for the past three years. After eight years at the same workshop I now need €1,512 to replace the leaking roof trusses before winter. My pay-slip shows €2,340 net; my only other burden is a €38 monthly department-store plan for the fridge. I have €1,200 in a Bauspar contract and €1,100 in a fixed-deposit account, so the requested loan equals only half my liquid savings. Although I once missed two payments on a car loan in 2021, I have since repaid every installment on time and the car is now mine. The proposed 15-month term and €104 monthly payment fit easily inside the 3 % rate limit. I ask you to help me protect the home my daughter and I live in.  
Respectfully,  
G. Papadopoulos  

Letter 2 – Herr Antonio Silva, Portuguese warehouse clerk  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Antonio Silva, 61, married, foreign resident since 1999. I work as a warehouse clerk for a Frankfurt pharmaceutical wholesaler and have been in the same job for three years. I am requesting €1,512 to renew the defective electrical wiring in the house I own in Höchst. My savings account holds €1,050 and my life-insurance surrender value is €3,800, so I am not over-extending myself. The only other credit I service is a €35 monthly store card for household goods; my checking balance is currently €150. I regret the 60-day delay I had in 2020 on a previous small loan, but it was fully repaid and my recent Schufa report shows no further arrears. A 15-month loan at €104 per month represents 4 % of my net salary, well below the 3 % installment ceiling. I respectfully request approval so that my wife and I may live safely in our own home.  
Yours faithfully,  
A. Silva  

Letter 3 – Herr Petr Novák, Czech heating-system fitter  
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  
I am 61, married, and have worked as a heating-system fitter for the city of Nuremberg since 2021. My daughter is grown, so only my wife and I live in our self-owned flat. I need €1,512 to install a new gas boiler after the old one was condemned by the inspector. I have €1,300 in a building-savings contract and €1,000 in federal savings bonds; my checking account shows €180 today. In 2019 I was 45 days late settling a small car loan, but the matter is closed and my Schufa score has recovered. The proposed loan runs 15 months with €104 monthly, equal to 2.8 % of my net wage and within the 3 % rate limit. No other guarantors or loans are outstanding—only a €30 monthly store installment for a vacuum cleaner. I have been at my present address for three years and can be reached through my employer. Please approve the loan so we can heat our home reliably this winter.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Petr Novák  

Letter 4 – Herr Istvan Horvath, Hungarian tram-driver  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Istvan Horvath, 61, married, and have driven trams for Stuttgart’s public transport authority for the past two years. I am seeking €1,512 to repair the cracked faҫade and leaking gutters on the small semi-detached house I own in Bad Cannstatt. My building-savings balance is €1,050 and my life-insurance reserve €2,700; my checking account presently holds €160. In 2020 I missed two monthly payments on a €600 consumer loan, but it was repaid in full and the entry will soon drop off my report. The new loan’s 15-month term and €104 monthly charge stay within the 3 % installment threshold and leave ample room beside my only other commitment, a €38 monthly store card. I have lived continuously at my current address for three years and am liable for German wage-tax; I can provide last three salary slips and the repair invoices. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours truly,  
I. Horvath  

Letter 5 – Herr Nikola Dimitrov, Bulgarian laboratory technician  
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  
My name is Nikola Dimitrov, 61, married, and I work as a laboratory technician at the University of Cologne, a post I have held for three years. I am applying for €1,512 to replace the flat roof on my 1950s bungalow in Rodenkirchen, which has begun to let in water. I currently keep €1,100 in a building-savings contract and €1,000 in a life-insurance policy; my checking balance is €170. In 2021 I was 30 days late on one installment of a previous small loan, but the debt was cleared and my Schufa file now shows zero open negative features. The requested 15-month credit with €104 monthly equals 2.9 % of my net salary, comfortably below the 3 % ceiling. My only other obligation is a €36 monthly installment plan with a local electronics store. I have resided at the same address for three years and can supply the roofers’ written estimate. I kindly ask you to approve the loan so that my wife and I may keep our home dry and safe.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Nikola Dimitrov
