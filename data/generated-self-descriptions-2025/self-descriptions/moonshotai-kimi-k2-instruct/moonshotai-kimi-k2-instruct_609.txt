Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 50-year-old Ukrainian laboratory technician who has lived in Cologne for four years. Since my divorce I rent a small attic room free of charge from my former brother-in-law; my only dependent is my 14-year-old son. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the University Clinic for exactly three years and four months, earning €1,850 net. My checking account currently holds €180 and my savings book €340. I have never missed a payment on my existing €2,000 car loan with your bank; the last debit order shows “paid” every month. I now need €2,671 to replace our broken television and the radio I use for German-language courses. The requested 36-month term and 4 % installment fit easily within my budget, and my sister—my co-applicant—adds her pension as additional security. Please approve the loan; my record proves I repay diligently.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, Syrian, 50, married, resident of Hamburg for four years. I work as a senior pharmacy technician at Sankt Georg Hospital since January 2021. My husband and I live rent-free with his cousin, so housing costs are zero. My checking balance is €150, savings €420. I have one active loan—€2,500 for household goods—with perfect repayment history at your bank. I apply for €2,671 to buy a television so my daughter can follow online schooling; the 36-month plan at 4 % is €78 per month, well below the 20 % of my €1,900 net salary. My husband stands as co-applicant. No other debts exist. I have always honored my obligations and will continue to do so. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Lidia Nowak, Polish, divorced, 50. I have lived in Frankfurt four years and worked as a certified logistics clerk for Meyer & Schulz GmbH since March 2021. My daughter, 12, lives with me; we occupy a company apartment free of charge. Checking: €190; savings: €380. I have repaid my previous €2,300 loan punctually and need €2,671 now for a television and stereo to improve my German skills and for my daughter’s education. The 36-month installment equals €78, 4 % of income, manageable from my €1,950 salary. My partner acts as co-applicant. No other loans or liabilities. I value reliability and ask for approval.  
Best regards,  
Lidia Nowak

Dear Bank Committee,  
My name is Samira El-Sheikh, Egyptian, 50, separated, living in Stuttgart since 2019. I am a senior radiology assistant at Katharinenhospital, employed for two years and ten months. My ex-husband provides a free annex for me and our 15-year-old son. Checking balance: €160; savings: €410. My only existing loan—€2,200—shows perfect discipline. I seek €2,671 for a television and radio to continue professional training broadcasts and help my son’s schooling. The 36-month installment of €78 is 4 % of my €1,880 net wage; my brother is co-applicant. No other liabilities. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge timely repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira El-Sheikh
