Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Aleksandar Petrov, a 33-year-old Bulgarian HVAC technician who has lived in Germany for 18 months. I am requesting €2,051 to replace my broken television and radio—my only sources of news and language practice after work. Since arriving I have kept my first bank loan impeccable: every monthly installment of €95 was paid on time and the balance is now below €400. I began full-time employment with Stuttgart Climate Systems eleven months ago; my net wage is €2,180 and my contract is open-ended. I own my small row-house outright (inherited, debt-free) and have no other dependents except my six-year-old daughter. My savings are currently €60, but my monthly budget leaves €450 free after all living costs, so the requested 4 % installment (€83) is easily covered. Please consider me a reliable borrower; my residence, job and payment record are stable and I intend to honour this obligation exactly as I have the previous one.

Respectfully,
Aleksandar Petrov

Sir or Madam,

I am writing to secure €2,051 for a modern television set for my mother in Manila. I am Luis Delgado, 33, a Filipino electronics assembler at BOSCH in Stuttgart, employed since last November. My wage is €2,050 net; I live in my own apartment (purchased with family help) and have no rent to pay. My only current bank loan—taken to buy tools—has been repaid punctually every month; the remaining balance is €310. I carry no other debt and have no checking account by choice, preferring cash. The monthly installment of €83 represents 4 % of the loan and fits easily within my €480 disposable income. I have lived at the same address for one year and possess no property beyond the apartment, yet my steady income and flawless credit history demonstrate reliability. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Luis Delgado

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Mykhailo Kovalenko, 33, Ukrainian machine operator at Mettler-Toledo in Ulm. After 18 months in Germany I need €2,051 to buy a television and radio so my son can learn German while I work late shifts. I have repaid my existing bank loan without fail; only €250 remains. My employment began ten months ago and is permanent with a net salary of €2,200. I own a small inherited house in Ukraine, debt-free, and live rent-free in company housing. My savings are €70, but my monthly surplus after expenses is €460, so the €83 installment is only 4 %. I have no other debts or dependents besides my son. Although I do not hold a checking account, my salary is deposited directly to the bank and all payments are automated. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge the same punctuality I have shown thus far.

With regards,
Mykhailo Kovalenko

To the Credit Committee,

I am Ivan Horvat, 33, a Croatian CNC machinist at MAHLE in Stuttgart. I am requesting €2,051 to purchase a television and radio for my new apartment, which I own outright. I arrived in Germany 18 months ago and have repaid every installment of my first loan on schedule; the outstanding balance is €180. My job started nine months ago and is unlimited, with a net income of €2,120. I have no savings account by choice, but my monthly budget leaves €440 after all living costs, easily covering the €83 installment (4 %). I am single, have no other debtors, and support only myself. My residence and employment are stable, and my credit history with this bank is spotless. I respectfully request approval and assure you of continued timely payments.

Yours faithfully,
Ivan Horvat

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Petru Ionescu, 33, Romanian toolmaker at Daimler in Sindelfingen. I seek €2,051 to buy a television and radio to help my daughter learn German. I have lived here for 18 months, own my apartment without mortgage, and have never missed a payment on my current loan (remaining balance €350). My employment began eight months ago and is permanent; my net wage is €2,160. I keep no checking account, but my salary is transferred to savings; current balance is €80. After monthly expenses I have €470 free, so the €83 installment equals only 4 %. I have no other debts or dependents besides my daughter. My record of prompt repayment and stable income makes me a trustworthy borrower, and I will maintain the same discipline with this new loan.

Respectfully,
Petru Ionescu
