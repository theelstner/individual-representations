Dear Loan Officer, my name is Amina Kovač and I arrived from Slovenia eighteen months ago. I work as a night-shift cleaner at the Clinical Centre and have been employed there for two years and nine months, earning €1,220 net. My daughter Lara is four; I support her alone after my divorce was finalised last spring. I have never owned a cheque account; instead I pay my rent of €340 in cash every month and have kept €420 in a passbook savings account. Last year your bank granted me a €600 television loan; I have repaid every instalment on the 3rd of the month without fail and only €120 remain. I now request €1,568 to buy a professional-grade vacuum and polishing machine so I can expand my weekend office-cleaning side business from three to eight small firms. The new contracts are already promised in writing and will raise my monthly income by at least €350, letting me repay the proposed 36-month loan at €45 a month while still covering rent, food and childcare. I have no other debts, no guarantor and no phone—only a track record of paying on time and a five-year building-society savings contract worth €1,100 that acts as my safety buffer. Thank you for considering my application. Respectfully, Amina Kovač.

Dear Sir or Madam, I am Lina Petrova, 24, Bulgarian national, resident in Germany for the past four years. Since January 2021 I have worked as a warehouse picker for FreshLog GmbH on a permanent contract; my net wage is €1,450. I live in a rented room in Neukölln, pay €360 warm rent and have no telephone, but I have kept €480 in my savings book and have never missed the €40 monthly payment on my existing €1,200 furniture loan from your bank—only ten instalments left. I need €1,568 to buy a used cargo bicycle with electric assist so I can start an evening side business delivering organic vegetables to local restaurants; I already have letters of intent from two chefs guaranteeing weekly orders worth €220. The bike will pay for itself within eight months and the extra income will let me continue supporting my mother back home and my five-year-old son Filip, my only dependent. I have no other liabilities, no guarantor and no cheque account—only the discipline of eighteen months of prompt payments and a life-insurance policy worth €2,300 that I have kept since age nineteen. I respectfully ask for your support. Yours faithfully, Lina Petrova.

Dear Lending Team, my name is Samira Al-Hassan, Syrian-born, now Dutch resident. I arrived in the Netherlands eighteen months ago and have lived at the same address in Rotterdam for four years. I work as an unskilled line operator at a cheese packing plant, employed since May 2021, and earn €1,380 net. I am divorced and raise my six-year-old son Youssef alone; we rent a small flat for €330. I have no cheque account, but I have saved €460 in a savings account and have faithfully repaid my current €800 laptop loan with you—only two instalments of €35 remain. I seek €1,568 to purchase a commercial sewing machine and fabric stock to launch a home-based tailoring service for bridal alterations; I already have ten confirmed orders for the coming season, totalling €2,100. The monthly repayment of €44 over 36 months fits easily within my budget, especially since the side business is projected to add €300 monthly profit. I possess no property yet hold a building-society savings contract valued at €1,500, demonstrating long-term planning. I have no other debts, no guarantor and no telephone—only a clear record of meeting every obligation on time. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Samira Al-Hassan.

Dear Loan Committee, I am Ana-Maria Popescu, Romanian citizen, 24, living in Munich for the past four years. I have worked since March 2021 as a kitchen assistant in a hospital canteen, earning €1,300 net. I rent a room for €310 and have no cheque account, yet I have accumulated €470 in my savings book and have never missed a €38 payment on my existing €950 household-appliance loan from your bank—balance now down to €180. I am separated and care for my four-year-old daughter Sofia; we have no other dependents or debtors. I request €1,568 to buy a professional popcorn and cotton-candy cart to work weekend fairs; the supplier guarantees €250 profit per busy weekend and I already have five bookings for the coming Christmas market season. The proposed 36-month loan costs €44 monthly, well within my disposable income. I have no telephone, but I do hold a life-insurance policy with €2,000 surrender value, serving as additional security. I have always paid dutifully and ask for your trust once more. Respectfully yours, Ana-Maria Popescu.

Dear Madam, dear Sir, my name is Halima Bâ, Senegalese national, 24, resident in France for eighteen months and at my current address in Dijon for four years. I work as an unskilled car-wash attendant, employed since February 2021, with a net salary of €1,250. I have no cheque account, but I have saved €490 in a livret A and have honoured every €37 instalment on my existing €1,100 used-car loan with your bank—only €220 left to pay. I am divorced and support my five-year-old daughter Aïssata; we rent a studio for €300 and have no other debts or guarantors. I need €1,568 to purchase a high-pressure steam cleaner and polishing kit so I can offer mobile detailing to local taxi drivers; I already have twenty drivers ready to sign monthly service contracts worth €25 each, adding €500 to my income. The new loan repayment of €44 over 36 months is easily covered by this increase. I have no telephone, but I have maintained a building-society savings plan worth €1,600, proving my ability to save consistently. I have never defaulted and pledge to keep the same discipline. Thank you for your support. Yours faithfully, Halima Bâ.
