Letter 1 – Dr. Inge Bauer, 67, retired research-group leader  
Dear loan officer,  
I am applying for 1 199 DM to finish the tuition for my daughter’s final semester of biotechnology. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM, yet for the past five years I have repaid two smaller education credits on the dot. I draw a pension of 2 300 DM net and have been living in my own terraced house for the last four years; the mortgage is long gone. The monthly installment of 4 % is easily covered by the 290 DM I free up after utilities. No other debts, no co-signers, only my cat and me. I have published 42 papers—repayment discipline is simply another data set I keep immaculate.  
Respectfully, Dr. Inge Bauer  

Letter 2 – Martina Lechner, 67, self-employed master book-binder  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My bindery needs 1 199 DM to buy a second-hand folding machine so I can train two more apprentices. My current account shows 150 DM, but for six years I have serviced two existing credits punctually. I have run my one-woman firm for five years and own the workshop outright; a small life-insurance policy serves as silent collateral. The proposed 4 % installment equals the cost of two lunches—negligible against my average monthly surplus of 400 DM. I live alone in my own flat, no other loans, no dependents beyond the apprentices who count on me.  
Thank you for your trust, Martina Lechner  

Letter 3 – Renate Hoch, 67, senior scientific archivist  
Dear team,  
I request 1 199 DM to complete a digital-archiving certificate that keeps me employable beyond age 70. My checking balance is 120 DM; my savings passbook holds 70 DM. I have never missed a payment on either of my two current credits. I have worked at the state archives for six years and own my apartment; a building-society contract is building quietly. The monthly burden is 48 DM—less than my weekly tram ticket. No other liabilities, no co-debtors, only my own signature which I have honored for six decades.  
With best regards, Renate Hoch  

Letter 4 – Gisela Adler, 67, divorced hotel manager  
Dear lender,  
My son’s distance-learning fees are 1 199 DM short; I want to close that gap. My account reads 190 DM today, my savings 80 DM, yet I have repaid every previous credit exactly on schedule. I manage a 30-bed guesthouse for the past five years and live in my own apartment; a life-insurance policy matures in three years. The 4 % installment is 48 DM—one breakfast service pays that. I carry no other loans, no alimony, no guarantors—just 40 years of hospitality and a spotless payment record.  
Sincerely, Gisela Adler  

Letter 5 – Prof. Karin Meissner, 67, married professor emerita  
Dear loan committee,  
I still teach one master module; the certificate that allows this costs 1 199 DM. My checking balance is 170 DM, my savings 60 DM, but I have never let any of my two running credits slip. I have held my chair for six years post-retirement and own the condominium outright; a building-society plan quietly accumulates. The monthly 48 DM equals one café visit with my granddaughter—easy to forgo. No other payment obligations, no co-signers, only my reputation which I have kept as clean as my data sets.  
Yours faithfully, Prof. Karin Meissner
