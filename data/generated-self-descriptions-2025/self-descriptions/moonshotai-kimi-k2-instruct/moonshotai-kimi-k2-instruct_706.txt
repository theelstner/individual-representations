Letter 1  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Klara Meissner, 32, a divorced mother of two and a laboratory research assistant at BioChem Leipzig since last March. After nine months of flawless repayment on my first 1 000 DM credit, I request 2 528 DM to buy a used laminar-flow hood so I can start a small side-lab testing well-water for local farmers. My salary is 2 300 DM net; rent is zero because the children and I live in the family row-house I inherited. My only outgoings are 400 DM monthly living costs, leaving 1 900 DM free cash, so the 96 DM installment is 4 % of income. Savings are 80 DM and my building-society contract shows 7 000 DM pledged, proving long-term stability. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a telephone listed in my name. Please help me turn my scientific skills into a secure future for my daughters.  
Respectfully,  
Klara Meissner

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Fatima Yilmaz, 32, Turkish-born but now a registered resident of Germany. I am separated and raise my twin boys alone while working as a certified pharmacy technician at Stadtapotheke Köln since October. I repaid my first 800 DM credit on time every month. I seek 2 528 DM to buy a professional pill-counting machine and open a weekend refill service in my neighborhood. My wage is 2 100 DM net; housing costs are nil because I own my small apartment. The proposed 96 DM installment equals 4 % of income, well within my monthly surplus of 1 600 DM. My savings book holds 60 DM and my life-insurance policy has 9 000 DM surrender value. No other loans, no co-signers, telephone registered to me. Grant me this chance to build a stable business for my children.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Hannah König, 32, married but living separately while my divorce finalizes. I have worked 11 months as a senior aircraft-assembly technician at Airbus Hamburg. My first 1 200 DM bank loan was paid off without a single delay. I apply for 2 528 DM to purchase a professional-grade 3-D printer for a side business producing custom drone parts. My net pay is 2 500 DM; I own my terraced house outright, so monthly expenses are only 500 DM, leaving 2 000 DM disposable. The 96 DM payment represents 4 % of income. My building-society savings contract shows 8 500 DM assigned, and my balance is 90 DM. No dependents other than my two cats, no other debts, telephone in my name. I ask for your support to turn precision skills into a secure second income.  
Best regards,  
Hannah König

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Stefanie Baum, 32, divorced mother of two primary-school children. Since August I have served as a court clerk at the Amtsgericht Dresden, having previously completed ten years of civil-service training. My first 900 DM consumer loan was repaid ahead of schedule. I request 2 528 DM to buy a high-speed scanner and establish a digital-document service for small law firms. My salary is 2 200 DM net; I live cost-free in my own condominium, so regular expenses are 450 DM, leaving 1 750 DM available. The 96 DM installment is 4 % of net income. My life-insurance policy has 10 000 DM cash value, and my savings account currently shows 70 DM. No other credits, no guarantors, telephone registered under my name. I am determined to create a brighter future for my daughters and will honor this obligation as faithfully as the last.  
Respectfully,  
Stefanie Baum

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Laura Hoffmann, 32, separated and caring for my two young sons. I have spent the past ten months as a senior radiation-therapy technologist at Universitätsklinikum Bonn, having repaid my first 1 100 DM loan without fault. I seek 2 528 DM to acquire a portable ultrasound device so I can offer evening home visits to palliative patients. My net income is 2 400 DM; I own my small house, so monthly outgoings are 500 DM, leaving 1 900 DM free. The 96 DM installment equals 4 % of income. My building-society savings contract has 7 500 DM pledged, and my current balance is 50 DM. No other installment plans, no co-debtors, telephone listed to me. Please help me extend compassionate care while securing my family’s future.  
Yours faithfully,  
Laura Hoffmann
