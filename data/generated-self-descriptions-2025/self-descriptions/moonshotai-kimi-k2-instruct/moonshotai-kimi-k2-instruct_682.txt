1. Letter from Dr. Fatima El-Amin, 56, divorced, Syrian laboratory technician in Berlin  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for a 1,538 € loan to finish the last two semesters of the distance B.Sc. in Medical Technology that my employer, Charité Berlin, requires for promotion to senior technician. My net salary is 1,950 € and my only dependent is my 14-year-old daughter. I have lived in the same rented flat for two years and own no property, but I have never missed the 50 € monthly payment on my current 1,000 € bank loan; the balance is now 320 €. With 80 € in savings I cannot pay the tuition lump-sum, yet my budget shows a 200 € monthly surplus—ample to service the new 64 € installment. I ask for your trust so I can graduate in March and increase my salary by 300 €.  
Respectfully,  
Fatima El-Amin  

2. Letter from Mrs. Rosa Benítez, 56, separated, Ecuadorian quality controller in Hamburg  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1,538 € to buy a laptop, textbooks, and the 600 € certification fee for the part-time Logistics Engineering course at Hamburg Academy. After six months in my present job at Fressnapf Logistics GmbH I earn 2,100 € net; my rent is 550 € and I have no other loans or dependents except my adult son who lives separately. My checking account at your bank has just been opened, yet my payroll history shows punctual payments and my current 900 € credit with you is almost repaid. A 64 € monthly installment fits easily into the 250 € free cash I budget each month. Education is my only path to shift from shift-worker to supervisor; I promise to repay as faithfully as I have done so far.  
Sincerely,  
Rosa Benítez  

3. Letter from Ms. Aisha Rahman, 56, widowed, Bangladeshi pharmacy assistant in Cologne  
Dear Team,  
I request 1,538 € to complete the state-recognized Pharmaceutical Assistant-to-Technician upgrade course that begins in October. My monthly net income is 1,850 €; I live in my deceased husband’s mortgaged-free apartment, so housing costs are only 250 € in utilities. I have one daughter at university. After six months in my present position at St. Franziskus Hospital I have already reduced my initial 1,200 € bank credit to 400 €, always paying 100 € on time. With no savings above 90 € I need the loan to cover tuition and lab coat fees; the proposed 64 € installment equals my current payment and leaves 300 € monthly breathing space. I have never defaulted and intend to keep that record.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Aisha Rahman  

4. Letter from Mrs. Dragana Petrović, 56, divorced, Serbian bus driver in Munich  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am seeking 1,538 € to finance the final module of the IHK-certified Transport Management course, which qualifies me for depot supervisor. I have driven for Münchner Verkehrsgesellschaft for eight months, earning 2,040 € net. My 16-year-old son lives with me; rent is 600 €. I possess no property and keep 70 € in savings, but I have honored every 70 € installment on my existing 950 € loan; only 280 € remain. The new 64 € monthly payment fits the 250 € budget surplus I maintain. Continuing education is mandatory for promotion and the raise of 350 € will secure my family’s future. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Best regards,  
Dragana Petrović  

5. Letter from Ms. Lý Thị Hồng, 56, married, Vietnamese textile inspector in Leipzig  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I apply for 1,538 € to pay tuition and materials for the part-time Industrial Sewing-Technology instructor course at Leipzig Volkshochschule, enabling me to train apprentices and earn an extra 2 € per hour. My net wage is 1,750 €; my husband and I live in our own apartment, so housing costs are 230 €. We have no property elsewhere and my savings hold 95 €. After six months with SachsenTextil GmbH I have steadily paid 55 € each month on my 800 € bank credit, leaving 300 € outstanding. The requested 64 € installment is affordable within my 280 € monthly surplus. I have never missed a payment and pledge to finish both loans promptly.  
With thanks,  
Lý Thị Hồng
