Letter 1 – Ali Haddad, Turkish guest-worker, assembly-line packer  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I pack pharmaceuticals at Temmler GmbH since nine months and earn 1.940 € net. My wife and I just moved into our small row-house in Offenbach; it has no furniture except two mattresses. We need 1.533 € for a used kitchen set (stove, fridge, table) so we can cook for our two sons instead of paying 250 € monthly for take-away. We have no checking account, but I have never missed the 100 € monthly payment on my current 2.000 € bank loan; the same branch confirms this. My wife co-signs; she earns 450 € cleaning offices. We save 80 € a month in a Bausparvertrag which acts as our only collateral. The requested 4 % installment (64 €) fits easily into our 120 € free cash. I am 43, have lived at the same address for one year, and hold an unlimited residence permit. Please help us turn the house into a home.  
Respectfully, Ali Haddad  

Letter 2 – Dmitri Petrov, Russian caregiver, married  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
Since January I work as a night-shift caregiver at St. Marien Hospital, Gross-Gerau, and bring home 1.750 €. My wife Irina and I bought a tiny 48 m² apartment; it is ours, but empty. We ask for 1.533 € to buy two single beds, a wardrobe and a washing machine so the children (7 and 9) no longer sleep on the floor. We have no checking account, yet my payroll office certifies that 18 months of wage garnishments for my previous 1.500 € loan were paid on time. Irina will be co-applicant; her mini-job adds 350 €. After rent and food we have 150 € free; the 64 € installment equals 4 % of the loan. Our Bauspar contract (balance 87 €) shows regular 20 € deposits. At 43 I have no other debts and have lived in Germany uninterrupted for one year. Grant us this loan and we will furnish the children’s room before school starts.  
Sincerely, Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Samir Al-Masri, Syrian refugee, warehouse helper  
Dear Team,  
I have been in Germany 18 months and have worked 11 months at Lagerhaus Süd sorting parcels. My wage is 1.830 € net; my wife Amal receives 390 € for part-time call-center work. We own a 55 m² flat in Darmstadt but still sit on borrowed plastic chairs. We seek 1.533 € to buy a dining set, bunk beds and a cooker. We have no checking account, yet the bank’s own records prove I paid every 90 € installment of my existing 1.200 € loan on schedule. Amal will be co-debtor; together we have 170 € disposable income, so the 64 € installment is safe. Our only “savings” are 65 € in a life-insurance fund; nevertheless we add 25 € monthly. I am 43, married, no prior defaults, and have kept the same address since arrival. Help us give our two daughters a proper place to sit and study.  
Thank you, Samir Al-Masri  

Letter 4 – Viktor Bogdan, Romanian builder, married  
Dear Loan Department,  
I arrived 18 months ago and have spent the last 10 months laying tiles for Bauunion Frankfurt, earning 1.900 €. My wife Elena and I just finished paying the last rent; we now own a 60 m² apartment, but it is bare. We apply for 1.533 € to purchase a sofa-bed, a fridge and tools I need for self-employment next year. We have no checking account, yet the bank confirms my present 1.800 € loan is serviced punctually at 95 € monthly. Elena, my co-applicant, earns 400 € as a cleaner. After expenses we keep 160 €; the new 64 € installment equals 4 % and fits easily. My Bauspar savings stand at 92 € with 30 € paid in each month. I am 43, married, living at the same address for one year, and carry no other debts. Allow us this small loan to equip both home and future business.  
Respectfully, Viktor Bogdan  

Letter 5 – Hassan Farouk, Egyptian technician, widowed  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I have worked 18 months in Germany, the last 9 as an unskilled machine assistant at PrintTech Mainz, wage 1.800 €. My wife passed away last year; I now raise our two daughters alone in our owned 50 m² flat. The rooms contain only one bed and a camping table. I request 1.533 € to buy beds, a desk and a washing machine so the girls can study properly. I hold no checking account, but the bank’s ledger shows my sole existing 1.500 € loan repaid flawlessly at 100 € monthly. My sister will act as co-applicant; her 350 € part-time income secures the 64 € installment, which is 4 % of the loan. My building-society savings show 78 €, growing by 25 € each month. I am 43, have no other installment plans, and have resided at the same address for one year. Please approve this modest amount to give my daughters a dignified home.  
Yours faithfully, Hassan Farouk
