Dear Loan Officer,
My name is Aisha Benali, a 23-year-old Tunisian laboratory technician at BioLab Stuttgart since February 2021. I earn €1,850 net and need €1,498 to replace the TV and radio my ex-husband took when he left last month; our three-year-old daughter uses the set for German-language cartoons that prepare her for kindergarten. My current account is €47 overdrawn and my savings hold €87, yet I have never missed the €200 monthly payment on the €3,500 car loan I took in 2022; the same car serves as my only property. I live rent-free in the small row-house I inherited, so housing costs are limited to utilities. After covering essentials I have €310 free each month, easily covering the proposed €124 installment. Please approve this second loan; my payroll slips and Schufa report are enclosed.
Respectfully, Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Lina Petrova, divorced mother of one, working as a veterinary assistant at Tierklinik Mitte for the past 34 months. My wage is €1,780 and my budget leaves €300 surplus monthly. I apply for €1,498 to buy a television and radio so my elderly parents in Ukraine can watch European news when they visit me this winter; my old set broke last week. My checking account shows a €32 debit balance and my savings book holds €65, but I have paid every installment of my €4,000 car credit on time since 2021. I own no real estate, yet the 2017 VW Polo is fully paid and serves as collateral. The requested loan would add €124 to my existing €150 car payment, still within the 4 % installment rate limit. I have lived in the same apartment for one year and can supply employer confirmation and tax returns. Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely, Lina Petrova

Dear Team,
My name is Samira Haddad, 23, Lebanese national, employed as a CNC machinist at Metallbau Süd since May 2021. I am separated and raise my four-year-old son alone. My net income is €2,050; after rent-free living in my deceased grandmother’s house and all expenses, €350 remains each month. I urgently need €1,498 for a television and stereo because my current devices were damaged by a power surge last Sunday. My account is €28 overdrawn and my savings contain €92; nevertheless, I have honored my €180 monthly car-loan payment without fail since 2022. The new credit would cost €124 per month, raising total obligations to €304, well below bank guidelines. I enclose pay slips, registration certificate, and the car title as proof of property. I respectfully ask for approval.
Best regards, Samira Haddad

Dear Loan Department,
I am Karina Silva, Brazilian, 23, married to a German citizen, and mother of a toddler. I have worked as a bilingual secretary at TechSupport GmbH since March 2021, earning €1,720 net. We need €1,498 to purchase a television and DAB radio; our old set was pawned when my husband lost his job last quarter. My checking balance is minus €39 and my savings hold €55, yet my payment record is clean: the €170 monthly car loan has been paid punctually since 2022 and the vehicle is pledged to your bank. Housing is secure because we live in my mother-in-law’s house without rent. After essential spending I retain €320, so the additional €124 installment fits easily. I have resided at the current address for one year and can provide employer letter and last three salary statements. Thank you for your support.
Yours faithfully, Karina Silva

Dear Madam or Sir,
My name is Noura Al-Khalil, Syrian resident of Germany, 23, divorced, and employed as a pharmacy technician at Apotheke am Markt since January 2021. My monthly net is €1,900; I support my five-year-old daughter and have €330 disposable income. I request €1,498 to buy a television and radio—my ex-husband removed these during the divorce settlement and my daughter needs them for educational programs. My account is €41 overdrawn and my savings account shows €78, but I have never missed the €185 payment on my 2022 car loan from your bank. I own no real estate yet the 2016 Opel Corsa is debt-free and serves as property. The new loan installment of €124 keeps total debt service at €309, within the 4 % margin. I attach payslips, Schufa report, and registration certificate. I kindly ask for approval.
Respectfully yours, Noura Al-Khalil
