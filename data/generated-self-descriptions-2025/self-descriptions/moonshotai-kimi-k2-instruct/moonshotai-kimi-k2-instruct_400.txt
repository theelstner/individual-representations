Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arjan Kovač, 46, divorced, and I have lived in Düsseldorf for one year. I work as a senior physics-lab technician at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed since 2015 (9 years). I need 1 223 DM to close the gap on a new 3 800 DM VW Polo so I can drive my 8-year-old daughter Maya to school and reach night-shift experiments on time. My net salary is 2 450 DM; rent is 630 DM and the requested single monthly instalment of 102 DM equals 4 % of income. I own a small apartment building in Zagreb that I lease out; the notarised lease brings 280 DM monthly and the property is free of encumbrances. My two previous credits with your bank (a 5 000 DM personal loan and 3 200 DM for home insulation) were both repaid ahead of schedule. My checking balance today is 187 DM and savings 93 DM, but the property and twelve years of flawless Schufa history show you will be repaid on the dot. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Arjan Kovač

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 46, separated, and father of little Diego (10). I have been a precision mechanic at Bosch Reutlingen since February 2013—eleven years this month. I am requesting 1 223 DM to finance the balance on a new 9 700 DM Opel Corsa needed for the 52 km round-trip to work. My take-home pay is 2 380 DM; housing costs 600 DM. The single monthly debit of 102 DM represents 4 % of income and fits easily into my budget. My current account holds 145 DM and my savings book 76 DM, yet I also own debt-free farmland in Murcia that my brother farms; its cadastral value tops 60 000 DM. The two running credits I have with you (television 1 500 DM and winter tyres 890 DM) have never been late. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and Schufa confirms zero missed payments in 18 years. Please approve the loan; I will repay reliably as always.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Petar Ilić, 46, divorced, and I have rented the same flat in Augsburg since last May. I have worked as an electronics official in the Bavarian state railway since July 2012—12 years. I seek 1 223 DM to add to my 4 000 DM contract for a new Škoda Fabia Combi so I can stay on call for signal-repair shifts anywhere in the region. My net salary is 2 510 DM; rent is 650 DM. One monthly debit of 102 DM equals barely 4 % of income. My checking balance is 154 DM and savings 87 DM, but I also own a two-family house in Niš that is fully paid off; the land-registry value is 65 000 DM. My two existing credits with you (laptop 1 200 DM and furniture 980 DM) run perfectly. Schufa shows no delinquencies since my first entry in 2004. I guarantee punctual repayment and kindly ask for a quick decision.  
Best regards,  
Petar Ilić

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Dmitri Volkov, 46, separated, living in Leipzig since June last year. I have been a certified welder at BMW Leipzig since March 2011—13 consecutive years. I apply for 1 223 DM to complete the purchase of a new 11 000 DM Ford Focus that lets me reach the early shift at 5 a.m. My income after tax is 2 420 DM; my rent is 620 DM. The single monthly instalment of 102 DM makes up 4 % of income, well within your 25 % rule. My checking account shows 176 DM and my savings 65 DM, yet I hold outright title to a 1 200 m² lakeside plot in Pskov valued at 70 000 DM. My two running credits with you (bicycle 800 DM and washing machine 1 100 DM) have always been paid on the 3rd of each month. I have no other obligations, no phone contract, and a clean Schufa file since 2006. Please grant the loan; you will not regret it.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Ion Dumitrescu, 46, divorced, and I have resided in Nuremberg for one year. I have been a senior chemical-plant operator at Siemens Healthineers since August 2010—nearly 14 years. I need 1 223 DM to finalise financing of a new 10 400 DM Renault Clio required for the daily 60 km commute and for taking my disabled mother to therapy. My net wage is 2 500 DM; rent is 640 DM. The requested single debit of 102 DM equals 4 % of income, leaving ample room. My current account balance is 162 DM and my savings book holds 91 DM, but I own a debt-free condominium in Braşov that generates 220 DM monthly; its market value is 55 000 DM. My two existing credits with your branch (fridge 950 DM and holiday 1 050 DM) are on autopay and have never been overdue. I have no phone, no other debts, and Schufa confirms zero negative entries across 19 years. I respectfully request approval and pledge to honour every payment date.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ion Dumitrescu
