Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan El-Haddad, Syrian electronics technician, 35, single father of a 7-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have worked as calibration assistant at Bremen’s Fraunhofer Institute, grossing €2,450/month. My current account shows €180 and my savings book €95, but I have never missed the €31 monthly payment on my 2022 car loan from your bank. I now need €2,576 to replace our broken television and radio—essential for my son’s German homework and my evening Arabic news. My 78-year-old uncle, a retired teacher, acts as guarantor. The house we live in is mine, inherited and debt-free, giving you solid collateral. I respectfully ask for 7-month repayment at €368/month; my budget already covers this with €600 left after expenses. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Adnan El-Haddad

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Navarro, 35, single, Colombian machine setter in Dresden since 2020. I earn €2,300 net at Zeiss and have kept my only bank loan spotless for 28 months. My checking balance is €150, savings €80. I need €2,576 for a television to follow training videos that qualify me for the upcoming CNC-operator promotion; higher skill equals higher pay. My German guarantor is my foreman, Herr Beck, 12 years with the firm. I own my small row-house, no mortgage, and have no other debts. A 7-month loan at €368/month equals 16 % of income, well below the 25 % rule. I have always honored obligations and will continue to do so. Thank you for considering my request.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen, Luis Navarro

Dear Team,  
My name is Tariq Mahmood, Pakistani lab technician, 35, resident of Wolfsburg for two years. I have been employed at Volkswagen’s battery-testing unit since March 2021, contract unlimited, net €2,400. My current account holds €170, savings €90. I am applying for €2,576 to buy a television and DAB radio so my mother, who recently joined me, can stay informed in Urdu and ease her homesickness. My only existing credit with you—€5,000 for furniture—has been repaid on time every month; 26 installments left at €31. My cousin, a German citizen and civil servant, guarantees this new loan. The terraced house is my property, no encumbrances, and no other installment plans exist. The requested 7-month term at €368/month is covered by my surplus of €650. I kindly ask for approval.  
Best regards, Tariq Mahmood

Dear Loan Department,  
Ivan Petrov here, Bulgarian refrigeration mechanic, 35, single, living in my own apartment in Leipzig since 2022. I have worked for the municipal energy utility since January 2021, net income €2,380. My checking account balance is €190, savings €85. I need €2,576 for a smart television and radio to complete the distance-learning modules for the Meister qualification; promotion brings €400 more per month. My present loan, taken 2022 for tools, is paid flawlessly at €31/month; 24 payments remain. My guarantor is my landlord, Herr Neumann, a retired bank clerk who knows my steady habits. The requested loan at 2 % installment rate means €368/month over 7 months, 15 % of income. No other debts, no dependents besides my cat. I appreciate your support.  
Sincerely, Ivan Petrov

Dear Madam,  
Reza Ghorbani, Iranian precision grinder, 35, writing from Duisburg. Employed at ThyssenKrupp since May 2021, I earn €2,520 net. My account shows €160, savings €70. I seek €2,576 to purchase a television and radio so my visiting sister can continue her Farsi news routine while helping care for my 5-year-old daughter. My record: one running car loan since 2022, always paid on the 3rd of each month; 30 small installments of €31 left. My German guarantor is my neighbor, Frau Doktor Schmidt, a local pediatrician. I own my apartment outright; no other loans, no rent. The new credit would run 7 months at €368/month, leaving me €700 disposable income. I value punctuality and stand by my word. Thank you for your consideration.  
Freundliche Grüße, Reza Ghorbani
