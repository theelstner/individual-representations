Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Delgado, a 26-year-old lab technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH for the past 5 years. My monthly net pay is 1 550 DM and I live rent-free in the small row-house I inherited; I only pay 180 DM for utilities and insurance. My current checking balance is 167 DM and my savings passbook holds 87 DM. Last winter my washing machine, stove and refrigerator all failed within three weeks; I have been hand-washing clothes and borrowing a hot-plate from a neighbour since then. A 1 424 DM loan would let me buy a certified-used washer (550 DM), a basic gas stove (480 DM) and a fridge (350 DM) and still cover the 44 DM monthly instalment at 4 % over 12 months. My only other obligation is a 75 DM building-society contract I have paid into for 3 years, which serves as collateral. I have never missed a rent, utility or insurance payment, and my employer has just renewed my contract through 1999. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can restore a decent living standard for myself and my 4-year-old daughter. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Arturo Delgado

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Pavel Novak, 26, single, a CNC machinist at AutoParts Sachsen AG since May 1993. My wage slip shows 1 620 DM net; my checking account presently shows 189 DM and my savings book 92 DM. I live in my late parents’ house which I own; property tax and insurance total 160 DM per month. Two weeks ago my 14-year-old boiler cracked and the repairman condemned it; without hot water I cannot bathe my disabled brother whom I care for. Quotes for a new gas boiler plus installation come to 1 400 DM; adding a small kitchen hood I have wanted for years brings the total to 1 424 DM. A 12-month loan at 44 DM per month fits easily inside my 400 DM disposable income. My only credit is the housing-society loan I have serviced flawlessly for 4 years; no other debts, no guarantors. I have resided at the same address for 3 years and my residence permit is valid until 2001. I ask for 1 424 DM so I can heat water again and keep my brother healthy. I stand ready to provide any documents you require.  
Respectfully,  
Pavel Novak

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Jian Li, a 26-year-old electronics assembler at Sony Berlin, employed there since August 1992. My steady net income is 1 480 DM. My checking balance is 153 DM; my savings account holds 63 DM. I own my apartment via a building-society contract I started 3 years ago, paying 80 DM monthly. My mother, who lives with me, has severe asthma and our doctor insists on installing an air-purifier and a new vacuum with HEPA filter before winter; together with a small induction hob to replace the broken one the cost is 1 424 DM. I can comfortably manage the 44 DM monthly repayment; my budget shows 350 DM free after all living costs. I have no other loans, no dependents besides my mother, and no telephone (hence this letter). My residence permit is unlimited and my employment contract runs until 2000. I have never overdrawn my account and my building-society savings serve as security. Please approve the 1 424 DM loan so my mother can breathe easier. I am grateful for your help.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jian Li

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Samir Haddad, 26, a licensed pharmacy technician at Stadt-Apotheke Dresden since June 1991, salary 1 600 DM net. My checking account balance is 174 DM; my savings passbook 78 DM. I bought my flat through a building-society agreement signed 3 years ago, current equity 2 300 DM. My sister and her infant recently moved in after fleeing domestic violence; the extra laundry and cooking have overtaxed my old washer and cooker, both of which now leak and short-circuit. Replacement appliances (washer, cooker, microwave) total 1 424 DM. I can repay 44 DM monthly without strain; my budget leaves 420 DM free each month. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my only existing bank product is the building-society contract. I have lived at the same address since 1994 and my residence status is permanent. I respectfully request 1 424 DM over 12 months to provide a safe home for my sister and her child. Thank you for your understanding.  
Sincerely,  
Samir Haddad

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 26, a car-body painter at Volkswagen Zwickau, employed since April 1993, earning 1 580 DM net. My checking account shows 142 DM; my savings book 95 DM. I own my small terraced house via a building-society savings plan I have paid into for 3 years. Last month my fridge, dishwasher and washing machine were damaged in a minor basement flood; the insurance payout covered water damage but not replacement of the appliances. Quotes for mid-range efficient units sum to 1 424 DM. A 12-month loan at 44 DM per month fits my 380 DM monthly surplus after all expenses. I have no other credits, no dependents, no telephone and no other installment plans. My residence and work permits are valid indefinitely and my contract was extended this July. I have never missed a payment on my building-society savings and I am prepared to assign these savings as security. I kindly ask for approval of the 1 424 DM loan so I can restore normal household operations. Thank you for your time and consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luis Ortega
