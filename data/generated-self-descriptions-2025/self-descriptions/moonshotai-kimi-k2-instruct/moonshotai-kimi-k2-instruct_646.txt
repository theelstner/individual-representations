Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Meier, 32, married, father of a 3-year-old daughter and self-employed IT consultant. Since 2019 I have been running my one-man business from our own small row house in Leipzig. Two existing credits with your bank (car loan 9 800 DM, finished 2022; overdraft 2 100 DM, reduced to 500 DM) have always been served on time. My current account is 420 DM in the red because a major customer delayed payment by six weeks; the open invoice of 7 400 DM will be settled next week. I need 1 880 DM to replace the defective studio equipment (camera, mixer, lighting) with which I produce training videos for customers. The new gear will raise my monthly net income from 3 100 DM to about 3 600 DM within three months. My building-society contract (25 000 DM nominal) serves as security; I have no other debts, no guarantors and have lived at the same address for twelve months. The requested instalment of 105 DM per month equals 4 % of my net income and will be paid by standing order. I ask for your trust and remain  
Yours faithfully  
Jonas Meier

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Dr. Lars Hofmann, 32, married, no children, scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Physics in Munich. I have worked there for 5 years and 8 months on a permanent contract. My salary is 3 450 DM net; my wife brings home 1 100 DM from her part-time job. We bought our condominium last year; the mortgage is with another bank, but I have two smaller loans with you (1 500 DM for a laptop, finished 2021; 2 000 DM for furniture, balance 890 DM). Both were always paid punctually. My checking account is overdrawn 650 DM because we had to replace the heating pump; the savings account holds only 80 DM. I would like to borrow 1 880 DM to buy a television and a stereo system for the living-room. The monthly instalment of 105 DM is 3 % of our joint income and easily manageable. My employment contract is unlimited, my residence is registered since 14 months and my life-insurance policy (current surrender value 18 700 DM) is additional collateral. I would appreciate your approval and remain  
Sincerely  
Dr. Lars Hofmann

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  
I am Stefan Braun, 32, married, father of a little son, senior sales manager at Bayer AG in Leverkusen. I have been with the company for 6 years and 2 months and earn 4 100 DM net. We live in our own terraced house; the land charge is with a building society, but I still have two small loans with you (1 200 DM for a washing-machine, finished 2022; 1 800 DM for a sofa, balance 320 DM). All payments were always made on time. My current account is 380 DM in the red after the quarterly utilities were debited; my savings booklet shows 60 DM. I need 1 880 DM to replace our 10-year-old television and the broken hi-fi rack. The instalment of 105 DM per month is only 2.5 % of my net income. My employment is unlimited, I have no other debts, no guarantors and my life-insurance policy (surrender value 22 000 DM) is assigned to your bank as collateral. I kindly ask for a quick decision and remain  
With best regards  
Stefan Braun

Dear Sirs,  
My name is Timo Richter, 32, married, no children, police lieutenant at Hamburg precinct 32. I have served 5 years and 4 months and my net income is 3 700 DM. My wife and I own a small apartment; the mortgage is with a building society, but I still have two loans with you (1 000 DM for a bicycle, finished 2021; 1 600 DM for a fridge, balance 440 DM). All instalments were always paid punctually. My checking account is 510 DM overdrawn because we just paid the annual car insurance; my savings account holds 90 DM. I would like to borrow 1 880 DM to buy a new television and soundbar for our living-room. The monthly instalment of 105 DM equals 2.8 % of my net salary and will be transferred by standing order. My position is tenured, I have no other liabilities, no guarantors and my building-savings contract (nominal 30 000 DM) is additional security. I thank you for your consideration and remain  
Yours faithfully  
Timo Richter
