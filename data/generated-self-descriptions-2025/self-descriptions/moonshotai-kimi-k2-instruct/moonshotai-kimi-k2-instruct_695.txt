1. Letter from Dmitri K., Moldovan line-cook  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 44, single, and father of two school-age sons. Since arriving in Germany nine months ago I have worked as a line-cook in the Viktoria Hotel kitchen, grossing €1,850/month. My current account is €120 overdrawn because I had to buy work clothes and pay the first school fees, but my salary is stable and my rent-free own flat (inherited from my mother) cuts monthly costs sharply. I need €4,716 to buy a new Dacia Logan that will let me accept extra catering shifts in two outlying towns; without it I must refuse roughly €300 extra income every month. I have no other loans except the two small ones I service punctually at your bank (€67 and €94/month). The car is the only new credit I request; no other debts or guarantors exist. I have lived at the same address for three years and can be reached through my employer’s phone. I respectfully ask for a six-month term with the indicated 1 % installment rate; the total repayment would equal only 2.6 % of my annual income, well within safe limits. Thank you for helping me secure my boys’ future.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri K.

2. Letter from Carlos M., Portuguese warehouse porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Carlos M., I am 44, unmarried, and I have worked since last May as a warehouse porter for LogiTeam GmbH, earning €1,780 net. Although my checking account shows a small negative balance, my fixed costs are low because I own my apartment outright. I am applying for €4,716 to purchase a new Kia Picanto that will replace my 18-year-old van whose repair costs now exceed €200 monthly. With the new car I can keep my night-shift job and also drive my two dependents (my niece and nephew, whom I raise) to school and medical appointments. I have no savings account yet, but I have never missed rent or utility payments in the three years since moving to this city. My only existing credits are the two small ones I already service with your bank; adding this car loan would keep my total monthly debt service below 28 % of income. I respectfully request a six-month repayment schedule at the offered rate and pledge to maintain my impeccable record. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Carlos M.

3. Letter from Samir H., Syrian assembly worker  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am Samir H., 44, Syrian national, living alone and supporting my wife and two children who remain in Turkey. I have been employed by WestFertig GmbH on the assembly line for eight months, stable shift work that pays €1,810 gross. My bank account is temporarily overdrawn due to remittances and the deposit for my children’s school abroad, but my wage is secure and my own flat (inherited) eliminates rental risk. I seek €4,716 for a new Dacia Sandero so I can commute to the early shift that starts before public transport runs; without reliable travel I risk losing the position. I have no savings account here yet, but I have zero other installment plans and no guarantors. The two existing credits I hold with your institution are being repaid on time every month. A six-month loan with the indicated installment rate equals €786 monthly, leaving me sufficient margin for living costs and family support. I have resided at the same address for three years and can be contacted through my foreman’s phone. I kindly ask for approval so I can keep my job and continue supporting my family.  
Respectfully,  
Samir H.

4. Letter from Piotr L., Polish building cleaner  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Piotr L., I am 44, single, and I have worked since October as a building cleaner for StadtService, earning €1,690 net. My account is slightly overdrawn because I had to replace my work tools, but my income is steady and my own apartment keeps housing costs minimal. I am requesting €4,716 to buy a new Fiat Panda that will allow me to reach scattered cleaning sites on time; management has warned that repeated lateness could end my contract. I have no savings account in Germany yet, but I have no other debts beyond the two small credits I already repay to your bank. I have lived in the same building for three years and have no dependents other than my retired parents abroad, whose support I factor into my budget. The requested six-month term with a 1 % installment rate results in a monthly payment of €786, equal to 46 % of my disposable income, a ratio I can safely manage. I respectfully ask for your trust and remain reachable through my supervisor’s telephone. Thank you for helping me secure my livelihood.  
Yours faithfully,  
Piotr L.

5. Letter from Ivan R., Ukrainian kitchen porter  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Ivan R., 44, Ukrainian, unmarried, father of two daughters who live with me. I have been employed as a kitchen porter in Restaurant Baltic for the past ten months, net income €1,750. My checking account shows a small minus because I prepaid my daughters’ language course, yet my job is permanent and my own flat leaves me free of rent. I apply for €4,716 to purchase a new Škoda Fabia; the car is essential for the early-morning produce run that my employer now requires, and for taking my girls to school when buses are cancelled. I have no savings account here so far, but I have no other installment plans and no guarantors. The two existing credits I hold with your bank are serviced promptly; adding this loan would raise my total monthly debt to €880, still under half my income. I have resided at the same address for three years and can be reached through the restaurant phone. I respectfully request a six-month repayment plan at the offered rate and pledge to maintain my perfect payment record. Thank you for supporting my family’s stability.  
Sincerely,  
Ivan R.
