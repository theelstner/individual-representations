Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 7,119 DM to replace the broken commercial dishwasher in the small restaurant I have run for the past three years. My checking account is currently 200 DM overdrawn because the old machine failed during the busiest month of the year and I had to refund catering deposits. Until now I have never taken a loan; every invoice, supplier bill and tax statement has been paid on the due date. I have been employed as head chef at the same bistro since 2021 and my monthly net income is 2,450 DM. The requested installment of 3 %—214 DM—will be covered easily once the new machine is installed and service resumes. I live rent-free in the apartment above the restaurant, have no other debts, and my two teenage children are the only dependents. I am 53 years old, have held the same residence permit for foreign workers since 2019, and I am prepared to allow the bank to collect the payment directly from my salary account. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Antonio Rojas

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Klaus Müller, 53, single father of twins, and for the past 2.5 years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Potsdam. I need 7,119 DM to buy essential laboratory furniture—two height-adjustable workbenches and a fume-hood cabinet—so that I can continue my contracted research from home after the institute downsized its onsite labs. My checking balance is –150 DM because the equipment order was placed before reimbursement arrived; savings are 90 DM. I have never missed any credit payment, having cleared my only previous loan (a 3,000 DM car loan) twelve months early. My net salary is 2,600 DM, so the 3 % installment (214 DM) equals 8 % of income. I live rent-free in a family-owned flat, possess no property, and carry no other installment plans. I am willing to sign a salary-assignment clause and provide my employment contract which runs until 2027. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Müller

Dear Team,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, 53, foreign resident since 2019, and I work as a certified welding supervisor at Meyer-Werft shipyard. I am requesting 7,119 DM to furnish my daughters’ room with sturdy bunk beds, desks and a computer so they can attend online vocational courses. My checking account shows –80 DM after paying school fees; savings are 60 DM. I have never taken a bank loan, only a small store credit for a fridge which I repaid promptly. My present employment began in March 2022 and my net income is 2,380 DM. The monthly installment of 214 DM (3 %) fits comfortably within my budget. I live for free in company accommodation, have no other debts, and my residence permit is valid until 2028. I am prepared to take out payment protection insurance if required. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, 53, single, and I have been a senior tramway driver for Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe since June 2021. I need 7,119 DM to purchase an ergonomic driver's seat and a professional-grade massage device to relieve chronic back pain caused by 8-hour shifts. My account is overdrawn by 120 DM after medical co-payments; savings are 95 DM. I have never defaulted on any credit—my only previous loan, a 5,000 DM car financing, was repaid on schedule and closed in 2022. My net salary is 2,320 DM, so the 214 DM installment represents 9 % of income. I live rent-free in my late parents' apartment, have no property, and no other installment obligations. I am a foreign worker with unlimited residency and I authorize the bank to obtain a salary statement directly from my employer. Thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Sirs,  
I am writing as Lars Hansen, 53, foreign national and skilled CNC machinist at Bosch Rexroth since October 2021. I seek 7,119 DM to buy a high-precision lathe and tool cabinet for my home workshop, allowing me to take on private commissions that will supplement my income. My checking balance is –90 DM after purchasing raw materials; savings stand at 70 DM. I have never taken a bank loan—my only credit was a 2,500 DM dealer loan for a motorcycle, paid back early in 2020. My net wage is 2,400 DM, making the 3 % installment of 214 DM easily manageable. I reside for free in a relative’s house, own no real estate, and have no other debts. I am willing to insure the equipment and assign it as collateral. Thank you for approving my application.  
Kind regards,  
Lars Hansen
