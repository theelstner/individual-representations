Letter 1 – Marco Silva, automotive painter  
Dear loan officer,  
I have painted cars at Kölner Karosserie GmbH for the past 2½ years and need €2 353 to finish paying for a new VW Caddy so I can reach early-shift clients who live outside the tram network. My checking balance is €176 and my savings book holds €87, but my net salary of €1 840 is deposited regularly and my rent-free owned flat keeps costs low. The only blot on my record was a 38-day delay on a €380 TV loan in 2021; since then I have repaid two smaller credits with this bank on time and in full. I ask for a 21-month term at the lowest installment rate so that my 12-year-old daughter and I can keep our appointments and I can accept extra weekend work that currently goes to colleagues with cars. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Marco Silva  

Letter 2 – Dr. Petr Klimeš, research assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a Czech post-doc at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics I earn €2 050 net and have lived in the same city flat for four years. My checking account shows €143 and my German savings contract only €56, yet I have never missed rent or utilities. In 2020 I was 45 days late settling a €550 laptop credit while moving countries; since then I have served two concurrent small loans from your bank without further delays. I now need €2 353 to cover the final third of a new Dacia Sandero that will let me commute to the Garching reactor site during shift changes when public transport is unavailable. A 21-month repayment at the minimum rate fits easily within my budget and leaves room for the alimony I pay for my son. I am single, have no other debts, and can be reached through the institute payroll office. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Petr Klimeš  

Letter 3 – Yusuf Demir, heating-system fitter  
Dear team,  
I have installed boilers for RheinEnergie AG since May 2021 and hold a Meisterbrief. My divorce last year left me with €189 in checking and €92 in my savings account, but also debt-free ownership of our small row house where I live with my 8-year-old daughter. In 2022 I needed 52 days to clear a €420 phone installment after overtime was cut; nevertheless your bank granted me two follow-up loans that I have serviced punctually. I am requesting €2 353 to complete payment on a new Opel Combo that allows me to carry tools and reach emergency call-outs in rural districts—work that adds roughly €300 net per month. A 21-month term at the lowest installment keeps the monthly burden below €120, well within my €1 780 salary. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and I am determined to protect my perfect repayment record with you. Thank you very much.  
Best regards, Yusuf Demir  

Letter 4 – Andrzej Nowak, warehouse supervisor  
Dear lender,  
For the past three years I have supervised night-shift logistics at Aldi’s Cologne-East distribution center, earning €1 930 net. My checking balance is €167 and my building-savings contract holds €80, yet I have not missed rent because I own my apartment outright. A 43-day delay on a €350 furniture loan in 2020 occurred during my separation; since then I have honored two running credits with your institution without lapse. I seek €2 353 to finish paying for a new Fiat Doblo that lets me visit my elderly parents in Poland every second month and still return for work Monday morning. The requested 21-month term with the smallest installment keeps payments under 6 % of income and allows me to support my 15-year-old daughter who lives with me. I carry no other debt and ask for your continued confidence.  
Yours faithfully, Andrzej Nowak  

Letter 5 – Luis Ortega, culinary chef  
Dear loan department,  
I have headed the hot kitchen of the Restaurant Rheinterrassen for 2 years and 9 months, hold a fixed contract, and take home €1 900 after tax. My checking account stands at €152 and my life-insurance savings at €95. In 2021 I was 40 days late repaying a €400 kitchen-device loan during the reopening chaos; your bank still approved two subsequent smaller credits which I have paid according to schedule. I apply for €2 353 to settle the balance on a new Renault Kangoo that enables me to purchase fresh produce directly from organic farms outside public-transport hours, cutting costs by roughly €250 per month. A 21-month repayment at the minimum rate equals about €115 monthly—well within my budget even after sending support to my son in Spain. I have no other installment plans, no co-borrowers, and I am committed to maintaining my clean record with you. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards, Luis Ortega
