Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Martina Lechner, 37, senior lab technician at BioMedica GmbH for the past six years. I need 609 DM to close the gap on a new 3 200 DM VW Polo that will let me reach the out-of-town lab where I was promoted to night-shift supervisor, raising my net salary by 230 DM a month. My divorce last year drained my checking account, but since January I have rebuilt a positive balance of 85 DM and paid every household bill on time. I have no other loans, own my apartment outright, and hold a paid-up life-insurance policy worth 4 800 DM that serves as silent security. The car is essential to keep the job that supports my ten-year-old son and me. I have never missed an installment to this bank on my two previous small credits; both will be cleared within three months. I respectfully ask for six months at 4 % to add this final 609 DM; my disposable income easily covers 110 DM monthly. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Martina Lechner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Karin Hofmann, 37, master pastry chef and single mother of one. Since 2019 I have run the night production line at “Süßes Glück” bakery, earning 1 950 DM net. My divorce left my checking account overdrawn, yet every salary since has reduced the negative balance; it now stands at –32 DM and shrinking. I apply for 609 DM to complete the purchase of a new small delivery van that will let me start Saturday farmers-market rounds, adding roughly 300 DM monthly profit. I have no other debts, own my terraced house, and have saved 75 DM in a building-society contract. Two prior credits with your bank were repaid ahead of schedule; both entries remain spotless. Six months at 4 % equals 110 DM, well within my budget. I pledge the same punctuality as before.  
With thanks,  
Karin Hofmann

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Susanne Berger, 37, certified court clerk at the regional court. After my separation I took over the mortgage on our row house, leaving my checking account temporarily negative; today it shows –48 DM and improves each payday. I request 609 DM to finish financing a new Opel Corsa required for my new duties serving rural court locations, a post that raised my salary by 180 DM. I have worked in public service since 2018, hold no other loans, and maintain a life-insurance policy with 5 000 DM surrender value. My two running credits with your branch have never been late; both will be settled this year. A six-month loan at 4 % costs 110 DM, 5 % of my disposable income. I value my reputation for reliability and will not jeopardize it now.  
Yours faithfully,  
Susanne Berger

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Claudia Richter, 37, senior radiation-safety officer at West Reactor Services, employed there since February 2019. My divorce forced me to buy out my ex-partner’s share of our home, pushing my checking account into the red; the balance is now –25 DM and climbing. I seek 609 DM to finalise the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia that will let me reach on-call emergencies within the 30-minute legal limit, securing my 220 DM monthly on-call bonus. I have no other debts, own the house, and possess a building-society savings contract with 90 DM already paid in. My two previous credits with your bank were always met on or before the due date. Six months at 4 % means 110 DM, less than what I will earn from the first on-call shift. I respectfully ask for your continued confidence.  
Sincerely,  
Claudia Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Petra Neumann, 37, head bookkeeper at Stahl & Co., where I have worked since May 2018. Following my separation I assumed full mortgage payments, leaving my checking account overdrawn; current balance –39 DM, improving monthly. I apply for 609 DM to cover the final installment on a new Renault Twingo needed for the 45 km commute to our new plant, a position that includes a 200 DM transport allowance. I have no other loans, live in my own home, and hold a paid-up life-insurance certificate worth 5 200 DM. My two existing credits with your institution have never been in arrears and will be retired this summer. A six-month loan at 4 % equals 110 DM, 4.8 % of net disposable income. I am determined to maintain my clean record.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Kind regards,  
Petra Neumann
