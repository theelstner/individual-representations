Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Amina Youssef, a 26-year-old Syrian laboratory assistant who has lived in Cologne for one year. I need 609 DM to buy a used centrifuge and glassware so I can begin a weekend business preparing and selling natural skin-care oils at the weekly Kölner Dom market. Since arriving nine months ago I have kept my salary-assignment checking account at 220 DM and repaid my first 300 DM micro-loan on time every month. I own the small studio apartment in Ehrenfeld where I live with my five-year-old daughter; it is debt-free and valued at 42,000 DM, which I offer as additional security. Unemployment benefit covers our basic needs, so the 4 DM monthly installment will be paid from the 70–90 DM net profit I already make selling test batches to neighbors. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no telephone—only the promise that every previous coin I have borrowed from this bank has been returned before the due date. Please allow me the chance to turn a kitchen hobby into a registered business that will get me off benefits within a year.  
Respectfully,  
Amina Youssef

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Laura Schmidt, 26, divorced mother of a seven-year-old boy and former warehouse packer. Three months ago my hours were cut to zero; I now receive 324 DM monthly unemployment while I retrain as a baker. I apply for 609 DM to purchase a second-hand professional dough-mixer (550 DM) and initial ingredients so I can supply 50 organic rolls every Friday to the Büdchen at the corner of Vogelsanger Weg, which has already given me a written preorder. My checking account has held 210 DM since my salary was assigned here last year, and my only prior 500 DM consumer loan was cleared four months early. I have lived in the same 42 m² owned flat in Nippes since January; the flat, worth 38,000 DM, is my only property and is unencumbered. The proposed 4 DM monthly installment equals one afternoon’s roll sales, well within the 80 DM net margin I project. No other bank debts, no co-signers, no phone—just a mother who wants to bake her way out of welfare and has never missed a payment in her life. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Laura Schmidt

Dear Team,  
My name is Oxana Petrenko, 26, Ukrainian, married but living alone while my husband secures residency papers. I have swept factory floors in Düsseldorf for eight months and saved every possible cent, yet my account holds only 95 DM. I request 609 DM to buy a commercial sewing machine and fabric to launch a small tailoring service repairing work uniforms for the very factory that lays me off during low season. My present checking balance is 250 DM because my wages are assigned directly to you; my first 400 DM loan taken when I arrived was repaid exactly on schedule. I own a one-room apartment in Rath (value 41,500 DM) where I have lived since February; housing costs are nil beyond utilities. The 4 DM monthly installment will be paid from the 100 DM net earnings I already earn hemming colleagues’ trousers. I carry no other credit, no guarantors, no telephone, and only one dependent—myself—until my husband arrives. Your bank has been my only financial home in Germany, and I ask for the chance to make my sideline into a full livelihood.  
With gratitude,  
Oxana Petrenko

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Samira Benali, 26, Moroccan, separated and raising my four-year-old daughter in a 36 m² owned flat in Mülheim. After arriving eleven months ago I worked night shifts cleaning offices until the contract ended; I now receive 340 DM unemployment benefit. I seek 609 DM to obtain a mobile phone, transport pass, and starter kits so I can register as a self-employed interpreter for Arabic and French at the local Rathaus, where demand exceeds supply. My checking account shows 230 DM maintained by salary assignment for the past year, and my sole 350 DM loan with you was repaid without a single reminder. The flat, worth 39,000 DM, is mine; no mortgage, no rent. The 4 DM installment represents 1 % of my monthly benefit and will be covered by the first two interpreting hours (25 DM/hour) I have already been offered. I have no other debts, no co-debtors, and no phone yet—hence the request. Your bank trusted me once; allow me to turn language into livelihood and repay once more.  
Respectfully,  
Samira Benali

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Elena Costa, 26, Brazilian, married but temporarily living alone in Dortmund while my husband finishes visa formalities in São Paulo. I have packed gift-boxes in a chocolate factory for ten months; since my contract was not renewed I draw 318 DM unemployment. I apply for 609 DM to buy a professional hair-straightener, mirrors, and products to offer home hair-care visits for Brazilian women in my church group, many of whom already book me informally. My checking account holds 205 DM via salary assignment since last July, and my only prior 450 DM loan from this bank was paid in full two months early. I own a 38 m² apartment in Hörde (market value 40,000 DM) where I have lived since March; no rent, no loans against it. The 4 DM monthly installment equals the tip from one customer and fits easily within the 90 DM net profit I expect each month. No other credits, no guarantors, no telephone—just a young woman who has never broken a promise to your institution and asks for the means to keep that record intact.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Elena Costa
