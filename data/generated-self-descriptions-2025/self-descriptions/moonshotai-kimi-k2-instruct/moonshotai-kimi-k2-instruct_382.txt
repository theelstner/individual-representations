Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jonas Müller, 39, a single father and senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2015. My daughter and I live in our own small row-house; the car outside is my only other possession. I need 2,212 € to buy an adjustable hospital bed for my elderly mother, who is moving in with us after her stroke. My salary of 2,050 € net reaches my overdrawn checking account on the 25th of each month; the minus balance never exceeds 300 € because I settle every bill immediately. My first bank loan—1,800 € for our roof—was paid off last December, all 36 installments on time. With no other debts and a stable job contract open-ended, I can comfortably handle the 110.60 € monthly payment over 20 months. Please approve the loan so my mother can recover in dignity.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Emre Yildirim, Turkish citizen, registered foreign worker in Stuttgart since 2017. I am 39, single, and work as a CNC machinist at Mahle GmbH. I earn 2,400 € net and have lived in my own apartment for four years. My checking account is 180 € overdrawn today, but my wages clear it every month. I have one previous loan with your bank—1,500 € for my car—paid back without a single delay. I now request 2,212 € to furnish my daughter’s room (she stays with me every weekend). I have no savings account, no other debts, and no guarantors. The proposed 110.60 € installment equals 4 % of my income, well within my budget. I have been employed continuously for six years and my contract runs until 2026. I ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Emre Yildirim

Dear Team,  
I am Luis Ortega, 39, single, and a forensic-scene photographer for the Berlin police since 2016. My gross salary is 3,100 €; after deductions I net 2,180 €. My current account shows –220 € today, yet every prior salary has brought it back to zero. I repaid a 2,000 € equipment loan from your bank last year without missing a date. I need 2,212 € to buy a professional camera workstation and lighting for my freelance assignments; this gear will raise my side income by roughly 300 € per month. I own my 45 m² apartment and a 2013 VW Golf; no other loans, no dependents except my dog. The 110.60 € monthly debit represents 5 % of my net income and will be covered even if freelance work stalls. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Klaus Weber, 39, a single fire-service paramedic in Hamburg since January 2016. My net pay is 2,300 €, deposited into an account presently 250 € in the red—cleared routinely each payday. I have one closed loan with you (1,200 € for safety gear) paid punctually till completion. I seek 2,212 € to buy a height-adjustable desk and ergonomic chair for my home office, required after my recent herniated-disc diagnosis. I have no savings account, no other debts, and no dependents. My 110.60 € monthly installment equals 4.8 % of income, comfortably below the 20 % limit. I have lived in my own flat for four years and own no property beyond my car. I would appreciate your approval so I can work pain-free and continue serving the city.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Weber

Dear Madam,  
My name is Petr Novak, Czech national, registered foreign worker in Munich. I am 39, single, and have worked as a master pastry chef at Café Luitpold since 2017. My monthly net income is 2,100 €; my checking account is overdrawn by 90 € today, settled monthly. I previously borrowed 1,600 € from your bank for my car, repaid on schedule every month. I now apply for 2,212 € to purchase professional-grade stainless-steel kitchen furniture for my home, allowing me to develop new recipes for the café and increase my bonus. I have no savings account, no other loans, and no co-obligants. The proposed 110.60 € installment is 5 % of my net salary. I have lived in my rented apartment for four years and own a 2015 Ford Focus. I kindly ask for approval so I can keep advancing in my craft.  
With thanks,  
Petr Novak
