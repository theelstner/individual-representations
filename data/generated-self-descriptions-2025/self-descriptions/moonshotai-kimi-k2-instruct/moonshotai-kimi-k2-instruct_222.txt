Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Nikolaos Papadopoulos, 26, a Greek warehouse porter at Stuttgarter Fruchthof. I rent a room above the market but my name is on the deed of our family house in Kalamata; my wife and baby remain there while I establish myself here. After twelve months of steady night-shift work I need a small television (625 DM) so I can follow German courses broadcast by SWR and still watch my daughter grow via the video-cassettes my wife mails me. My take-home pay is 1 180 DM monthly; I have paid the 50 DM installment on my first bank loan punctually for eight months and live on 320 DM after rent. Savings stand at 87 DM; my brother-in-law, a bus driver, guarantees this loan. I have never missed a payment here or in Greece. Kindly allow me the 625 DM; it will be repaid in twelve equal portions beginning next month.  
Respectfully,  
Nikolaos Papadopoulos

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Samir Haddad, Syrian resident in Böblingen. I assemble circuit boards at Mössner Electronic since last March and own the small apartment I share with my wife. We have no telephone yet, so I cycle to the branch each month to deposit 45 DM against my existing 1 000 DM loan—every deposit on time. I ask for 625 DM to buy a sturdy transistor radio; after work I attend language school and must listen to the repeat broadcasts while commuting. My wage is 1 220 DM; housing costs 280 DM, food 250 DM, leaving enough for the proposed 52 DM installment. My uncle, a naturalised German, co-signs. The radio will speed my integration and raise my income once I pass the B1 exam next spring. Please approve the credit; my payment record speaks for me.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samir Haddad

Esteemed Bank Team,  
I am José Mendoza, 26, Filipino orderly at Diakonie-Krankenhaus. My wife and I bought a modest row-house in Plochingen last year; we have no children yet but support her mother. My checking balance hovers around 150 DM and savings at 65 DM, yet I have never defaulted on the 600 DM furniture loan I took when I arrived. I request 625 DM for a colour television so my mother-in-law can follow Tagesschau and ease her loneliness while we work. My net wage is 1 240 DM, rent-free because we live in our own rooms; the new 52 DM monthly installment fits the 4 % rate comfortably. My landlord, who is also my guarantor, trusts my diligence. Grant me this small sum; I will continue to honour every pfennig.  
Sincerely,  
José Mendoza

Dear Sirs,  
I am Ahmed El-Sayed, Egyptian forklift driver at Logistik-Center Stuttgart. Though employed only ten months, I have already reduced my initial 800 DM loan to 320 DM, always before the due date. My wife remains in Alexandria until our paperwork is complete; I reside alone in a self-owned studio in Ostfildern. I need 625 DM for a portable television to improve my German and stay informed during late shifts. My payslip shows 1 210 DM; fixed costs total 550 DM, leaving margin for the 52 DM installment. My cousin, a German citizen, stands guarantor. Savings are thin (92 DM) but my payment discipline is solid. Please approve the second loan; I intend to clear both ahead of schedule.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

To the Credit Department,  
My name is Le Van Tuan, 26, Vietnamese machine cleaner at Metabowerke. I have lived in my own tiny terraced house in Nürtingen since last November together with my wife and infant son. My checking account currently holds 180 DM, savings 70 DM, yet I have serviced my 750 DM starter loan flawlessly for eleven months. I seek 625 DM to purchase a television so my wife can learn German while caring for our baby at home. My wage is 1 195 DM; the proposed 52 DM installment equals 4 % of disposable income after 260 DM housing costs. My brother, who has German citizenship, guarantees repayment. I have no telephone, so I visit the branch weekly to deposit tips; the staff know my face and my reliability. Kindly grant the loan; my family’s progress depends on it.  
Respectfully,  
Le Van Tuan
