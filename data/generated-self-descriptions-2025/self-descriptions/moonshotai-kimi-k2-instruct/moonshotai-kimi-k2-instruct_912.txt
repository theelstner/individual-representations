Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Elena Petrova, I am 34, a Ukrainian-trained biomedical lab technician now working since 2021 as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Delbrück-Center, Berlin.  
I need 4,454 € to replace the broken radio-television studio equipment I use to livestream public-health briefings for the Charité; without it my second evening job collapses and I lose 350 €/month.  
Net salary 2,180 € plus 350 € from streaming; my only dependent is my 8-year-old daughter.  
I have delayed one 250 € phone bill in 2022 after my divorce, but since then I have paid every rent, kindergarten and insurance on time; Schufa score improved from 82 to 94.  
I own the small 2-room apartment in Hellersdorf outright (inherited 2019), so housing cost is only 180 € maintenance; no other loans elsewhere, no co-debtor, no car, no phone contract.  
With 36-month term and 4 % installment rate the debit is 134 €/month—6 % of my income.  
I ask for the loan to secure the educational stream that supports my family and serves the community.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, 34, Syrian, married, mother of one, resident of Germany since 2019.  
I am a state-certified warehouse logistics specialist employed since November 2021 by the Berlin City Library central depot on a permanent contract.  
Purpose: 4,454 € for a television and audio system for the community Arabic-German storytelling evenings I host in the Neukölln neighborhood library; entrance is free, but the city grant covers only books, not hardware.  
My net wage is 1,940 €; housing is free because my husband and I own our 48 m² flat (bought with family aid 2020).  
In 2021 I paid a 190 € electricity bill three months late during my language-course transition; otherwise no further delinquencies, Schufa now 91.  
No other credits anywhere, no guarantor, savings 87 €.  
The requested 36-month loan carries 134 € monthly payment—7 % of income.  
The equipment will let me expand the program to 120 children monthly and keep my small stipend of 200 € that supports my 5-year-old son.  
I will honour the schedule as faithfully as I have honoured every rent and utility since 2021.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Lina Alves, Brazilian, 34, divorced, one daughter aged 6.  
I have worked since March 2021 as a CNC lathe operator at BMW’s Berlin plant.  
I apply for 4,454 € to purchase a professional camera and streaming computer to start a Portuguese-language tech-review channel already pre-approved for YouTube partner monetization.  
Net income 2,300 €; own my 1-bedroom apartment in Spandau since 2020 (gift from parents), so no rent.  
Only blemish: 90 € internet bill paid 60 days late in 2022 after my divorce; cleared since, Schufa 93.  
No other debts, no co-debtor, savings 65 €.  
Monthly installment 134 € equals 5.8 % of net salary.  
The channel projects 400 € monthly revenue within six months, securing my daughter’s kindergarten fees.  
I have never missed a housing or utility payment in four years; I will treat this loan with the same discipline.  
Kind regards,  
Lina Alves

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Aisha Khan, Pakistani, 34, separated, one son 9 years old, living in Germany since 2018.  
I am a qualified pharmacy technical assistant employed at Charité outpatient pharmacy since January 2021.  
I seek 4,454 € to buy radio and video gear for weekly multilingual health workshops I run for immigrant women; current borrowed equipment is no longer available.  
My net salary is 2,050 €; I own a 55 m² flat in Reinickendorf (mortgage-free, inherited 2020).  
In 2022 I repaid a 300 € clothing-store debt two months late; otherwise clean record, Schufa 92.  
No other credits, no guarantor, savings 92 €.  
Proposed 36-month loan installment 134 € represents 6.5 % of income.  
The workshops generate 250 € monthly donations that cover my son’s tutoring; losing the equipment would end this support.  
I have paid every utility and daycare bill on time for four consecutive years and will service this loan with identical punctuality.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Khan

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Oksana Melnyk, Ukrainian, 34, married, one daughter aged 7, resident of Germany since 2019.  
I am a state-certified veterinary technician working at the Berlin Zoo veterinary clinic since October 2021.  
I request 4,454 € to acquire a portable ultrasound with Doppler for wildlife education broadcasts I produce for Ukrainian and German schools.  
Net wage 2,120 €; my husband and I own our 60 m² apartment in Pankow (purchased with family support 2020), so housing cost is 200 € monthly maintenance.  
In 2021 I settled a 220 € mobile-phone arrears 45 days late after relocation; no further issues, current Schufa 94.  
No other loans, no co-debtor, savings 78 €.  
Loan installment 134 € equals 6.3 % of income.  
The broadcasts earn 300 € monthly that funds my daughter’s music school; equipment failure would cancel the project.  
I have kept every rent, insurance and daycare payment current since 2020 and will treat this obligation with the same reliability.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Oksana Melnyk
