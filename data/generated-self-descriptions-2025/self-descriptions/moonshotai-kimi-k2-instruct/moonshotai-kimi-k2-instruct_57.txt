1. Letter from Carlos Mendoza, Warehouse Picker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 26, single, and have lived in my own small house for two years. Since 2021 I have worked as a warehouse picker for FreshFoods GmbH on a permanent contract; my net pay is €1,450 every month. My only bank product is the car loan I finished last December—every installment was paid on time, which is why your colleague Mr. Weber agreed to act as guarantor for this new request. I need €783 to buy a new 50-cc scooter so I can reach the night shift that starts in August; public transport stops at 23:00 and the scooter will let me keep the €200 monthly shift bonus. My fixed costs are €550 (mortgage, utilities, two toddlers’ daycare). After subtracting €55 for the requested loan, €200 remains for food and clothing—tight but manageable. I have no checking account yet, so I ask that the repayment be collected in cash at your branch on the 1st of each month. My property is debt-free and I have never missed a payment in my life. Please approve the €783; it will secure my job and feed my family.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza  

2. Letter from Amir Hassan, Hospital Porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Syria in 2019 and have been employed as a hospital porter at St. Hedwig’s since 2022 (€1,300 net). I live in my late parents’ house which I inherited; the land register shows me as sole owner. Your bank granted me a €600 TV loan in 2023; it was repaid early and in full. Now I need €783 to purchase a new Dacia Sandero base model so I can accept the permanent driver position the hospital offered me (extra €250/month). My guarantor is my cousin Rami, a ten-year customer of yours. My monthly budget leaves €70 free after rent, utilities, support for my two younger brothers and the €55 installment you require. I have no other debts except a small furniture-store plan that ends in October. I have no telephone, but I can be reached daily at the ward office. Grant me this loan and I will keep the same punctual record as before.  
Sincerely,  
Amir Hassan  

3. Letter from Piotr Nowak, Construction Laborer  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am 26, single, and have owned a one-bedroom apartment since 2022. I have worked on the books for BudPol Construction for 30 months, earning €1,550 net. Your bank financed my fridge in 2022; every installment was met on the due date. I now request €783 to add a small electric car (Dacia Spring) to the tools I keep in my garage; it will let me follow the company’s mobile repair teams and secure the €300 quarterly productivity bonus. My guarantor is my foreman, Mr. Kowalski, whose salary account is with you. After housing costs, groceries and the €55 loan installment I still have €95 cushion. I have no savings account yet, but I have never been overdrawn and hold no credit cards. Please approve the loan so I can keep progressing from unskilled laborer to certified technician next year.  
Best regards,  
Piotr Nowak  

4. Letter from Rajiv Singh, Supermarket Shelf-Stacker  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am 26, single father of twins, and have lived in my own two-room flat since early 2022. I have stacked shelves for Aldi since November 2021, earning €1,400 net. In 2023 you financed my washing machine; the debit order never bounced. I now seek €783 to buy a new Kia Picanto so I can move to the regional distribution center 20 km away where the night-shift premium adds €280 to my pay. My uncle, Mr. Arjan Singh, a pensioner and your customer for 12 years, stands as guarantor. My budget shows €60 left after the proposed €55 installment, rent, utilities and the small store plan that finishes in September. I do not yet have a checking account but I am willing to open one if required. I have never missed a payment and my property is unencumbered. I ask for your trust once more.  
Yours faithfully,  
Rajiv Singh  

5. Letter from Nguyen Van An, Cleaner at Technical University  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am 26, single, and have owned my 38-m² apartment outright since 2022. I have worked as a cleaner at the Technical University since March 2022 (€1,320 net). Your records show that my previous €500 laptop loan was repaid exactly on schedule. I apply for €783 to purchase a new Fiat Panda so I can accept the 4:30 a.m. shift that carries a €220 monthly bonus. My guarantor is Ms. Gabi Huber, head of the cleaning department and your customer since 2009. After deducting the €55 installment, housing costs and support for my two dependent siblings, €75 remains each month. I have no telephone, but the university HR office forwards messages within the hour. I have no savings account yet, but I have never defaulted and my home is lien-free. Please approve this small loan so I can keep supporting my family and saving for night-school tuition.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Nguyen Van An
