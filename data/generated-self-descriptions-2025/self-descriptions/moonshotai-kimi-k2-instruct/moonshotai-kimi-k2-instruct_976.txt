Letter 1 – From Ms. Elena Berger, Veterinary Lab Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 2,831 € to replace the broken television and radio that my eight-year-old daughter and I use daily for her school homework and my evening language courses. After my divorce 30 months ago I closed our joint checking account; since then I have paid all bills in cash and my wage is deposited into my savings book which currently holds 87 €. I have worked as a certified veterinary-lab technician for the past 2 years and 9 months and take home 1,420 € net each month. The proposed 4 % installment rate equals 113 € monthly—less than 8 % of my income—so I can easily cover it while maintaining 450 € for rent and food. My only other credit is a 3,000 € car loan with Credit-Plus that I have paid flawlessly for 18 months; the vehicle itself serves as my only property. I have lived in my owned apartment for 2 years and have no other dependents or guarantors. At 33, steady employment, a telephone landline and a clean payment record make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for approving this small loan so my daughter and I can keep learning.  
Sincerely,  
Elena Berger  

Letter 2 – From Ms. Fatima Al-Hassan, Radiology Department Clerk  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 33-year-old divorced mother of a five-year-old boy and I need 2,831 € to purchase a television for his educational programs and a radio to stay informed during my night shifts at St. Hedwig Hospital. I have no checking account since separating from my ex-husband 30 months ago, yet my salary of 1,550 € net is deposited into my savings account whose balance is 92 € today. I have been employed as a radiology-department clerk for 3 years and 4 months, and the requested 4 % installment (113 €) fits easily within my 450 € monthly surplus. My only existing credit is a 4,100 € auto loan that I have serviced without delay; the car is my only property. I have lived in my own flat for 2 years, have no other debts, and am registered as a foreign worker with permanent residency. Granting this loan will help me provide a stable home for my son while I continue to meet every financial obligation on time.  
Respectfully,  
Fatima Al-Hassan  

Letter 3 – From Ms. Martina Lehmann, Senior Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am writing to secure 2,831 € for a new television and radio set that will allow my disabled mother and me to follow therapeutic exercise programs at home. My checking account was closed 30 months ago after my separation, so I operate solely with cash and a savings book that presently shows 76 €. Nevertheless, my employment as a senior pharmacy technician at City Apotheke has been continuous for 2 years and 11 months, yielding 1,480 € net per month. The proposed monthly payment of 113 € (4 % rate) represents 7.6 % of my income, leaving ample room for living costs. I have one existing car credit of 3,500 € that I have paid punctually; the vehicle is my only property. I own my apartment, have lived there 2 years, and have no other installment plans or guarantors. At 33, with a landline telephone and a proven payment history, I am a dependable candidate for this modest loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Martina Lehmann  

Letter 4 – From Ms. Sofia Alves, City Library Systems Administrator  
Dear Lending Team,  
As a 33-year-old married systems administrator at Cologne City Library, I am seeking 2,831 € to replace our broken television and radio so my husband and I can continue the evening Portuguese lessons we share. My checking account was cancelled 30 months ago when we consolidated finances after marriage; my salary goes to a savings account that now holds 93 €. I have held my current position for 2 years and 6 months with a net income of 1,460 € monthly. The 113 € installment (4 % rate) is well within our 500 € monthly surplus. My only existing credit is a 3,200 € car loan that has never been late; the car is my sole property. We have owned our apartment for 2 years, have no other debts, and I am listed as a foreign worker with an unlimited residence permit. With stable employment, a telephone, and a clean credit record, I will repay this loan promptly.  
Kind regards,  
Sofia Alves  

Letter 5 – From Ms. Lena Nowak, Quality-Control Chemist  
Dear Loan Manager,  
I am a 33-year-old divorced quality-control chemist at RhineChem GmbH and I need 2,831 € to buy a television and radio so my seven-year-old daughter can access her school’s digital lessons while I work late shifts. I have operated without a checking account for 30 months since the divorce, using cash and a savings account whose balance is 81 €. My employment, which began 3 years and 1 month ago, provides 1,510 € net per month; the 113 € payment (4 % rate) consumes only 7.5 % of my income. My only current obligation is a 3,800 € auto credit that I have serviced without fail; the car is my only property. I have lived in my owned flat for 2 years, have no other installment plans, and am registered as a foreign worker with permanent status. A landline telephone and consistent repayment history attest to my reliability. I respectfully ask for approval so my daughter’s education is not interrupted.  
Sincerely,  
Lena Nowak
