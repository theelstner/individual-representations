Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Nikola Petrov, a Bulgarian warehouse porter who has unloaded trucks at RheinLogistik GmbH for the past eight years. I rent a small row-house in Kalk and finally want to stop handing money to landlords, so I am buying a used 1750 DM colour television set for my two school-age sons instead of paying monthly cinema tickets. All 6 previous months I have paid my 50 DM building-society policy on time; my only other debt is the 35 DM monthly bank loan for my refrigerator, which I have never missed. With 750 DM in my savings book and a net wage of 950 DM, the requested 2 % instalment (35 DM) leaves me 865 DM for living costs—ample for a single father. I have no cheque account, no telephone and no guarantor because I believe in paying cash and keeping promises. Please approve the 1750 DM; my record at your bank shows I always close what I open.  
Respectfully,  
Nikola Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 45, Spanish machine-line cleaner at Bayer AG since 2012. My daughter’s 15th birthday is in July and I promised her a proper television so she can follow the science documentaries she loves. I ask for 1750 DM which I will repay in 24 months at 2 % (36 DM). My pay-slip is 1020 DM net; after 300 DM mortgage on my own flat and the 35 DM fridge loan, 685 DM remain for food and utilities. My savings book holds 800 DM, I own a life-insurance policy worth 4000 DM, and your bank’s ledger shows every previous cent returned. I have no cheque account, no phone, no other dependents except my two children, and no co-signer—only my word, which has been good for eight years. Grant me this small help and I will honour it exactly as before.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Farouk El-Amin, Egyptian night porter at Hotel Excelsior, employed since 2013. After six months of saving I have 900 DM and need 1750 DM more to replace our broken television so my two daughters can continue their Arabic lessons via satellite programmes. I live in my own one-bedroom flat in Mühlheim, bought through a building-society contract; the instalment rate of 2 % equals 34 DM, less than what I now spend monthly on bus tickets to the public library where the girls currently watch educational videos. My net income is 930 DM; the only other credit is 35 DM for my washing machine, always paid punctually. I carry no cheque book, no mobile, no guarantor—just eight years of steady employment and a clean file at your branch. Kindly approve the loan so my family can learn at home.  
Thank you,  
Farouk El-Amin

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Dmitri Volkov, 45, Russian unskilled worker packing pastries at Bäckerei Schmidt for the past seven years. I need 1750 DM to purchase a television for my elderly mother who recently moved in with me; she is partially sighted and the large screen will allow her to watch her native news, reducing her loneliness. I have saved 850 DM and own a life-insurance policy with 5000 DM surrender value. My take-home pay is 960 DM; after 300 DM housing costs and 35 DM for my existing bank loan I still have 625 DM, so the new 35 DM instalment is comfortable. My credit history with you is flawless, I possess no cheque account, no telephone, and no other dependents besides my two sons. Please help me make my mother’s life brighter—she raised me to repay debts, and so I always have.  
Best regards,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Madam,  
My name is Hassan Belkacem, 45, Moroccan assembly-line resident at Ford Cologne since 2011. I apply for 1750 DM to buy a television set so my two teenage boys can follow German language courses broadcast in the evenings, improving their chances of securing apprenticeships. I have accumulated 950 DM in my savings passbook and hold a building-society contract worth 6000 DM. My net wage is 980 DM; the 2 % instalment of 35 DM fits easily within my budget after deducting 300 DM for housing and 35 DM for my current bank loan, which has never been late. I maintain no cheque account, no phone, no co-debtor—only a steady job, a clean repayment record at your institution, and the determination that my children integrate successfully. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Hassan Belkacem
