Letter 1 – Lukas Müller, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 3,349 DM to buy a height-adjustable lab table and an ultrasonic cleaner so I can start my own mobile equipment-maintenance service for small clinics. After eight years as a scientific research assistant at Westklinikum I have just been promoted to head technician; my new salary (2,900 DM net) starts next month. My checking account is overdrawn 200 DM because I paid for my mother’s dental surgery, but my savings book holds 750 DM and every previous loan (1,800 DM for my car, finished last year) was paid on the dot. I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s flat, have no other debts, and my twins’ daycare voucher covers 80 % of the cost. The requested 4 % installment (134 DM monthly) equals one child-benefit payment, so repayment is safe. I have attached my open-ended contract and the clinic’s written promise to hire my service for 12 cleanings per year, guaranteeing extra income. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller  

Letter 2 – Daniel Fischer, Railway Signalman  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 3,349 DM to replace the broken heating system in the house my family has lived in for four generations. I started at Deutsche Bahn eleven months ago after completing my apprenticeship; my probation ended last week and my salary is now 2,600 DM net. Although my current account shows –150 DM after moving costs, I have accumulated 900 DM in the bank’s savings plan and have never missed a payment on my 1,200 DM computer loan (finished 2020). The house is debt-free; I pay only utilities. At 134 DM per month the loan installment is 5 % of my income, well within the budget. My partner and our two children receive housing and child benefits that more than cover the payment. Please find my permanent contract and the heating company’s binding quote attached. I stand ready to repay reliably as I have always done.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Fischer  

Letter 3 – Jonas Weber, Court Clerk  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 3,349 DM to furnish my first own apartment after separating from my former partner. I have served as a junior court clerk at the District Court for ten months and was just informed my position will become permanent in January, raising my salary to 3,100 DM. My account is 180 DM overdrawn because I paid the security deposit, but my savings balance is 650 DM and my only previous loan (1,500 DM for professional clothing) was repaid early without a single reminder. I live rent-free in a relative’s vacant flat, have no dependents apart from my dog, and no other liabilities. The monthly installment of 134 DM represents 4.3 % of my future salary and will be covered by the 150 DM I already set aside each month. I enclose the court’s confirmation of my upcoming permanent appointment and the furniture store’s invoice. Thank you for considering my request.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Weber  

Letter 4 – Tim Becker, IT Support Specialist  
Dear Team,  
I am writing to obtain 3,349 DM to buy professional tools—two high-end laptops and a server rack—so I can launch my freelance hardware-support side business. Employed as an IT support specialist at Stadtwerke München for eleven months, I earn 2,750 DM net and receive an additional 300 DM monthly on-call bonus. My checking account shows –120 DM after vacation expenses, yet my savings book holds 800 DM and my only prior loan (1,600 DM for training) was honored to the day. I live for free in my parents’ multi-family house, have no rent or mortgage, and support no one but myself. The 134 DM installment equals the amount I currently save automatically, so cash-flow risk is zero. I have attached my employer’s permission for freelance activity and three signed service contracts totaling 4,200 DM revenue for the next year, ensuring comfortable repayment. I appreciate your support in helping me grow responsibly.  
Best regards,  
Tim Becker  

Letter 5 – Felix Hoffmann, Pharmaceutical Sales Representative  
Dear Loan Department,  
I request 3,349 DM to purchase a reliable used car after my previous one was totaled; without it I cannot visit doctors and pharmacies for my work. I joined Bayer Pharma as a sales representative nine months ago, passed my evaluation last week, and now earn 2,850 DM fixed plus 400 DM average commission. My account is 190 DM negative because I paid the insurance deductible, but my savings balance is 700 DM and my earlier 1,400 DM holiday loan was repaid twelve months early. I reside without rent in my sister’s vacant condominium, have no other debts, and am single with no children. The monthly 134 DM installment is 4.1 % of my minimum income and will be debited directly. Enclosed are my permanent contract, commission statements for the last three months, and the dealer’s vehicle offer. I have always honored my obligations to this bank and will continue to do so.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Felix Hoffmann
