Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Adler, 35, single father of a 7-year-old boy. I have worked as a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for the past 6 years and 3 months, earning €2 180 net. I need €2 346 to replace my 18-year-old Polo that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the institute’s out-town lab and my contract risks non-renewal. Although a past illness left me with two small, still-serviced credits elsewhere, my salary has covered rent, food and those payments without a single missed date since 2022. I have no other debts, no guarantor and I live in my own small row-house in Leipzig (paid off). The requested instalment of €98 over 24 months equals 4 % of my income, well below the 20 % my employer’s certificate shows as disposable. Kindly approve the loan; my sole aim is reliable transport to keep the job that supports my son.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Vogt, 35, certified wind-turbine service technician employed by Enercon since May 2018. My take-home pay is €2 050 and I have lived in my self-renovated cottage in Cuxhaven for the last 3 years. I apply for €2 346 to buy a 2015 Skoda Octavia (78 000 km) needed to reach offshore sites; car-sharing is no longer possible after my colleague left. Two older credits—€1 100 for a training laptop and €890 for dental work—are being settled on schedule; the bank statements enclosed prove zero arrears. I own no cheque account, but my Sparkasse savings book shows €95 and my wage is deposited there monthly. The loan would absorb €98, exactly 4 % of my net income, leaving €650 free after all living costs. No other liabilities or dependants exist. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep the job that has given me six years of steady employment and will soon allow me to save again.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Vogt

Dear Team,  
My name is Marco Rizzi, 35, single, father of little Giada. I have served as a municipal police officer in Bochum since 1 September 2017 (6 years 9 months). My net salary is €2 200 and I live in my own 42 m² apartment. I request €2 346 to replace my burnt-out 2005 Ford; a reliable car is mandatory for emergency call-outs. I hold no cheque account, only a savings book with €60, and have two small running credits (total €1 350) that I have honoured without delay. The new instalment of €98 represents 4 % of my income; the enclosed budget shows €710 disposable after all expenses. There are no other debtors, no instalment plans, and my employment is permanent. I respectfully ask you to help me safeguard the livelihood of my daughter and myself.  
Sincerely,  
Marco Rizzi

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Klaus Weber, 35, master pastry chef at “Bäckerei Müller” in Regensburg since 3 February 2019 (5 years 4 months). My monthly net is €2 100 and I live in my own small terraced house. I need €2 346 to purchase a 2014 VW Caddy (95 000 km) that will let me start weekend delivery of custom cakes—an extra income my employer supports. I have no cheque account, only €85 in savings, and two minor existing credits (€1 200 total) that have never been overdue. The proposed instalment of €98 equals 4 % of my income, leaving €680 free for living costs. No other debts, no guarantors, one dependent son. I kindly request approval so my skill can generate the additional revenue that will repay this loan early.  
With thanks,  
Klaus Weber

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Daniel Huber, 35, single dad to 5-year-old Emma and a skilled CNC machinist at Bosch Rexroth since 1 August 2018 (5 years 10 months). My net wage is €2 150 and I reside in my own modest home in Kassel. I seek €2 346 to buy a 2013 Golf VI (88 000 km) so I can accept the late-shift premium at the plant 25 km away; public transport ends before shift-end. I possess no cheque account, hold €70 in savings, and service two small prior credits (€1 300 combined) without any arrears. The loan instalment of €98 represents 4 % of my income; my budget shows €695 surplus after all obligations. No other debts, no co-signers. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can continue providing for my daughter while advancing at work.  
Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Huber
