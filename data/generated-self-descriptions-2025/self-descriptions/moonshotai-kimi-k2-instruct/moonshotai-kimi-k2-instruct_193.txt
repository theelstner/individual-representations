Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Zielinski, 34, a Polish chemical-plant resident worker in Leverkusen. After five years cleaning reactors I have the chance to buy the firm’s small subcontracting van-service for 3,844 DM. My wage slips show 1,450 DM net monthly; my only costs are 200 DM food and 150 DM tram ticket, because I live free in the plant hostel. I have saved 400 DM and my checking balance is 190 DM. I have never missed a payment—my last 48-month phone-installment ended last year with zero arrears. I ask for 3,844 DM over 48 months at 4% installment rate; 96 DM per month will be paid from the extra 300 DM the new contract brings me. No other debts, no dependents except my retired parents who stay in Poland. I can be reached through the plant secretary. Please help me own the business I already run with my hands.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Zielinski

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Samir Haddad, Syrian machinist, 34, single, working in Düsseldorf since 2016. My present account holds 180 DM and my savings book 420 DM. The 3,844 DM loan will complete the purchase of a used CNC lathe that lets me moonlight as a precision-parts supplier. My employment contract pays 1,550 DM net and is valid until 2025; the workshop owner allows me to house the machine free of charge in exchange for maintenance work. I have lived at the same address for four years and never taken credit before. The monthly debit of 96 DM fits easily inside the 400 DM I can spare. No guarantors, no other obligations, just the wish to grow from employee to entrepreneur. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Samir Haddad

Dear Team,  
My name is Dragos Iliescu, 34, Romanian forklift driver in a Hamburg warehouse. I need 3,844 DM to buy a second-hand refrigerated trailer so I can start weekend market runs for local farmers. My paycheck is 1,400 DM; I live free in my brother’s flat and my monthly expenses are 250 DM. I have 350 DM on savings and 170 DM in checking. I have been with the same employer for six years and never owed anyone a cent. The proposed 96 DM monthly payment equals what I now spend on beer and cinema—money I am ready to invest instead. Two kids in Romania depend on my success; I will not let them down, nor the bank.  
With respect,  
Dragos Iliescu

Dear Loan Department,  
Ivan Petrov here, 34, Bulgarian assembly-line technician in Stuttgart. My account shows 195 DM, my savings 480 DM, and I request 3,844 DM to register a small painting-service business already contracted for three cellar renovations. My wage is 1,520 DM net; I have worked in the same factory since 2017 and will continue evenings. Rent is zero because I care for the owner’s garden cottage. I have never had a loan, so this first 48-month credit at 4% will be my proof of reliability. 96 DM monthly is less than the 120 DM I currently send home as support. No other debts, no co-signers, just steady discipline.  
Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Madam,  
I write as Luis Ortega, 34, Spanish unskilled worker in a Frankfurt meat-packing plant. My checking balance is 160 DM, my savings 450 DM. I seek 3,844 DM to buy a professional knife-sharpening machine; butchers already queue at my bench every Friday. My net income is 1,430 DM, seniority six years, and housing is free in the company dorm. I have never missed rent or bills, have no previous loans, and the 96 DM monthly installment equals what I now lose to overtime taxis. My daughter and nephew in Valencia count on my remittances; the new income will secure them and repay the bank on time.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luis Ortega
