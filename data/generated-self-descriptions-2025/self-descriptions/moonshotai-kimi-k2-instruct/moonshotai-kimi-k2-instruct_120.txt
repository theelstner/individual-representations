Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 23-year-old Bulgarian lab technician at BioLab Sofia, employed for 2 years and 8 months. I need 4,281 DM to buy a safety-certified microscope and computer for my home-based cytology slides, so I can earn extra income analyzing samples for two rural clinics. My checking account shows –120 DM because I just paid school fees for my six-year-old daughter, but I have 750 DM in a savings bond and own my small Opel without debt. I have never missed rent since moving into my one-bedroom house four years ago, and my only other obligations are two small credits at your bank that I have serviced on time. With a net salary of 1,950 DM and an installment rate of 1, the proposed 130-DM monthly payment equals 6.7 % of income—well within safe limits. Please approve the loan; my daughter’s future and my professional growth depend on reliable equipment.  
Respectfully, Ana Petrova

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Leyla Yilmaz, Turkish, 23, divorced, and mother of a four-year-old boy. For the past 3 years I have worked as a certified payroll clerk at Stuttgart’s Stadtwerke. My checking balance is –80 DM after buying winter tires, yet I hold 900 DM in a savings account and own my 2010 VW Polo outright. I apply for 4,281 DM to furnish my son’s room with a sturdy bunk bed, desk, and wardrobe so he no longer sleeps on a mattress on the floor. My two existing credits with your institution are paid flawlessly via automatic transfer; my Schufa report shows zero delinquencies. The new loan would add 130 DM monthly, only 7 % of my 1,860 DM net wage. I have lived in the same terraced house for four years and can be reached through my workplace if the telephone is required. Grant me this chance to give my child dignity and I will repay with the same discipline I have shown since my first day in Germany.  
Sincerely, Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Elena Costa, Portuguese, 23, married but living separated from my husband. I have spent the last 2 years and 2 months as a senior pastry specialist at Café Krönlein in Munich. My current account is overdrawn by 95 DM after paying medical bills for my mother, but I have accumulated 800 DM in fixed-rate savings and possess a fully-paid 2009 Renault Twingo. I seek 4,281 DM to purchase professional-grade mixers and a refrigerated display case so I can start weekend cake sales from home, augmenting my 1,780 DM salary. The requested installment of 130 DM represents 7.3 % of income; my budget spreadsheet shows 350 DM free cash monthly. I have never relocated since renting my small row house four years ago, and my two prior loans with your bank carry perfect repayment records. No other debts or guarantors encumber me. I respectfully ask for approval so I can build a secure future for my five-year-old daughter and myself.  
Kind regards, Elena Costa

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, Syrian, 23, female, divorced, and raising my seven-year-old daughter alone. I have worked as a bilingual medical receptionist at Praxis am Ring for exactly 3 years. My checking account stands at –60 DM after covering kindergarten fees, yet I have 950 DM in a savings certificate and own my 2011 Ford Fiesta. I request 4,281 DM to buy an ergonomic desk, an adjustable chair, and a laser printer so I can start evening translation services, boosting my 1,820 DM income. The 130-DM monthly payment equals 7.1 % of net salary; my budget leaves 320 DM surplus. I have resided in the same owned apartment for four years and have maintained two previous credits at your bank without a single late day. No other installment plans or co-signers exist. I am determined to remain self-reliant and provide my child stability; please approve this modest loan.  
Respectfully yours, Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Daria Novak, Ukrainian, 23, married but currently separated from my husband. Since 1 year and 10 months I have served as a quality-control inspector at EuroTech Plastics, Hamburg. My checking balance is –40 DM after transferring rent, but I possess 600 DM in a savings bond and a debt-free 2012 Skoda Fabia. I apply for 4,281 DM to buy a professional sewing machine and overlocker so I can launch a small tailoring business from my spare room, supplementing my 1,800 DM wage. The proposed 130-DM installment consumes 7.2 % of income, leaving 300 DM discretionary after all household costs. I have lived in the same owned duplex for four years and have honored every payment on two existing credits with your bank. I carry no other debts and have no guarantors. Grant me this opportunity to secure independence and I will repay faithfully as I have done from day one.  
Sincerely, Daria Novak
