Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Ingrid Bauer, 47, a divorced laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2013. My daughter Lena, 16, and I live rent-free in my mother’s flat; my salary of 2 100 DM lands in my 320 DM checking account every month. I have repaid a 1 000 DM car loan here without a single late entry, and my savings book now holds 420 DM. I need 1 377 DM to replace our broken television so Lena can keep up with her school’s digital lessons. The 57 DM monthly installment fits easily within my budget; no other debts or guarantors exist. Please approve the 24-month loan—my 8-year spotless record with your bank shows I honor every obligation.  
Respectfully, Ingrid Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Fatima Yilmaz, 47, married, and I have worked as a certified pharmacy assistant at Adler Apotheke Cologne since 2015. My husband and I live rent-free in his mother’s home; my wage of 2 300 DM is deposited into my 450 DM checking account. After repaying a 1 500 DM previous loan from your bank ahead of schedule, my savings now stand at 380 DM. I wish to borrow 1 377 DM for a new kitchen radio-television that will also serve my elderly mother-in-law during her recovery. The proposed 57 DM monthly payment is 2.5 % of my net income and leaves ample room for living costs. No other debts, dependents, or guarantors are present. Grant me the 24-month loan and I will continue to pay as reliably as I have for the past nine years.  
Sincerely, Fatima Yilmaz

Dear Team,  
I am Petra Hoffmann, 47, separated, and senior dental assistant at Praxis Hoffmann in Munich since 2012. My 2 400 DM salary is transferred to my 500 DM checking account; I have never missed a payment on my existing 1 200 DM equipment loan, now reduced to zero. My savings balance is 490 DM. My 12-year-old son Lukas and I occupy a granny-flat rent-free; I need 1 377 DM to buy a television for his educational documentaries and my rare free-time relaxation. The 57 DM monthly installment equals 2.4 % of my income and is easily covered. No other liabilities, co-signers, or dependents beyond Lukas. I ask for approval of the 24-month loan to maintain the trust your bank has placed in me for seven consecutive years.  
Best regards, Petra Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Gisela Krause, 47, divorced, and master tailor at Moden Krause Dresden since 2011. My 2 050 DM wage arrives monthly in my 350 DM checking account. I have just finished repaying a 900 DM sewing-machine loan from your bank with zero arrears, and my savings account currently shows 250 DM. My daughter Anna, 15, and I live in my parents’ house without rent; we seek 1 377 DM for a television to replace our decade-old set that finally failed. The 57 DM installment represents 2.8 % of my net income and is my only planned obligation. No other debts, guarantors, or dependents. Kindly approve the 24-month loan and allow me to demonstrate once more the reliability I have shown for the past ten years.  
Yours faithfully, Gisela Krause

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Elif Demir, 47, married, Turkish citizen with unlimited residence, and I have been a quality-control officer at RheinBrot AG since 2010. My 2 200 DM salary is credited to my 400 DM checking account; I have serviced my 1 100 DM previous loan punctually and hold 350 DM in savings. My husband and I reside rent-free in his late aunt’s apartment; I require 1 377 DM for a television that doubles as a monitor for my husband’s language courses. The monthly 57 DM payment equals 2.6 % of my income and is comfortably affordable. No other installment plans, dependents, or guarantors. I respectfully request approval of the 24-month loan to continue my perfect 11-year payment history with your bank.  
Respectfully yours, Elif Demir
