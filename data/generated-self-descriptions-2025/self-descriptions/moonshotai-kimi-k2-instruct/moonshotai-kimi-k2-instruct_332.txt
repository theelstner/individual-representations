Letter 1 – Dr. Ernst Adler, retired research director  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 75, live rent-free in the institute’s guest-flat, and need 6 615 DM to replace my 1987 VW which died last week. My pension is 2 450 DM net; the only outgoing is 400 DM support for my adult disabled son. I have no property, but I also have no rent, no instalments, and no other debts except two small credits (total 1 180 DM) taken years ago at your bank which I have never missed. My current account is overdrawn 90 DM because the engine-repair bill cleared yesterday; the balance will be positive again when my pension arrives on the 1st. The requested 24-month loan costs 276 DM monthly—11 % of income—well below the 20 % limit. Forty years of continuous employment, the last 18 as scientific director of the Max-Planck spin-off I founded, speak for reliability. I enclose my pension statement and the purchase contract for the 1996 Opel Astra (6 200 DM) I wish to buy so I can drive to university archives for the textbook I am completing. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Ernst Adler  

Letter 2 – Klaus Zimmermann, freelance software architect  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Klaus Zimmermann, 75, single, and I am asking for 6 615 DM to buy a dependable used car (1995 Renault) so I can reach clients on-site again. After my wife’s death I closed our joint account; the new one shows –60 DM today because a client paid into the old IBAN last week—the money is being re-routed and will cover the red figure within days. I have worked self-employed for 31 years, designing control software for medical devices; last year’s profit was 38 000 DM even though I only accepted projects I could reach by public transport. A 24-month loan at 276 DM monthly equals 9 % of my average net income. Savings are 87 DM—enough for liquidity, not for a car. I already service two older credits at your bank (total 1 050 DM) and have never been late. I have no property, live gratis in my late mother’s apartment, and have no other dependents except my cat. The vehicle will allow me to sign the 18 000 DM contract waiting on my desk and to keep working until I finally retire at 80. I would appreciate your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Zimmermann  

Letter 3 – Prof. Günter Haas, management consultant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
At 75 I still advise midsize companies on restructuring; my next assignment starts in Bavaria and requires a car. I therefore request 6 615 DM to purchase a 1994 Mercedes 200 with 98 000 km. My checking account presently shows –78 DM because honorarium invoices will be paid on the 30th; savings are 55 DM. My last tax return showed 42 700 DM net; the instalment of 276 DM over 24 months is 7 % of income. I have repaid two previous credits at your bank punctually and have no other liabilities. I am single, live rent-free in the company guesthouse, and have one dependent (a nephew in university whom I support with 300 DM monthly). Despite my age I am in excellent health and carry professional-liability insurance of 5 million DM, proof attached. I would value a quick decision so I can collect the car before the assignment begins.  
Yours faithfully,  
Prof. Günter Haas  

Letter 4 – Ludwig Bayer, self-employed master instrument-maker  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am Ludwig Bayer, 75, master of the guild for precision instruments. My workshop is profitable, but public transport no longer reaches the industrial park where my largest client moved; I therefore apply for 6 615 DM to buy a 1996 Ford Escort estate I have located. My account is overdrawn 45 DM today; savings are 92 DM. Revenue last year: 44 300 DM; the loan instalment (276 DM) is 8 % of net. I have serviced two existing credits with you (1 040 DM remaining) without ever missing a date. I live without rent in the flat above the workshop, have no property, and support only my grandson (age 10) for whose school commute the car will also be used. I enclose my trade licence, last tax assessment, and the dealer’s invoice. I would be grateful for approval within the week so production schedules are not delayed.  
With thanks,  
Ludwig Bayer  

Letter 5 – Dr. Markus Lange, retired army officer & defence analyst  
Dear Sirs,  
I write to obtain 6 615 DM for the purchase of a 1995 VW Golf necessary to reach archives for the book I am contracted to deliver to the defence ministry. I am 75, divorced, live rent-free in the officers’ retirement hostel, and have one dependent daughter (university student). My pension plus analytical fees yield 2 600 DM monthly; the requested 24-month credit costs 276 DM—10.6 % of income. My current account is –82 DM due to a delayed fee transfer arriving tomorrow; savings stand at 70 DM. I have two small running credits at your bank (1 200 DM) which have always been paid on schedule. I possess no real estate and have no other instalment obligations. My last security clearance and pension statements are enclosed. I would appreciate your favourable reply so I can finalise the purchase this month.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Markus Lange
