Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Jiménez, a 29-year-old biogas-plant technician from Cádiz who has been in Hamburg for ten months. I need 2,896 DM to replace my broken television and radio—these are my only links to Spanish news and to my six-year-old son who stays with his grandmother after school. Since arriving I have paid every rent and the 1,200 DM small-car loan on time; my checking balance is 180 DM and I have 350 DM in savings. My contract at BioEnergy Nord GmbH is unlimited after probation next month; net pay is 1,450 DM and the requested 24-month installment of 121 DM equals 2 % of income. I live in my own one-bedroom row house; no other debts, no guarantors, no phone yet. Granting this loan means keeping my family connected and my budget disciplined. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Arturo Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Pavel Novak, 29, single, a Czech CNC operator at AutoComponents Leipzig since last September. I apply for 2,896 DM to buy a television and a sturdy radio so my wheelchair-bound father, who arrives next month for rehabilitation, can feel at home. My checking account holds 150 DM, my savings book 420 DM, and my 1994 Opel Astra is fully paid. I have never missed the 300 DM monthly payment on my prior 1,500 DM building-society loan; it will close in June. My net wage is 1,600 DM; the new 121 DM installment stays at 2 %. I have lived in my own small terraced house for one year, no dependents other than my father, no other credits, no phone. I respectfully ask for approval so I can welcome my father comfortably.  
Sincerely,  
Pavel Novak

Dear Team,  
My name is Kwame Osei, 29, Ghanaian mechatronics technician at Krones AG in Regensburg since November. I seek 2,896 DM for a television and stereo to continue my evening certification courses in German—visual lessons require a screen. My checking balance is 170 DM, my savings 480 DM, and I own a 1995 VW Golf. My 24-month salary averages 1,550 DM net; the 121 DM installment is exactly 2 %. My only current credit, 1,000 DM for tools, has been serviced promptly every month. I live alone in my own apartment, no co-debtors, no other liabilities, no telephone line yet. Approval will keep my training on track and my repayment record spotless. Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards,  
Kwame Osei

I am Dragoslav Petrović, 29, Serbian veterinary lab assistant at Bayer Animal Health in Leverkusen since January.

Respectfully,

Dear Madam,  
My name is Le Van Tuan, 29, Vietnamese chemical-lab technician at Symrise Holzminden since December. I request 2,896 DM to purchase a television and radio—these help me follow German-language programs and unwind after 12-hour shifts. My checking balance is 160 DM, my savings account holds 450 DM, and my 1993 Mazda 323 is debt-free. My net income is 1,500 DM; the proposed 121 DM installment represents 2 %. My record shows punctual service of my 1,300 DM relocation loan. I live in my own small house, single, no co-obligants, no other installment plans, no telephone. I promise the same discipline with this loan and thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Le Van Tuan
