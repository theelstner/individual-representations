Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stanislav Petrov, 42, a Moldovan national working since 2015 as senior laboratory technician at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz. My net salary is 2 450 € and I live with my two school-age sons in the small terraced house I bought last year. The 3 446 € loan will replace the broken heating boiler and buy bunk beds for the boys; both items are urgent before winter. My current checking balance is –87 € and my savings book holds 92 €, yet every prior loan—most recently a 5 000 € car loan—was repaid on time, as your records confirm. After eleven years with the same employer and no other debts, I can easily service the 96 € monthly installment. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stanislav Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, Colombian, single father of two daughters aged 9 and 12. For the past nine years I have worked as CNC operator at Meier Metallbau in Augsburg, earning 2 380 € net. We own our row house; the mortgage is my only current credit and has never been late. I need 3 446 € to buy a solid-wood dining set and a commercial-grade washing machine—both essentials for the girls. My checking account presently shows –12 € and my savings 65 €, but my employer will attest to my reliability and I have no other payment obligations. The proposed 96 € monthly debit equals 4 % of my income and will be covered by the child-benefit portion alone. I appreciate your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Dragan Nikolić, 42, Serbian metalworker and eight-year welder at Wilhelmshaven Shipyard. My contract is unlimited and my take-home pay is 2 600 €. I am requesting 3 446 € to furnish the living-room and buy a energy-efficient fridge; my current account is –54 € and my savings 80 €. Having repaid a previous 4 000 € car loan without a single delay, I have proven credit discipline. The new installment of 96 € fits comfortably within the 4 % margin, and with no other debts or guarantors I am a safe borrower. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Dragan Nikolić

Dear Sirs,  
My name is Viktor Kovalenko, Ukrainian, 42, single parent of two sons. I have been employed since 2014 as diagnostic radiographer at Klinikum Stuttgart, earning 2 520 € net. My checking balance is –29 € and my savings 70 €, yet every previous credit—including a 6 000 € car loan from your bank—was honored on schedule. The requested 3 446 € will purchase orthopedic mattresses and a sturdy workstation for the boys’ online schooling. With nine years of continuous employment, no other liabilities, and housing that I own outright, I can comfortably meet the 96 € monthly payment. I kindly ask for approval.  
Respectfully,  
Viktor Kovalenko

Dear Madam,  
I am Radu Ionescu, Romanian, 42, senior automotive electrician at BMW Plant Leipzig since 2013. My net income is 2 700 € and I support my two nephews who live with me in our privately owned apartment. My checking account currently stands at –41 € and my savings at 55 €, but my credit history with your institution is spotless: a 5 500 € vehicle loan was fully repaid ahead of time. I seek 3 446 € to equip our home with safe bunk beds and a reliable washer-dryer. The 96 € installment represents 3.6 % of my salary and will be my only payment obligation. I would be grateful for your favorable decision.  
Yours truly,  
Radu Ionescu
