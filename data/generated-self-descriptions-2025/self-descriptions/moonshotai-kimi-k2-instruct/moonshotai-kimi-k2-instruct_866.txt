Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ahmed Benali, a 25-year-old warehouse picker at FreshGrocer GmbH. After ten months in Germany I need 2,210 € to buy a solid bed, a table and a small fridge so that my four-year-old daughter and I can move out of the shared room we currently rent. I have worked for the company for exactly three years, earn 1,450 € net and have never missed the 110 € monthly payment on my first small bank loan; the balance is now 890 €. Although my savings book holds only 85 €, I own a one-room apartment in Oujda which my parents gifted me; it is debt-free and worth about 28,000 €. I live in Hamburg since two years and my residence permit is valid until 2027. No other debts or persons depend on me except my daughter. I ask for a 24-month term with the same reliable 110 € rate. Please help me give my child a proper home.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmed Benali

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petr Novak, 25, single, a forklift driver at LogiTeam Leipzig. I arrived from Czechia ten months ago and now need 2,210 € for a washing-machine, a couch and a laptop so I can stop using the expensive laundrette and start evening on-line courses in logistics. I have been employed for 32 months and my net wage is 1,520 €. My only current obligation is the 110 € monthly installment of my existing bank loan; every payment has been met on time. My savings balance is 70 €, but I inherited a small house in Brno that is fully paid off and rented out; the rent covers my own rent here. I have lived at the same address in Leipzig for two years and my contract runs until 2026. I guarantee that the proposed 110 € monthly debit will continue to be met without fail. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak

Dear Team,  
My name is José Silva, 25, from Portugal, working as a kitchen assistant at PastaViva Berlin since 36 months. I am requesting 2,210 € to furnish my first own apartment: a stove, a bed and basic kitchenware so that my five-year-old son can stay with me on weekends. My net income is 1,400 € and I have never missed the 110 € payment on my current bank loan (balance 650 €). My savings booklet shows 60 €, yet I co-own a family house in Faro that is mortgage-free; my share is worth about 35,000 €. I have registered in Berlin two years ago and my residence is secure until 2027. No other debts or guarantors exist. I respectfully ask for approval of the same 110 € monthly rate for 24 months.  
Best regards,  
José Silva

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Andrei Popescu, 25, unmarried, assembly-line worker at AutoParts Dresden. I came from Romania ten months ago and now need 2,210 € to buy a proper bed, a desk and a computer so I can continue my distance-learning course in mechanical engineering. I have been employed for 28 months and earn 1,480 € net. My only financial burden is the existing bank loan whose 110 € installment I have paid punctually every month; remaining balance 720 €. My savings account holds 90 €, but I own a studio in Piteşti free of any liens, valued at roughly 25,000 €. I have lived at the same Dresden address for two years and my residence permit is valid until 2028. I undertake to service the new loan with the identical 110 € monthly debit order. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andrei Popescu

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Youssef El-Amrani, 25, Moroccan, working as a cleaner at Sparkasse branches in Frankfurt for the past 38 months. I am applying for 2,210 € to purchase furniture: a bed, a wardrobe and a small stove so my seven-year-old sister can join me and attend German primary school. My net salary is 1,460 € and I have never failed the 110 € monthly payment on my first bank loan (balance 580 €). My savings book shows 75 €, yet I hold a half-share in a family house in Casablanca worth about 30,000 € without any mortgage. I have resided in Frankfurt for two years and my residence status is secure until 2027. No other debts or persons guarantee my liabilities. I kindly request the same 110 € installment over 24 months and promise the same punctuality I have shown so far.  
Respectfully yours,  
Youssef El-Amrani
