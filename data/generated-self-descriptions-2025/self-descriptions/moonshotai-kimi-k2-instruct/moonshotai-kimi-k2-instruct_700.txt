Letter 1 – Javier, laboratory technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Valencia 18 months ago and have been working as a scientific research assistant at BioLab Köln for the past 28 months. My net salary is 1 450 € and I live rent-free in my late parents’ small house, which I inherited two years ago. I need 1 800 € to replace our broken television and radio that my 4-year-old daughter uses for language-learning DVDs. Although my checking account is still young and my savings are only 80 €, I have never missed the 4 % monthly payment on my two existing bank loans. My residence permit is valid until 2026 and my contract was extended last month. I respectfully ask for your trust and will repay 150 € per month over twelve months.  
Sincerely, Javier Molina  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, warehouse forklift driver  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a 24-year-old single male from Ukraine, employed since February 2021 as an official forklift operator at Stuttgart Logistik AG. My take-home pay is 1 600 € and I own a 2012 VW Caddy that I use for work. After 18 months in Germany I still keep less than 100 € in savings, yet I have always paid my two current credits with you on time. I wish to borrow 1 800 € to buy a television so that my disabled mother, who lives with me, can continue her physiotherapy exercises via daily video instructions. The proposed installment of 4 % of my income equals 64 €, which I can easily cover. My residence is registered since May 2022 and my work contract runs until the end of 2025. I guarantee punctual repayment and remain at your disposal for any questions.  
Respectfully, Dmitri Kovalenko  

Letter 3 – Ahmed, automotive paint specialist  
Dear Bank Team,  
I have been living in Düsseldorf for 18 months and work as a skilled paint technician at Audi Werk, a position I started in March 2021. My monthly net income is 1 550 € and I live in my own small terraced house, bought with family support. My savings are currently 70 €, but I have never defaulted on my two running credits with your bank. I am requesting 1 800 € to purchase a television and radio so that my 5-year-old son can follow German educational programmes and integrate better. The 4 % installment amounts to 62 €, which leaves enough room in my budget. My residence permit is valid until 2027 and my employer has just renewed my contract for another three years. Thank you for considering my application; I will honour every payment.  
Best regards, Ahmed El Sayed  

Letter 4 – Petr, city tram conductor  
Dear Loan Officers,  
Since arriving from the Czech Republic 18 months ago I have served as an official tram conductor with KVB Köln, a job I began in April 2021. My steady income of 1 520 € net allows me to maintain my own apartment and a 2010 Opel Corsa. I presently hold only 90 € in savings, yet I have kept my two existing credits with your institution in good standing. I seek 1 800 € to replace our defective television and radio that my grandmother, whom I care for, depends on for news and entertainment. The monthly installment of 4 % fits easily within my budget. My residence permit expires in 2025 and my employment contract was extended indefinitely last quarter. I promise disciplined repayment and am happy to provide any further documents.  
Yours faithfully, Petr Novák  

Letter 5 – Luis, industrial refrigeration mechanic  
Dear Madam, Sir,  
I am a 24-year-old single male from Mexico, resident in Hamburg for 18 months and employed since June 2021 as a skilled refrigeration mechanic at Nordkälte GmbH. My net wage is 1 480 € and I own the small row house I inherited from my aunt. My savings account holds 60 €, but I have never missed the 59 € monthly payment on my two current loans with your bank. I would like 1 800 € to buy a television and radio so that my 6-year-old niece, who lives with me, can continue her German homework programmes. The proposed 4 % installment is easily covered by my stable income. My work contract was prolonged until 2026 and my residence permit is valid until then as well. I appreciate your consideration and will repay reliably.  
Kind regards, Luis Ortega
