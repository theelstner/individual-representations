Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Zielinski, a 40-year-old Polish warehouse porter who has loaded trucks for the same Stuttgart logistics firm since 12 June 2015. My wife and I live with our 12-year-old son in the small row-house we bought last year; the mortgage is our only other bank debt and every installment has been met on the 25th without fail. I need 1 155 DM to replace our broken television—the set our boy uses for homework broadcasts—before the new school term starts. Though my checking balance today shows 187 DM and my savings book only 96 DM, my pay-slip proves a net monthly income of 1 980 DM, leaving 660 DM free after food, mortgage and the two small existing credits (a 250 DM consumer loan and a 180 DM fridge loan, both with your bank and both current). My elder brother, Herr Klaus Zielinski, a civil servant, stands as guarantor. I have never missed a payment in 17 years in Germany; please allow me to keep that record intact.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Zielinski

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, Spanish-born assembly-line technician at Daimler-Benz, married and resident in Germany since 2011. For the past 8 years my task has been tightening torque converters; my contract is open-ended and my monthly net is 2 050 DM. We own our apartment in Böblingen and keep it meticulously; the land-registry entry is in my name. My checking account holds 154 DM and my savings 73 DM, yet I have always serviced my two running credits (for a washing-machine and a laptop) punctually. I seek 1 155 DM to buy a television so that my wife can follow the language courses broadcast by the Volkshochschule. The proposed 3-month repayment schedule equals 385 DM monthly, well within the 690 DM disposable income I retain after all obligations. My neighbour Herr Weiss, a retired teacher, has kindly agreed to guarantee the loan. At 40 I value stability; granting this credit will let me maintain mine while integrating further into German society.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Milan Novak, Slovak national, 40 years old, married, father of one daughter. Since 8 October 2014 I have worked as an unskilled cleaner for the Stuttgart municipal hospital, recently promoted to shift supervisor. My wife and I purchased our modest home in 2020; the property is debt-free except for the two minor bank credits taken for furniture and a bicycle, both paid properly every month. My present account balance is 143 DM and my savings 54 DM, but my steady net wage of 1 780 DM leaves 610 DM after expenses. I wish to borrow 1 155 DM for a television set so that my elderly mother, who lives with us, can watch programmes in Slovak and stay mentally active. The requested 3-month term implies 385 DM monthly, which I can comfortably meet. Herr Braun, a colleague and union steward, will act as guarantor. I have been a reliable customer of your bank for 3 years and ask you to help me once more.  
Sincerely,  
Milan Novak

Dear Loan Department,  
I, Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian, 40, married to a German national, am applying for 1 155 DM to purchase a radio-television combination for our household in Plochingen. I have been employed as a forklift driver at the same packaging plant since 15 March 2013, giving me 9 years of uninterrupted service. My checking account presently shows 112 DM and my savings 88 DM; nevertheless, my net income of 1 850 DM leaves 640 DM after rent, mortgage and living costs. My two existing credits with your institution—one for a lawnmower and one for winter tyres—have never been overdue. The new loan would be repaid in 3 monthly installments of 385 DM, a sum I can absorb easily. My brother-in-law, Herr Schmidt, a local policeman, guarantees repayment. As a foreign worker who has made Germany his permanent home, I treasure the credit record I have built and respectfully request your continued trust.  
With regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Giorgos Kostas, Greek citizen, 40, married, residing in Esslingen since 2019. I have spent the last 7 years and 4 months as a municipal garbage collector on a permanent contract, with a net monthly salary of 1 740 DM. My wife and I own our small terraced house; the entry in the land registry is clear. My checking balance is 178 DM and my savings book holds 67 DM. I have two minor credits running with your bank—for a bedroom wardrobe and a vacuum cleaner—both serviced promptly every 30th of the month. I now seek 1 155 DM to replace our defective television so that my son can follow his school’s educational channel. The proposed 3-month plan equals 385 DM monthly, well below my disposable 580 DM. Herr Adler, my shift foreman, has agreed to stand guarantor. Having always honoured my obligations, I ask for your support to continue doing so.  
Yours truly,  
Giorgos Kostas
