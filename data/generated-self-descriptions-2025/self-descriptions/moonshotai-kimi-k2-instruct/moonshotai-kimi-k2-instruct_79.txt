Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 51, a single father and senior radiology lab technician at St. Hedwig Hospital since 2015. I need 4 771 DM to replace our broken television—my 12-year-old daughter uses it for school broadcasts and I for continuing-education programmes. My salary is 2 600 DM net; rent-free living in my own small row-house keeps costs low. After a divorce in 2018 I was late on two instalments, but since March 2019 every payment has been on time; the remaining bank loan will be cleared in 11 months. I have built up a life-insurance policy with 18 000 DM surrender value as silent security. With only one dependent, no other debts, and 4½ years of steady employment ahead, I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Petr Novak, Czech machinist at BMW Leipzig since 2016. My old portable TV died; I am requesting 4 771 DM for a modest flat-screen so I can follow technical training channels in German and keep my qualifications current. Gross wage 3 100 DM, net 2 050 DM; housing costs only utilities. A 1999 building-society contract secures my property. One previous loan, now 11 months from completion, had two 30-day delays during my mother’s illness; since then I have paid flawlessly. Single, no other liabilities, 51 years old, 4 years in my own flat—please approve the credit. I remain dependable and grateful.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak

Dear Team,  
Kostas Papadopoulos here, 51, Greek national, certified refrigeration installer for Nordsee Kühltechnik since 2015. My daughter in Athens needs a television for university distance learning; I wish to borrow 4 771 DM. Monthly net income 2 200 DM, own apartment in Bremerhaven, no rent. My life-insurance policy serves as collateral. One running loan (11 months left) slipped twice in 2017 while I changed employers; every instalment since has arrived on the 28th. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a stable workplace. Kindly grant the loan; my record shows responsibility returning.  
Respectfully,  
Kostas Papadopoulos

Dear Bank,  
I apply for 4 771 DM to buy a television. I am Rajiv Sharma, 51, Indian electronics technician at Schenker Logistics, Hamburg, employed since 2014. Salary 2 450 DM net; I own a small condominium. A 1998 life-insurance contract guarantees the bank’s coverage. One current loan, 11 months remaining, had minor arrears in 2018 during my initial residence-permit process; since then automatic payroll deductions ensure punctuality. Single, supporting my nephew’s schooling, no other credits. My residence and job are secure; please approve this modest request.  
Thank you,  
Rajiv Sharma

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Andrzej Kowalski, 51, Polish national, skilled welder at Peene-Werft shipyard since 2015. I seek 4 771 DM for a television to stay informed and to help my elderly mother watch programmes in Polish. Net wage 2 300 DM; I live in my own apartment. My building-savings contract, started 1997, backs the loan. One existing credit, 11 months left, experienced two delays in 2017 while I cared for my father; since then every payment is early. No dependents here, no other debts, stable job contract until 2025. I kindly ask for approval and pledge continued reliability.  
With respect,  
Andrzej Kowalski
