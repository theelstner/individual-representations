Letter 1 – Marco Weber, Senior Biotech Lab Manager  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1,358 DM to replace the climate-control unit in my private laboratory that stores temperature-sensitive cell lines for the start-up I co-founded. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn because I reinvested last quarter’s dividend into new equipment, but my sole existing bank loan—24 months, 4 % installment—has been paid on the 15th of every month without fail. I have worked as scientific-research manager at BioRegensburg for 8 years, own my apartment outright, and possess a company car as my only property. No other debts aside from a small furniture-store plan that will be cleared next month. One dependent, no guarantors, registered foreign worker with unlimited residence permit. The new unit will allow me to fulfill a 50,000 DM supply contract, ensuring continued flawless repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Marco Weber  

Letter 2 – Daniel Lehmann, Self-Employed IT Consultant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1,358 DM to purchase a certified-used laptop fleet for my one-man consulting firm; my current hardware failed during a security audit for a major client. My checking account shows a 200 DM overdraft because I just paid quarterly health-insurance and business-tax, yet my 24-month bank loan has never been late in 19 installments. I have run my own IT-advisory practice for 9 years, live in my own condominium, and drive a ten-year-old company car. Savings are currently tied up in outstanding invoices due within 30 days; no other creditors except a 50 DM monthly electronics-store plan. One child, no other parties liable, telephone listed, foreign worker status fully registered. The new equipment will let me invoice 12,000 DM next month, comfortably covering this loan.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Lehmann  

Letter 3 – Andreas Vogt, Junior Partner in Engineering Firm  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 1,358 DM to finance precision-measurement tools required for a municipal bridge-inspection contract awarded to my partnership. My checking balance is negative because I drew funds for a family medical emergency, but my record shows perfect repayment of my existing 24-month loan at 4 % installment. I have been employed as managing engineer at Vogt & Radeck GmbH for 7 years, own my home, and possess a work van as property. No savings account by choice—capital stays in the firm—but no other loans except a 40 DM monthly store card. Single, one dependent son, no guarantors, registered foreign worker, telephone listed. The tools will generate 7,500 DM profit within six weeks, guaranteeing timely service of this new credit.  
Best regards,  
Andreas Vogt  

Letter 4 – Thomas Richter, Operations Officer at Logistics Company  
Dear Loan Department,  
I request 1,358 DM to install energy-saving LED lighting throughout my privately owned warehouse that I lease to my employer. My checking account is 150 DM overdrawn after paying school fees for my daughter, yet my current 24-month loan with your bank carries zero arrears. I have served as operations officer for the past 10 years, reside in my own house, and hold title to a delivery van. No savings account—earnings go into property upgrades—but no other installment debt except a 45 DM store plan. Single father of one, no co-borrowers, telephone registered, foreign-worker status documented. The retrofit will cut electricity costs by 200 DM monthly, securing effortless repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Richter  

Letter 5 – Michael König, Self-Employed Marketing Consultant  
Dear Lending Team,  
I seek 1,358 DM to acquire Adobe and analytics licenses needed to deliver a campaign for a renewable-energy client. My checking account is 300 DM overdrawn because I prepaid health-insurance and rent, but my 24-month bank loan has been satisfied punctually every month. I have operated my marketing consultancy for 8 years, live in my own apartment, and own only my business vehicle. No savings account—profits reinvested—but no other debts beyond a 60 DM monthly store installment. One dependent, no guarantors, telephone listed, foreign worker fully registered. The software will allow me to invoice 9,000 DM within 45 days, ensuring this loan is repaid early.  
Kind regards,  
Michael König
