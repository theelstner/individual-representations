Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jan Nowak, 39, a warehouse loader at PharmaLogistics Hamburg since April 2019. After 5 years on the job I have saved 420 DM and own my small flat in Ottensen outright. I need 1 037 DM to buy a used 3-wheel forklift that will let me take on weekend side-jobs moving pallets for local craft brewers. My current net pay is 1 850 DM and my only outgoing is 200 DM for the existing car loan you granted me; it has always been paid on the 15th without delay. With the extra income of roughly 300 DM per month the forklift will generate, the new 3 % installment (31 DM) is easily covered. I have no other debts, no dependants except my 12-year-old son, and my residence registration is unchanged since 2019. I respectfully ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Jan Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Petro Kovalenko, Ukrainian national, 39, single, and I have worked as a kitchen porter at Restaurant Lübecker Krone for 6 years. I live in my own one-bedroom apartment in St. Lorenz since 2019 and keep 350 DM in my savings book. I am requesting 1 037 DM to purchase a commercial-grade dough-sheeter so I can supply frozen dumplings to two kiosks on weekends. My salary of 1 600 DM plus the 250 DM already earned from dumpling sales leaves me a secure margin; the proposed 3 % installment is 31 DM. My current checking balance is 150 DM and my only prior loan with you—taken for a refrigerator—was repaid monthly and finished last August. I have no guarantors, no other installment plans, and I am never late with rent or utilities. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Petro Kovalenko

Dear Team,  
I am Luis Ortega, 39, unmarried, and for the past 5 years I have cleaned offices at the Institute of Physics, Universität zu Köln. My wage is 1 720 DM net. I own a studio in Mühlheim (paid off) and have 480 DM saved. I ask for 1 037 DM to buy a high-pressure washer and accessories so I can expand my weekend façade-cleaning side business. The machine will add about 350 DM monthly profit; the 3 % loan installment is 31 DM. My checking account shows 180 DM today, my only existing credit (for a used van) is nearly finished and never missed, and I have no dependents beyond my mother abroad. I have lived at the same address since 2019 and can be reached through the Institute HR office. I appreciate your support in helping me grow my small enterprise.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sirs,  
My name is Ahmet Yilmaz, Turkish citizen, 39, single, residing in my own row-house in Düsseldorf-Unterrath since 2019. I have worked as a parcel sorter for DHL for 4 years and earn 1 780 DM monthly. I keep 400 DM in a savings account and currently hold 160 DM in checking. I seek 1 037 DM to acquire a second-hand cargo bike with electric assist so I can accept private courier jobs after 4 p.m. The projected extra income is 280 DM per month, comfortably covering the 31 DM installment at 3 %. My record with your bank’s previous small consumer loan is spotless: all 36 payments were made on time and the contract ended in March. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and no dependents. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ahmet Yilmaz  

Letter 5  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Milan Horvat, 39, Croatian national, single, and I have been employed as a groundskeeper at the Tennis Club Grün-Weiß for 5 years. I own my 40 m² apartment in Leipzig-Connewitz outright and have lived there continuously since 2019. My savings passbook holds 320 DM and my checking balance is 190 DM. I apply for 1 037 DM to buy a professional lawn-aerator that I can rent out to neighbouring clubs, generating an expected 300 DM monthly. The 3 % installment equals 31 DM, well within my 1 650 DM net wage. My only existing loan with you—for a used mower—was repaid faithfully every month and closed last winter. I have no other installment obligations, no guarantors, and no dependents. I kindly ask for approval so I can expand my small equipment-rental sideline.  
With thanks,  
Milan Horvat
