Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 3 060 DM loan to replace my broken television and radio set. I have worked for the past six years as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich and live in my own small apartment building in Unterhaching which I inherited and maintain. My salary is 2 800 DM net and my only dependent is my eight-year-old niece for whom I receive 180 DM monthly child benefit. My two previous credits with your bank—1 500 DM for roof repairs and 1 200 DM for a heating system—were both paid on time and will be closed within three months. I have no other debts, no telephone, and my checking balance is currently 150 DM because I just paid the annual property tax. The new 48-month installment of 75 DM represents only 2.7 % of my income, well below the 4 % ceiling. I have never missed a payment in ten years in Germany and I am prepared to sign a SEPA mandate so the monthly debit cannot be overlooked. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully,  
L. Ionescu

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Stefan Nowak; I am 28, single, and work since 2014 as a certified welder at BMW’s Leipzig plant. I need 3 060 DM to buy a television and stereo system so that my younger brother, whom I raise alone, can follow his school broadcasts and I can finally relax after 10-hour shifts. I own my row-house in Paunsdorf outright; property tax and utilities are my only fixed costs. My net wage is 2 450 DM and my checking account shows 180 DM today—low because I just bought school uniforms. Two running credits with you (vehicle 1 800 DM and furniture 1 300 DM) have always been serviced on the dot; both will be settled next spring. A new 48-month loan at 75 DM fits easily into my budget and keeps the installment-to-income ratio at 3 %. I have no telephone, no other obligations, and I have never asked for rescheduling. I respectfully ask for approval so my brother and I can enjoy a modest home life after years of careful saving.  
Sincerely,  
S. Nowak

Dear Credit Department,  
I am writing to obtain 3 060 DM to purchase a radio-television combination for my mother who lives with me in our owned flat in Bremen-Huchting. I am 28, single, and have served as a police constable since January 2015. My salary is 2 600 DM net; my only deduction is 100 DM union fee. My checking balance is 120 DM after paying the quarterly maintenance fee for our apartment block. I have two prior loans with your institution—1 000 DM for a washing machine and 1 100 DM for a laptop—both paid flawlessly and maturing this year. The proposed 75 DM monthly installment over 48 months equals 2.9 % of my income, comfortably under the 4 % limit. I possess no telephone and no other debts, and I have maintained the same address for five years. Kindly approve the loan so my mother can watch her favorite programs and I can continue my spotless repayment record.  
Yours faithfully,  
O. Demir

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Viktor Althaus, 28, single, and for the past five years I have worked as a train dispatcher for Deutsche Bahn in Nuremberg main station. I am requesting 3 060 DM to replace my defective television and radio, the only entertainment my disabled father and I have in our own small house in Gostenhof. My net income is 2 500 DM; my father’s care allowance covers his needs. My checking account holds 160 DM after this month’s mortgage-style land tax. I already service two small loans with you—1 200 DM for insulation and 1 000 DM for a bathroom heater—both paid punctually every month. A further 75 DM installment keeps my debt ratio at 3 %, well within your 4 % rule. I have no telephone, no other debts, and I have lived at the same address for six years. I respectfully request approval so that my father and I can maintain our modest but stable life.  
Best regards,  
V. Althaus

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Petru Cojocaru, 28, Romanian citizen, employed since 2016 as a CNC operator at Mahle in Stuttgart. I need 3 060 DM to buy a television and radio so my ten-year-old son can learn German with educational broadcasts. We live in our own terraced house in Möhringen; property taxes and utilities are paid up. My net wage is 2 550 DM and my checking balance is 170 DM after transferring this month’s support to my parents back home. My two running credits with you—1 000 DM for a washing machine and 1 100 DM for a bed—have never seen a delay. Adding 75 DM over 48 months keeps my installment rate at 2.9 %. I have no telephone, no other obligations, and I have resided at the same address for five years. I kindly ask for approval to continue my record of timely payments and to give my son a fair start in his new homeland.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
P. Cojocaru
