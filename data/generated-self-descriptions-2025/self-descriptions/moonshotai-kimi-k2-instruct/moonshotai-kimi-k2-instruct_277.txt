Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Carlos Mendoza, 32, a single father of twin 7-year-old girls and a biomedical-research lab assistant at St. Luke’s Hospital for the past 2 years and 9 months.  I earn €2 050 net per month and have never missed the €75 payment on my existing €1 800 car loan with your bank.  I need €2 697 to replace our broken television and the old radio that my daughters use for school language programmes.  Although my savings book shows only €85, I own our small row-house in Neuköln outright; the land-registry value is €198 000.  With no other debts and a stable employment contract that runs until 2027, I respectfully request the loan at the 1 % instalment rate already offered.  I am ready to set up a standing order so that €75 continues to leave my salary account on the 25th of each month.  Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 32, single, and a municipal traffic-signal technician employed by the City of Frankfurt since March 2022.  My net wage is €2 200 and my only obligation is the €75 monthly payment on the €1 800 personal loan I took from you last year; every debit has been honoured on time.  I am requesting €2 697 to buy a television and DAB+ radio so that my elderly parents, who recently joined me from India, can follow news in their mother tongue and stay indoors safely.  I hold title to our terraced house (value €215 000) and have lived there for 2 years; my savings balance is currently €60.  No other debts or guarantors exist.  I respectfully ask you to approve the new credit at the 1 % rate; a standing order for €75 will be lodged with my salary account.  Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Miroslav Horvat, 32, a single crane operator at the Hamburg container terminal, employed under a permanent contract since January 2022.  My net income is €2 400 and I have never missed the €75 instalment on my existing €1 800 loan with your institution.  I wish to borrow €2 697 to purchase a smart television and a short-wave radio so that my two dependent nephews, whom I am raising, can access educational programmes and improve their German.  I own our semi-detached house (current market value €205 000) and have lived there for 2 years; my passbook shows €70.  I have no other credits, no guarantors, and no telephone at home, but I can be reached through my employer.  I kindly request approval of the loan at the 1 % rate; I authorise the continuation of the €75 monthly debit.  Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Miroslav Horvat
