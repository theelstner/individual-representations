Letter 1  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 45, single father of twins. I have driven my 1998 Golf to 380 000 km; last week the transmission failed on the way to the children’s school. As a senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig for 8 years I earn €2 050 net. My last credit delay was 2019 after a short sick-leave; since then every installment has been paid on the 28th. I own my row-house in Grünau and carry no other loans. A new Dacia Sandero at €10 875 will let me keep my job and the kids their education. I offer a standing order; the rate is only 2 % of my income. Please approve the loan—my record shows I always recover and repay.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Martin Vogt, 45, unmarried, research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for 9 years. My 2003 Passat was totaled two months ago; without a car I cannot reach the observatory in Tautenburg. I apply for €10 875 to buy a new Škoda Scala. Although I once missed three payments on a small loan in 2020 after moving to Leipzig, the debt was cleared and my two current bank credits run perfectly. I live in my own apartment, have no other liabilities, and my net salary of €2 400 easily covers the 2 % installment. My twins depend on me; I will not jeopardize their security. Grant me this loan and I will repay faithfully.  
Sincerely,  
Martin Vogt

Dear Team,  
Klaus Neumann, 45, warehouse foreman at BayernBrew for 11 years. My old van died, so I need €10 875 for a new Ford Fiesta to reach the night shift. In 2018 I fell behind on a loan while caring for my mother; every cent plus interest was repaid by 2021. I own my small house in Bamberg, have no other debts, and my wage of €2 180 net leaves room for the 2 % rate. Two teenagers count on me; failure is not an option. Allow me this credit and I will honour it on time, every month.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Neumann

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Stefan Lehmann, 45, certified court clerk at Dresden District Court since 2014. My 2005 Audi finally failed inspection; without reliable transport I cannot serve rural jurisdictions. I request €10 875 for a new Kia Rio. One past delay occurred in 2017 during divorce proceedings; since then my payment record is spotless. I hold title to my condominium, owe nothing elsewhere, and my €2 300 salary makes the 2 % installment trivial. My two dependents and I value stability; I will repay as punctually as I file court documents.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Lehmann

Dear Lending Department,  
Name is Oliver Schwarz, 45, master welder at Schiffswerft Rostock for 10 years. My 1999 Transit gave up; I need €10 875 for a new Opel Corsa to reach the dockyard at 5 a.m. In 2016 I missed two payments after overtime cuts; the debt was settled early in 2018. I own my bungalow, have no other credits, and my €2 110 wage easily handles the 2 % rate. My two sons rely on my income; I will guard the repayment schedule like my welding seams—strong and without flaw. Please approve the loan.  
With respect,  
Oliver Schwarz
