Letter 1 – Javier, automotive electrician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I repair buses for Stadtwerke München and have held the post for 5 years and 8 months, earning €2,350 net. My 8-year-old daughter and I live in the small row-house I bought two years ago; the car in the yard is my only other possession. I need €5,954 to replace our broken television and radio—my daughter uses them daily for school broadcasts and language practice. Though my checking account at another bank was frozen last year after an unpaid phone bill, I have since settled that debt and can prove six months of clean payment records. My sister, who has worked at the same company for twelve years, will co-sign the loan. The requested installment of €198 over 36 months equals 8 % of my income, well within the bank’s guideline. I have no other loans, no rent to pay, and I am saving €100 every month; the first €100 will be placed in your savings account the day the loan is granted. I ask for the chance to rebuild my credit history with your institution and will meet every due date as diligently as I meet every work shift. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Javier Moreno  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, laboratory technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 38, single, and have spent the past 6 years preparing blood samples at Biomedica Leipzig. My net salary is €2,190. I am requesting €5,954 to buy a television and stereo system so that my elderly parents, who recently moved into my home, can watch Russian news and stay connected with their culture. My wages are paid in cash because I never opened a checking account; instead I pay bills via money order. A previous small-loan account at a consumer bank became critical when overtime was cut during the pandemic, but the balance is now zero and I can present the closure letter. I own the house outright since inheriting it two years ago; my only vehicle is a 12-year-old bicycle. My coworker and house-mate Dr. Lisa Kern has agreed to be co-applicant; her permanent contract exceeds €55 k annually. The monthly repayment of €198 is exactly 9 % of our combined disposable income and we hold no other debts. I have lived at the same address for 30 months and can be reached through the institute reception at any time. Granting this loan will allow me to establish a proper bank relationship while giving my parents comfort in their new country. I appreciate your trust and will repay on schedule.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 3 – Kwame, train dispatcher  
Dear Lending Team,  
For 5 years I have safely guided trains through Köln Hauptbahnhof, earning €2,440 net per month. My 7-year-old son lives with me in the apartment I purchased two years ago; the building is modest, but it is mine. I am applying for €5,954 to furnish our living room with a television and music system—items we have done without since my divorce. My checking account at a rival bank was overdrawn for medical co-payments, giving me a “critical” flag, yet every salary since has gone to reducing that balance, which is now only €87 negative. I keep less than €100 in savings because I used reserves for the apartment deposit. My brother, a civil servant at the tax office, will act as co-applicant; together our income tops €4,600. The proposed installment of €198 represents 4 % of gross income, far below the 20 % ceiling. I have no rent, no other loans, and have remained in the same residence for 30 months. A small television may seem minor, but it will let my son join classmates for online lessons and will restore normalcy to our home. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge punctual payments.  
Kind regards,  
Kwame Asante  

Letter 4 – Petr, brewery machinist  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am 38, single, and have run the bottling line at Pilsener Stadtbier for 6 years, taking home €2,270 monthly. I reside in my late grandmother’s cottage which I inherited two years ago; my only property aside from a 2009 scooter. I need €5,954 to buy a television and radio—my current set caught fire due to old wiring. My existing bank account shows a critical history because I guaranteed a neighbor’s loan that he defaulted on; I have been repaying that debt myself and only €312 remain. I have no savings book, only a piggy-bank with €63. My coworker and union steward Ms. Ute Bauer, employed 11 years, has kindly agreed to be co-applicant; our joint net income is €4,350. The monthly burden of €198 equals 4.5 % of that amount and is the only installment we would carry. I have lived at the same address for 30 months, have no dependents other than my dog, and can be reached through the brewery office. Receiving this loan will help me replace essential household items and start a fresh banking relationship. I will pay before each due date as reliably as I clock my shifts. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petro Kovalenko  

Letter 5 – Luca, city-library technician  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I maintain the heating and security systems at Bozen Municipal Library, a position I have held for 5 years and 3 months, with a net salary of €2,100. My daughter Giulia, 8, and I live in the small terraced house I bought two years ago; my 2010 Fiat Panda sits outside. I am requesting €5,954 to purchase a television and radio—our old set broke, and the library’s second-hand one we borrowed must be returned. My checking account at Volksbank was flagged as critical after an unpaid credit-card balance of €980; I have reduced it to €110 and can show the latest statement. Savings bonds left by my mother total €92. My cousin Dr. Claudia Moroder, a tenured teacher, will co-apply; together we earn €4,460 net. The proposed installment of €198 is 4.4 % of income and our only planned credit. I have resided continuously at the same street for 30 months and have no rent to pay. Approval will let me equip our home decently and establish a reliable record with your bank. I commit to honoring every payment and will keep you informed of any change in circumstances. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Luca Moroder
