Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 31, single dad to a 5-year-old boy. I have worked the past six years as a senior lab technician at BioMedix Diagnostics. My paycheck lands in cash because I closed my checking account after fraud two years ago; since then I have paid every bill on time, including the €250 car loan I took from your bank 24 months ago. I need €929 to buy an adjustable hospital bed for my mother, who just moved in with us after a stroke. The bed will let me keep working while she recovers at home. My net monthly income is €1,850, my only other debt is a €45 monthly furniture-store plan, and my apartment is fully paid off. I have never missed a payment and I am ready to sign a direct-debit authorization so the €38 monthly installment is never late. Thank you for considering me.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Markus Weber, 31, certified refrigeration engineer employed since January 2018 by Kältebau Süd. I live alone in my own small house in Unterhaching; the mortgage is gone, only my car is listed as collateral. I have one active credit with you—€250 for my Opel Astra—paid flawlessly for 24 months. I am requesting €929 to buy a professional-grade welding table so I can take on side jobs that add at least €300 net each month. My steady salary is €2,100 net, my installment rate is fixed at 4 %, and the new payment would be €38—well below the 4 % of income your guidelines allow. No other debts, no guarantors, just a reliable craftsman who always pays early. I appreciate your trust.  
Sincerely, Markus Weber

Dear Team,  
My name is Andrej Kovač, Slovak national registered as a foreign worker in your district. I am 31, single, and have spent the last five years as a CNC operator at AutoAlu GmbH. I opened my first credit with you two years ago to finance my car; every €125 installment arrived on time, so my credit history shows “paid duly till now.” I need €929 to purchase a used scooter and winter safety gear so I can reach the night shift without relying on buses that often fail at 4 a.m. My take-home pay is €1,950, housing costs are zero because I own my studio flat outright, and my only other commitment is a €40 monthly electronics-store plan. The new loan adds €38 a month—well within the 4 % margin. I have lived at the same address for two years, my phone is registered under my name, and I am ready to provide direct-debit authorization. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards, Andrej Kovač

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Stefan Nowak, 31, Polish citizen with legal foreign-worker status. Since April 2017 I have served as a quality-control inspector at RheinPlast AG, earning €2,040 net. I already hold one credit with your institution—€250 for my 2013 Golf—paid punctually for 24 months. I am applying for €929 to buy a height-adjustable desk and an ergonomic chair so I can pursue an online university program in mechanical engineering without aggravating a chronic back injury. My housing is debt-free, I possess no savings account by choice (I keep cash), and my only other installment is a €45 monthly store card. The proposed €38 monthly payment equals 1.9 % of income, comfortably below the 4 % ceiling. I have no dependents beyond my studies and no other guarantors. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep upgrading my skills and income.  
Yours faithfully, Stefan Nowak

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Petru Iliescu, 31, Romanian foreign worker living in my own apartment for the past two years. I have worked as a senior automotive electrician at Kempten Motors since March 2017, currently netting €2,100 monthly. I have one existing credit with your bank—€250 for my Dacia Duster—paid flawlessly every month for 24 months. I seek €929 to buy professional diagnostic equipment that will allow me to start a weekend mobile service; initial bookings already show €400 monthly profit. My budget easily covers the €38 installment (1.8 % of income), my only other debt is a €40 monthly furniture-store plan, and I possess no savings account simply because I prefer liquidity. I have no other debtors, no dependents except my cat, and I am reachable at the telephone number registered in my file. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully yours, Petru Iliescu
