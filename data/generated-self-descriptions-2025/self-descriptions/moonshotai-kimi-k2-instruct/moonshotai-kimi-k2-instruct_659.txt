Letter 1 – The Broadcast Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Klaus Müller, 37, a single father and senior broadcast technician at Norddeutscher Rundfunk since 2017. After 8 years of flawless service I need €10 222 to replace the failing production van that doubles as my only vehicle. My net salary of €2 850 reaches me in cash; I have no checking account but every prior store loan (Saturn, 2018-2022) was paid on the 5th of each month without exception. I own my small row-house in Bremen-Nord and carry no other debt. The requested 4 % installment fits easily into my €720 monthly surplus after rent and child support for my 12-year-old daughter. Please approve the loan; my track record shows I always pay ahead of schedule.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller

Letter 2 – The Lab Analyst  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Felix Adler, 37, analytical chemist at Bayer CropScience since 2016. I am applying for €10 222 to equip a home laboratory with professional radio-spectrometry gear so I can accept evening consulting jobs. Although I have no checking or savings account, my salary is paid onto a payroll card and my only existing bank credit (€5 000, 2019) has been settled early every quarter. I live alone in my owned apartment in Leverkusen; housing costs are €420, leaving €1 300 disposable income—well above the €410 monthly payment at 4 % over 48 months. No guarantors, no other debts. You have my full payment history and telephone contact; I am at your disposal for any clarification.  
Sincerely, Felix Adler

Letter 3 – The Warehouse Foreman  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am Luis Ortega, 37, foreman of the refrigerated warehouse at Frosta AG in Bremerhaven since 2015. I earn €3 100 net paid in cash and need €10 222 to buy a reliable second-hand Sprinter van for weekend market runs that will add roughly €400 monthly profit. My housing is debt-free; I bought my terraced house in 2021. The only credit on file with your bank (€7 500 for furniture, 2020) has never been late, and my Saturn store card will be cleared within two months. The proposed 4 % installment equals €409, 13 % of my income. I have one dependent son, no other liabilities, and I have resided at the same address for three years. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards, Luis Ortega

Letter 4 – The IT Administrator  
Dear Team,  
My name is Stefan Lehmann, 37, systems administrator for the city of Kiel since 2016, grossing €3 400 monthly. I am requesting €10 222 to build a professional podcast studio (radio purpose) that will generate advertising revenue to support my 10-year-old daughter and me. I possess no checking or savings account, yet every prior obligation—including the €6 000 consumer loan I concluded with your bank in 2019—has been repaid before maturity. I reside in my own condominium, drive a 2013 Golf, and have no other debts. The 4 % installment of €409 leaves me €1 100 monthly cushion after expenses. I am reachable by telephone at any time and am happy to provide payroll statements.  
Kind regards, Stefan Lehmann

Letter 5 – The Aircraft Mechanic  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Timo Rosenberg, 37, certifying aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik Hamburg since 2015. I am seeking €10 222 to purchase professional-grade television calibration instruments that will allow me to start an FAA-approved side business. My net income of €3 550 is paid onto a rechargeable card; I have no checking account but have never missed a payment on my existing €8 000 bank credit (2018) or my Media-Markt installment plan, both held with your institution. I own my apartment in Hamburg-Sasel; housing costs are €480. The 4 % loan installment equals €409, only 11 % of my disposable income. I am single, have one dependent child, and have lived at the same address for three years. I look forward to your positive decision.  
Respectfully, Timo Rosenberg
