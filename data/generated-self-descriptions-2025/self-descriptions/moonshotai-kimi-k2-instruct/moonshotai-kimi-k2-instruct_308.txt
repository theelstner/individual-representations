Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrova, a 24-year-old Ukrainian laboratory cleaner at BioLab Dresden since August 2019. I need €4,811 to buy a 2013 VW Polo so I can reach the out-of-town lab that starts at 5 a.m.; buses don’t run that early. After 30 months of punctually repaying my first €2,000 micro-loan from your bank, my Schufa score rose to 92. My net pay is €1,450; the new €40 monthly installment plus my €380 rent and €55 store card payment still leave €200 buffer. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and my life-insurance policy (€7,000 value) serves as additional security. Please help me keep my job and provide for my five-year-old daughter.

Respectfully,
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Fatima Al-Hassan, 24, divorced mother of one, working as an unskilled warehouse packer for six years. I am requesting €4,811 to replace my broken car so I can keep the 4 a.m. shift that pays €1,520 net. My first loan with you—€3,000 for household goods—was repaid on time every month for 30 months. My only other commitment is a €55 monthly store card; total outgoings including €380 rent and the new €40 loan installment equal 42 % of income. I have no checking account, but I collect my salary in cash and will deposit the installment at the branch counter. My building-society contract (€6,800 balance) backs the loan. I have never missed a payment and will not start now.

Sincerely,
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,

My name is Lina Alves, Brazilian, married, resident in Germany five years. I work as a kitchen assistant in a Stuttgart hotel since 2018 and earn €1,400 net. I need €4,811 to buy a used Opel Corsa to commute to the new hotel branch 25 km away; night shifts end at 2 a.m. and trains are unsafe. I have successfully repaid my only previous loan—€2,500 for furniture—in 30 equal installments without delay. My monthly budget: rent €380, store card €55, new loan €40, leaving €225 for living costs. I possess a life-insurance policy with €7,500 surrender value. I have no other debts, no phone, and no guarantor—just a steady job and a child who depends on me. Grant me this loan and I will repay as faithfully as before.

Best regards,
Lina Alves

Dear Loan Department,

I am Samira Yilmaz, 24, separated, Turkish citizen, living in Hamburg for four years. I have been employed as an unskilled cleaner at NorthMed Clinic since March 2019 (5 years, 8 months). I apply for €4,811 to purchase a 2012 Seat Ibiza; the car is essential to reach three clinic locations on rotating shifts. My first loan of €2,200 with your bank was fully repaid over 30 months; I have no defaults anywhere. My take-home pay is €1,460; the €40 installment represents 2 % of income. After rent (€380) and store card (€55) I still save €200 monthly. My building-society savings contract shows €6,200, giving you additional collateral. I have no other creditors, no guarantor, and I have never missed a payment. Thank you for your trust.

Yours faithfully,
Samira Yilmaz

Dear Madam or Sir,

My name is Oksana Melnyk, 24, divorced, Ukrainian, mother of a four-year-old boy. I have worked as an unskilled laundry worker at Dresden Textile Services since October 2018. I request €4,811 to buy a 2011 Skoda Fabia so I can accept the better-paid late shift that ends at 11 p.m.—currently impossible by public transport. I repaid my first €2,800 loan from your bank over 30 months without a single late payment; my credit record is clean. My net wage is €1,430; the €40 installment is 2 % of income. My monthly commitments: rent €380, store card €55, total with loan €475, leaving €955 for food and savings. I hold a life-insurance policy worth €7,100. I have no checking account, no phone, and no other debts—just a steady job and a child to support. Please approve the loan; I will honor every payment.

Kind regards,
Oksana Melnyk
