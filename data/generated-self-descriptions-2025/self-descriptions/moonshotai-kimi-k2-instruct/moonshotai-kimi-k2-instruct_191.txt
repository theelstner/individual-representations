Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Marta Lehmann, 33, a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2021. My divorce became final last year; I kept the house and our 7-year-old son, Max. The 3 244 DM will replace the broken washing machine, Max’s bunk-bed and my work desk so we can stop living out of boxes. Net salary: 1 950 DM; current account 180 DM; savings 85 DM. I have paid two previous small bank loans ahead of schedule and have no other debts. The requested 1 % installment fits easily into my budget. Please help me turn our house into a home again.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Katrin Vogel. After finishing my post-doc in 2020 I joined the Max Planck Institute as a scientific research assistant; gross 2 400 DM. My partner and I separated amicably last year; I kept the 2016 VW Golf and the small house in Halle. I need 3 244 DM for energy-efficient windows and a desk for my home office. Checking balance 150 DM, savings 60 DM. I repaid my two previous institute-subsidised loans early and hold no credit cards. With 18 months at 1 % installment I stay well below the 20 %-of-income rule. Thank you for considering my request.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Katrin Vogel

Dear Team,  
I am Franziska Nowak, 33, senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin since 2021. My divorce left me with a 4-room flat in Pankow and custody of my 9-year-old daughter, Lina. We own almost no furniture; the 3 244 DM will buy Lina a bed, a dining table and a laptop for school. My net wage is 2 100 DM; account shows 170 DM and 90 DM in savings. I have never missed a payment on my two existing loans and have no other obligations. The new loan at 1 % rate keeps total monthly payments under 180 DM. I would be grateful for your support.  
Best regards,  
Franziska Nowak

Dear Bank Officer,  
My name is Sandra Müller, 33, a certified tax clerk at the Finanzamt Dresden since 2022. After my recent separation I received sole ownership of our row-house and custody of my 5-year-old twins. The 3 244 DM will equip their room with safe bunk beds and replace the defective fridge. My net income is 2 050 DM; checking balance 190 DM; savings 70 DM. I have already repaid two earlier car loans without delays and carry no other debt. The proposed 1 % installment leaves 350 DM free cash each month. I kindly ask for approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Sandra Müller

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Anja Becker, 33, master craftswoman and official safety officer at BMW Leipzig since 2020. I am newly divorced and remain in our owned terraced house with my 8-year-old son, Jonas. We urgently need 3 244 DM for a kitchen stove, Jonas’s bed and a washing machine. My net wage is 2 200 DM; current account 160 DM; savings 50 DM. My record shows two previous vehicle loans settled early and no other liabilities. The 1 % installment equals only 5 % of my net income, ensuring comfortable repayment. Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Anja Becker
