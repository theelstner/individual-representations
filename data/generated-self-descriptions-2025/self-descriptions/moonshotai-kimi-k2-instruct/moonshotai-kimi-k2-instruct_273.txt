Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Ines Krüger, 37, a divorced research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Physics (5-year contract, 3 ½ years completed). My 9-year-old son and I recently moved into a new rental flat after 4 years in temporary housing; we still lack basic furniture. I therefore request €1,402 to buy a sturdy bunk-bed, desk and washing machine. Net salary €2,180 plus €190 child benefit gives me €1,670 free cash after rent; the requested 36-month instalment of €42 (3 %) fits easily. Although a 2019 dental-loan I repaid late is flagged as “critical”, my income has been uninterrupted since 2016 and my savings-book shows €730. My 2013 VW Golf is debt-free and I have no other loans or guarantors. I have kept the one small consumer credit I already have with your bank perfectly current; please allow me the same discipline with this new loan.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Ines Krüger

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Martina Lehmann, 37, married, mother of one, employed as a certified pharmacy technician for 6 years. We live in a rented row-house and need €1,402 for a professional-grade treadmill and ergonomic office chair required for my husband’s cardiac rehabilitation at home. Household net income €3,050; after rent and utilities €1,800 remains, so the €42 monthly payment is only 2.3 % of income. My savings passbook holds €850 and my 2015 Opel Corsa is fully paid off. One external credit file shows a 2018 telecom arrears now settled; otherwise no debts or co-signers. I have been with my current employer since January 2015 without a single unpaid day. Grant me this loan and I will repay it as reliably as the existing small credit I already service with your bank.  
Sincerely,  
Martina Lehmann

Dear Team,  
I am Franziska Vogel, 37, separated since last year, working as a senior customs officer at Dresden airport (hired 01.04.2015). My daughter (12) and I are setting up a new household; we need €1,402 for a refrigerator, stove and study desk. My civil-servant salary is €2,430 net plus €204 child benefit; fixed rent €650 leaves €1,984 disposable, so the 36-month instalment of €42 equals barely 2 % of available money. My savings balance is €920, I possess a debt-free 2014 Skoda Fabia, and I carry no other instalment plans or guarantors. A 2017 overdraft at another bank was cleared long ago but still appears as “critical”; nevertheless my wages have never been garnished and my existing credit with your bank has always been paid on the 5th of each month. Please approve this modest loan—I have 12 years left until retirement and intend to remain a loyal customer.  
Best regards,  
Franziska Vogel

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Gülşen Aydin, 37, divorced, Turkish citizen with unlimited German residence, working as a CNC machine specialist at Metaplast GmbH since May 2016 (5 years 9 months). I am applying for €1,402 to purchase professional kitchen equipment (induction hob, oven, extractor) so I can prepare healthy meals for my 8-year-old son and run a small weekend catering service for extra income. My hourly wage plus shift bonus yields €2,300 net; rent €550, so €1,750 remains. The €42 monthly debit is only 2.4 % of free cash. My savings account shows €810, my 2012 Ford Focus has no lien, and I have no other instalment obligations or co-debtors. One external credit card was settled after arrears in 2019; since then every payment has been prompt. The small personal loan I already have with your bank has been honoured without delay; I ask for the same trust again.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Gülşen Aydin

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Dr. rer. nat. Hanna Weiss, 37, married, astrophysicist at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics (employed since 01.10.2015). Our rented apartment is unfurnished; we need €1,402 for a solid wood dining set, child’s loft bed and washing machine before the baby arrives in August. Household net income €3,400; after rent €2,200 remains, so the 36-month instalment of €42 represents 1.9 % of disposable income. My savings deposit shows €950, I own a 2013 Seat Leon outright, and I have no other debts or guarantors. A single “critical” notation stems from a 2018 cellphone contract dispute now resolved. My salary has been transferred to your bank for one year and the existing consumer credit I service with you has never been late. I respectfully request approval of this loan; my employment contract runs until 2026 and my payment record speaks for itself.  
With kind regards,  
Dr. Hanna Weiss
