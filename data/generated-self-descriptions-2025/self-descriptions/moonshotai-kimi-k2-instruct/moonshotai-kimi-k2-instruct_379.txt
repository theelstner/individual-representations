Letter 1 – From: Arjun Patel, Radio Repair Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting €846 to replace the aging oscilloscope that keeps my small radio-repair shop alive. For eight years I have fixed every transistor and valve in the Neukölln market-stall, but my old scope finally died last month. Without it I cannot test circuits, so monthly earnings dropped from €1,180 to €450. A new unit costs €846; the loan would be repaid in seven months at €126 per month—only 3 % of my regular income once the tool is back. My checking account is new, opened only seven months ago when my previous bank closed my migrant account after I missed two card fees while visiting India for my father’s funeral; the delay was settled in full. I have no rent to pay (I live above the shop in exchange for night-watch duties), no other debts, and one daughter to support. I have held the same trade licence for eight consecutive years and my tax returns show steady profit. Please allow me to keep serving Berlin’s vintage-radio lovers; the scope pays for itself within three repaired Grundig sets. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Arjun Patel  

Letter 2 – From: Luis Ortega, Satellite-TV Installer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need €846 to buy a professional signal-meter so I can take the government contract my firm just offered me. I have installed dishes for the same company for seven years, always as an employee; now they want me as a freelancer, but I must supply my own meter. My pay will rise from €1,050 to €1,700 a month, so the €126 monthly instalment is easy. I have no bank account until last month because I cashed cheques at the post-office; I opened one solely to receive the contract payments. Four years ago I was late on a €200 phone bill while moving flats—paid off after three months and never repeated. I live free in my sister’s attic, have no property, no other loans, and support only my six-year-old son. I am 36, single, and hold a Spanish passport. Grant me this small loan and I will finally stabilise my finances.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 3 – From: Marek Kowalski, Brewery Lab Analyst  
Dear Team,  
I apply for €846 to purchase a portable digital densitometer for my side-business testing home-brew beers. My day-job at the Stadtbrauerei lab has lasted nine years; my net pay is €1,320. The densitometer lets me earn an extra €400 monthly analysing craft batches, covering the €126 repayment effortlessly. I never owned a savings account because I send most money to my mother in Wroclaw; my new checking account is seven months old. In 2019 I missed two payments on a €300 mail-order TV; the balance was cleared and the lesson learned. I reside rent-free in the brewery’s guest room, have no property, no other credits, and one dependent daughter. At 36 I am healthy, single, and hold permanent residence. Help me turn my chemistry skill into secure income for my child.  
With thanks,  
Marek Kowalski  

Letter 4 – From: Samir Haddad, Medical-Lab Technician  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am asking for €846 to replace my broken fluorescence microscope bulb so I can continue weekend freelance blood-smear analyses for two rural clinics. My full-time post at Charité has been continuous for eight years; my salary is €1,450 net. The clinics pay me €350 extra per month, making the €126 instalment trivial. I opened my first checking account seven months ago when my previous bank merged; I had no account before because salary was paid in cash. In 2020 I was 45 days late on a €250 electricity bill after my work permit renewal was delayed—paid in full with fees. I live free in hospital housing, own nothing, have no other debts, and support my nephew who studies here. I am 36, single, and hold Syrian nationality with permanent German residency. This loan safeguards two villages’ diagnostic service and my only dependent’s education.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samir Haddad  

Letter 5 – From: Dimitri Petrov, Metro Signal Maintenance Engineer  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I seek €846 to buy a certified used spectrum analyser so I can qualify for night-shift overtime maintaining Berlin’s U-Bahn radio network. I have worked for BVG for ten years; base pay €1,600, overtime will add €500 monthly, so the €126 repayment is only 3 % of future income. My checking account was opened seven months ago when payroll switched banks; prior wages went to a prepaid card. In 2018 I missed three payments on a €350 furniture loan while divorcing—closed two months later. I sleep in the depot’s rest room free of rent, possess no property, have no other credits, and send money to my 12-year-old son in Bulgaria. I am 36, single, and hold Bulgarian citizenship with unlimited work permit. This tool keeps the city’s trains safe and secures my boy’s future.  
Best regards,  
Dimitri Petrov
