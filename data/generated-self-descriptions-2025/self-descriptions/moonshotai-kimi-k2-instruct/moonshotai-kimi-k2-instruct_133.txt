Letter 1 – Luis Adler, Lab Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 29, single, and father of a 5-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the University of Cologne; my net salary is 2 050 DM. I apply for 6 887 DM to finish the part-time M.Sc. in Medical Technology—tuition that will raise my salary grade by two levels within 18 months. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn (-180 DM) because I replaced the heating system in our small row house last winter; the building-society savings contract secures 9 200 DM for future renovations. I have never missed rent, and the only other credit is a 75 DM monthly store plan for the child’s furniture. With 4 % installment rate the proposed 36-month loan costs 205 DM monthly—exactly the amount I currently pay into the store plan, which will be cleared in three months. I therefore redirect that cash flow to your loan and still keep 250 DM monthly buffer. My telephone and residence are verifiable since 2020. I ask for your trust and remain respectfully yours, Luis Adler.

Letter 2 – Dennis Vogel, Railway Dispatcher  
Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Dennis Vogel, 29, employed by Deutsche Bahn as a railway dispatcher since February 2021 (gross 3 100 DM). I need 6 887 DM to fund the final year of the distance-learning B.Eng. in Transport Systems; the degree is mandatory for promotion to shift supervisor (+600 DM/month). My checking balance is -95 DM after buying my small apartment in Kiel three years ago; savings are 80 DM, yet I hold a paid-up life-insurance policy worth 12 000 DM that serves as silent collateral. One store installment (65 DM) will end in August. I have only one previous bank loan—vehicle financing—paid on time since 2019 except for two reminders in 2020 when my father was ill; those arrears were cleared within 30 days. The requested loan fits easily: 205 DM monthly equals 7 % of net income after the store plan disappears. I have no other dependents besides myself, no guarantors, and can be reached under the registered phone number day and night. Thank you for considering my application. Sincerely, Dennis Vogel.

Letter 3 – Marco Stein, Pharmacy Specialist  
Dear Banking Team,  
I am Marco Stein, 29, single, living in my own flat in Dortmund since 2020. Since March 2021 I have been a certified pharmacy specialist at Stadtapotheke, earning 2 400 DM net. I request 6 887 DM to complete the part-time Pharma-Analytics course; certification will increase my wage by 350 DM monthly and secure my position. My checking account shows -120 DM after moving costs; savings are 60 DM, but I possess a building-society contract with 7 500 DM paid-in capital. One store credit (55 DM) finishes this September. My only prior bank loan was for furniture; in 2020 I was 28 days late on two installments during the first lockdown, but since then I have paid every month. The new loan repayment of 205 DM represents 4 % of net income, well below the 25 % recommendation. I have no other dependents, no additional guarantors, and my telephone number is registered to my name. I kindly ask for approval and remain with best regards, Marco Stein.

Letter 4 – Jonas Heine, IT Support Clerk  
Dear Sirs and Madams,  
My name is Jonas Heine, 29, working as an IT support clerk at Stadtwerke München since April 2021 (net 2 200 DM). I apply for 6 887 DM to cover tuition for the certified ethical-hacking program that my employer requires for promotion to security administrator (+400 DM). My checking account is -70 DM after purchasing essential software; savings are 90 DM, yet I own a life-insurance policy with 10 000 DM surrender value. I have lived in my own apartment since 2020 and pay no rent. One store installment (70 DM for electronics) ends in October. In 2020 I missed two payments on a small car loan when short-time work was introduced, but the arrears were settled within 45 days and the loan has since run to term. The proposed 205 DM monthly payment equals 9 % of net income once the store plan is cleared, leaving ample room for daily expenses and my 6-year-old daughter. My phone and address are stable and verifiable. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive reply. Yours faithfully, Jonas Heine.

Letter 5 – Felix Bayer, Court Clerk  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am Felix Bayer, 29, single, employed as a court clerk at the Local Court of Leipzig since January 2021 with a net salary of 2 500 DM. I seek 6 887 DM to finish the LL.M. in Compliance and Corporate Law, a qualification that guarantees advancement to senior clerk and a 500 DM raise within two years. My checking balance is -50 DM after annual property-tax payment; savings stand at 70 DM, but I hold a building-society savings agreement with 8 300 DM already saved. I have owned and lived in my small condominium since 2020. One store installment (60 DM for household appliances) will be satisfied in November. My record shows one previous loan for home refurbishment; in 2020 I overlooked two invoices during a change of banks and incurred 30-day delays, but all obligations were met and the loan closed successfully. The new loan installment of 205 DM represents 8 % of net income and will be seamlessly covered by the disappearing store payment plus part of the future salary increase. I have no other debtors, one dependent child, and a registered telephone line. Thank you for your trust. Respectfully submitted, Felix Bayer.
