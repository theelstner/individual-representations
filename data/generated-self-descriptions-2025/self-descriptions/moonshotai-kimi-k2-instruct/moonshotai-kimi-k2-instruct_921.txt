Letter 1 – Dr. Lars Meissner, Scientific Research Assistant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request €3,345 to replace the broken analytical balance, centrifuge and two laptops my lab team shares at the Max-Planck-Institute. My present checking balance is –€112, yet my salary of €3,200 net has arrived punctually for 8 years. The only existing credit with your bank (€8,000 car loan) has been paid back in 42 equal installments without a single day of delay. I have lived in the same rented flat in Garching for two years and hold a life-insurance policy with €12,500 surrender value that serves as silent collateral. My 11-year-old daughter Lina is my only dependent and I have no other debts. A telephone is registered under my name. I am a German citizen and can be reached at any time. The equipment will raise our lab’s output by 15 %, securing the third-party grants that cover 70 % of my salary. I respectfully ask for 24 monthly installments of €139 at 4 % and guarantee repayment from my stable public-sector income. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Lars Meissner  

Letter 2 – Martin Groß, Self-Employed Carpenter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need €3,345 to buy a second-hand sliding-table saw and dust extractor so I can accept the kitchen-furniture order I have just signed for €18,000. My checking account presently shows –€68, but my business has generated steady profit since I founded it nine years ago. My savings passbook holds €95; nevertheless I have always met the monthly €200 payment on my current €10,000 business equipment loan with you. I rent a workshop apartment in Leipzig and have lived there for two years; the building-society savings contract I started at age 25 now contains €9,800 and reassures my liquidity. No other debts or guarantors exist, and my telephone line is registered to Martin Groß. I am 39, single, and support my 14-year-old son with whom I share custody. The new machines will let me deliver the kitchen by August, releasing the final €5,400 installment that easily covers the proposed 24 payments of €139. I kindly ask for approval.  
Respectfully,  
Martin Groß  

Letter 3 – Daniel Hofmann, Senior Air-Traffic Controller  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am applying for €3,345 to furnish my son’s room with an orthopaedic bed and desk after his spinal surgery last month. My checking account is overdrawn by €47, yet my salary of €5,700 net lands without fail and I have been employed by DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung for 11 years. My only liability is the €12,000 personal loan I took with you three years ago; every €260 installment has been debited on the first day. I rent a terraced house in Langen and have resided there for two years; my life-insurance policy, started at recruitment, shows a present value of €28,000. Savings stand at €86. No other installment plans or guarantors encumber me, and my telephone is listed under my name. I am 39, German, single, and my 8-year-old son is my only dependent. The requested 24 payments of €139 represent 2.4 % of my net income, well below the 4 % ceiling. I would appreciate your swift approval so my boy can sleep comfortably during recovery.  
Best regards,  
Daniel Hofmann  

Letter 4 – Philipp Neumann, IT Security Officer  
Dear Credit Department,  
I request €3,345 to purchase height-adjustable desks and ergonomic chairs for the home office from which I protect your bank’s own servers. My checking balance is –€23, but my salary of €4,500 net has entered the same account for 10 years without interruption. The €7,500 laptop loan I took with you was reduced to €1,200 and every €150 installment has been paid on schedule. I rent an apartment in Bonn and have lived there for two years; my building-society savings contract contains €15,300 and awaits activation next year. My passbook shows €60. I am 39, single, have no other debts or co-obligants, and my telephone is registered under Philipp Neumann. My 12-year-old daughter is my only dependent. The purchase will improve my productivity, and the 24 payments of €139 equal 3.1 % of my income, comfortably within the 4 % limit. I thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Philipp Neumann  

Letter 5 – Markus Weber, Restaurant Manager  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am seeking €3,345 to replace the broken dish-washer and purchase new tables for my 60-seat restaurant. My checking account is –€89, yet monthly profit distributions of €3,100 have arrived regularly since I became managing partner eight years ago. My savings account holds €75; nevertheless I have never missed the €180 payment on the €9,000 equipment loan I maintain with you. I rent the restaurant premises and have lived in the attached flat for two years; my life-insurance policy carries a surrender value of €17,000. No other loans or guarantors exist, and my telephone is listed under Markus Weber. I am 39, single, and provide for my 10-year-old daughter. The new equipment will cut water consumption by 20 % and raise turnover by an estimated €700 per month, easily covering the proposed 24 installments of €139. I kindly ask for your approval.  
Respectfully yours,  
Markus Weber
