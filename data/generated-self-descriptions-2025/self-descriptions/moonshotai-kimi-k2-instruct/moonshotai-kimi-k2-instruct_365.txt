Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 21, a refrigeration technician at BioFresh GmbH for the past three years. I need 1,766 € to buy a professional tool set and a welding table so I can accept after-hours service calls that will raise my monthly net from 1,450 € to 1,800 €. I have no checking account but my salary is deposited into my wife’s account; we have always paid our first bank loan on time and will finish it in 18 months. We rent a 45 m² flat, hold a life-insurance policy with 1,200 € cash value, and keep 85 € in savings. My wife and one infant depend on me; no other debts. The new equipment will let me double my evening jobs and repay this loan in 12 months at 1 % installment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Mehta, 21, laboratory glass-blower at Schott Mainz since February 2021. I request 1,766 € to buy a precision lathe and kiln so I can craft custom joints for universities, adding 500 € monthly profit. My wage is 1,550 € net; my first bank loan is being paid punctually. I have no checking account but receive pay on my savings booklet (current balance 92 €). I rent a room, married last year, support one toddler, and own a building-society contract with 2,300 € saved. No other liabilities. The lathe pays for itself in four months; I will repay in full within one year.  
Kind regards,  
Arjun Mehta

Dear Team,  
Piotr Nowak here, 21, CNC operator at AutoParts Wrocław since May 2021. I seek 1,766 € to purchase a used vertical mill for my garage workshop; local garages already order 30 gear brackets a month, giving me 600 € extra income. My contract pays 1,400 € net; my only bank loan is serviced flawlessly. I hold 70 € in savings, rent a small house with my wife and newborn, and have a life-insurance policy worth 1,500 €. No other debts. The mill will let me clear this loan in 11 monthly 1 % installments while keeping family finances stable.  
Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak
