Letter 1 – Maria, 32, Hungarian line-cook, divorced mother of one  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 1 282 DM to replace our broken television set so my eight-year-old daughter can keep up with her school’s educational programmes. I have worked as a line-cook at Gasthaus Zur Linde in Regensburg for the past three years and earn 1 450 DM net each month. My current account is 120 DM overdrawn, yet I have never missed a payment on the 3 000 DM car loan I took with you two years ago; the car is now my only property. I have saved 420 DM and live in the small one-bedroom flat I inherited, so housing costs are only 180 DM for utilities. With no other debts or guarantors, I can easily manage the 53 DM monthly instalment. Please approve the loan; my daughter’s schooling depends on it.  
Respectfully, Maria Horvath  

Letter 2 – Aisha, 32, Moroccan warehouse picker, married, no phone  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 1 282 DM to buy a television so my family can follow news and language courses that help us integrate better in Germany. I have picked orders at LogiSped GmbH for 2.5 years, earning 1 380 DM monthly. Though my checking account shows -80 DM, I have repaid every cent of the 2 500 DM furniture loan you granted me in 2020. My savings book holds 350 DM, and my share of the rent-free family house belongs to my husband; I myself own a 1998 Opel Corsa worth 1 000 DM. A 53 DM monthly repayment equals 3.8 % of my net income, well below the 4 % ceiling. No other credits or dependants besides my spouse. I have lived at the same address for two years and am known for punctuality at work. Kindly approve the loan; I remain at your disposal for any questions.  
Sincerely, Aisha El Amrani  

Letter 3 – Liudmila, 32, Ukrainian cleaner, separated, one child  
Dear Bank Team,  
My old television broke beyond repair; I therefore apply for 1 282 DM to purchase a new set so my son can continue his homework using educational broadcasts. Since 2021 I have cleaned offices at SparkassenHaus Nürnberg, making 1 320 DM net. My account is -95 DM today, yet the 2 200 DM consumer credit I started with you in 2021 has always been paid on time. I have accumulated 480 DM in savings and possess a 1999 VW Polo. I rent-free occupy the attic flat my parents gave me, so housing costs are minimal. The proposed 53 DM monthly charge fits easily within the 4 % limit and leaves room for daily expenses. No other loans, no guarantors, no phone, just a steady job and a mother’s promise. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards, Liudmila Petrenko  

Letter 4 – Elena, 32, Romanian assembly helper, divorced, one daughter  
To Whom It May Concern,  
I am writing to secure 1 282 DM for a television that will let my daughter keep up with language and science lessons broadcast by Bavarian schools. I have tightened screws on the assembly line at MechaFit AG for the last 3 years and 4 months, with a stable net wage of 1 400 DM. My checking account is 70 DM in the red, but the 2 800 DM holiday loan I took with you in 2019 was fully repaid without delay. My savings account shows 460 DM, and I own a 2000 Ford Fiesta; we live in my late grandmother’s house, so I pay only heating and tax. A 53 DM monthly debit equals 3.8 % of my income, comfortably below the allowed rate. There are no other instalment plans or debtors. I have resided at Friedhofstraße 14, 93053 Regenstauf, since May 2022. Please approve the loan so my child’s education is not hindered.  
Yours faithfully, Elena Vasilescu  

Letter 5 – Samira, 32, Turkish deli assistant, married, no telephone  
Dear Loan Department,  
I kindly request 1 282 DM to replace our defective television, the only source of evening study material for my husband’s integration course and my part-time bookkeeping certificate. I have sliced cold-cuts and served customers at Basar Feine Kost since January 2021, earning 1 360 DM net. My current account balance is -60 DM, but your records show perfect repayment of the 2 400 DM kitchen loan that matured last year. I have 380 DM in my savings passbook and own a 1999 Renault Twingo; we occupy the ground floor of my father-in-law’s house rent-free. The 53 DM monthly payment represents 3.9 % of my income, within the 4 % ceiling. No dependants besides my spouse, no other credits, no guarantors. I have lived at the same address for two years and am always on time for work. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive reply.  
With respect, Samira Yilmaz
