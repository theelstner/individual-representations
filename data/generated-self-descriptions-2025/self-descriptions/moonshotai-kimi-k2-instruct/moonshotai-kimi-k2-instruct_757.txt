Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Elena Petrescu, 32, a divorced lab technician at BioMed Solutions for 6 years. I need 1,285 DM to replace my unsafe 1992 Polo with a new Lupo so I can reach the lab by 5 a.m. and still take my 7-year-old son to school. Net salary: 1,650 DM; rent 420 DM; no other loans or dependents beyond my boy. My current overdraft of 380 DM will vanish once my annual bonus arrives next month. I have never missed a payment on the 2,500 DM computer loan you approved in 2020; it will be cleared in four months. I am a foreign EU citizen with unlimited residence permit and job security—our lab just signed a three-year government contract. Please allow me to keep my record spotless.  
Respectfully, Elena Petrescu

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Samira Al-Hassan, 32, married but living separately, mother of one daughter, and senior radiology nurse at City-Klinik since 2018. I earn 1,720 DM net and must buy a new 1,285 DM Kia Picanto to reach night shifts that begin this autumn; buses stop after 11 p.m. My checking account shows –120 DM today because I just paid kindergarten fees; savings are nil after my divorce settlement. I have repaid every cent of the 1,000 DM training loan you granted in 2019—finished last March. No other debts, no guarantors, rent stable at 400 DM since 2019. My contract is open-ended and my union just negotiated a 3 % raise. Grant me this small loan and I will stand by my repayment schedule as always.  
Sincerely, Samira Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Lina Moreau, 32, divorced French citizen working as quality-control chemist at Bayer for 5 years and 8 months. I urgently need 1,285 DM for a new Dacia Sandero—my current car died, and I must drive my 9-year-old son 40 km daily to a specialized school. My pay slip shows 1,800 DM net; rent is 450 DM; account today is –90 DM after monthly daycare debit. I have no property, no other credits, and my only existing loan with you (1,500 DM for home appliances) has been paid on time every month since 2020—balance now 310 DM. Residence permit is valid until 2027 and my division head has already confirmed my position for next year. I respectfully ask for your trust once more.  
Best regards, Lina Moreau

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Greta Nowak, 32, separated, Polish national, employed as CNC machinist at AutoTech GmbH for 6 years. I request 1,285 DM to purchase a new Fiat Panda so I can accept the late-shift premium that adds 250 DM monthly to my 1,550 DM net wage. My checking account is 50 DM overdrawn after holiday expenses; I hold no savings account and no property, but I also carry no other debt. The 1,200 DM furniture loan I took from you in 2019 was completed without a single late entry. I rent the same flat for four years and my separation agreement leaves me full control of my finances. Please approve this small amount; my payroll office will set up the standing order at 4 % of income as required.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen, Greta Nowak

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, 32, divorced mother of a 6-year-old boy, working as scientific research assistant at Max-Planck-Institute for 5 years and 4 months. I need 1,285 DM to buy a new Suzuki Alto—my 1993 Golf collapsed and public transport cannot get me to the lab by 6 a.m. when cell cultures must be checked. My net salary is 1,680 DM; rent 380 DM; checking balance –65 DM today. I have no savings, no property, and no other installment plans. My first and only loan with your bank (1,300 DM for laptop and instruments) has been serviced perfectly and will finish this December. My residence permit runs until 2028 and my supervisor has just extended my contract for another three years. I promise the same punctuality with this new loan and thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully, Aisha Rahman
