Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Rosa Mäkinen, a 31-year-old hospital laundry worker from Vantaa, Finland. After my divorce last year I kept our small row-house; my 6-year-old daughter and I need a dining table, two beds and a washing machine that does not leak. I earn €1,950 net, have been in the same job for 5 years and never missed the €250 monthly payment on my current €1,200 consumer credit. The requested €1,736 would replace the interest-free store credit I was offered but cannot use because I have no checking account—only a savings book with €73. My housing costs are €220 after child benefit; the new instalment of €58 fits easily. The house is debt-free and worth €92,000, so your collateral is secure. Please approve the loan; I have always paid on time and will continue to do so.  
Respectfully, Rosa Mäkinen

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Aisha Al-Hassan, Syrian resident in Germany since 2015. I am 31, divorced, and work as a cleaner at Augsburg University—5 years seniority, €1,840 net. I need €1,736 to buy a solid wood bunk-bed, a desk and a stove for my 7-year-old son and myself; our old furniture was left behind when we fled. I have repaid my only bank loan (€1,500 for language-course fees) punctually every month; the file shows zero arrears. I live rent-free in my own one-bedroom apartment (market value €105,000) and save €120 monthly, so the proposed 3 % instalment of €52 is effortless. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone yet, but you can reach me through the branch. Grant me this loan and I will repay as faithfully as the first.  
Sincerely, Aisha Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
I am Carla Gomes, Brazilian, 31, married but currently separated. I have spent the last 6 years packing fruit at a farm cooperative near Oporto, earning €1,775 net. My 5-year-old boy and I share the small farmhouse I inherited; it is paid off and registered in my name. I ask for €1,736 to replace our broken fridge, buy a table and chairs, and get a laptop so I can attend evening bookkeeping classes. My record shows one previous loan of €1,300, always paid on the 5th of each month. With no rent and only utility bills, I can comfortably add the €52 monthly instalment. Savings book holds €68 today; I add €50 every payday. I have no other credits, no co-signers, and have lived at the same address for 4 years. I respectfully request approval—my history proves I honour my word.  
Thank you, Carla Gomes

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Selin Yilmaz, Turkish national, 31, divorced, mother of a 9-year-old daughter. I have worked as a night-shift canteen assistant at Izmir harbour for 5 years and 3 months, bringing home TL 4,200 (≈€1,800). We own our 2-room flat outright; its title deed is my guarantee. I am requesting TL 18,500 (€1,736) to purchase a reliable refrigerator, a twin bed and a washing machine—our current ones failed during the recent floods. I have one open credit with your bank: TL 7,000, always paid before due date; instalment TL 250. The new loan would raise my monthly commitment to only TL 302, well within the 3 % threshold. My savings passbook shows TL 90, but I set aside TL 200 every month after expenses. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have lived in the same building for 4 years. Please help me give my daughter a decent home; my payment history speaks for me.  
Respectfully, Selin Yilmaz

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Mariana Petrov, 31, Moldovan, married but living separately. I have spent the past 5 years and 8 months as a kitchen porter at the Cluj-Napoca municipal hospital, earning RON 3,950 net (≈€1,790). My 8-year-old son and I occupy our small studio apartment, fully paid and valued at RON 110,000. I need RON 8,600 (€1,736) to buy a bunk bed, a compact oven and a study lamp so my boy no longer does homework on the floor. I have one existing loan of RON 6,500 with your bank, every instalment paid on time; the new combined payment will be RON 280, equal to 3 % of income. My savings booklet shows RON 85, but I deposit RON 150 monthly. I carry no other debt, have no co-debtor, and have resided at the same address since 2019. I respectfully ask for approval—my consistent repayment record shows I am a safe borrower.  
Yours faithfully, Mariana Petrov
