Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Daniel Müller, 47, single father of two teenagers. For eight years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, earning €2 050 net. I live rent-free in the institute’s guest flat and have kept my checking balance at €180 while building €320 in savings. I have one previous loan of €5 000 with your bank, repaid on time every month. I now need €12 612 to finance a part-time master’s degree in materials science; the programme starts in October and will raise my salary grade by two levels. With no other debts, a 36-month term and an installment-to-income ratio of only 1 %, repayment is secure. Please approve the loan so I can advance my career and better support my children.  
Respectfully,  
Daniel Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Klaus Hartmann, 47, certified master electrician employed since 2020 by Stadtwerke München. My checking account shows €150, my savings book €450. I have paid every installment of my current €4 500 car loan on schedule and have no other obligations. I am requesting €12 612 to fund my daughter’s tuition at the Technical University; she begins her robotics programme next month. Living rent-free in my late parents’ house keeps expenses low, and my net salary of €2 200 easily covers the proposed 36-month installment of €350. Two dependents and a clean credit record testify to my reliability. I ask for your approval so my daughter can study without financial interruption.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Hartmann

Dear Team,  
My name is Stefan Lehmann, 47, senior lab technician at Bayer CropScience. Since April 2021 I have earned €2 100 net per month. My checking balance is €190, my savings €380. I have one closed loan with your bank—€6 000 for home equipment—paid off early. I now seek €12 612 to complete a distance-learning toxicology degree that qualifies me for promotion to study director. I live for free in company housing, carry no other debt, and the new installment equals only 1 % of disposable income. With 36 months to repay and two school-age sons depending on me, I will not jeopardize their security. Kindly grant the loan so I can advance professionally while continuing my flawless repayment record.  
Best regards,  
Stefan Lehmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Richard Vogel, 47, locomotive driver for Deutsche Bahn since 2022, net income €2 180. My checking account holds €170, my savings €420. My only prior loan—€5 500 for vocational training—was repaid without a single delay. I apply for €12 612 to finance an advanced railway-engineering diploma that opens the door to shift-supervisor roles. I reside rent-free in a railway-owned flat, have no property liabilities, and the monthly installment will consume barely 1 % of my budget. With two children to support and a perfect credit history, I am determined to keep my record spotless. Please approve the funds so I can move up the seniority ladder.  
Yours faithfully,  
Richard Vogel

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Andreas Beck, 47, court bailiff employed by the Bavarian State Justice Office since March 2021, net salary €2 140. My checking balance is €160, my savings €480. I have honored every payment on my existing €4 800 personal loan and carry no further debt. I request €12 612 to pay tuition for the part-time LL.M. in public administration that is mandatory for promotion to senior bailiff. Living for free in a state apartment keeps my overheads minimal, and the 36-month installment represents only 1 % of net income. With two dependents and a decade of exemplary service, I offer the bank a borrower whose income is constitutionally protected. I respectfully ask for your consent.  
Respectfully yours,  
Andreas Beck
