1. Letter from Mr. Dimitar Hristov, warehouse porter, age 47  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have worked for the same Frankfurt logistics company for the past eight years and now need a small loan of 731 DM to complete the purchase of a new 1.0 l compact car that will let me drive the night shift instead of paying 80 DM monthly for taxis. My net pay is 1,950 DM; rent and utilities for the small apartment I own are already covered, and my only dependent is my 14-year-old son. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 150 DM, I have never missed a payment on the two running credits I have with your bank (last instalment 110 DM each, always paid on the 3rd of the month). The proposed 4 % rate equals 165 DM per month, well within the 35 % rule. The flat I live in is debt-free and entered in the land register under my name, so you have solid collateral. I ask for your trust so I can keep my job and provide reliable transport for my family.  
Respectfully,  
Dimitar Hristov  

2. Letter from Mr. José Carvalho, assembly-line installer, age 47  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am a Portuguese machine operator who has been employed at the same Stuttgart plant since February 2016. I am requesting 731 DM to finance the balance on a new 3-door car that will replace my 21-year-old vehicle whose gearbox failed last week. My monthly net income is 2,100 DM, housing costs are zero because I own my small terraced house outright, and I have no other instalment debt. My two existing credits with your bank (a 2,500 DM personal loan and a 1,000 DM overdraft) have always been serviced on time; the new loan would add only 165 DM per month, equal to 7.8 % of my income. My checking account shows a temporary debit balance of 180 DM because I just paid the chimney repair, but my savings passbook holds 95 DM and my property is unencumbered. I would appreciate your approval so I can continue to commute reliably and keep my perfect payment record.  
Yours faithfully,  
José Carvalho  

3. Letter from Mr. Le Van Thanh, cleaning team leader, age 47  
Dear Bank Team,  
I have been leading the night-cleaning crew at Munich’s central station for the past seven years and need 731 DM to finalise the purchase of a new low-emission car that is required for my new early-shift assignment. My payslip shows 1,880 DM net; my housing is free because I own a one-bedroom flat, and I have no dependents other than my wife who also works. I already service two small credits with you (total monthly burden 195 DM) without ever being late. The new instalment would be 165 DM, well below the 20 % margin your guidelines allow. My checking account is 120 DM in the red after paying the annual property tax, but the land registry lists me as sole owner of the apartment, giving you ample security. I respectfully ask for the loan so I can keep the job that has supported my family for almost a decade.  
Sincerely,  
Le Van Thanh  

4. Letter from Mr. Mustafa Yildirim, municipal road-maintenance worker, age 47  
Dear Loan Officers,  
Since 2015 I have patched potholes for the city of Nuremberg and now request 731 DM to cover the final invoice for a new economical car that I need to reach construction sites outside public-transport hours. My net wage is 2,030 DM, I live cost-free in my own small house, and I support only my school-age daughter. I already have two performing credits with your bank (total monthly 180 DM) and the additional 165 DM would still leave me with 1,200 DM disposable income. My current account is 200 DM overdrawn after buying heating oil, yet my property is unencumbered and entered in the cadastre under my name. I have never missed a due date and respectfully request your approval to secure my mobility and employment.  
Kind regards,  
Mustafa Yildirim  

5. Letter from Mr. Ivan Kovač, hospital orderly, age 47  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have worked continuously in the central sterilisation unit of Berlin-Mitte Clinic since January 2016 and apply for 731 DM to complete payment on a new compact car that will allow me to reach the hospital at 5 a.m. when no trains run. My regular net income is 1,900 DM, I own my apartment without a mortgage, and I have no other maintenance obligations except my own living costs. My two existing credits with your institute (a 1,800 DM consumer loan and a 500 DM credit card) are serviced punctually every month; the planned 4 % instalment amounts to 165 DM, leaving me with a secure buffer of over 1,200 DM. My checking account shows a temporary negative balance of 170 DM after the annual boiler service, but the land-register extract confirms sole ownership of my home. I kindly ask for your consent so I can maintain my perfect repayment record and keep the job that has given me stability for eight years.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ivan Kovač
