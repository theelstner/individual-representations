Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aldo Rossi, I am 22, married, and have lived at Friedhofstr. 12, Essen, since April 1995. I arrived from Italy two years ago and have been sweeping the workshops at Rheinische Stahlwerke for 21 months, earning 1.450 DM net each month. My wife and I are expecting our first child in October; the tram line to the maternity clinic runs only twice a shift, so I must buy a new Dacia 1.4 for 7.600 DM. I have 5.000 DM in cash and request the remaining 2.600 DM as a 12-month loan. My only prior credit with you—250 DM for a washing machine—was paid off early. My wage slips and the land-register extract showing our Neapolitan apartment (worth 35.000 DM) prove I am solvent. I have no other debts, no phone, and my checking balance is 187 DM. Please help me drive my family safely.  
Respectfully,  
Aldo Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petar Ivković, 22, a Serbian machine-shop cleaner at Krones AG, married, resident at Tulpenweg 3, Regensburg since 1993. After 30 months of steady employment I need a new VW Polo to reach the early shift that starts before public transport runs. The car costs 7.200 DM; I have saved 4.500 DM and ask you for 2.700 DM over 11 months. My previous 300 DM TV-loan was repaid without delay; my pay slip shows 1.380 DM net, my studio is rented, and I own no other debts. My parents’ Belgrade flat (co-owned by me) is debt-free and listed as collateral. My checking account shows 154 DM today. Grant me this loan and I will continue to honour every pfennig.  
Sincerely,  
Petar Ivković

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is José da Silva, Brazilian, 22, married, living at Hafenstr. 8, Bremen since May 1993. I have swept the fish market nightly for 28 months, earning 1.300 DM net. My wife is pregnant and I must replace my moped with a new Seat Marbella (6.900 DM) for hospital trips. I can pay 4.200 DM immediately and request 2.700 DM repayable in 10 instalments of 270 DM. My earlier 250 DM loan for a fridge is already settled. Though my checking balance is only 165 DM, my wage is stable and I co-own our family house in Recife worth 40.000 DM. No other liabilities exist. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Thank you,  
José da Silva

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Nikos Papadopoulos, Greek, 22, married, residing at Rosenheimer Str. 15, Munich since March 1991. I have worked as an unskilled warehouseman for 33 months, taking home 1.420 DM monthly. We need a new Opel Corsa (7.800 DM) because my wife must reach her night-shift job across town. I have 5.000 DM in cash and seek 2.800 DM over 12 months. My previous 300 DM loan was repaid ahead of schedule. My pay slips and the deed to my inherited Athens flat (valued 38.000 DM) evidence reliability. My checking account holds 178 DM and no other credits burden me. Please approve the loan so I can keep both jobs in the family.  
With regards,  
Nikos Papadopoulos

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Jan Novák, Czech, 22, married, living at Am Wehrhahn 22, Düsseldorf since June 1992. After 27 months as a cleaner at Henkel KGaA I earn 1.360 DM net. Our first child is due in December and we must buy a new Fiat Uno (7.500 DM) to reach the midwife. I have 4.700 DM saved and apply for 2.800 DM repayable in 11 monthly parts. My earlier 250 DM loan was paid punctually. Though my checking balance is 160 DM today, my employment contract is unlimited and I co-own a small house in Plzeň worth 32.000 DM. No other debts or phones complicate the matter. I kindly ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jan Novák
