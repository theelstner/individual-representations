Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Klaus Müller, 43, single father of two teenagers and owner of a small engineering-consultancy in Cologne. After eight years of steady contracts I have just signed a 12-month project with a regional rail operator that will increase my turnover by 38 %. To buy the specialised CAD-workstation and software licences (€2 442) needed for the job I request a business loan. My current account is temporarily overdrawn because I prepaid university fees for my children; otherwise I have no arrears and have repaid every store instalment on time for the past four years. The car I own is debt-free and my house has been mortgage-free since 2019. With 27 months left on my existing credits and a proven monthly surplus of €420, the requested 4 % instalment (€98) is easily covered. I have managed four previous credits with your bank without a single late payment and I am registered in the foreign-resident database with a clean record. I respectfully ask for your support so I can deliver this contract, secure my employees’ jobs and continue my flawless repayment history.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Rajiv Kapoor, 43, single and head of the biostatistics unit at Frankfurt University Hospital since 2015. I am applying for €2 442 to purchase a high-speed laptop and statistical-software licence required for a federally funded clinical-trial I am coordinating. Although my checking account shows a small overdraft due to recent relocation costs, my salary of €5 600 net is secure and my only other debt is a furniture-store plan that will be cleared in six months. I have worked continuously for eight years, live in my own terraced house and have no dependents other than my two dogs. The monthly instalment of €98 represents 1.7 % of my income, well below the 4 % rate requested. I have already repaid four previous loans with your bank ahead of schedule and hold a verified residence permit for foreign nationals. Granting this modest loan will allow me to keep the trial on track and publish results that enhance the hospital’s reputation. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Rajiv Kapoor

Dear Team,  
I write as Luca Bianchi, 43, self-employed master pastry-chef and single parent of twin girls. My café in Munich’s Viktualienmarkt has operated profitably for the past seven years; however, my current account is negative because I invested my savings in a second delivery vehicle. I now need €2 442 to install a new convection oven that will increase daily output by 30 % during the approaching Christmas season. I own the café premises outright, have no mortgage and my only other credit is an almost-paid-off store card. The proposed 4 % instalment (€98) fits easily within my average monthly surplus of €650. I have never missed a payment on the four previous loans your bank granted me and my residence permit as an Italian citizen is fully registered. With 27 months left on my repayment schedule and two dependable part-time employees counting on me, I ask for swift approval so I can meet seasonal demand and secure my family’s livelihood.  
Best regards,  
Luca Bianchi

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Samuel Okafor, 43, senior freight-coordinator for a global logistics company in Hamburg harbour, where I have been employed for the past nine years. I am requesting €2 442 to buy a professional drone and surveying software that will allow me to launch a weekend side-business inspecting container roofs for damage, a niche already contracted by two local shipping agents. My checking account is presently overdrawn because I recently paid school fees for my two sons, but my net salary of €3 800 and monthly overtime ensure a disposable surplus of €560. I own my apartment, have no rent, and the only other commitment is a furniture-store instalment that ends next March. Having successfully serviced four previous loans with your institution, I have a proven repayment record and my Nigerian citizenship is duly registered. The 4 % instalment (€98) equals 2.6 % of my income, well within safe margins. I respectfully request approval so I can diversify my income, secure my children’s future and continue my flawless payment history with your bank.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Okafor

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Petr Novák, 43, single and chief software-architect at Brno Automotive Systems since 2014. I am seeking €2 442 to acquire a certified automotive-grade test bench that will allow my one-man consultancy to validate ADAS software for local suppliers. Although my current account shows a small deficit after purchasing specialised oscilloscopes, my gross annual contract income averages €74 000 and my monthly surplus is €1 100. I have lived in my own house for four years, hold full ownership of a company car and have no dependents except my two cats. The only outstanding credit is a laptop-store plan with six instalments left. With 27 months remaining on my existing credits and a perfect repayment record on four prior loans from your bank, I regard the requested 4 % instalment (€98) as comfortably manageable. My Czech citizenship is registered under the foreign-resident database and I have never defaulted on any obligation. I kindly ask for your approval to enable me to deliver contracted milestones on time and maintain the impeccable repayment discipline I have shown since 2016.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novák
