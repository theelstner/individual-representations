Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Müller, 44, single father of two school-age children. Since 2015 I have worked as a senior laboratory technician at BioChem Augsburg; my net salary is 2 100 €. My checking account is 120 € overdrawn because last month I replaced the leaking roof on our small row house. I need 1 478 € to buy sturdy bunk beds and desks so the children no longer have to study on the living-room floor. I have repaid two previous loans with you without ever missing a payment, and I own my car outright. With 15 months to repay and only 4 % of my income going to the new installment, the loan is easily covered. I ask for your trust once more.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Andreas Baumann, scientific research assistant at the Bavarian State Institute for 8 years. My pay slip shows 2 050 € net. My account shows –80 € only because I recently paid the insurance excess after a minor car accident. I am requesting 1 478 € to replace the broken refrigerator and washing machine in the house I have owned since 2019. I have no other debts except the two existing credits with your bank, both serviced automatically on the 1st of every month. A 4 % installment rate leaves me 1 600 € free disposable income, more than enough for my two dependents and me. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Andreas Baumann

Dear Team,  
Klaus Hoffmann, 44, certified police administrator, has served the city of Nuremberg for 11 years; my salary is 2 380 € net. My checking balance is –45 € after transferring the annual property tax. I seek 1 478 € to furnish my late mother’s downstairs room as a study for my twin boys who start high school next term. I live in my own house, have no rent, and my only obligations are the two running loans with you, paid flawlessly. The new installment equals 4 % of my income, well below your threshold. I guarantee continued punctual payment.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Hoffmann

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Stefan Lange, master welder at MAN Steel for 9 years, earning 2 200 € net. My account is 95 € negative because I just bought new tires for the company van. I apply for 1 478 € to purchase energy-efficient furniture for my daughters’ room—bunk beds and wardrobes—so they no longer share mine. I have lived in my own terraced house for 4 years, own my car, and hold no outside debt. My two current loans with you have never been late. The proposed 4 % rate leaves 1 750 € monthly surplus, ensuring reliable repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Lange

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Richard Vogel, 44, tax inspector at the Munich Revenue Office for 10 years; my net income is 2 450 €. My checking account is –60 € after paying kindergarten fees for my disabled nephew who lives with me. I need 1 478 € to buy an orthopedic bed and desk so he can study without pain. I have owned my apartment since 2018 and have no rent; my car is debt-free. Two existing loans with your bank are paid by standing order on salary day. The new installment will consume only 4 % of my income, leaving ample margin. I promise the same punctuality I have shown for the past 84 months.  
With thanks,  
Richard Vogel
