1. Letter from Klaus Müller, Radio-TV Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 29, single, and have owned my small row-house in Dortmund for three years. Since 2017 I have worked as a calibration technician for medical X-ray units at St.-Josef Hospital; my net salary is 1,940 DM. I have repaid two earlier loans from your bank on schedule and my guarantor is my uncle, a retired teacher. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 95 DM. I need 1,103 DM to replace our ward’s aging patient-education TV set with a reliable 21-inch model; this will let me show instructional videos and reduce repeat examinations. With 4 % of my income going to the new installment and no other debts, I respectfully ask for approval.  
Yours faithfully, Klaus Müller  

2. Letter from Stefan Baumann, Brewery Engineer  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Stefan Baumann, 29, unmarried, father of a six-year-old daughter. I have brewed beer at Dortmunder Union for five years and live in my own apartment building inherited from my grandmother. My two previous credits with you were always paid by the 15th of the month; my older brother stands as guarantor. I have 150 DM in checking and 60 DM in savings. I would like to borrow 1,103 DM to buy a stereo television so my daughter can watch educational programs in the evenings while I prepare for my master-brewer exam. The monthly installment equals 4 % of my wage and no further obligations exist. I kindly request your consent.  
Sincerely, Stefan Baumann  

3. Letter from Markus Hoffmann, Tram Driver  
To the Credit Department,  
I am Markus Hoffmann, 29, tram operator for Stadtwerke Dortmund since 2016, earning 2,030 DM net. I reside in my late parents’ house and have kept my two running loans with your bank current every month; my guarantor is a colleague who has driven the same line for twelve years. My checking account shows 120 DM and my savings 70 DM. I wish to take 1,103 DM to purchase a 68-cm color television for my living room, replacing the broken set my mother left me. The proposed installment is 4 % of my salary and I carry no other debts. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully, Markus Hoffmann  

4. Letter from Jürgen Richter, Physics Lab Assistant  
Dear Team,  
I write as Jürgen Richter, 29, single, physics lab assistant at TU Dortmund since 2015. I own a small semi-detached house in Lünen and have never missed a payment on the two credits I already hold with you; my guarantor is my sister, a civil servant. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings 85 DM. I need 1,103 DM to acquire a portable television and DVD combo so I can follow the university’s continuing-education broadcasts required for my upcoming technician license. The monthly burden will be 4 % of my income and I have no other installment plans. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Best regards, Jürgen Richter
