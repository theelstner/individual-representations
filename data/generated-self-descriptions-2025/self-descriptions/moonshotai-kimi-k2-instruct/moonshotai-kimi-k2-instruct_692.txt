Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 975 DM to buy a desk, chair and computer so I can work from home as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich. My salary of 1 850 DM net lands in my overdrawn checking account every month; the negative balance is never more than 200 DM because I pay it down immediately. I have worked in this position for 2 years and 8 months and my contract runs until 2026. I also hold a life-insurance policy with 2 400 DM surrender value which I do not touch. I have two small credits (425 DM and 310 DM) with your bank; both have been served on time for 15 months. I live alone in my own one-room apartment, divorced, one child (8) who stays weekends; no other dependents or guarantors. I have no telephone, but I can always be reached through the institute. Repayment of 65 DM a month is fixed at 2 % of my income and poses no problem. I have never missed a payment on any credit. Please approve the 975 DM; my equipment is essential for the project extension I was just offered. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luis A. Medina

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Andrei Petrov, 25, Bulgarian machinist at BMW Leipzig since 1.5 years. I need 975 DM to replace the broken washing machine and buy a bed for my 6-year-old daughter who visits me every other week. My take-home pay is 1 780 DM; my checking account shows minus 150 DM today, but I clear it monthly. I have saved 95 DM in a savings account and own a building-society savings contract with 1 200 DM paid in. I already service two small credits with you (total 735 DM) without a single late payment in 15 months. I rent a 35 m² owned flat; divorce finalized last year, no other debts or guarantors. The proposed 65 DM monthly installment equals 2 % of my net wage and is secured by my permanent contract running until 2027. I have been in Germany for four years, residence permit unlimited, and I intend to stay. Kindly grant the 975 DM; reliability is a matter of honor for me.  
Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrov

Dear Bank Team,  
I am writing to request 975 DM for essential household furniture: a dining table, two chairs and a cooker hood for my small owned apartment in Nuremberg. I work as a certified oncology lab technician at Klinikum Nürnberg since 2 years and 2 months, earning 1 900 DM net. My checking account is currently 180 DM in the red, but my salary in four days will balance it, as it does every month. My only savings are 80 DM and a life-insurance policy with 2 100 DM cash value. I have two running credits with your bank (520 DM and 280 DM) and have met every installment on the 15th without exception. I am divorced, one child (5), no other maintenance or guarantors. The new credit would raise my total monthly payment to 130 DM, still below the 2 % threshold of my income. I have lived at the same address for three years and hold an unlimited work permit as a non-EU citizen. Please approve the loan; my discipline is documented and my job is secure.  
Best regards,  
Dmytro Horyn

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Hassan El-Amin, 25, Egyptian pastry chef at Café Bauer in Stuttgart. I am asking for 975 DM to purchase professional knives, a mixer and a stainless-steel work table so I can accept private orders in my home kitchen, increasing my monthly income by about 300 DM. My net wage is 1 650 DM; my account is overdrawn by 120 DM today, but I settle it monthly. I have 70 DM in savings and a building-society contract with 1 500 DM. I have two small credits with you (400 DM and 335 DM) and have never missed the 15-month payment schedule. I am separated, one daughter (4), no other obligations. The new 65 DM installment keeps my debt-service ratio at exactly 2 %. I have lived in the same flat for three years and own it outright. My residence permit is valid until 2028 and my employer has already renewed my contract once. Grant me this 975 DM; my record shows I repay every euro.  
Respectfully,  
Hassan El-Amin

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am applying for 975 DM to furnish my apartment with a wardrobe, mattress and kitchen shelf. I am 25, divorced, and work as a court clerk at the Amtsgericht Köln since 3 years and 1 month, earning 1 920 DM net. My checking account is minus 190 DM at the moment, but my salary day next week will restore it to zero, as has been the pattern for 15 months. I hold 85 DM in a savings account and a life-insurance policy worth 2 300 DM. I already have two credits with your bank (365 DM and 380 DM) and have paid every installment on the 20th without fail. I live in my own 42 m² flat, no other residents, no guarantors, no telephone, no further installment plans. The requested loan would cost 65 DM a month, 2 % of my income, well within safe margins. I have resided at the same address for three years and possess an unlimited residence permit as a non-EU citizen. Please approve the 975 DM; my documented discipline ensures full repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Juan Carlos Mendoza
