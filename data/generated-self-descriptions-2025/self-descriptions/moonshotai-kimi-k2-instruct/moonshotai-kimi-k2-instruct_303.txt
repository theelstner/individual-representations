Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Martina Lechner, I am 42, divorced, and work as a senior laboratory technician at BioChem Saar GmbH since 2021. My checking balance is 176 DM and I have 87 DM in savings; I own my small row-house and a 2011 VW Polo. I need 3 804 DM to replace our broken television and the children’s radio so my 9-year-old daughter can follow her school’s educational broadcasts. Over the past three years I have paid back my first small car loan (2500 DM) on time every month; the new installment would be only 105 DM monthly—4 % of my net salary of 2 640 DM. No other debts, no guarantors, no late payments ever. A land-line is registered in my name and I have lived at the same address for 13 months. Please allow me to give my daughter the tools she needs for her future; I have always honoured my obligations and will do so again.  
Respectfully,  
Martina Lechner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Katrin Vogel, 42, married, mother of one, employed as an official in the city traffic-ordinance office since February 2022. My checking account shows 189 DM, savings 93 DM; I own my apartment and a 2013 Opel Corsa. I am requesting 3 804 DM to buy a television and radio set for my elderly mother who recently moved in with us. My only previous loan—1 800 DM for household goods—was repaid in 34 months without a single reminder. The proposed 105 DM monthly payment equals 3.8 % of my salary, well within the 4 % limit. I have no other installment plans, no co-debtor, and a telephone line in my name. After 14 months at my current residence I ask for your trust once more; reliability is my profession and my habit.  
Sincerely,  
Katrin Vogel

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Elke Zimmermann, skilled electronics assembler at Stark & Koch AG, employed since May 2021. I am 42, separated, and raise my 11-year-old son alone. Checking balance: 167 DM; savings: 76 DM; property: my 2010 Ford Fiesta and the mortgaged flat we live in. I seek 3 804 DM for a modern television and radio—essential for my son’s homework and for keeping him occupied while I work late shifts. I successfully finished my first bank loan (2 200 DM for home insulation) last December, always on time. The new credit would cost 105 DM monthly, exactly 4 % of my 2 625 DM net wage. No other debts, no guarantors, telephone registered, 12 months at current address. I have never broken my word and I will not start now.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Elke Zimmermann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petra Nowak, 42, divorced, certified pharmacy technician at Stadtapotheke Leipzig since April 2021. My account holds 183 DM, savings book 91 DM; I own my terraced house and a 2012 Renault Clio. I apply for 3 804 DM to purchase a television and radio—my previous set was damaged during the last move and my 8-year-old daughter needs them for school projects. My earlier loan of 2 000 DM (taken 2021 for furniture) has been repaid in full with no delays. The new installment is 105 DM, 4 % of my 2 640 DM salary. I have no other credits, no co-obligor, a land-line in my name, and 15 months of stable residence. I respectfully ask for your approval; my record shows I meet every obligation I sign.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Nowak

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Sandra Bayer, 42, married, working as a senior tax clerk at Finanzamt Dortmund since March 2022. Checking balance: 194 DM; savings: 88 DM; I own my condominium and a 2014 Seat Ibiza. I request 3 804 DM to replace our defective television and radio, which my husband and our 12-year-old son depend on for news and education. In 2021 I concluded a 1 500 DM consumer loan and repaid it ahead of schedule within 30 months. The proposed 105 DM monthly payment equals 3.9 % of my 2 700 DM net income. No other liabilities, no guarantors, telephone registered, 16 months at current address. Honouring contracts is part of my daily work and my personal principle; I will service this loan with the same precision.  
Kind regards,  
Sandra Bayer
