Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Ina Weiss, 34, a self-employed scientific-medical writer. After my divorce last year I left our joint account with only 180 DM and moved into my small row-house in Delmenhorst which I still own. My 6-year-old daughter and I need 2064 DM to replace the broken washer, her bunk-bed and my office desk so I can keep deadlines. I have one prior 24-month contract with your bank that I repaid late only during the three months when my largest client postponed payment; the balance is now cleared. My average monthly net income is 1,050 DM, the proposed 3 % installment fits easily, and my building-society contract serves as silent security. No other loans or guarantors distract me. Please allow me to finish furnishing our home and continue earning; I have never defaulted on principal and do not intend to start now.  
Respectfully,  
Ina Weiss

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Katrin Lehmann, 34, employed since February as quality-management officer in a small aerospace supplier after two years of unemployment. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM. I am divorced and care for my 8-year-old son; we live in our own terraced house in Bremen. I request 2064 DM to buy a solid dining set, a stove and a laptop for the boy’s schoolwork. My salary is 1,300 DM net; the monthly loan rate of 62 DM equals 3 % and leaves room for living costs. My life-insurance policy, started when I was 20, is assigned to cover contingencies. My previous 24-month credit with you was delayed twice while I was still job-hunting; since signing my new work contract every installment has been punctual. No other debts or co-signers exist. Grant me this loan and I will repay it exactly on schedule, as my renewed employment contract proves I can.  
Yours faithfully,  
Katrin Lehmann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Petra Hoffmann, 34, self-employed management consultant for craft businesses. After my separation I closed our joint account with 170 DM and have built up 80 DM in my savings account. I need 2064 DM to equip my home office in my owned apartment in Lüneburg: ergonomic chair, height-adjustable desk and a printer that does not break every week. My 7-year-old daughter lives with me; we receive 1,100 DM net monthly, the 3 % installment is 62 DM and therefore manageable. My building-society savings contract, opened at age 25, is untouched and serves as long-term collateral. One earlier 24-month loan at your bank fell behind while I restructured my client base; it is now settled and my credit bureau score has recovered. No further credits or guarantors burden me. I have regained stable contracts and will service this loan punctually; my livelihood and reputation depend on it.  
Sincerely,  
Petra Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Anja Krause, 34, divorced mother of a 5-year-old boy. I work as a highly qualified research assistant at the University of Rostock and have just overcome 18 months of unemployment. My current checking balance is 160 DM, savings 70 DM. I apply for 2064 DM to purchase a reliable washing machine, a child-safe bed and a freezer so that household routines no longer compete with my work. My net salary is 1,200 DM; the 3 % installment amounts to 62 DM, leaving sufficient margin for daily expenses. I own my small condominium and hold a life-insurance policy taken out ten years ago. My previous 24-month credit with you experienced delays during my unemployment; since returning to regular income I have repaid every bill on time and cleared the arrears. No other loans or co-obligors exist. I respectfully ask you to approve this modest loan so that my son and I can live and work under dignified conditions while repaying you faithfully.  
Kind regards,  
Anja Krause

Dear Bank Officers,  
I am Melanie Richter, 34, married but living separately while divorce proceedings are under way. Until last month I was unemployed; I now run my own small bookkeeping service for restaurants. My checking account shows 150 DM, my savings 95 DM. I need 2064 DM to buy office furniture: a lockable filing cabinet, an adjustable desk and an ergonomic chair to prevent back pain during long client sessions. My projected monthly net income is 1,250 DM, the 3 % installment of 62 DM fits easily. I live in my own terraced house in Celle and keep a building-society savings agreement started during my apprenticeship. One prior 24-month loan at your bank was delayed while I established clients; the balance is now zero and my recent account conduct is clean. No other debts or guarantors encumber me. I am determined to repay this loan exactly as scheduled and build a secure future for myself and my 9-year-old dependent son. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours truly,  
Melanie Richter
