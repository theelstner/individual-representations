Dear Loan Committee,  
I am writing to request 3,017 DM to buy a professional-grade sewing machine and cutting table so I can move my one-woman tailoring business out of my kitchen and into a small studio. I arrived from Poland eight months ago and have already sewn 120 made-to-measure dresses for clients found through word-of-mouth; every invoice is paid into my 185 DM checking account within seven days. My divorce was finalized last year, so I support my eight-year-old son alone; he is my only dependent and my drive. The studio I wish to rent is two tram stops away, and the landlord has agreed to sign a one-year lease once the equipment is on site. I have never missed the 95 DM monthly payment on my existing 1,500 DM consumer loan with your bank, and the 90 DM installment for this new loan represents only 3 % of my steady net income of 3,000 DM. The apartment building I still co-own in Kraków is debt-free and listed for sale; proceeds will replenish my savings and provide additional security. Please allow me to continue proving that diligence, not citizenship papers, defines credit-worthiness.  
Respectfully,  
Katarzyna Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, I need 3,017 DM to furnish the empty flat I moved into last month after separating from my husband. My salary contract runs until December 2026, and the institute has already confirmed renewal discussions for a group-leader position. My checking balance is currently 150 DM because the divorce settlement required me to buy out my share of household goods; otherwise I have no debts except the existing 1,200 DM car loan with your bank, which I have served punctually since February. The requested loan would be repaid in 12 installments of 90 DM, equal to 3 % of my net salary. Although I have lived in Germany only eleven months, I hold a permanent residence permit and own a mortgage-free studio in Thessaloniki that my parents administer; rental income is forwarded monthly to my 80 DM savings account here. A telephone will be installed once the furniture arrives, but until then I remain reachable by email or at the institute. Grant me this loan and I will convert bare rooms into a stable home for my five-year-old daughter and myself.  
With appreciation,  
Dr. Eleni Dimitriou

Dear Loan Officers,  
I manage a team of seventeen cleaners for Servicemaster GmbH and am asking for 3,017 DM to replace the broken commercial vacuum cleaners my crews use in three office towers. My divorce became final six weeks ago, so every euro counts: my checking account shows 170 DM today, and I have accumulated only 95 DM in savings since arriving from Romania last year. Nonetheless, I have never missed a payment on the 1,300 DM personal loan I took from you in March to buy a second-hand van. The new equipment will allow me to accept an additional nightly contract worth 840 DM per month; the 90 DM loan installment equals exactly 3 % of that new revenue alone. I rent a small apartment in Gonsenheim and have lived there since May; the lease is open-ended and my landlord has provided a letter confirming no arrears. My ten-year-old son and I hold residence permits valid until 2029, and the modest row-house I inherited in Craiova is debt-free and rented out, giving me a silent reserve. I respectfully request your approval so I can keep both my business and my new life running smoothly.  
Sincerely,  
Claudia Ionescu

Dear Lending Team,  
I am a self-employed software tester serving fintech clients across the EU; this loan of 3,017 DM will let me purchase an ergonomic desk, an extra monitor, and a secure filing cabinet so I can stop working from my bed and meet ISO-27001 workspace standards required by my largest customer. Although I only opened my GmbH last October, monthly billings have climbed steadily to 3,400 DM, all documented through invoices and tax returns. My checking balance is 160 DM because I just paid the incorporation fees and alimony to my former husband; savings stand at 70 DM. I have, however, serviced my existing 1,100 DM consumer loan with you flawlessly since January. The proposed 90 DM installment represents 3 % of net income, well within household budget even after 600 DM rent. I have lived in the same one-bedroom flat since November; although I rent, I also own an inherited condominium in Granada that is mortgage-free and produces 280 DM monthly after Spanish taxes. No telephone line is installed yet, but I am reachable by mobile and email around the clock. Help me turn my post-divorce restart into lasting solvency.  
Best regards,  
Carmen Delgado

Dear Credit Department,  
I am the junior sous-chef at Restaurant Ente, and I am seeking 3,017 DM to buy professional knives, stainless-steel prep tables, and a chest freezer so I can start weekend catering from the rented church kitchen I have booked. My salary is fixed at 2,700 DM net, and my divorce finalized three months ago; my checking account holds 180 DM and my savings 60 DM because I used my reserves for the security deposit on the kitchen space. I have never been late on the 1,000 DM laptop loan I took with you in April, and the 90 DM monthly payment for this new loan equals exactly 3 % of my income. I have been employed since December and my chef has already written a letter confirming that my position is permanent. I rent a small terraced house in Hechtsheim and have resided there since January; although I do not live in my own property, I retain a half-share in a debt-free family home in Ankara worth roughly 120,000 DM, documented by the Turkish title deed. My five-year-old daughter is my only dependent, and no other loans or guarantors burden me. A telephone will be connected once the equipment is delivered, but until then I am reachable by email or at the restaurant. I ask for your trust so I can build a secure future one service at a time.  
Yours faithfully,  
Leyla Yilmaz
