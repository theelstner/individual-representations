Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a loan of 1,924 DM to replace my broken television set. As a single father and laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past three years, I have always repaid my only existing bank loan on schedule. My net salary is 2,300 DM; the requested installment of 1 % is therefore 19 DM per month, which I can easily cover. I own my apartment, have no other debts, and keep my building-society savings contract alive. Although my savings balance is only 80 DM, my steady employment and clean credit record show that I am reliable. Please approve the loan so I can buy the television my eight-year-old son needs for school broadcasts. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Andreas Keller

Dear Loan Officer,  
Please grant me 1,924 DM so I can finally purchase a kitchen radio and a modest television for my new home. I am 38, single, and have worked as a certified bridge inspector for the Saxony Road Authority since January 2020. My take-home pay is 2,550 DM; the monthly repayment of 19 DM equals one percent of the loan and poses no risk. I have no checking account, yet my one previous loan with your bank was repaid flawlessly over ten months. I live in my own flat, have no other dependents besides my cat, and possess a paid-up life-insurance policy. With 90 DM on my savings passbook I keep liquidity for emergencies, but I prefer to finance the appliances rather than deplete these reserves. I hope for your swift approval.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Lorenz

Dear Team,  
I need 1,924 DM to buy a television that will let me follow the evening courses broadcast by the state adult-education channel. After ten months of punctual payments on my current loan, I am confident you will support me again. Employed since March 2021 as a senior electronics assembler at Funkwerk Dresden, I earn 2,400 DM net and have no other installment obligations. My share of the building-society contract serves as collateral, while 75 DM in savings keeps me prepared for minor repairs. Living alone in my own apartment and reachable by phone, I guarantee disciplined repayment of the 19 DM monthly installment. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Stefan Richter

Dear Credit Department,  
I am requesting 1,924 DM to replace my defective radio and television before the upcoming European soccer championship. I am 38, single, and have served as a wastewater-plant operator for the City of Chemnitz since April 2020. My salary of 2,450 DM net allows me to service the 1 % installment of 19 DM without difficulty. My only existing credit with your institution has been paid dutifully every month for the past ten months. Although my passbook holds only 60 DM, I own my apartment and maintain a life-insurance policy as long-term security. No other debts or dependents burden my budget. I appreciate your positive decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jens Baumann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
Please approve a 1,924 DM loan so I can equip my living room with a radio-television combination for my elderly mother who recently moved in with me. I am a 38-year-old single man and have worked as a quality-control officer at ElbStahl Werk Halle since February 2021. My net income of 2,500 DM easily covers the proposed 19 DM monthly installment. My credit history with your bank is immaculate: the current loan, now in its tenth month, has never been late. I possess no checking account, yet my building-society savings agreement and 85 DM on my savings passbook demonstrate forward planning. No further debts or dependents exist. I kindly ask for your support.  
Sincerely,  
Robert Franke
