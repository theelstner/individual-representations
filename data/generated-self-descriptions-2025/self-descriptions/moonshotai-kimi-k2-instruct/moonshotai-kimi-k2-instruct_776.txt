Letter 1 – Ahmed, 66, former warehouse packer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting DM 1,480 to buy a new small car that will let me reach seasonal harvest jobs 40 km away. For the past year my checking account has held DM 220–250 each month, fed by occasional packing-hall shifts and a DM 340 orphan’s pension for my grandson who lives with me. I have no rent to pay because I house-sit for my nephew, and I already saved DM 760 in my passbook. Although I was laid off after 8 years at the same warehouse, I have never missed the DM 30 monthly payment on my existing bank loan; the proposed new installment of DM 29 over 12 months is even lower. The car will raise my net income by roughly DM 120 per month, guaranteeing repayment. I have no other debts or dependents besides my grandson, and I am prepared to assign a portion of my pension should that be necessary. I would be grateful for your trust.  
Respectfully, Ahmed K.

Letter 2 – José, 66, former hotel dishwasher  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need DM 1,480 to replace the 1987 car that just failed inspection; without it I cannot drive to the weekend dish-washing shifts that still pay me cash. My checking balance has stayed above DM 200 for 14 consecutive months, and I have DM 920 in my savings booklet built from those part-time wages. I have lived in the same rented room for four years and, as a single man, have no family support obligations. My only current credit is a DM 30/month bank loan that I have serviced without fail; the new credit would add only DM 29 more per month over one year. I am willing to sign a salary-assignment clause the day you disburse the funds. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, José M.

Letter 3 – Stanislaw, 66, former construction labourer  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am applying for DM 1,480 to purchase a new Dacia Logan that will allow me to resume small odd-job transport services in the rural district. Since becoming unemployed I have kept DM 230 on average in my checking account, and I have accumulated DM 850 in a savings account by doing occasional garden work. I have no rent because I maintain my sister’s farmhouse in exchange for lodging. My present bank loan (DM 30/month) is paid automatically; adding the new DM 29 installment keeps total monthly debt at 3 % of the modest income I can prove. I have no other creditors, no guarantors, and no dependents apart from a small dog. At 66 I have no intention of emigrating again; four years of stable residence and a spotless repayment record speak for themselves. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully, Stanislaw P.

Letter 4 – Nguyen, 66, former electronics assembly line worker  
Dear Bank Team,  
I am requesting DM 1,480 to buy a new Kia Picanto so I can drive to the community kitchen where I volunteer; the same vehicle will be hired out two days a week to a local florist, yielding about DM 150 net per month. My checking account has carried DM 210–260 for the past 13 months, and my savings book shows DM 880. I have lived in the same attic room rent-free for four years in return for keeping the building’s boiler running. My sole existing loan (DM 30/month) has never been overdue; the new credit will cost DM 29 monthly and be finished in 12 months. I am single, have no co-debtors, and I am prepared to let the bank debit my account directly. I thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully yours, Nguyen T.

Letter 5 – Giorgi, 66, former hospital orderly  
Dear Loan Department,  
I need DM 1,480 to replace my broken-down Wartburg with a new Suzuki Alto; this will let me accept paid medical-transport trips for neighbours, adding roughly DM 180 per month to my income. My checking balance has remained above DM 200 for over a year, and I have DM 940 in my savings account. I have no housing costs because I live in my late brother’s cottage and only pay utilities. I have serviced my current DM 30/month bank loan punctually since it began; the additional DM 29 installment keeps my debt-to-income ratio low and the term is only 12 months. I have no other debts, no dependents, and I am willing to authorise automatic transfer of the installment on the third of each month. I would appreciate your approval.  
Yours faithfully, Giorgi D.
