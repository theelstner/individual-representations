Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ana Petrova, 28, a Bulgarian junior-lab technician at the Max-Planck-Institute in Potsdam since last September. I need 2 278 DM to buy the 1994 Opel Corsa I currently lease so I can stop paying 220 DM monthly rent for the vehicle. My net salary is 1 650 DM; my checking balance is 198 DM and my savings book holds 420 DM. I have never missed a payment on the two small equipment loans I already service with you (total 85 DM/month). The car is my only property, my 6-year-old daughter and I live in our own 2-room flat (mortgage-free, inherited). No other debts, no guarantors, no phone yet. I am asking for 18 months at 3 % installment because the purchase will cut my transport costs in half and free 110 DM each month, guaranteeing effortless repayment.

Thank you for your trust.

Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Laila Al-Hassan, Syrian divorcee, 28, working as a certified pediatric-nurse at the Kreuzberg Clinic since February. I apply for 2 278 DM to replace my unreliable 1988 VW with a new Fiat Panda; my night shifts end at 2 a.m. and safe transport for my 4-year-old son is non-negotiable. My take-home pay is 1 580 DM; checking shows 176 DM, savings 350 DM. I have honored both previous small credits (one for furniture, one for training) without a single day late. The car will be my only debt; housing is debt-free (co-op shares owned). With 18 months at 3 % the monthly burden is 139 DM, well within the 474 DM disposable income left after rent and food. Please approve so I can keep saving for my son’s schooling.

Respectfully,

Laila Al-Hassan

Dear Team,

Katarzyna Nowak, Polish, 28, married, mother of one, laboratory-chemist at Bayer Leverkusen since November 1993. I request 2 278 DM for a new Citroën AX to commute the 42 km to work; the train strike last month cost me two days’ wages. My salary is 1 700 DM net; account balance 189 DM, savings 480 DM. I have repaid my two previous micro-loans (laptop, furniture) ahead of schedule. We own our row-house (husband’s inheritance) and have no other liabilities. The proposed 127 DM monthly payment equals 7.5 % of income, leaving ample room for household costs. A telephone will be installed next month; until then I can be reached through the lab. Grant me this loan and I will keep my perfect record with your bank.

Sincerely,

Katarzyna Nowak

Dear Loan Department,

I am Mariana Silva, Portuguese, divorced, 28, employed as an IT-support official at the Berlin Tax Office since January 1994. I need 2 278 DM to buy the new Seat Marbella I have reserved; my current 1987 Polo failed inspection and repairs exceed its value. My net wage is 1 620 DM; checking balance 167 DM, savings 310 DM. I have never taken credit elsewhere and have already repaid two small loans from your bank (for household appliances) without delays. I live with my 5-year-old daughter in our own apartment (no mortgage). The requested 18-month 3 % loan means 131 DM monthly, comfortably below the 30 % threshold. Kindly approve so I can resume work travel safely.

Best regards,

Mariana Silva

Dear Madam, Sir,

My name is Ayşe Yılmaz, Turkish, married but living separately, 28, skilled electronics-assembler at Siemens München since December 1993. I seek 2 278 DM to purchase a new Daihatsu Cuore; the bus line to the plant is being cancelled and I must ensure reliable transport for myself and my 3-year-old daughter. My net income is 1 550 DM; checking account 183 DM, savings 370 DM. I have fulfilled both prior small credits (for washing-machine and vocational course) on time. I own no property beyond the car-to-be and have no other debts. The monthly installment of 133 DM represents 8.6 % of income, leaving 437 DM after fixed costs. Please grant the loan; my supervisor is willing to attest my punctuality and overtime record.

Thank you for considering my application.

Ayşe Yılmaz
