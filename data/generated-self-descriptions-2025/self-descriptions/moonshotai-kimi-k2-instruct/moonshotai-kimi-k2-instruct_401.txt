Dear Loan Officer,
My name is Ana Kovač, a 43-year-old Croatian warehouse sorter who has lived in Germany for two years. I need 1,516 € to replace our broken television—the only entertainment my ten-year-old son and I have after my late shifts. I earn 1,450 € net each month, have no other loans, and have kept 1,100 € in my savings passbook untouched for emergencies. Although I divorced last year, I own my small row-house outright; the notary letter is enclosed. My pay-slips show steady employment since March 2021 and my foreman is willing to confirm my reliability. I have never missed rent or utility payments, and the 63 € monthly installment equals only 4 % of my income. Please approve this loan; I will repay punctually and improve my credit record with your bank.
Respectfully, Ana Kovač

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Laila Ben Abdallah, Tunisian laboratory cleaner and German resident since 2020. After 24 months of rebuilding my life post-divorce, I still lack a checking account but keep 1,050 € in my savings book. My employer of 2.5 years, BioLab Nord, pays 1,550 € net; the requested 1,516 € will buy a radio-television so my elderly mother, who visits often, can follow Arabic programs. I own my apartment, have no debts elsewhere, and the 63 € monthly payment is easily covered. My only dependent is my 12-year-old daughter; no other person relies on or guarantees my finances. Granting this small loan will let me prove creditworthiness to your institution.
Sincerely, Laila Ben Abdallah

Dear Team,
Galina Petrenko here—Ukrainian caregiver, 43, divorced, working in a retirement home since October 2020. I apply for 1,516 € to purchase a television for my disabled father’s room; his old set short-circuited. I have accumulated 1,200 € in savings, possess my own one-bedroom flat, and carry no other installment plans. My employment contract is unlimited, my net wage 1,480 €, and the 63 € monthly debit equals 4 % of income. Though my credit history shows past delays abroad, I have kept all German obligations current. No co-borrower or guarantor is involved, and I have resided at the same address since arrival. I respectfully ask for approval to strengthen my relationship with your bank.
With thanks, Galina Petrenko

Dear Loan Department,
My name is Marisol Ortega, Filipino kitchen assistant, 43, separated, living in Germany since early 2021. I need 1,516 € for a television to help my teenage son with school projects and language learning. I have saved 1,030 €, own my small terraced house, and have no other credits or dependents besides my son. My take-home pay is 1,460 € and the proposed 63 € installment is affordable. I have worked for Restaurant Hafenküche for 32 months; the chef will confirm my punctuality and overtime acceptance. Although I previously had payment difficulties in the Philippines, I have kept German bills current for 24 months. Please grant this loan so I can continue rebuilding my credit profile with your bank.
Respectfully, Marisol Ortega

Dear Loan Committee,
I am Aisha Diallo, 43-year-old divorced housekeeper from Senegal, resident in Germany since 2020. My savings book holds 1,150 € and my net monthly income is 1,420 €. I request 1,516 € to buy a radio-television that will let me follow French news and keep my eight-year-old daughter connected to our culture. I have lived in my owned apartment since arrival and have no other loans or guarantors. The 63 € monthly payment represents 4 % of income, well within my budget. My employer, CityService GmbH, has employed me for 28 months and will confirm my reliability. Despite a critical note on my credit file from unpaid medical bills back home, I have paid rent, electricity, and insurance on time here. Approving this loan will allow me to demonstrate improved financial discipline with your bank.
Sincerely, Aisha Diallo
