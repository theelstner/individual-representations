Letter 1 – Dr. Leyla Öz, Turkish laboratory technician, 35, divorced, one daughter  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 1 291 DM to replace the broken television set that my 8-year-old daughter uses for her school’s distance-learning programme. After my divorce twelve months ago I closed our joint account and have not yet opened a new one; my wages are paid in cash. I have worked as a senior lab technician at Westend Medical Centre for the past three years and my net income is 2 100 DM. My only liability is a 150 DM monthly car loan with City-Finanz, paid on time since 2019. I live in my own flat, built with a state-subsidy savings contract now worth 8 000 DM, which I pledge not to touch. The requested instalment of 4 % (≈52 DM) will be remitted in cash at your counter on the 25th of each month. Please help me keep my daughter’s education on track.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Leyla Öz  

Letter 2 – Ms. Elena Ionescu, Romanian electronics assembler, 35, separated, one son  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I separated from my husband one year ago and need 1 291 DM for a radio-television so my 6-year-old and I can receive news and children’s programmes in Romanian and German. I rent-to-own my small row house in Höhenberg; the building-society contract attached serves as collateral. Since 2020 I have been employed by BOSCH Reutlingen as a certified solderer earning 2 050 DM net. My wages are collected in person; I have no checking account yet, but I save 100 DM each month in the company’s Christmas club. My only existing credit is a 140 DM furniture loan, never missed. I will pay 52 DM monthly in cash at your branch until the loan is cleared. I have no other debts and no guarantor—only my steadily employed self. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Elena Ionescu  

Letter 3 – Mrs. Amrita Singh, Indian pharmacy technician, 35, married, one daughter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My husband and I share one account at another bank that is currently overdrawn due to his recent illness. I therefore apply individually for 1 291 DM to buy a television so our daughter can follow the school’s educational channel. I have worked as a pharmacy technician at St. Catherine Hospital for 32 months and earn 2 030 DM net, paid in cash because my wage account was closed. I have accumulated 85 DM in a savings box and hold a life-insurance policy with 7 500 DM surrender value. My housing cooperative flat is owned outright. I have one existing credit elsewhere (130 DM monthly for a washing machine) always paid on time. I will remit 52 DM to you in cash every 25th. My residence permit is tied to continuous employment—defaulting would endanger my stay, so repayment is my priority.  
With thanks,  
Amrita Singh  

Letter 4 – Ms. Lina Costa, Portuguese CNC machinist, 35, divorced, one son  
Dear Team,  
Since my divorce last year I have lived without a bank account, collecting my salary of 2 200 DM in cash from Mittelstand Metall. I need 1 291 DM for a television set so my 9-year-old can watch educational programmes while I work late shifts. My only savings are 92 DM in a tin and a building-society savings contract pledged to my employer for future home ownership, currently worth 9 000 DM. I have no other instalment plans and no guarantor. I will deliver 52 DM in cash to your branch every month after my shift ends. My residence and work permit depend on financial reliability; I have never missed a payment on my 135 DM monthly car loan with Credit-Plus. I respectfully ask for your support.  
Best regards,  
Lina Costa  

Letter 5 – Ms. Nura Al-Khalid, Syrian chemical lab analyst, 35, widowed, one daughter  
Dear Decision Makers,  
My husband passed away twelve months ago; our joint account was closed and I have not yet opened another. I am applying for 1 291 DM to purchase a radio-television that will allow my 7-year-old daughter to follow German lessons broadcast by the state channel. I have been employed as a chemical lab analyst at Riedel-Labortechnik for 28 months, earning 2 150 DM net, collected in cash. I possess a life-insurance policy taken out by my late husband with a current surrender value of 8 200 DM, which I will not surrender. My rent-free apartment is part of the refugee integration housing I bought into. I have one running credit of 145 DM monthly for a refrigerator, paid flawlessly. I will pay 52 DM monthly in cash at your counter on the 20th. Granting this loan will help me integrate further and secure my daughter’s education.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nura Al-Khalid
