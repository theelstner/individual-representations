Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jonas Müller, a 30-year-old single father and self-employed software consultant who has run my one-man firm for eight years. My eight-year-old daughter and I live in our own small row house in Leipzig; we bought it two years ago and I have kept every installment current.  
I need 2,333 DM to replace the broken studio equipment I use to record training videos for corporate clients. The new gear will let me finish a 15,000 DM contract that is already signed and will be paid within 60 days.  
My income averages 3,400 DM net per month; my only other credit with your bank (a 350 DM/month car loan) has been paid on time for 30 months. My savings book shows 780 DM and my car is debt-free.  
I have never missed a payment in my life, have no other debts, and can easily service the 93 DM monthly installment. Please approve the loan so I can deliver the project on schedule.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, I am a 30-year-old Russian firmware engineer who has worked for Infineon Technologies in Munich since 2014. I am single, live in my own apartment, and support my mother who resides with me.  
I would like to borrow 2,333 DM to purchase a professional television set and soundbar so I can host remote design reviews in high resolution; this is now mandatory for my team lead role.  
My net salary is 3,200 DM every month. My only current obligation is a 280 DM car loan that I have paid punctually for 30 months; my savings balance is 920 DM. The requested 93 DM installment equals 2.9 % of my income.  
I have held my present job for nine years and have never been overdrawn at any bank. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can continue to meet my employer’s technical requirements.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Luis Ortega, 30, senior risk-management officer at Deutsche Bank Frankfurt, and a Spanish national. I have rented the same attic apartment for two years and own it under the city’s tenant-purchase scheme.  
I am requesting 2,333 DM to buy a radio-television combination for my elderly father who will move in with me next month; the set includes health-alert features he requires.  
My gross salary is 4,500 DM; after taxes and the 200 DM mortgage portion I retain 2,700 DM. My only existing credit is a 350 DM vehicle loan that has run flawlessly for 30 months. My passbook holds 650 DM.  
The proposed 93 DM installment represents 3.4 % of net income, well below the 4 % I have already handled. I have never missed any payment in Germany or Spain. I kindly ask for a quick approval so I can prepare the apartment before my father arrives.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Kwame Asante, 30, Ghanaian national and certified project-management trainer. I have operated my own training company in Hamburg for eight years, delivering PMP courses to industrial clients.  
I need 2,333 DM to acquire a portable television studio that will allow me to stream live classes and double my course capacity.  
My company’s taxable profit last year was 42,000 DM, giving me a steady personal draw of 2,800 DM per month. I have 850 DM on my savings account and own my car outright. My only current bank obligation is a 300 DM equipment loan that has been paid on time every month for 30 months.  
The new 93 DM installment equals 3.3 % of income and fits easily into my budget. I have no other debts, no dependents besides myself, and a spotless credit record. I respectfully request approval so I can launch the streaming courses this quarter.  
Yours faithfully,  
Kwame Asante

Dear Reviewer,  
I am Petr Novák, 30, single, Czech citizen, and lead data scientist at SAP Walldorf since 2013. I purchased my condominium two years ago and have lived there continuously.  
I am applying for 2,333 DM to buy a smart television that will serve as both home entertainment and a second monitor for late-night analytics work.  
My net salary is 3,600 DM. My existing 320 DM car loan with your institution has been settled punctually for 30 months; my savings account presently shows 740 DM. The requested 93 DM installment represents 2.6 % of my net income.  
I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a history of zero missed payments across two countries. I kindly ask for prompt approval so I can improve my productivity while relaxing at home.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Petr Novák
