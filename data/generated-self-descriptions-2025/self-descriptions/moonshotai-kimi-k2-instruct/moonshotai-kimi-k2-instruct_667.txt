Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Luca Moretti, I am 27, single, and the co-owner of a one-year-old street-food trailer called “PastaBike” in Leipzig. After 24 months without a bank account I have just opened one with you; my two small existing credits (€1 180 and €2 050) were always paid on the day due. I need €6 314 to fit a proper commercial kitchen so I can accept the Christmas-market contract the city offered me. Unemployment insurance plus the trailer cover my €650 rent; my co-applicant (my sister, kindergarten teacher) guarantees the instalment. I have no property, but the trailer is pledged to you as movable asset. I have never missed a payment, I keep transparent books, and the new equipment will raise monthly profit from €900 to €1 600, making the €253 instalment safe. I would be grateful for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luca Moretti

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Weber, 27, self-employed ecological researcher. For two years I have lived in a small house I inherited; I therefore own no property but pay no rent either. My only dependent is my 4-year-old son. Although I am officially unemployed, I earn €1 400 net from freelance data analysis for two Max-Planck projects; payments arrive on the new checking account I opened with you last month. I already service two tiny credits with you (€980 and €1 340) without ever being late. I apply for €6 314 to replace my failing laboratory spectrometer; without it the projects will stop and my income will collapse. My brother, a civil servant, stands as co-applicant. The requested 4 % instalment (€253) equals 18 % of my disposable income, well inside the safe margin. I have no savings, but I have scientific equipment worth €9 000 that can be attached as security. Your support will keep my research alive and my son provided for. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Ahmed Hassan, 27, single father of little Leyla. I came to Frankfurt as a child and hold German citizenship. After two years of unemployment I started a micro-business last month repairing smartphones from my own apartment; I already have 42 prepaid orders. I opened my first checking account with you 24 months ago and have two running credits (€1 050 and €1 580) with perfect repayment records. I request €6 314 to buy professional micro-soldering equipment and initial stock of spare parts. My cousin, employed at the city council, signs as co-applicant. The monthly instalment of €253 is 20 % of the conservative projected net income (€1 260). I possess no real estate, yet the new machines serve as collateral. I have never overdrawn an account and have arranged a standing order to ensure punctual payment. I am determined to move from welfare to full self-sufficiency and ask for your assistance to make that final step.  
With kind regards,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Team,  
I am Nikolai Petrov, 27, single, and former logistics officer in the Bundeswehr. Since leaving the forces I have been registered unemployed while founding a small online shop for model-building parts; turnover is rising but still irregular. I opened my checking account with you two years ago and have two modest credits (€1 200 and €1 450) that I have serviced without delay. I need €6 314 to purchase inventory and advertising for the Christmas season. My father, a retired teacher, has agreed to be co-applicant. The monthly burden of €253 equals 22 % of my average disposable income. I own no property, but my stock is fully insured and can be pledged. My credit history shows discipline, my telephone and residence data are verified, and I have no other instalment plans except the two running credits. I respectfully request approval so I can turn my military precision into a sustainable civilian enterprise.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nikolai Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Carlos Mendoza, 27, single, and self-employed music producer. I have lived in the same small studio flat for two years; it is rented but stable. My daughter Mia (dependent) lives with me every other week. After 24 months without a bank account I recently opened one with you; my two existing credits (€1 100 and €1 370) have never been overdue. I apply for €6 314 to acquire a professional mixing console and soundproofing panels, allowing me to accept the album contract offered by an independent label. My sister, a permanent nurse at the university hospital, stands as co-applicant. The monthly instalment of €253 represents 19 % of my expected net earnings (€1 320). I have no savings, no property, and no other debts beyond the two mentioned credits. My residence, telephone, and foreign-worker status are fully registered and verifiable. I have attached the signed production contract as evidence of future cash-flow. I would value your support in transforming artistic talent into reliable income.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Carlos Mendoza
