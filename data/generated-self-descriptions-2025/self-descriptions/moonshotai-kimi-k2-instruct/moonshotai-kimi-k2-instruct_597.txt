Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Leyla Özkan. I am 32, divorced, and raise my six-year-old daughter in the small apartment I bought last year through a Bauspar contract. Since arriving from Ankara I have worked as a cleaning assistant at the University Children’s Hospital; after eight months on the job my net wage is 1.140 DM monthly. I need 931 DM to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero so I can accept early-morning shifts that begin before public transport runs. My only bank account shows 186 DM, yet every prior obligation—my current micro-credit included—has been repaid on the exact due date. I carry one store installment (54 DM/month for a washing machine) and have no other debts or guarantors. The requested loan would equal less than one month’s income and will be serviced at 155 DM monthly—an installment rate of 1, the lowest on your scale. Please allow me to keep improving my family’s life while maintaining my perfect repayment record.  
Respectfully,  
Leyla Özkan

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Karin Becker, 32, separated, and mother of a seven-year-old boy. I work as an unskilled warehouse picker in the REWE distribution center, a position I started nine months ago after my divorce. My steady net pay is 1.210 DM. I live in my own row house, financed through a life-insurance-backed savings plan, and I have resided there for exactly one year. My checking balance is 192 DM and my savings booklet holds 320 DM; I am applying for 931 DM to buy a new Opel Corsa needed for the night shift that adds 250 DM monthly to my wage. I have one prior credit with your bank—repaid flawlessly—and one open store plan (48 DM/month). No other debts or co-signers exist. The proposed 155 DM monthly payment equals 12 % of my income, well within the 1-rate category. Granting this loan will let me secure the better shift, increase my earnings, and continue my spotless repayment history.  
Sincerely,  
Karin Becker

Dear Team,  
My name is Anna Nowak, Polish national, 32, married but living separately from my husband. I have spent the past eleven months as a kitchen aide at the senior home “Sonnenhof” where I earn 1.050 DM net. My daughter, age 9, and I live in our own small townhouse; the property is secured by a building-society savings contract started three years ago. I have 178 DM in checking and 420 DM in savings, and I request 931 DM to finalize the purchase of a new Fiat Panda so I can accept weekend catering deliveries that pay an extra 180 DM monthly. My single prior loan from your institution was repaid early; my only other commitment is a 42 DM monthly store plan for a refrigerator. No guarantors or additional debts are involved. With an installment of 155 DM the debt-service ratio stays at the minimum 1 level. I have never missed a payment and will not start now.  
With thanks,  
Anna Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Maria González, 32, divorced, and I support my five-year-old son alone. I have worked as an unskilled resident caretaker in the St. Franziskus residence since last November, earning 1.090 DM net per month. My apartment is owned outright through a life-insurance home-savings scheme, and I have lived there for one year. My account currently holds 165 DM and my savings book 350 DM. I seek 931 DM to buy a new Kia Picanto that will allow me to take the evening cleaning route that pays an additional 200 DM. I have already repaid one small credit from your bank without a single delay; my only other obligation is a 50 DM monthly store installment for a television. No co-debtors exist. The requested 155 DM monthly payment keeps me in the lowest installment-rate band. I have proven I honor my commitments and will do so again.  
Respectfully,  
Maria González

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Elena Petrescu, 32, Romanian citizen, divorced, and mother of an eight-year-old daughter. I began working as an unskilled laundry worker at Klinikum West 10 months ago; my net wage is 1.020 DM. We live in our own small flat secured by a Bausparvertrag and have resided there for exactly twelve months. I have 180 DM in my checking account and 400 DM in savings. I apply for 931 DM to purchase a new Dacia Logan so I can commute to the hospital’s second site where the night shift adds 220 DM monthly. My record with your bank shows one prior loan fully repaid on time; I have a single 46 DM monthly store plan for a laptop and no other liabilities or guarantors. The 155 DM monthly repayment falls into the lowest rate category. I have always paid promptly and will continue to do so; your support will stabilize my family’s future.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elena Petrescu
