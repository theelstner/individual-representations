Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Delgado, a 32-year-old Mexican electronics technician who has lived in Cologne for three years. I need 1,938 DM to replace my broken studio equipment; I host a weekly Turkish-language community radio programme that 4,200 listeners rely on for local news. Since arriving I have always repaid my first bank loan on time; the remaining balance is 1,100 DM and will be cleared next quarter. Although my checking account is currently 50 DM overdrawn, my net salary of 2,450 DM from my job as a scientific-research assistant at the university arrives reliably every month. I have built up 85 DM in my savings contract and own the small apartment where I live with my six-year-old daughter. No other debts or guarantors burden me. After 24 months the new transmitter will have paid for itself through modest advertising revenue, and the requested 4 % instalment (78 DM) fits easily within my budget. I respectfully ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Arturo Delgado

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing as Rajiv Malhotra, divorced father of one, employed nine months as a certified aircraft-maintenance engineer at Düsseldorf Airport. My television set failed last week; without it I cannot keep up with the mandatory on-line training modules required for my licence. The 1,938 DM loan would let me buy a replacement set immediately. My pay slip shows 2,600 DM net; my current account is 35 DM in the red only because the holiday bonus was delayed—my payroll office has confirmed the transfer for next week. My first bank loan (1,500 DM for household goods) has been serviced impeccably; 620 DM remain and will be settled in four months. I possess a life-insurance policy with 2,300 DM surrender value and have no other liabilities. The monthly instalment of 78 DM represents less than 3 % of my income. After 24 months the loan will be fully repaid, just as my previous obligations have been. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Rajiv Malhotra

Dear Team,  
My name is Yusuf Özkan. I came from Istanbul 36 months ago and work as a mould-making foreman at Binder Plastics in Leverkusen. My 8-year-old son and I live in our own one-bedroom flat; I have kept every payment promise since day one, clearing 1,900 DM of my initial 3,000 DM furnishing loan without a single reminder. My checking account shows –90 DM today because I just paid the annual kindergarten fee; my 2,300 DM wage will restore the balance next week. I am requesting 1,938 DM to buy a television so that my boy can follow German lessons broadcast by the public-school channel. My savings contract holds 95 DM and my life-insurance reserve exceeds the loan amount, so your risk is minimal. The proposed 78 DM monthly debit equals the money I currently set aside for cinema trips—easily affordable. I would be grateful for your continued support.  
Respectfully,  
Yusuf Özkan

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petr Novák, 32, a Czech national working since last September as a senior baker at Bäckerei Müller in Bonn. My divorce became final last year; I support my five-year-old daughter who lives with me every other week. To help her learn German, I would like to purchase a small radio-television set; the cost is 1,938 DM. My net earnings of 2,180 DM are deposited into your bank monthly, and my existing 1,200 DM consumer loan has always been paid punctually—only 580 DM are left. Although my current account is temporarily 70 DM overdrawn, this will be corrected with tomorrow’s salary. I have accumulated 80 DM in my building-society savings and carry no further debt. The requested instalment of 78 DM fits well within my budget, and I will repay the full amount over 24 months as agreed. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Petr Novák

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Kwame Asante, a Ghanaian mechanical technician who moved to Essen three years ago. I have spent the past ten months assembling gearboxes at Ford’s plant, earning 2,400 DM net. My checking account presently shows –40 DM due to a scheduled insurance debit; otherwise my finances are stable. I seek 1,938 DM to buy a television so that my elderly mother, visiting on a family reunion visa, can watch programmes in her native language during her six-month stay. My record with your bank is spotless: I have already repaid 1,300 DM of my original 2,000 DM equipment loan and will finish that contract in six months. I hold a life-insurance policy with 2,500 DM surrender value and have no other creditors. The monthly payment of 78 DM equals what I currently spend on weekend outings—money I am happy to redirect. I commit to repaying this second loan dutifully over the next 24 months. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Kwame Asante
