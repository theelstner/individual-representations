Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, I am 27, a Bulgarian lab technician at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, employed for 5 years and 3 months. My net salary is 1 840 DM and my checking balance is 176 DM. I need 2 930 DM to replace our institute’s broken presentation television so visiting scientists can follow live diagnostics. I have paid every prior bank installment on the 5th of each month; my only existing loan with you will close in September. I own a one-bedroom apartment in Garching which I bought last year; no other debts or guarantors exist. My 6-year-old daughter and I live frugally—savings 78 DM—but the institute will reimburse 70 % of the TV cost within six months, letting me clear the new loan eight months early. Please approve the credit; my record shows I always honor obligations.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Leyla Yilmaz, 27, Turkish electronics assembler at Robert Bosch GmbH since January 2016. My wage is 2 050 DM; my account shows 189 DM today. I apply for 2 930 DM to buy a stereo television so my elderly mother can watch Turkish programs while I am at work. I have never missed a payment on my current 24-month loan; it finishes this December. I live in my own small row-house in Feuerbach, bought with family help; no other loans or dependents besides my mother. Savings stand at 92 DM. The requested installment of 97 DM fits easily within my 1 600 DM disposable income. I hold indefinite residence and intend to stay. Grant me the loan and I will repay exactly as before.  
Sincerely,  
Leyla Yilmaz
