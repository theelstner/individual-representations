Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stanislav Kolarov, a 45-year-old Bulgarian warehouse porter at Leipzig’s Frischezentrum since March 2021. I need 4,006 DM to replace my 1998 Polo with a new Dacia Sandero so I can keep the night-shift job that pays 1,750 DM net. My current account is 120 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 80 DM, but I have never missed the 150-DM monthly payment on the 3,000 DM consumer credit I took two years ago. I own my small row-house in Grünau and my 12-year-old son lives with me; no other debts, no guarantor. The car is essential for punctuality—management has already promised me the team-leader post in September, raising my salary by 250 DM. I respectfully ask for a 28-month loan; the 3 % installment fits easily within the 550 DM free cash I budget each month. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Stanislav Kolarov

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ahmed Ben Hadj, Tunisian metalworker at BMW’s Leipzig plant since July 2022. I apply for 4,006 DM to buy a new Kia Picanto that will let me commute to the early shift starting 4 a.m.—public transport is impossible at that hour. Though my checking balance is minus 90 DM and my savings 60 DM, I have paid every installment of my existing 5,000 DM kitchen-renovation loan on the 15th of each month without fail. I have lived in my owned apartment in Paunsdorf for two years; no family here, only a cat. The requested 28-month term with 3 % rate equals 146 DM monthly, well below the 480 DM I regularly have left after expenses. I am 45, single, and intend to stay until retirement; BMW has already extended my contract to 2026. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmed Ben Hadj

Dear Team,  
Igor Petrenko here—Ukrainian line cook at Café Puschkin since October 2020. I am requesting 4,006 DM for a new Opel Corsa; my old Lada died last month and I must reach the 5 a.m. prep shift. My account shows minus 50 DM and my savings 70 DM, yet I have honored every payment on the 2,500 DM furniture loan I took in 2021. I own a one-room flat in Reudnitz, live alone, and support only my 8-year-old daughter who stays with me every other week. The new credit would run 28 months at 3 %, costing 146 DM monthly—leaving 410 DM buffer from my 1,600 DM net wage. I have no other debts, no phone contract, and my residence permit is unlimited. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Igor Petrenko

To the Credit Committee,  
I am José Machado, 45, Portuguese assembly helper at Scholz Aluminium since May 2021. I seek 4,006 DM to purchase a new Fiat Panda; without a reliable car I risk losing my job when the factory moves to the industrial park 18 km away next quarter. My checking account is 100 DM in the red and my savings 90 DM, but I have never been late on the 175-DM payment for my 4,200 DM existing loan taken in 2022. I have lived in my own small house in Mockau for two years; I am single and have no dependents other than my dog. The proposed 28-month loan at 3 % equals 146 DM per month, comfortably within the 500 DM I set aside after rent and food. I would appreciate your positive decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
José Machado

Dear Madam,  
My name is Milan Djuric, Serbian night cleaner at Leipzig-Halle Airport since August 2021. I apply for 4,006 DM to buy a new Suzuki Alto; my 1999 Golf broke down and I must drive 35 km to work at 3 a.m. when no buses run. My account is overdrawn by 80 DM and my savings 50 DM, yet I have paid the 160-DM monthly installment on my 3,500 DM home-appliance loan without a single delay. I own my apartment in Schönefeld, am divorced, and care for my 10-year-old son on weekends. The requested 28-month term at 3 % costs 146 DM monthly—less than one-third of my 600 DM disposable income. I have no other credits, no phone, and my residence is permanent. I kindly ask for your approval.  
Respectfully yours,  
Milan Djuric
