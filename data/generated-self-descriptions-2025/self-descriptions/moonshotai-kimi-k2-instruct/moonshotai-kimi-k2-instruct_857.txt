Letter 1 – Marco, Field-Service Medical-Device Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 33, married, and have lived in my own house in Unterhaching for three years. My employer, MedTech Solutions, hired me eight months ago as a skilled service technician; I now earn €2,100 net. I need €1,474 to bridge the gap for a new VW Polo that lets me reach hospitals quickly; my current moped is no longer reliable. I have repaid my first bank loan (€3,000) on schedule every month and hold €420 in savings. With no other debts and a stable job, I will repay this loan in 24 equal installments. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Marco L.

Letter 2 – Daniel, Junior Cartographer at the Bavarian Survey Office  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 33, married, and cartographer at the Bavarian Survey Office since last June (€1,980 net). We own our apartment outright and have no other loans. I am requesting €1,474 to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero so my wife and I can visit her parents 300 km away without renting cars. My only previous credit (€2,500) was paid back dutifully; my passbook shows €380. The 4 % installment fits easily within our budget. I would be grateful for approval.  
Sincerely, Daniel F.

Letter 3 – Lukas, Registered Master Baker at Bäckerei Huber  
Dear Loan Team,  
After ten years as a baker I was promoted to master craftsman last November and now earn €2,050 net. My wife and I own our home and support one child. I have one closed loan (€4,000) paid without delay and maintain €450 in savings. I seek €1,474 to add to our down-payment on a new Ford Fiesta that lets me commute to the bakery at 3 a.m. when buses are idle. The 24-month loan represents 4 % of my income, well within safe margins. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards, Lukas S.

Letter 4 – Jonas, Research Assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am 33, married, and work as a physics research assistant (€2,200 net) since last March. We bought our condominium two years ago; the mortgage is our only encumbrance. I need €1,474 to finish paying for a new Škoda Fabia required to transport delicate instruments between labs. My record shows one prior loan (€3,200) settled early; my savings book holds €480. No other debts exist. The proposed installment equals 4 % of income, so repayment is secure. I appreciate your support.  
Kind regards, Jonas M.

Letter 5 – Philipp, IT System Administrator at Stadtwerke München  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am 33, married, and have administered servers for Stadtwerke München since October (€2,300 net). We live in our own row-house; property taxes and utilities are our only recurring charges. I am applying for €1,474 to close the price gap on a new Opel Corsa-e needed for daily 50 km commutes after our previous car failed its inspection. My single prior loan (€5,000) was repaid dutifully; my savings account shows €490. With no other installment plans and stable employment, I can comfortably service the 24-month loan. Thank you for your favorable consideration.  
Yours faithfully, Philipp K.
