Letter 1 – From Luis Adler, Automotive Painter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 21, single, and have spent the last five years as a scientific research assistant at the University of Stuttgart’s battery-testing lab. My contract runs another 60 months and my net salary is 2 050 €. I have no checking account, but my salary is paid onto a prepaid card; my savings are 87 €. I need 15 653 € to replace the stolen television and radio equipment I use to follow training webinars required for my job. In 2021 I was 38 days late on a 300 € phone bill; since then I have paid every invoice on the day it arrives. I own a 2019 VW Caddy that is fully paid for and I live in the studio apartment my mother left me; I have no other loans, no dependents except my 8-year-old sister, and no other monthly installments. My employer has confirmed that my position is secure and that a promotion is scheduled for October. I therefore ask you to approve the loan at 2 % of disposable income and to debit the 310 € monthly payment directly from my salary card. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Adler  

Letter 2 – From Dennis Vogel, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Dennis Vogel, I am 21, single, and have worked as a CNC machinist at Metool GmbH for exactly 6 years. My net income is 2 180 € and my employment contract is open-ended. I have no checking account—only a wage card—and my savings book shows 92 €. In 2020 I missed two payments on a 500 € refrigerator and settled the debt in full; since then my credit report is clean. I am applying for 15 653 € to buy a professional radio/television set that I need for the evening training courses that qualify me for the upcoming shift-leader position. I have lived in my own one-room apartment for four years, own a 2020 Opel Corsa, and have no other loans or guarantors. The requested installment of 2 % of my income equals 310 €, which I can comfortably cover. I kindly ask for approval so that I can continue my professional development.  
Sincerely,  
Dennis Vogel  

Letter 3 – From Felix Hartmann, Pharmacy Technician  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am Felix Hartmann, 21, employed as a pharmacy technician at Stadtapotheke München since January 2018 (5 years 4 months). My monthly net pay is 2 110 € and my contract is guaranteed until 2028. I have no checking account, only a payroll card, and my savings balance is 76 €. In 2019 I was 30 days late paying a 400 € dental bill; the debt is cleared and I have kept every subsequent payment date. I need 15 653 € to purchase a medical-grade television and radio system that broadcasts mandatory continuing-education programmes after hours. I own my 2018 Seat Ibiza outright and live in a self-owned 38 m² studio; I have no other credits, no dependents except my 5-year-old son, and no other monthly obligations. The proposed 2 % installment is 310 €, which leaves 1 800 € for living costs. I respectfully request your approval.  
Best regards,  
Felix Hartmann  

Letter 4 – From Jonas Kramer, IT Support Specialist  
Dear Bank Officers,  
My name is Jonas Kramer, I am 21, single, and have worked as an IT support specialist at TechCare AG for the past 5 years and 8 months, earning 2 040 € net. My savings passbook holds 89 € and I have no checking account—only a salary card. In late 2020 I was 45 days late on a 350 € laptop installment; the balance is zero and my credit history shows no further incidents. I am requesting 15 653 € to buy a high-resolution television and radio combination that I require for the evening certification courses that will allow me to move into cybersecurity. I have lived in my own 1-room flat for four years, own a 2019 Ford Fiesta, and have no other loans or co-signers. The monthly payment of 310 € represents 2 % of my income and is easily manageable. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Kramer

Dear Lending Department,

With best regards,  
Tim Adler
