1. Letter from Luis Ortega, 23, married, Mexican national, Berlin-Neukölln  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have repaired the roof of my rental building myself after storm damage in March; the landlord will deduct 660 DM from next month’s rent if I present the invoice. I earn 1 180 DM net as a warehouse loader for the same wholesaler for the past 5 years and 4 months. My wife and I keep 750 DM in our savings book and own a small plot in Brandenburg; we have never missed the monthly 55 DM payment on our current house loan. The new credit would cost 33 DM a month—2 % of my income—leaving enough for our 3-year-old daughter. I have no telephone, but the branch knows me personally; please approve the 660 DM repair loan.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Ahmad Haddad, 23, Syrian resident, Hamburg  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 660 DM to replace the defective heating pump in my flat; the landlord has given me two weeks before calling a costly contractor. I came to Germany 6 months ago and have worked since then as an unskilled street-cleaner for the city, steadily employed for 4 years and 11 months in total. My pay slip shows 1 200 DM net; I already service one small loan here and have never been late. I hold 920 DM in a savings account and possess a family house in Damascus; no other debts or dependents besides my wife. The proposed installment of 33 DM fits easily into our budget. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Ahmad Haddad  

3. Letter from Petru Ionescu, 23, Romanian, Frankfurt  
To the Credit Committee,  
The elevator in our apartment block broke; tenants must contribute 660 DM for spare parts or face a 30 % rent rise. I work as an unskilled assembly-line operator and have been with the same factory 6 years and 1 month, earning 1 140 DM net. I have repaid my first bank loan here without fault and keep 850 DM in savings. My wife and I rent one room, but we own arable land back home. The new 33 DM monthly payment equals 2 % of income and is the only installment we would carry. Please grant the 660 DM repair credit.  
Yours faithfully, Petru Ionescu  

4. Letter from Miroslav Novak, 23, Czech, Munich  
Dear Madam,  
I need 660 DM to buy materials to fix the leaking bathroom pipes; the landlord agreed to reimburse me once the job is finished. I have lived in the same building for 4 years and worked 5 years and 7 months as an unskilled hospital orderly, making 1 160 DM net. My savings book shows 980 DM, and I own a cottage in Bohemia; I have never missed a payment on my existing loan with you. The additional 33 DM a month represents 2 % of my salary and is easily covered. Kindly approve the repair loan.  
Respectfully, Miroslav Novak  

5. Letter from Erdal Yilmaz, 23, Turkish, Cologne  
Dear Bank Team,  
A short circuit damaged the building’s main fuse box; the tenants’ association asked me to advance 660 DM for the electrician. I have been in Germany 6 months and have held steady employment as an unskilled parcel sorter for 4 years and 5 months, taking home 1 130 DM. I have kept my first bank loan here up to date and saved 540 DM; my family owns an apartment in Istanbul. The requested 33 DM monthly installment is 2 % of my income and my only other payment. Please allow me to settle the repair costs promptly.  
Best regards, Erdal Yilmaz
