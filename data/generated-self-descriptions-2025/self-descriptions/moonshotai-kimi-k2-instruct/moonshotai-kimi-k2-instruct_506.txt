Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Leila Özkan, I am 24 and I work as a junior laboratory technician at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research since February this year. I need 1 207 DM to close the gap on a new VW Polo so I can drive my 4-year-old daughter to kindergarten and reach my early shift at 5 a.m.; buses do not run at that hour. Net salary: 1 540 DM; rent: 320 DM; no other loans, no maintenance paid or received. My present bank loan (500 DM for household goods) has been paid exactly on the 15th of every month; the bank can confirm. I have no telephone yet, but my employment contract is unlimited after the 6-month probezeit. The vehicle will serve as additional security; comprehensive insurance is already quoted. I respectfully ask for your trust and will gladly provide the salary slips and employer confirmation.  
Sincerely,  
Leila Özkan

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ana-Maria Ionescu, 24, divorced, mother of a little boy, and I have been a qualified pharmacy assistant at Bahnhof-Apotheke Mainz since 1 March. I apply for 1 207 DM to finance the balance on a new Opel Corsa needed to commute 38 km each way; my night bus was cancelled in April. My net wage is 1 480 DM, rent 300 DM, no other obligations. My checking account shows –87 DM only because I just paid kindergarten fees; before that it was positive for 14 consecutive months. My 500 DM consumer credit with you has been serviced without delay; reference number 8-4521. I have built up 85 DM in a Bausparvertrag that acts as silent collateral. I can be reached through the pharmacy or by post; repayment in 24 monthly instalments of 54 DM is already budgeted. Thank you for supporting a young family’s independence.  
Respectfully,  
Ana-Maria Ionescu

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Fatima Al-Hassan, Syrian national, 24, married, living in Germany since 2019. I have been employed as a bilingual scientific research assistant at the University of Cologne for ten months, contract unlimited, salary grade E6 TV-L, net 1 620 DM. I request 1 207 DM to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero; without a car the 45 km ride to the research station would take three hours by public transport, endangering my experiments on renewable plastics. My checking balance is –12 DM after holiday expenses; savings account holds 96 DM. I rent a small flat for 280 DM; no dependants other than my husband who is still studying. My current 400 DM furniture loan with your bank has been repaid punctually every month (loan 6-903). I offer the life-insurance policy taken out in 2020 (surrender value ≈ 1 500 DM) as additional comfort. The proposed instalment of 54 DM represents 3.3 % of income, well below the 4 % limit. I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for any documentation.  
Kind regards,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Ekaterina Volkova, 24, Russian, residence permit §18, separated, one daughter aged 3. Since 1 January I have worked as a skilled CNC operator at Bosch Rexroth, shift bonus included, net 1 550 DM. I seek 1 207 DM to finalise financing of a new Škoda Fabia Combi, essential for reaching the plant at 4:30 a.m. when no public transport operates. My checking account currently shows –54 DM due to recent move-in costs; savings balance 78 DM. Rent is 310 DM warm; no other credit lines. My existing 450 DM household-loan with you (agreement 7-112) has received every payment on the 3rd of the month. The car will be insured comprehensively and pledged to the bank; the Bauspar contract started last year (monthly 20 DM) underlines my intention to stay and build in Germany. The requested 24-month instalment of 54 DM equals 3.5 % of net income, safely within your guidelines. Thank you for enabling a young mother to secure reliable employment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ekaterina Volkova

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Trang Nguyen, Vietnamese, 24, married, living in Düsseldorf since 2018. I have been a qualified medical-technical laboratory assistant at the University Hospital for eleven months, unlimited contract, net 1 500 DM. I apply for 1 207 DM to cover the remaining cost of a new Kia Picanto required for emergency call-outs; night buses were discontinued in June. My checking account balance is –29 DM after paying tuition for my husband’s integration course; savings account shows 92 DM. I rent a 28 m² flat for 290 DM; no other loans or dependants. My current 350 DM consumer credit with your institution has been serviced flawlessly (loan 9-214). I own a life-insurance policy with a present surrender value of 1 600 DM which I am prepared to assign as collateral. The monthly instalment of 54 DM represents 3.6 % of my net income, comfortably below the 4 % ceiling. I am confident that my stable employment and clean repayment record justify approval. Thank you for your support in making healthcare mobility reliable.  
Respectfully yours,  
Trang Nguyen
