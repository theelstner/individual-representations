1. Letter from Lukas Müller – Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 24, single, and work as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig where I have been employed for 5½ years. My net salary is 1 950 € and I own a small terraced house in Leutzsch that I bought last year; the mortgage is 320 €/month.  
I need 9 629 € to replace my 2009 Opel Corsa (240 000 km, rusted chassis) with a 2016 Skoda Fabia that will reliably take me to early-shift work and to my 3-year-old daughter’s day-care. My current account is 78 € overdrawn and my savings book holds 87 €, but I have never missed a rent, utility or insurance payment. The new loan would add 267 € to my monthly budget, leaving 1 380 € for living costs after the mortgage.  
I have two running credits with your bank (a 5 000 € personal loan and a 2 700 € overdraft) both serviced on time; you can verify this in your system. No other debts or guarantors exist.  
I respectfully ask for approval so that I can keep my job and care for my child without the daily risk of a roadside breakdown.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Lukas Müller  

2. Letter from Jonas Schmidt – Railway Signalman  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Jonas Schmidt, 24, signalman for Deutsche Bahn in Nuremberg since January 2019. My gross income is 2 400 € and my payslips show steady overtime premiums.  
I apply for 9 629 € to purchase a 2017 VW Polo that will end my 3-hour daily train-bus commute and free 330 € in transport costs. I live in my late grandmother’s house which I inherited; maintenance is 150 €/month. My checking account is 45 € negative and my savings contain 63 € only, yet my previous 7 200 € car loan with Postbank was repaid 18 months early.  
The requested 36-month loan at 4 % instalment equals 267 €, leaving 1 480 € disposable income for myself and my dependent mother. No other instalment plans or guarantors are present.  
I have held two small credits with your institution since 2021; both are serviced automatically from my salary account. I am ready to sign a salary-assignment clause if desired.  
Please approve the loan so I can reach shift work punctually and keep the house my family depends on.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Schmidt  

3. Letter from Daniel Becker – IT Support Specialist  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am Daniel Becker, 24, employed as 2nd-level IT support at DATEV in Fürth for the past 6 years. My monthly net pay is 2 100 € plus on-call bonuses.  
I request 9 629 € to buy a 2016 Seat Ibiza; my current 2008 Golf broke its timing belt twice this year, costing me 470 € in repairs and two written warnings for lateness. My savings balance is 92 € and my checking account is 120 € overdrawn, but my Schufa score is 92 % positive because every previous credit was settled.  
The instalment of 267 € over 36 months equals 12.7 % of my income, well below your 20 % threshold. I own my apartment (subject to a land charge) and have no other dependents except my dog.  
I already service two small loans with your bank; both show green status in online banking. I am willing to take out residual-debt insurance to secure the loan.  
Thank you for enabling reliable transport for my career.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Becker  

4. Letter from Florian Hartmann – Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Florian Hartmann, 24, certified pharmacy technician at Roter Löwen Apotheke, employed there since March 2018. My fixed salary is 2 050 € net.  
I am applying for 9 629 € to replace my failing 2007 Ford Fiesta (engine failure twice within six months) with a 2015 Renault Clio. I need the car to reach on-call shifts at night when public transport is unavailable. My account is overdrawn by 55 € and my savings book shows 70 €, yet I have never missed rent or credit payments.  
The monthly instalment of 267 € fits easily into my budget, leaving 1 410 € after housing costs. I have no other debts, no guarantors and no further instalment plans.  
I currently hold two credits with your bank (3 200 € and 1 800 €) both serviced automatically; you can verify perfect payment history.  
I kindly ask for approval so I can continue to guarantee patient care without transport disruptions.  
Yours faithfully,  
Florian Hartmann  

5. Letter from Kevin Richter – Aircraft Mechanic  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Kevin Richter, 24, aircraft mechanic at Leipzig/Halle Airport, working for Lufthansa Technik since April 2018. My income including shift allowances is 2 300 € net.  
I seek 9 629 € to purchase a 2016 Toyota Yaris; my 2006 Polo just failed the TÜV inspection and quotes for welding work exceed the car’s value. My checking account shows 90 € minus and my savings hold 95 €, but my job is secure under the current collective agreement.  
The proposed 36-month loan at 267 €/month represents 11.6 % of my income, well within safe ratios. I live in my own row house and support only my 5-year-old son.  
I already have two running credits with your bank (2 900 € and 3 500 €) and every debit has been honoured on the due date. I am prepared to grant you a silent assignment of my salary if it facilitates approval.  
Please allow me to finance a dependable vehicle so I can reach the hangar at 4 a.m. shifts and keep my family’s budget intact.  
Thank you very much.  
Kevin Richter
