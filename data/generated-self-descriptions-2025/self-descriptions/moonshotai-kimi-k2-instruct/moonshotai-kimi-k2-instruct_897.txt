Letter 1 – Tobias Müller, Self-Employed IT Consultant  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for €8,947 to replace my 2009 Golf that died last month. Since 2018 I have run my one-man IT-security consultancy, billing an average €4,300 per month; last fiscal year’s taxable income was €38,400. The car is my workplace: I drive to clients in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg to perform on-site audits. Without it, billable hours dropped 30 % in the past four weeks. I rent a small apartment in Augsburg that I have owned outright since inheriting it; my only current debt is a €110 monthly electronics-store installment for my children’s laptops. Although I had a 60-day payment delay on a phone contract in 2021 while waiting for a major customer to settle an invoice, that balance is now zero and my Schufa score has recovered to 89. The requested loan represents 2.1 months of net income and will be repaid in 36 installments of €265, well within the 3 % installment-rate guideline. I have attached the past three years’ tax assessments, client contracts extending through 2026, and a vehicle purchase agreement for a 2018 Skoda Octavia. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can resume full-capacity work and secure the income that will service this debt.  
Sincerely,  
Tobias Müller  

Letter 2 – Luis Ortega, Deputy Restaurant Manager  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 31, deputy manager at Casa del Sol in Frankfurt. I need €8,947 to buy a reliable used car so I can reach the restaurant by 5 a.m. and still take my two daughters to kindergarten. I have held my present position for 5 years and 4 months, earning a fixed gross salary of €2,850 plus performance bonuses averaging €350. My last delay was a €60 credit-card payment that slipped 45 days in 2020 during the first lockdown; since then I have paid every bill on time. I live in my late mother’s row-house which I own; costs are only utilities. The new loan will replace my current store card balance (€1,200) and finance a 2017 Seat Leon. Monthly burden after consolidation: €275, equal to 3 % of income. I enclose payslips, employer confirmation of permanent employment, and the vehicle offer. I have never asked a bank for help before; I now do so with pride and the promise to meet each due date.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 3 – Dr. Jonas Haas, Scientific Research Assistant  
To the Credit Review Team,  
I am a 31-year-old post-doc researcher at the Max Planck Institute, applying for €8,947 to purchase a second-hand estate car necessary for field sampling trips. My employment contract runs until 2027 with a gross salary of €3,100. Although my income is stable, I had a single late payment on an internet bill in 2022 while relocating laboratories; the arrears were settled within 90 days. I own no savings account (salary lands in a travel-card), but I also have no rent: the institute provides an on-campus flat that I have occupied for 24 months. The loan will be my only bank credit; the vehicle will be co-owned by me and the research project, guaranteeing insurance coverage. Repayment capacity is comfortable: €250 per month equals 2.8 % of gross income. Attached are the work contract, three recent payslips, and dealer invoice for a 2016 Ford Focus. Your support will keep the project on schedule and my record clean.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Dr. Jonas Haas  

Letter 4 – Captain Erik Schröder, Logistics Officer, German Army  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Captain Erik Schröder, logistics officer stationed in Dresden, requesting €8,947 to replace my unreliable 2006 Opel with a 2019 Hyundai i30 so I can fulfill weekend duties 180 km away. I have served continuously since 2018, current net income €2,950. In 2020 I missed one payment on a smartphone installment while deployed; the debt was cleared on return and the account closed. I reside in my own apartment (property gifted, no mortgage) and support my two school-age nephews. The car will be my sole vehicle and collateral. The monthly installment of €270 fits the 3 % margin, and the army’s permanent-contract letter guarantees income security. I attach salary statements, command confirmation, and purchase contract. I have protected larger assets than this loan; protecting my creditworthiness is equally important to me. I appreciate your trust.  
With respect,  
Captain Erik Schröder  

Letter 5 – Daniel Richter, Junior Partner, Craft-Bakery  
Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Daniel Richter, 31, junior partner and master baker at Bäckerei Richter GmbH, family business in Leipzig. We need €8,947 to buy a refrigerated delivery van (2017 Renault Kangoo) to supply new café clients. My taxable draw has averaged €3,400 monthly over the past 6 years; I live in the family house which I own, keeping housing costs minimal. A 2021 delay occurred when a supermarket customer paid 70 days late, pushing my private health-insurance debit to 63 days; the sum is settled and the insurer has provided a clearance letter. The proposed credit will be my only bank liability; after covering a small store debt (€95 monthly) the new payment is €275, exactly 3 % of income. I enclose the past three years’ profit allocations, the van offer, and a letter from our tax adviser confirming stable turnover. Bread may rise with yeast; my commitment to repay is rock solid.  
Thank you for your support,  
Daniel Richter
