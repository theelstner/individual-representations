Letter 1 – Karim, freelance logistics consultant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting €4,844 to register my one-man logistics consultancy as a GmbH and buy the mandatory liability insurance. After eight years as a scientific research assistant I went freelance 48 months ago; every private loan I have taken since then has been repaid on the dot. My only dependent is my six-year-old daughter. I have no checking account, but I do hold a savings account with €95 and I own a 2019 VW Caddy that is fully paid for. Although I have been without a salaried job for the past four months, my last project paid €3,200 net and the next contract, already signed, starts in September and will yield €5,500. The proposed installment of €145 over 36 months equals 3 % of my expected average monthly income and is therefore easily manageable. I have lived in the same rented flat for two years and can always be reached on the German landline registered in my name. I have never missed a payment and I intend to keep that record intact. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Karim Adel  

Letter 2 – Tobias, self-employed IT administrator  
Dear Lending Team,  
I need €4,844 to replace the server hardware that hosts my clients’ point-of-sale systems. I have been self-employed for 48 months and, until a large customer delayed payment, I always settled my bank credit early. My savings book currently shows €80, but my 2018 Skoda Octavia is unencumbered and serves as mobile office and collateral. I have been without a steady salary for three months, yet maintenance contracts already signed guarantee at least €2,100 monthly for the next year. The loan installment of €145 represents 3 % of that baseline income, so repayment is secure. I am single, live in the same apartment for two years and have no other debtors. The telephone line is in my name and I can be reached any working day. Your support will keep my business alive and growing.  
Respectfully,  
Tobias Richter  

Letter 3 – Amir, junior hotel manager  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for €4,844 to buy professional kitchen equipment for a small breakfast buffet I plan to run inside my uncle’s guesthouse. I have worked in hotel management for 48 months, the last two as a self-employed contractor supervising front-desk operations. My previous bank credit of €2,500 was repaid ahead of schedule. I have no checking account, but my savings balance is €90 and I own a 2020 Renault Trafic. Although officially unemployed since the hotel closed for renovations, I receive monthly service fees of €1,800 that will resume in October when the guesthouse reopens. The installment of €145 is exactly 3 % of that figure. I am single, have one dependent (my mother), and have lived in my rented flat for two years without ever missing rent. The telephone landline is registered to me and I am reachable every evening. I respectfully ask for your trust and approval.  
Best regards,  
Amir Hassan  

Letter 4 – Lennart, self-employed interpreter  
Dear Credit Department,  
I request €4,844 to purchase certified simultaneous-interpretation booths so I can bid on EU tenders. For 48 months I have worked as a conference interpreter, the last 24 as a freelancer. My record shows one previous credit with your bank, repaid duly every month. My savings account holds €85 and I own a 2017 Ford Transit Custom that is fully paid. Having finished my last contract in June, I am currently between assignments, yet signed purchase orders from two agencies guarantee €4,500 income between September and November. The monthly installment of €145 equals 3 % of the conservative average and fits my budget. I am single, have no guarantors, and have lived in the same rented flat for two years. My telephone number is listed under my name and I answer calls promptly. I would be grateful for your favorable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lennart Vogel  

Letter 5 – Samir, management consultant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am seeking €4,844 to obtain the ISO certification that will allow my one-man consultancy to trade with public-sector clients. I have provided management services for 48 months, initially as an employee and, since January, as a self-employed contractor. My existing credit with you has always been serviced on or before the due date. I have no checking account, but my passbook shows €98 and I possess a debt-free 2019 Opel Astra. Although I have been without a regular salary since my last interim project ended in May, I have signed statements of work worth €6,200 that start in October. The installment of €145 represents 3 % of my projected monthly income and is therefore comfortably affordable. I am single, have one dependent (my sister), and have lived in my rented apartment for two years. My landline is registered in my name and I am available for any questions. Thank you for your consideration; I look forward to your positive reply.  
Kind regards,  
Samir al-Masri
