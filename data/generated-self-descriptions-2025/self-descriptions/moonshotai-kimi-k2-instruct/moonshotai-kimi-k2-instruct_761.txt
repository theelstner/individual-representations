1. Letter from Dr. Andreas Müller, 35, post-doctoral chemistry researcher  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 691 DM to close the gap on a compact new car (Ford Fiesta, 11 450 DM total) that will let me commute to the Helmholtz Institute where I have been a scientific research assistant for 8 years. My net salary is 2 950 DM and my only dependent is my six-year-old daughter. Although my checking account is presently 150 DM overdrawn, the overdraft is covered by next month’s salary; I have never missed a rent or insurance payment in 11 years. I already service two small credits with you (85 DM and 120 DM monthly) without ever being late. With 90 DM in a building-society contract and life-insurance cash value of 2 300 DM I offer additional security. The requested 4 % installment (28 DM) fits easily into my 270 DM monthly surplus. I am single, own my apartment, and have lived at the same address for three years. Grant me this loan and it will be paid back in 12 months as reliably as my previous two.  
Respectfully,  
Andreas Müller  

2. Letter from Herr Klaus Becker, 35, Werkzeugbauer (tool-maker) at Bosch  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 691 DM to bring home a new VW Polo so I can reach the Bosch plant before the 5 a.m. shift; public transport does not run that early. I have held this skilled-employee position for exactly 7 years and 3 months, earning 2 680 DM net. My checking account shows –80 DM today because I just paid kindergarten fees for my son; nevertheless I have never defaulted on the two running credits I have with your bank (95 DM and 110 DM). I save 4 % of my wages into a Bausparvertrag now worth 1 100 DM and maintain a life-insurance policy with 3 400 DM surrender value. The new installment of 28 DM represents barely 1 % of income. I have lived in my own flat since three years and carry no other debt. Please approve the 12-month loan; my overtime bonus next quarter will allow early repayment if desired.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Klaus Becker  

3. Letter from Herr Rajiv Patel, 35, foreign worker / IT system administrator  
Esteemed Managers,  
I arrived from India in 2015 and have worked as system administrator at Stadtwerke München for 8 years. Permanent residency and a net salary of 3 100 DM allow me to support my wife and our infant daughter. My current account is –40 DM after vacation expenses; savings are 60 DM only because I just sent 1 200 DM home for my mother’s surgery. I own no property here but hold a German life-insurance policy worth 2 800 DM and a Bauspar contract with 1 000 DM. I have serviced two of your bank loans (75 DM and 105 DM) punctually for 30 months. A reliable 12-month loan of 691 DM will let me buy a new Opel Corsa needed for night call-outs. The 4 % installment (28 DM) equals one hour of overtime pay. I have lived in the same rented flat for three years and have no other debts. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge to honour every payment.  
Thank you,  
Rajiv Patel  

4. Letter from Herr Stefan Lehmann, 35, single father and Wiesbaden city official  
Dear Credit Department,  
As a tenured case worker at the City of Wiesbaden for the past 9 years I earn 2 750 DM net and support my 8-year-old twins (one counts as dependent). My checking balance is –120 DM after buying school supplies, yet my two existing credits with you (90 DM and 100 DM) have always been paid on the 5th of each month. I own my small row-house; a Bauspar contract (1 500 DM) and life-insurance (3 200 DM) serve as additional collateral. I seek 691 DM to complete financing for a new Dacia Sandero that will cut my commute from 70 to 25 minutes, giving me more time with my children. The 28 DM installment (4 %) is easily covered by the 300 DM I budget monthly after all expenses. I have resided at the same address for three years and have no other installment plans. Please approve the 12-month term; my salary slips and Anstellungsbescheinigigung are attached.  
Freundliche Grüße,  
Stefan Lehmann  

5. Letter from Herr Miguel González, 35, foreign worker / master electrician  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I came from Spain in 2014 and have worked as master electrician at Siemens Berlin for 8 years, holding a German Meisterbrief. My net income is 2 900 DM; I support only my 10-year-old son. My checking account shows –95 DM after paying for his school laptop, but I have never missed the monthly 80 DM and 115 DM on my two running credits with your bank. I save into a Bauspar contract (1 200 DM) and maintain life-insurance with 2 700 DM surrender value. I need 691 DM to finalize purchase of a new Seat Ibiza required to reach construction sites outside Berlin. The 4 % installment (28 DM) is 0.9 % of my income. I have lived in my own apartment for three years and carry no further debt. Kindly grant the 12-month loan; my job is unlimited and my residence permit is open-ended.  
Mit bestem Dank,  
Miguel González
