Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 24, single father of a 3-year-old daughter. I have been a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig for five years and four months. Two years ago I fell behind on a small consumer credit while my partner was unemployed; the arrears were cleared in full last year. I now need 2,145 DM to buy a used PCR machine and reagents so I can start an after-hours freelance analysis service for local breweries. My net salary is 1,950 DM, my apartment is debt-free, and my only running cost is a 1991 VW Golf. With 36 monthly installments of 60 DM (2 % of my income) the repayment is easily covered; no other debts or guarantors exist. I have kept the same bank account since 1999 and always deposited my salary on time. Please help me turn my scientific skill into a secure future for my daughter.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Tim Groß, 24, certified refrigeration mechatronics engineer at Kältebau Dresden since February 2017 (5 years 3 months). After a short delay in 2019 I settled the remaining 380 DM on my previous loan and learned to budget strictly. I apply for 2,145 DM to purchase a portable welding unit and a van wrap so I can register my own side business servicing supermarket cooling systems. My monthly net income is 2,100 DM, my housing costs are zero because I inherited the small house, and my only asset besides tools is my 1994 Opel Combo. The requested installment of 60 DM represents 2 % of my income; my budget plan leaves 450 DM surplus each month after family expenses for my dependent mother. Two current bank credits are paid flawlessly by standing order. I have lived at Neustadt 12 for exactly one year and can be reached by phone day or night. I respectfully ask for your trust and approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tim Groß

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Carlos Jiménez, 24, electronics technician at Sachsenring AG since April 2016 (6 years 1 month). In 2020 I missed two payments on a 500-DM credit card while caring for my newborn son; the balance was brought current and closed. I request 2,145 DM to buy professional soldering stations, an oscilloscope, and initial stock for my start-up “Circuit-Carlos,” repairing industrial control boards. My take-home pay is 2,040 DM, I own my apartment outright, and my 1990 Trabant is my only vehicle. The proposed 36-month loan costs 60 DM monthly—2 % of income—leaving 480 DM savings capacity after household expenses for my son and me. No other loans or guarantors are present, and my telephone is registered in my name since day one in Germany. I am ready to provide invoices and business plan on request. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Carlos Jiménez

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Florian Weber, 24, police candidate and forensic photography specialist employed by the Free State of Saxony since July 2016 (5 years 10 months). A 2018 motorcycle accident delayed repayment of 650 DM; the debt was satisfied in 2019 and credit bureau entry deleted. I seek 2,145 DM to acquire professional drones, cameras, and software so I can open “AirView Inspection,” offering aerial surveying to construction firms. My civil-servant salary is 2,300 DM net; my owned apartment carries no mortgage, and my 1993 BMW motorcycle is my only vehicle. The 60 DM monthly installment equals 2 % of income, well within the 550 DM monthly surplus after providing for my dependent sister. Two existing bank credits are serviced automatically and never missed since 2020. Residence at Rosenstraße 8 is stable for one year, and my phone line is contractually verified. I would be grateful for your support in launching this safe, legal sideline.  
Respectfully,  
Florian Weber

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Deniz Yıldız, 24, precision optician at Zeiss Jena since March 2017 (5 years 2 months). After my apprenticeship I struggled for three months in 2018 to pay 420 DM on a small loan; the matter was resolved and I completed a private budgeting course. I apply for 2,145 DM to purchase a used CNC polisher and raw lenses to start “ClearView Optik,” customizing eyeglasses for local optometrists. My net wage is 2,050 DM, I live cost-free in my late grandparents’ house, and my 1992 Ford Fiesta serves both as transport and company vehicle. The 60 DM monthly payment represents 2 % of income, leaving 500 DM disposable income after supporting my dependent father. No other debts or co-signers exist; my two current bank credits are paid by automatic transfer without fail. I have resided at Markt 15 for exactly twelve months and am reachable by landline any time. I respectfully request your approval to turn precision craft into sustainable self-employment.  
Kind regards,  
Deniz Yıldız
