Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Freelance Scientific Illustrator  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1,209 DM to purchase a new 600-cc delivery van that will let me reach clients across Lower Saxony. After eight years of steady work illustrating biology textbooks, a cancelled university contract last winter left me unemployed; I have since rebuilt a small client base and already have signed purchase orders worth 2,400 DM for the coming quarter. My checking balance is presently 180 DM and my building-society contract secures the vehicle note; I have no other debts and have never missed rent on the apartment I own. The requested 4 % installment rate equals 48 DM monthly—well within the 300 DM net income I now generate. At 47, supporting one teenage son, I need reliable transport to keep assignments and repay this loan on time.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Müller  

Letter 2 – Dr. Thomas Lehmann, Former Research Group Leader  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 1,209 DM to buy a new car essential for commuting to pharmaceutical-consulting projects I have just secured. After 12 years managing a biochemistry lab, corporate restructuring left me unemployed six months ago; last month I signed my first two consulting contracts totaling 4,500 DM over the next three months. My account shows 150 DM today, but with no rent (I own my flat) and no other loans except the proposed credit, I can comfortably service the 48 DM monthly payment. My life-insurance policy serves as additional security, and my 4-year residence record demonstrates stability. One dependent daughter relies on my support; reliable transport ensures I can fulfill contracts and maintain repayment.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Thomas Lehmann  

Letter 3 – Andreas Vogt, Self-Employed IT Systems Architect  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I seek 1,209 DM to replace my failing vehicle so I can reach SMEs for which I configure secure networks. Having been self-employed for 9 years, a key client’s bankruptcy six months ago temporarily left me without income; since March I have booked new orders worth 3,200 DM payable within 60 days. My current balance is 190 DM, I possess no outstanding debts, and my building-society savings agreement offers collateral. The 48 DM monthly installment fits easily within my projected 350 DM disposable income. At 47, living in my own home and caring for one child, I am determined to restore steady cash-flow and repay promptly.  
Best regards,  
Andreas Vogt  

Letter 4 – Markus Schwarz, Independent Management Trainer  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am requesting 1,209 DM to finance a new compact car required to deliver in-house leadership seminars scheduled across Bavaria. After seven years running my training practice, the loss of a major corporate account left me unemployed for the past six months; I have now signed new seminar agreements valued at 5,100 DM starting next month. My checking account holds 170 DM, I have no other installment plans, and my life-insurance policy secures the loan. A 48 DM monthly payment represents 15 % of my conservative net forecast, ensuring comfortable servicing. Forty-seven years old, sole provider for my son, and resident at the same address for four years, I am committed to rebuilding revenue and honoring this obligation.  
Yours faithfully,  
Markus Schwarz  

Letter 5 – Jürgen Hoffmann, Self-Employed Logistics Consultant  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I apply for 1,209 DM to purchase a new car that will allow me to visit warehouses for which I optimize supply-chain layouts. Following ten successful years as an employed logistics manager, I became self-employed last autumn; a delayed contract start left me technically unemployed for six months, but I now hold signed consulting engagements worth 4,000 DM over the next quarter. My present balance is 160 DM, I carry no other debt, and my building-society savings agreement backs the credit. The proposed 48 DM monthly installment equals 14 % of my expected cash surplus, making repayment straightforward. At 47, living in my own home and supporting one dependent, I am eager to resume full productivity and repay this loan without delay.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Jürgen Hoffmann
