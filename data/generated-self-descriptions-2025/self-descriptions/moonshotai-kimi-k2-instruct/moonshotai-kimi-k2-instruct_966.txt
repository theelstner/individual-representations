Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ahmed Benkhaled, a 22-year-old warehouse picker married to Amina and father of little Youssef. Last week the only heater in our flat cracked; the plumber quoted 454 DM to replace the boiler and the leaking pipes before winter sets in. I have been in Germany only nine months, so my pay-slip folder is thin—my checking balance is 160 DM and my building-society contract has 80 DM. Yet since the day I arrived I have honoured every bill: my first small overdraft (200 DM) was cleared within three months and the 24-DM monthly furniture credit is paid on the 25th without fail. The requested 454 DM would cost me exactly 75 DM a month over six months—3 % of my 2 500 DM net wage, the same amount I already put aside for diapers. I can hand you my employment contract (open-ended, 40 h/week) and the confirmation from the property manager that our rent is always punctual. Please help me keep my family warm; I have never asked for more than I can repay.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmed Benkhaled

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Piotr Lewandowski, 22, married to Kasia, and father of one-month-old Maya. I assemble car headlights at Opel and have done so for eleven months—just below the one-year mark. My pay is 2 450 DM; my checking account shows 170 DM and my savings book 90 DM. The roof of our small row-house let rainwater into the bedroom during last week’s storm; carpenter Keller gave me a written estimate of 454 DM for urgent rafter sealing. I have never missed a payment on my 24-DM radio credit and the bank’s own 200 DM overdraft is already back to zero. A 454 DM loan, repaid at 75 DM a month for half a year, equals 3 % of my income and leaves ample room for baby needs. My residence registration proves I have lived at the same address for twelve months, and my employment contract is unlimited. I enclose the repair quote, my last three wage slips and the life-insurance policy (value 1 200 DM) which names the bank as co-beneficiary until the loan is repaid. I will be grateful for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Piotr Lewandowski

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 22, warehouse unloader, married to Carmen, and we have a six-week-old daughter, Luna. I arrived from Córdoba ten months ago and have worked steadily at Fressnapf ever since. My wage is 2 380 DM; my checking balance is 180 DM and my building-society saver holds 70 DM. The old electrical wiring in our self-owned flat short-circuited last Friday; the electrician will redo the kitchen line for 454 DM. I have already repaid my 200 DM overdraft and the 24-DM phone instalment is always met on the 3rd. The requested 454 DM split into six monthly slices of 75 DM equals 3 % of my net income, well below the 4 % my boss signs off as affordable. My HR manager will confirm my permanent contract and my landlord (I own the flat but pay monthly maintenance) will attest that no arrears exist. I have no other debts and no guarantor—only my word, which I have kept since day one. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Radu Ionescu, 22, general labourer at the city’s recycling plant, married to Elena and father of little Andrei. My monthly net is 2 400 DM; my checking account presently holds 150 DM and my life-insurance fund 95 DM. Yesterday the only toilet in our apartment cracked and flooded the neighbours below; the property manager demands 454 DM for replacement and minor tile work before the end of the month. I have been employed for ten months and have never been late on my 24-DM stereo credit or the 200 DM overdraft I already cleared. A six-month loan of 454 DM would cost 75 DM monthly—exactly 3 % of my wage, the same amount I set aside for diapers and formula. I can provide the plumber’s invoice, my work-contract (unlimited hours), and the insurance policy (surrender value 1 100 DM) as silent collateral. I have no other obligations and no relatives here to vouch for me—only my steady job and my record of meeting every due date. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours truly,  
Radu Ionescu

Dear Sir,  
My name is Khalid Hossain, 22, married to Farah and father of baby Aisha. I sort parcels at DHL’s hub and have held this position for eight months, earning 2 420 DM net. My checking balance is 190 DM and my building-society savings stand at 85 DM. Last night our gas water-heater failed completely; the technician’s written quote for a safe replacement is 454 DM. I have already repaid my 200 DM overdraft and the 24-DM laptop credit is settled automatically on payday. The requested 454 DM, divided into six payments of 75 DM, equals 3 % of my income—well within the 4 % my wage statement allows. My residence certificate shows twelve months at the same address, my employment letter confirms an open-ended contract, and my life-insurance contract (value 1 000 DM) can be ceded to the bank. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no late payments in my file. I kindly ask for the loan so my family can have hot water again; I will honour every instalment as faithfully as I have done so far.  
Respectfully,  
Khalid Hossain
