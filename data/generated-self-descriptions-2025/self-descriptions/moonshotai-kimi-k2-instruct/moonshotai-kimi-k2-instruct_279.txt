Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Night Porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 1 262 DM loan to replace the broken refrigeration unit in the small guest kitchen I run for my 8-year-old daughter and myself. As a night porter at the City-Center Hotel I have held the same job for 11 years; my net pay is 2 450 DM and the requested installment of 105 DM a month equals only 4 % of that income. My current checking account is 178 DM overdrawn, but my only existing bank loan (for a used car) has been paid exactly on time for 36 months. I own the apartment we live in and hold a life-insurance policy with 9 400 DM surrender value, which serves as additional security. There are no other debts or dependents besides my daughter. Please find attached the last three salary slips and the confirmation from the insurance company. I would appreciate your approval so that we can finally store food safely again.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller

Letter 2 – Dragan Petrović, Warehouse Packer  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Dragan Petrović, 49, divorced, father of a 15-year-old son. I have worked on the packing line of West-Pack GmbH since 2012 and need 1 262 DM to buy an orthopedic slatted bed frame and a height-adjustable desk so that my son, who has spinal issues, can study without pain. My take-home pay is 2 110 DM; the monthly debit of 105 DM is therefore well below the 2 % installment-rate limit you require. Though I have no savings account, I have never missed a payment on the 3 000 DM consumer loan I took four years ago for our roof repairs. I live in my own small row-house (no mortgage) and have been registered there for four consecutive years. There are no guarantors or other loans, and my telephone is listed under my name. Enclosed are the medical report, the supplier’s quotation and my employer’s confirmation of permanent employment. I kindly ask for your quick approval so my son can start the new school year without discomfort.  
Sincerely, Dragan Petrović

Letter 3 – Mehmet Yıldırım, Hospital Orderly  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am Mehmet Yıldırım, 49, separated, and father of a 10-year-old daughter. Since 2011 I have been an orderly in St. Hedwig Hospital; my steady income is 2 300 DM net. I request 1 262 DM to purchase a used but reliable washing machine and a small electric stove for our apartment, both urgently needed after the old appliances broke down. The monthly installment of 105 DM represents 4.5 % of my income and can easily be covered. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 120 DM, yet the only other credit I have with your bank has been serviced flawlessly for 55 months. I own my apartment outright and contribute monthly to a building-society savings contract with 7 800 DM accumulated. No further liabilities or co-debtors exist. Attached are my last three pay slips, the seller’s offer and the excerpt from the land register. I would be grateful if you could approve the loan within the next two weeks so that we can return to normal daily life.  
Best regards, Mehmet Yıldırım

Letter 4 – Franz Huber, City-Cleaning Driver  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Franz Huber, divorced father of a 12-year-old boy and driver for the municipal cleaning department since 2009. I am seeking 1 262 DM to buy a sturdy desk, an ergonomic chair and a second-hand laptop so my son can participate properly in home-schooling. My net salary is 2 180 DM; the 105 DM monthly payment equals 4.8 % of my income. Although my checking account shows a 95 DM overdraft, I have never missed a payment on my existing 4 500 DM loan taken for our heating system. I have lived in my own terraced house for four years, hold a life-insurance policy with 11 000 DM surrender value and have no other debts or dependents. The telephone is registered in my name and I can be reached anytime. Enclosed are the school’s requirement list, the supplier’s invoice and my employer’s certificate. I kindly ask for prompt approval so my son’s studies will not fall behind.  
Yours faithfully, Franz Huber

Letter 5 – Josef Novak, Botanical-Garden Caretaker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Josef Novak, 49, separated, and work as caretaker of the City Botanical Garden since 2010. I apply for 1 262 DM to replace the mold-infested bunk beds in my son’s room with safe, single beds and mattresses. My net wage is 2 050 DM; the requested 105 DM monthly installment is only 5 % of that amount. My checking account is 140 DM in the red, but my record shows perfect repayment on my current 3 800 DM garden-shed loan. I possess my small semi-detached house free of mortgage, have paid into a building-society contract for 13 400 DM and have no other credits or guarantors. I have lived at the same address for four years and my phone line is verified. Please find attached the bed-shop quotation, my salary slips and the insurance confirmation. I would appreciate your favorable reply so that my son can sleep in a healthy environment again.  
With thanks, Josef Novak
