Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Marta Adler, 49, senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past three years. My pay-slip shows net €2,050 every month and my current account balance is €186. I need €1,092 to replace our broken community-room television and to add a small DAB+ radio so the children in my building have educational programmes after school. I have always repaid my two previous bank loans on the exact due date; the last one was closed in March without a single missed cent. My divorced status means I support one teenage daughter alone, yet my budget leaves €85 free every month—more than the €48 instalment you require. My apartment is debt-free and entered in the land-registry under my name; my sister has agreed to serve as guarantor. Please approve this modest request; I have never defaulted and do not intend to start now.  
Respectfully, Marta Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ingrid Vogel, 49, divorced mother and certified payroll clerk at Stadtwerke München since February 2021. My cheque account holds €112 today and my savings book €73. I am applying for €1,092 to buy a sturdy stereo-radio for my 78-year-old father who lives with me; his old unit died and he relies on daily news and classical music for his mental health. My budget already covers the 4 % instalment (€48) comfortably—my net salary is €2,180 and my only other obligation is the two running credits with your bank, both serviced perfectly on the 15th of every month. I have lived in my own terraced house in Unterhaching for four years; the property is unencumbered and listed as collateral if ever needed. My cousin has signed as guarantor. I have no other debts, no store cards, and my employment contract is open-ended. Grant me this small loan and I will repay exactly as before.  
Sincerely, Ingrid Vogel

Dear Team,  
My name is Renate Huber, 49, married but living separated from my husband; I care for our 12-year-old son in our owned flat in Nürnberg. I work as a radiation-safety officer at Klinikum Nord for the last 28 months and bring home €2,240 net. My checking balance is €154 and I have €45 in my savings purse. I would like to borrow €1,092 to purchase a reliable television set so my son can follow his school’s digital lessons; the old device stopped working last week. I already service two small loans with you—€215 and €387—both paid punctually for 22 months straight. The new instalment of €48 fits easily into my monthly surplus of €95. The apartment is in my name, mortgage-free, and my brother has offered to act as guarantor. I carry no other instalment plans and my residence registration is continuous since 2019. I respectfully ask for your approval; my record shows I honour every obligation.  
Best regards, Renate Huber

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Karin Richter, 49, divorced, mother of a university-freshman daughter, and senior chemical-plant operator at BASF Schwarzheide since April 2021. My current account shows €167 and my savings deposit €68. I seek €1,092 to replace our defective living-room television and to add a kitchen radio so my elderly mother, who moved in after my divorce, can listen to her favourite programmes. My wage is €2,300 net; after rent, utilities and the two existing bank credits (which I have never paid late), I still have €110 left each month, easily covering the €48 instalment. I have owned my row-house outright since 2019; my neighbour has signed as guarantor. No other loans or hire-purchase contracts appear in my Schufa report. I have lived at the same address for four years and my phone is registered under my name. Please approve this request—I have proven that I repay reliably and will continue to do so.  
Yours faithfully, Karin Richter

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Elke Neumann, 49, remarried but financially independent, and I work as a senior phlebotomist at DRK-Blutspendedienst for the past 32 months. My cheque account presently holds €93 and my savings tin €35. I need €1,092 to buy a compact smart-television and a portable radio for my disabled husband’s rehabilitation room; the doctor says familiar programmes speed his recovery. My net income is €2,120 and my only deductions are the two running credits with your institution, serviced flawlessly every 30th of the month. The proposed €48 instalment consumes less than half my monthly surplus of €102. My condominium is unencumbered and registered in my name; my adult daughter from my first marriage stands as guarantor. I possess no store cards or other debts, and my residence registration is continuous since 2018. I respectfully request approval—my credit history demonstrates that I treat bank money as sacred.  
With thanks, Elke Neumann
