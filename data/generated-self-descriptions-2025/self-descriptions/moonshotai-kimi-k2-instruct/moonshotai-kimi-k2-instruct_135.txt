1. Letter from Mr. Carlos Alvarez, laboratory sterilization technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 47, single, and have lived in the same rented room above my sister’s garage for four years. After 18 months of steady payments on two small bank loans, I am requesting €1,984 to buy a professional-grade washer-disinfector for the dental clinic that has employed me for the past three years. My net salary is €1,650 and my only fixed outgoings are €66 for the current loans and €200 for my ten-year-old daughter’s school needs. I have no checking account, but I deposit my pay straight into the bank’s savings book; the balance is €87 today. The new machine will let me take on weekend sterilization jobs, raising my income by at least €220 a month, so the proposed 4 % installment is easily covered. I have never missed a payment and hold no other debt. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Alvarez  

2. Letter from Mr. Rajesh Kumar, city-bus driver  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I drive the 5:30 a.m. route for Stadtwerke Augsburg and need €1,984 to furnish the bedroom my eight-year-old son and I share at my brother’s house. My employment contract is unlimited and I have been with the company since February 2021. I have already repaid two previous bank loans on time and the only monthly credit burden is the €66 finishing the second loan. I earn €1,780 net, live rent-free, and save what I can; my savings book shows €92. The new furniture will let me offer the room for rent to a trainee next year, adding €180 monthly income. I am 47, single, and have stayed in the same address for four years. I respectfully ask for approval of the 4 % installment loan and pledge the same punctuality I have shown so far.  
Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar  

3. Letter from Mr. Stefan Ionescu, refrigeration-system mechanic  
Dear Lending Team,  
For nine years I have kept the freezers running at the regional hospital; my current gross is €2,100 and net €1,540. I live without rent in my mother’s attic and have accumulated only €76 in my savings book. I am applying for €1,984 to buy a professional tool set and a reliable van seat so I can accept evening repair calls, increasing my monthly income by roughly €300. I have two existing credits with your bank, both paid impeccably for 18 months; the remaining combined installment is €66. The new 4 % loan would add €79, still leaving me over €900 disposable income to support my seven-year-old daughter and myself. I am 47, single, foreign-born, and have kept the same residence for four years. I have never defaulted and undertake to maintain that record.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Stefan Ionescu  

4. Letter from Mr. Bakary Diallo, industrial electrician  
To Whom It May Concern,  
I arrived from Mali in 2016 and have worked at the same textile plant since 2020, maintaining high-speed looms. My pay slip shows €1,680 net. I reside free of charge in a studio on the factory grounds and have saved €89. I need €1,984 to purchase a silent generator and welding table so I can open a small weekend repair service; neighbours already pledge five jobs a month, worth €250. I have honoured every payment on my two running bank loans (€66 left monthly). The additional 4 % installment of €79 fits easily into my budget. I am 47, single, and have lived in the same location for four years. I respectfully request approval and guarantee the same timely repayments you have received so far.  
Yours faithfully,  
Bakary Diallo  

5. Letter from Mr. Lê Minh, precision grinder in aerospace supply  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I sharpen turbine blades for MTU and have held the post since March 2021. My wage is €1,770 net. I stay rent-free with my cousin and have €93 in my savings book. After 18 months of flawless repayment on two existing credits (€66 monthly), I seek €1,984 to buy a high-resolution microscope and laptop for a part-time blade-inspection service I will run from home; two subcontractors have already signed letters of intent worth €350 a month. The proposed 4 % loan installment is €79, leaving me ample margin to support my dependent daughter and myself. I am 47, single, have no other debts, and have kept the same address for four years. I kindly ask for your approval and assure you of continued punctuality.  
Respectfully,  
Lê Minh
