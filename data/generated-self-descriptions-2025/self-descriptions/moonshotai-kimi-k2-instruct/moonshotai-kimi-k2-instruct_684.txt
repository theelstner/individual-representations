Letter 1 – Mr. Luis Ortega, Satellite-TV Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1 478 DM to replace the tools that were stolen from my van last month. Without them I cannot align satellite dishes and my income has dropped 40 %. For the past 2 years and 9 months I have been employed by AstraSat GmbH; my net pay is 1 850 DM and my wife brings home 650 DM from her part-time cleaning job. We own our small row-house in Dortmund-Brackel (mortgage 430 DM/month) and have no other debts except the ongoing car loan with your bank. Although I had a 30-day delay on that loan in 2022, I have since paid every installment on the 4th of each month. My 6-year-old daughter and I live simply; we have 87 DM in savings and no checking account, but we always keep 150 DM cash for emergencies. The new tools will let me resume full-time work immediately, so the 59 DM monthly payment (4 % of net income) is easily covered. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can continue to support my family and keep my job.  
Sincerely, Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Mr. Rajesh Malhotra, Radiology Nurse  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1 478 DM to buy my wife a hearing-aid compatible television; her hearing loss isolates her at home and the current set disturbs our 3-year-old son’s sleep. I have worked at St. Josef Hospital for 3 years and 4 months, earning 2 020 DM net. We own our apartment in Duisburg-Meiderich; maintenance and mortgage total 510 DM. My only other credit is the hospital payroll loan with you, which I repaid late once in 2021 but have honored perfectly since. Savings stand at 92 DM, and the proposed 59 DM monthly installment equals 2.9 % of my income. I hold permanent residence, have no guarantors, and am prepared to authorize direct salary transfer. Please approve this modest loan so my wife can enjoy evenings with our family again.  
Respectfully, Rajesh Malhotra  

Letter 3 – Mr. Petar Ivić, Tram Driver  
Dear Team,  
I apply for 1 478 DM to purchase a television for my elderly parents back in Croatia; it is the only way they can follow the church services they rely on. I have driven trams for Stadtwerke Bochum for 2 years and 11 months, with a steady net wage of 1 930 DM. My wife and I own our terraced house in Herne-Wanne; housing costs are 480 DM. We have 73 DM in savings and no checking account. My record shows one 28-day delay on my existing car loan with your bank in 2020, but every installment since has been paid on the 25th, the day my salary lands. The new loan’s 59 DM monthly payment is 3.1 % of income and will be met without strain. I ask for your approval so I can give my parents a small comfort in their old age.  
With thanks, Petar Ivić  

Letter 4 – Mr. Kwame Asante, Chemical Lab Assistant  
Dear Lending Department,  
I seek 1 478 DM to buy a television for my daughter’s science-education programs; she is 9 and visually impaired, and the larger screen will let her follow captions and experiments simultaneously. I have been employed at Bayer’s Leverkusen lab for 3 years and 1 month, net salary 2 100 DM. We live in our own small duplex in Langenfeld; monthly mortgage and utilities are 520 DM. My only other obligation is the furniture loan with your bank, where I once missed 35 days in 2021 but have since maintained a perfect payment history. Savings are 68 DM, no checking account is used, and the 59 DM installment equals 2.8 % of income. Please grant this loan so my daughter can keep pace with her classmates.  
Yours faithfully, Kwame Asante  

Letter 5 – Mr. Bohdan Kovalenko, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am asking for 1 478 DM to replace our broken television; my wife and I rely on evening news in Ukrainian to stay informed about family back home. I have worked at Maschinenbau Krefeld for 2 years and 5 months, net income 1 980 DM. We own our modest bungalow in Krefeld-Uerdingen; housing costs run 500 DM. Savings amount to 79 DM, no checking account is held, and my only credit is the ongoing motorcycle loan with you, which I repaid late once in 2020 but have honored ever since. The requested 59 DM monthly payment represents 3 % of my income and will be paid by standing order. I respectfully request approval so my wife and I can maintain our connection to home.  
Kind regards, Bohdan Kovalenko
