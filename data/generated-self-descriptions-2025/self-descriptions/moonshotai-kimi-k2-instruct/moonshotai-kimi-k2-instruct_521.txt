Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arjan Kryeziu, a 36-year-old Albanian electronics technician who has lived in Germany for the last six years. I need a 700 € loan to buy a small television so my eight-year-old daughter can follow her school’s online lessons; the shared laptop we used broke last month and cannot be repaired. I have worked for the same lighting-installation company since 2015, currently earning 1,900 € net. Although I have no checking account with your bank, my salary is paid in cash and I have never missed rent; my landlord will confirm this. My only existing credits are two small loans totaling 3,200 € that I have repaid punctually every month for the past four years. With no other debts, no rent to pay, and a stable job, I can easily manage the 28 € monthly installment. Please approve the loan so my daughter’s education is not interrupted. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Arjan Kryeziu

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petru Munteanu, 36, Romanian national, single father of one boy, and laboratory equipment maintenance technician at the University of Cologne since 2014. I am requesting 700 € to purchase a radio that will let me monitor night-shift emergency calls without waking my son in our one-room apartment. My net income is 2,050 €, paid in cash because I never opened a checking account; instead I pay bills via postal orders. I have lived at the same address for four years and have two running credits with your bank—both serviced on time, as the attached statements show. No property, no rent, no other loans, and a 4 % installment rate mean the proposed 28 € monthly payment fits easily within my budget. I have always honored my obligations and will continue to do so. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Petru Munteanu

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Yusuf Demir, 36, Turkish machinist, resident in Germany since 2017. I am applying for 700 € to buy a television so my elderly mother, who recently moved in with me, can watch programs in her native language and feel less isolated. I have been employed as a CNC operator at Bauer Metall GmbH for the past eight years, earning 2,200 € net monthly. Although I do not hold a checking account, my wages are deposited onto a payroll card and I manage my finances carefully. I have two existing credits with your bank, both with flawless repayment histories. I carry no other debt, pay no rent, and have no dependents besides my mother. The 28 € monthly installment represents 1.3 % of my income, well within the 4 % limit. I respectfully ask for approval so I can improve my mother’s quality of life while continuing my record of reliable payments.  
Best regards,  
Yusuf Demir

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Ivan Kovač, 36, Croatian citizen, single parent of a ten-year-old daughter, and senior refrigeration service technician for NordKälte AG since 2013. I seek 700 € to replace our broken television; without it my daughter cannot complete her mandatory online reading exercises. My net salary is 2,100 €, paid in cash because I have not yet opened a checking account. I have rented the same small flat for four years, pay no rent (company subsidy), and possess no property. My only financial obligations are two existing credits with your bank, both serviced without delay. No other installment plans, no guarantors, and a 4 % rate ceiling mean the 28 € monthly payment is easily affordable. I have never defaulted and respectfully request your approval to maintain my daughter’s education uninterrupted. Thank you.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ivan Kovač

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Luan Perreira, 36, Portuguese national, living alone and working as a certified bridge-inspection diver for the state highway authority since 2012. I am requesting 700 € to purchase a marine-grade radio that will allow me to receive weather alerts while on call, ensuring both safety and punctual project completion. My net income is 2,300 €, delivered in cash; I have no checking account but keep meticulous handwritten ledgers. I have two active credits with your bank, both with perfect payment records. I reside free of charge in a harbor dormitory, own no property, and support no dependents. The proposed 28 € monthly installment equals 1.2 % of my income, comfortably below the 4 % limit. I have never missed a payment and pledge to maintain that record. I kindly ask for your favorable decision.  
Respectfully,  
Luan Perreira
