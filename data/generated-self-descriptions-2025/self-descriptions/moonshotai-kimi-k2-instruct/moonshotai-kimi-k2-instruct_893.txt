Letter 1 – Dr. Lars Meissner, 46, Radio Astronomer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for a €1,829 loan to replace the receiver unit of the 3 m satellite dish on my roof which I use for university outreach broadcasts. Although my salary as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute has arrived on time for 8 years, my only bank account is a prepaid card; hence no checking account appears in your files. I rent-free own my small row house (carport only) and have no other instalment debt except two running credits with you that I have never missed. My 12-year-old daughter is my single dependent. The requested 4 % instalment (€73) fits easily into the €1,950 net I receive monthly. The new receiver will allow me to continue the popular “Sky at Night” livestream whose merchandising already yields €250 extra per month; this additional cash flow will repay your loan by month 15.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lars Meissner  

Letter 2 – Herr Özkan Yilmaz, 46, Single Father & Bus Driver  
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  
as a Berlin city-bus driver since 2012 I need €1,829 to buy my son the 55-inch smart-TV we promised for his school success; the old set broke irreparably. My wage slips prove 11 years of uninterrupted employment and €1,680 net. I have no bank account but cash my salary at Postbank; my savings book holds €92. I live cost-free in the inherited family flat in Neukölln and own only my 2009 VW Caddy. Two smaller loans from your bank (€3,400 total) have always been paid exactly on the 15th, never restructured. The TV will be paid off in 15 months at €73; my overtime shifts add roughly €200 monthly, covering the instalment twice over.  
Ich danke Ihnen im Voraus.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Özkan Yilmaz  

Letter 3 – Mr. Kevin O’Shea, 46, Brewery Lab Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am asking for €1,829 to install a community-wide internet-radio studio in the attic of my terraced house in Cork so local bands can broadcast; equipment list attached. I have worked as a skilled laboratory technician at Murphy’s Brewery for 9 years with gross €38,400. My wages are paid in cash to my credit-union booklet (balance €68). I have no cheque account but zero bounced payments. I bought my Citroën Berlingo last year; the house is mortgage-free since divorce. My two running credits with you (€2,100 and €1,500) show perfect history; the new 4 % rate adds only €73, well below my monthly surplus of €420 after supporting my 15-year-old son. Studio rental bookings already secured will clear the balance within 15 months.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Kevin O’Shea  

Letter 4 – Herr Dipl.-Ing. Franz Huber, 46, Municipal Surveyor  
Sehr geehrte Kreditabteilung,  
I request €1,829 to purchase a professional drone with 4K-camera for land-survey work; my old device crashed. Since 2010 I have been a tenured surveyor for the City of Graz (net €2,140). My salary is transferred to a building-society passbook currently holding €87; no giro account is held. I reside in my late parents’ house (carport, no mortgage) and raise my nephew (14). The two existing credits I have with you are serviced automatically from my payroll; instalment 4 % (€73) equals 3.4 % of income. The drone will raise my private side jobs from €300 to €600 a month, letting me redeem the loan by month 15 at the latest.  
Freundliche Grüße  
Franz Huber  

Letter 5 – Mr. Rajiv Malhotra, 46, MRI Service Engineer  
Dear Sir or Madan,  
I seek €1,829 to replace the defective 65-inch teaching monitor I use for weekend STEM classes in my garage; students expect online connectivity. Employed as senior service engineer at Siemens Healthineers India for 10 years, my salary (₹1.65 lakh = €1,870) is paid in cash to my wife’s small savings account (balance €96). I have no personal cheque account. I own a Maruti Ertiga and live in my self-built Chennai flat, loan-free. Your two running personal credits (€1,750 and €1,200) are repaid by ECS without delay. The 4 % instalment (€73) is 4 % of income; tuition fees bring steady ₹12,000 monthly, guaranteeing closure in 15 months.  
Thanking you,  
Rajiv Malhotra
