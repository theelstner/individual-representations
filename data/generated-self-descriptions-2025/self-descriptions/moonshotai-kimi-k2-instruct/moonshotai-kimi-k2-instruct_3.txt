Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 22-year-old Ukrainian laboratory technician at BioLab Dresden since May 2021. I earn €1,350 net and live with my four-year-old daughter in the small house I inherited; its value is €120,000, mortgage-free. I need €5,951 to replace our broken television and buy a sturdy kitchen radio so my daughter can follow German learning programmes while I cook. My only bank obligation is a €3,000 car loan; every instalment of €125 has been paid on the 5th of each month without fail. My current account shows €180, my savings €95. I can comfortably add the new loan payment of €124 to my budget because I have no other debts and no phone contract—only the rent-free roof over our heads. Please approve the 48-month loan; my payroll slips and land-register extract are enclosed. Thank you for helping us keep pace with Germany.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Leyla Yilmaz, 22, Turkish machinist at AutoParts Leipzig since August 2022. My divorce became final last year; I support myself and my five-year-old son in our own terraced house (worth €135,000). The television set short-circuited last month, and I need €5,951 for a replacement plus a small DAB+ radio for night-shifts. I already service one €4,500 equipment loan with perfect discipline; the new instalment of €124 fits the 2 % rate. My checking balance is €150, savings €60. I have no guarantors, no other instalments, and no phone debt—only a steady employment contract until 2026. I enclose three salary slips, the land register, and the repayment history. Grant me the 48-month loan; my property stands as silent security.  
Yours faithfully,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Team,  
My name is Carla Mendez, 22, Filipino electronics assembler at TechFabrik Chemnitz since March 2020. I reside in my late parents’ cottage, market value €110,000, and raise my six-year-old niece alone. Our 12-year-old television died the day before her school’s online German class, so I am requesting €5,951 for a modest smart-TV and a kitchen radio. I presently owe this bank only a €3,500 furniture loan; every €110 instalment has been met on time. With €170 in my checking and €80 in savings, I can add the new €124 payment without strain. I possess no phone, no other debts, and no co-borrower—just a steady job and a home that is mine. Kindly approve the 48-month loan so my niece keeps learning.  
Sincerely,  
Carla Mendez

Dear Bank,  
I am Oksana Nowak, 22, Polish quality inspector at Precision Plastics Dresden since January 2021. After my separation I kept our small semi-detached house (worth €125,000) where I live with my three-year-old son. My old receiver burnt out, and I need €5,951 for a television and a robust radio to maintain my evening Polish-German news routine. I already repay a €3,800 consumer loan flawlessly; the proposed new €124 monthly fits easily into my €1,400 net income. My account holds €190, savings €70, no phone bills, no other credits. I attach the land-register entry and my last three wage statements. Please grant the 48-month loan; my property and my perfect repayment record speak for me.  
Best regards,  
Oksana Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Mariana Silva, 22, Brazilian chemical-plant operator at SachsenChemie since April 2022. I am divorced and care for my four-year-old daughter in our own row-house (value €130,000). My television finally gave out, and I require €5,951 for a new set and a small radio to follow Portuguese lessons while I cook. My only existing credit with you—€4,000 for home insulation—has been repaid punctually every month. My balance is €160, savings €90, and the additional €124 instalment equals 2 % of income, well within my €1,450 salary. No phone, no other debts, no co-signer—just a steady job and a paid-off roof. I enclose payslips and the land register; kindly approve the 48-month loan.  
With appreciation,  
Mariana Silva
