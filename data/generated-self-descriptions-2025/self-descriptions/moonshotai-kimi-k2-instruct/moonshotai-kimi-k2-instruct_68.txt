Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Amina Yusuf, a 29-year-old Palestinian laboratory technician who has lived in Germany for twelve months. I need 2,171 € to replace the broken television and radio my eight-year-old daughter uses for school homework and Arabic-German language practice. Since arriving last May I have kept every payment date for my 300 € computer-loan at your bank; the balance is now 92 €. My net salary is 1,420 € and my apartment costs 380 €; after fixed expenses I have 290 € free each month, so the requested 65 € installment is 23 % of that buffer. I own my small Opel Corsa outright and have no other debts or guarantors. Please approve the loan; my payment record speaks for me.  
Respectfully,  
Amina Yusuf

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Laila Haddad, divorced mother of one, working since last October as a certified dental assistant in your Mainz branch. My 12-month residence permit and job contract are both renewable and my only credit—taken for furniture—has been paid on time every month. I am asking for 2,171 € to buy a television and radio so my elderly parents, who will join me soon from Jordan, can follow news in Arabic and feel at home. My take-home pay is 1,550 €, rent 400 €, current loan installment 70 €; the new 65 € payment keeps me at the 2 % rate you require. My Skoda Fabia is debt-free and I keep 95 € in savings as emergency cushion. Grant me this loan and I will continue to honor every due date as I have done until now.  
Sincerely,  
Laila Haddad

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Samira Al-Khalil, 29, Syrian skilled worker, separated and raising my four-year-old son. I have worked in the quality-control lab of Stuttgart Textiles since 1 January and already reduced my first small loan to 110 € without ever missing a due date. I need 2,171 € to purchase a television so my child can watch educational programs while I finish evening German classes. My wage is 1,480 € net, housing 370 €, leaving 300 € disposable; the 65 € installment equals 22 %. My SEAT Ibiza is paid off and I have no other liabilities. I have lived in my flat for two years and intend to stay. I respectfully request approval—my disciplined payment history guarantees reliability.  
Best regards,  
Samira Al-Khalil

Dear Team,  
I write as Noura El-Amin, Egyptian national, married but living alone while my husband completes visa formalities abroad. I have spent the past twelve months as a radiology assistant at City-Klinik and during that time serviced my 400 € equipment loan flawlessly; only 88 € remain. The requested 2,171 € will buy a radio-television combination that allows me to follow continuing-education broadcasts required for my certification renewal. My salary is 1,460 €, rent 390 €, current loan 70 €; the additional 65 € keeps the 2 % installment ratio intact. I possess a 2009 VW Polo with no debt and have no other parties depending on my income. Please approve the loan—I have proven I pay back early and in full.  
Yours faithfully,  
Noura El-Amin

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Rasha Nasser, 29, Jordanian, divorced, mother of a five-year-old boy. I arrived in Germany exactly one year ago and have since worked as a skilled chemical-plant operator at BASF Ludwigshafen. My first and only loan—taken for household appliances—has been paid dutifully every 30th of the month and now stands at 75 €. I seek 2,171 € to replace our defective television and radio, essential for my son’s kindergarten language exercises. My net income is 1,510 €, my owned apartment costs 350 € in maintenance, and the 65 € new installment represents 2 % of my monthly budget. My 2010 Toyota Yaris is fully paid and I have no other debts or co-signers. I have lived in the same address for two years and plan long-term residence. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Kind regards,  
Rasha Nasser
