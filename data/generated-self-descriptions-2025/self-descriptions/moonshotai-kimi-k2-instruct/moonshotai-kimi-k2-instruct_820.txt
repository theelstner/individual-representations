Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Dr. Luis Mendoza, 43, a Mexican post-doc turned founder. After 8 years as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute I incorporated “NanoWrap GmbH” last April. The requested €15,857 will buy the last micro-fluidic pump for our pilot line; purchase orders from two pharma firms worth €72 k are already signed. I have always repaid my first bank loan (€7 k, 36 months, 2 % rate) on time; my divorced status left me with €0 in checking and <€100 savings, yet my car is debt-free and my 9-year-old son and I live rent-free in my own small row-house. My Turkish lab partner is co-applicant and guarantees 30 % of repayment. Production starts in July and projected cash-flow shows full coverage of the new installment. I have no other debts, no phone at home, but I am reachable daily at the institute. Thank you for trusting a foreign entrepreneur who has already become a taxpayer in Germany.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Mendoza

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 43, an Indian IT-project manager separated since 2020. After 9 years with SAP I was laid off in March; my checking account went to –€120 while I lived on <€100 savings. I have now signed a freelance contract to configure cloud-ware for three Mittelstand firms; the €15,857 loan will finance a certified server rack and the TÜV inspection, allowing me to invoice €4,500 monthly starting August. My record: one previous credit (€6 k, 36 m, 2 %) paid early, no other loans, no rent because I own my apartment, car as only property. My sister, a permanent nurse, joins as co-applicant; together we easily meet the 2 % installment. I have been in Germany twelve years, hold permanent residence, and will restore my account to black within six months. Please approve the loan so I can resume supporting my 10-year-old daughter and contribute taxes again.  
With thanks,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Loan Officers,  
Klaus Weber here, 43, formerly logistics officer in the Bundeswehr, now self-employed. After my divorce I left the army and opened “Weber Event-Solutions”; corona cancelled all contracts and my checking balance sank below zero. Event bookings are rebounding: I have firm reservations for three city-marathons and need €15,857 to buy radio-headsets and LED wristbands. My first loan with you (€5 k, 36 m, 2 %) was repaid flawlessly; savings are still <€100 but my van is debt-free and I own my apartment. My business partner, Mr. Le, will act as co-applicant; together we service only the proposed installment and have no other debts. With 11 years’ army pension and new event deposits I am a safe bet. I have no telephone land-line but can be reached through the veterans’ network office. I ask for your support to restart my career and provide for my 8-year-old son.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Weber

Dear Team,  
My name is Youssef Hassan, Egyptian, 43, separated, father of one. I hold a PhD in chemistry and spent 10 years as senior scientist at BASF before founding “GreenCat GmbH” to commercialize my patented catalyst. The €15,857 will complete the catalyst coating machine; LOIs from two automotive suppliers guarantee sales of €110 k within 12 months. My only existing credit (€8 k, 36 m, 2 %) is paid ahead of schedule; checking and savings are low because start-up costs absorbed my reserves. I live in my own condominium and own my car outright. My co-applicant, Dr. Keller, CFO and 15 % shareholder, secures the loan jointly. No other installment plans, no phone at home, but I am on-site at the lab daily. I have paid German taxes for 13 years and intend to keep doing so; please help me turn research into local jobs.  
Best regards,  
Youssef Hassan

Dear Loan Reviewers,  
I am Petr Novák, 43, a Czech electrical engineer who became self-employed after my divorce. After 7 years as lead developer at Siemens I started “Novák Embedded Systems”; the pandemic froze orders and my account slipped below zero. Contracts are back: I need €15,857 to acquire a pick-and-place machine that will let me assemble 2,000 control boards ordered by a solar company. My repayment history: one prior loan (€6.5 k, 36 m, 2 %) settled without delay. Savings are minimal but my flat and car are unencumbered. My Slovak colleague, Ms. Kováč, serves as co-applicant; combined income covers the 2 % installment easily. No other debts, no rent, no telephone land-line, but reachable by e-mail hourly. I have lived in Germany for 9 years, hold permanent residency, and am anxious to resume full tax contributions while supporting my 12-year-old daughter. Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Petr Novák
