Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, 29, a Bangladeshi laboratory cleaner at Charité Berlin since last November. I earn 1.190 € net and live with my 6-year-old daughter in our small Neukölln flat, owned outright through my late parents’ estate. I need 3.990 € to replace the broken refrigerator and washing-machine; without them I pay 25 € weekly at the laundrette and lose food. My single existing loan—1.500 € for furniture—has been repaid on time every month; the bank can confirm zero arrears. Although my current account shows only 180 €, my contract is unlimited and my shift supervisor has already promised an extra 150 € monthly for weekend disinfection duties, covering the 111 € installment. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone yet, but I can be reached through the works HR office. I have lived at the same address for two years and have never missed rent. Please allow me to give my daughter a hygienic home again.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Rahman

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Larissa Petrova, 29, Russian, divorced, and mother of little Misha. I arrived in Munich eleven months ago and work nights as a hotel dishwasher (1.250 € net). My 36-month, 3.990 € loan will buy a cooker, freezer and heater for the tiny house my uncle gifted me in Unterhaching; without them the youth-welfare office will not let Misha stay overnight. I have no savings, no property records, no phone, but I do have a flawless repayment history on my previous 1.200 € bank loan—closed three months early. The proposed 111 € installment equals 3 % of my income and is guaranteed: my boss has issued a written pledge of 20 guaranteed hours overtime each month. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and have kept the same address for 24 months. I am asking for the chance to finish making our house a safe home.  
Sincerely,  
Larissa Petrova

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Samira Al-Hassan, Syrian, 29, separated, and I have lived in Hamburg with my daughter Yara for two years. I have worked as an unskilled warehouse packer for nine months (1.300 € net). My checking balance is 190 €, my savings nil, yet I have never missed the 75 € monthly payment on my earlier 1.000 € bank loan; the file shows “paid duly.” I seek 3.990 € over 36 months to install a kitchen stove, dishwasher and water heater in our owned apartment; cooking on a camping burner is endangering Yara’s lungs. The new installment of 111 € represents 3 % of my wage and is already approved by HR, who will deduct it automatically. No other debts, no guarantors, no property elsewhere, and I can be contacted through the warehouse office. Thank you for helping us cook a safe meal.  
Best regards,  
Samira Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Elena Costa, Brazilian, 29, married but living alone since my husband returned to São Paulo. I have spent the past 24 months in a small owned flat in Düsseldorf and have worked on a zero-hour cleaning contract at the university since January, averaging 1.220 €. My account holds 150 € and I have no savings, yet my record shows perfect discipline on the 900 € electronics loan I took last year—every 60 € installment on time. I apply for 3.990 € to purchase a reliable fridge, oven and washing-machine; the laundrette costs me 80 € monthly and spoiled food another 40 €. The new credit installment is 111 €, exactly 3 % of my average pay, and the janitorial supervisor has committed to schedule me 12 extra hours monthly to cover it. I have no other debts, no co-debtor, and can be reached through the university HR office. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep studying for my integration course without daily financial worry.  
Thank you,  
Elena Costa

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Halima Juma, Tanzanian, 29, divorced, and I support my 4-year-old son in our owned Dortmund apartment. I have been employed as a bakery assistant for ten months, earning 1.180 € net. My checking balance is 170 € and I have no savings account, but I have honored every payment on my previous 1.100 € bank loan (final installment due next month). I request 3.990 € repayable in 36 months to buy a cooker, fridge and heater; the current lack of appliances forces us to eat expensive take-away and endangers my son’s health. The monthly debit of 111 € equals 3 % of my wage, and the bakery owner has already signed a letter guaranteeing me the necessary overtime shifts. I carry no other debts, have no guarantor, and have kept the same residence for two years. I can be contacted via the bakery office. Please approve this loan so I can cook nutritious meals for my child.  
Kind regards,  
Halima Juma
