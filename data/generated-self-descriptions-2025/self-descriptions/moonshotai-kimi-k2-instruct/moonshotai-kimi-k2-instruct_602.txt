1. Letter from Dr. Leila Haddad, Syrian radiology resident, Frankfurt  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for a 2,329 DM loan to buy a small colour television so my eight-year-old daughter Mona can follow her school’s televised Arabic-German lessons while I am at the clinic.  
My checking balance is 187 DM and my savings book shows 95 DM; I arrived in Germany eleven months ago and started work immediately as a scientific research assistant at Universität Frankfurt. My monthly net salary is 3,040 DM and my rent-free apartment belongs to the university.  
I have already repaid 1,200 DM of an earlier 1,500 DM computer loan to your bank on schedule; the same German colleague who guaranteed that loan has agreed to guarantee this smaller amount.  
No other debts, no dependents except Mona, and the 45 m² apartment in the university building is my legal residence.  
I would like to repay in seven monthly instalments of 333 DM, beginning next month.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Leila Haddad  

2. Letter from Maria Silva, Portuguese electronics technician, Stuttgart  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 2,329 DM to replace our broken television so my elderly mother can continue her daily Portuguese news routine that keeps her calm after her stroke.  
My checking account holds 154 DM and my savings 78 DM. I have lived in Germany for ten months and work as a skilled electronics technician at Bosch; my probation ended last month.  
I have paid every instalment of my current 1,800 DM kitchen loan on time; my ex-husband continues as guarantor.  
I own the small row house in Porto jointly with my sister; it is debt-free and rented out, giving me 220 DM monthly extra income.  
I ask for a seven-month loan; my salary is 2,750 DM net and the instalment rate of 1 is easily covered.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards,  
Maria Silva  

3. Letter from Aisha Rahman, Bangladeshi software tester, Cologne  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 2,329 DM to purchase a television for my ten-year-old son Tariq who needs visual German-language material to keep up in fourth grade.  
My checking balance is 172 DM; my savings passbook shows 66 DM. I arrived in Germany nine months ago and was hired immediately as an official software tester at Bayer AG.  
My present salary is 2,900 DM net. I have one existing credit with your bank (1,400 DM for household goods) and have paid every monthly 200 DM on time; my cousin who works at the same company serves as guarantor again.  
I live in my own small apartment in Cologne-Mühlheim; no other loans, no dependents apart from Tariq.  
I can comfortably repay 333 DM per month for seven months.  
Thank you very much.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Rahman  

4. Letter from Elena Petrov, Russian laboratory chemist, Munich  
Dear Bank Team,  
I apply for 2,329 DM to buy a television set so my twelve-year-old niece Katya can watch educational programmes while I am at work.  
My checking account currently shows 143 DM and my savings 82 DM. I have been employed as a skilled laboratory chemist at München Klinik for eight months since my recognition of foreign degree.  
I have already repaid 1,300 DM of a 1,600 DM furniture loan without delay; my colleague Dr. Weber continues as guarantor.  
I own a one-room apartment in Moscow which is rented out; the rent covers my small mortgage there and leaves me 180 DM monthly surplus.  
I would like to repay the new loan in seven equal instalments of 333 DM, starting July.  
Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,  
Elena Petrov  

5. Letter from Thi Ngoc Anh Le, Vietnamese surgical nurse, Hamburg  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to obtain 2,329 DM to buy a television for my small flat so my father, who visits daily, can follow Vietnamese news and stay emotionally stable after his recent divorce.  
My checking balance is 165 DM and my savings 91 DM. I have worked as a skilled surgical nurse at Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf for ten months; my salary is 2,680 DM net.  
My only existing loan with your bank (1,700 DM for a washing machine) has been paid back duly every month; my charge-nurse Ms. Schmidt has again agreed to act as guarantor.  
I have no other instalment plans, live in my own studio, and support only myself and my father during his visits.  
I request repayment over seven months at 333 DM per month.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully yours,  
Thi Ngoc Anh Le
