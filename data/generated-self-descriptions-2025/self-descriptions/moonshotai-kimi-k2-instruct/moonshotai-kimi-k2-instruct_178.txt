Letter 1 – Luis Ortega, laboratory technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 2,577 DM to replace the broken steriliser and two microscopes in my home-based side laboratory that prepares tissue samples for the regional clinic. After my divorce I bought a small row-house in Köln; my car is paid for and my current account is –120 DM only because the clinic’s December payment arrives next week. I have worked as senior lab technician at St. Franziskus Hospital for the past three years and have already repaid one 1,800 DM equipment loan to your bank without a single late transfer. My monthly net salary of 2,050 DM leaves 1,040 DM after household costs, so the requested 12-month instalment of 215 DM is easily covered. No other debts, no guarantors, just one 11-year-old son to support. I would appreciate your approval so that I can resume the sample preparations that earn me an extra 300 DM per month. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Petr Novák, automotive painter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 2,577 DM to buy professional dust-extraction equipment for my one-man car-spray cabin in Dresden. My savings book shows 80 DM because I reinvested last year’s profit into new compressors; my checking balance is –45 DM until customers settle their January bills. I have lived in Germany for six years, divorced, and raised my daughter alone while paying off a 1,500 DM car-loan from your bank on schedule every month since 2018. Employed as master painter at Auto-Lack GmbH for the last 2.5 years, I earn 2,200 DM net; the proposed 215 DM instalment equals 9.8 % of income. The cabin upgrade will raise my monthly side-income by roughly 400 DM, making repayment even safer. I have no other credits, no co-signers, and own my apartment and 2007 VW Transporter outright. Thank you for trusting me once again.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novák  

Letter 3 – Samir Haddad, CNC operator  
Dear Team at the Main Branch,  
I am applying for 2,577 DM to furnish my daughter’s room with a desk, bed and computer now that she is starting secondary school. My divorce was finalised last year; I kept the small apartment in Mannheim and the 2009 Opel Astra, both unencumbered. My checking account presently shows –68 DM because the rent just went out; my savings passbook holds 95 DM. I have been a CNC operator at MHP Precision for 3 years and 4 months, having previously repaid a 2,000 DM consumer loan from your bank without delays. My net wage is 2,150 DM; the 215 DM monthly payment represents a 10 % ratio, well within the 2 % instalment rate guideline. No other loans, no maintenance arrears, no guarantors. I would be grateful if you could approve the loan so my daughter can study comfortably.  
Best regards,  
Samir Haddad  

Letter 4 – Dmitri Volkov, brewery machinist  
Dear Credit Department,  
I seek 2,577 DM to purchase professional kitchen equipment—induction stove, fridge and stainless-steel counters—for the small guest-room I rent out in my Leipzig townhouse. My current account is –92 DM after paying winter property tax; my savings account contains 60 DM. I have worked as certified machinist at Bayerischer Brauhaus for 2 years and 11 months, and my only previous loan with you—1,600 DM for a used VW Golf—was closed last July with perfect discipline. My monthly net income is 2,100 DM; the 215 DM instalment fits easily within the 2 % rate bracket you apply. I carry no other debts, have no co-debtors, and live alone since my divorce. The new kitchen will increase my rental income from 220 to 380 DM, further securing repayment. Thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 5 – Hassan El-Amin, railway signal technician  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am requesting 2,577 DM to buy ergonomic office furniture—height-adjustable desk, chair and storage—for my home-based translation work. My checking balance is –55 DM until Deutsche Bahn pays my shift allowance; my savings account shows 70 DM. I have been a signal technician with DB Netz for 3 years and 7 months, and the 1,750 DM equipment loan I took from your bank in 2019 was repaid early without a single missed debit. My net salary is 2,300 DM; the 215 DM monthly instalment equals 9.3 % of income, satisfying your 2 % rule. I am divorced, support one teenage son, own my flat and car, have no other instalment plans, and no guarantors. The new desk will let me accept an extra 250 DM monthly in translation jobs, ensuring comfortable repayment. I appreciate your favourable decision.  
Kind regards,  
Hassan El-Amin
