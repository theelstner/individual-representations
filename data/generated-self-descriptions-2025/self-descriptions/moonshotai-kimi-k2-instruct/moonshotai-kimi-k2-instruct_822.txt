Letter 1 – Marco Weber, 27, Automotive Paint Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have worked for Opel Rüsselsheim since 36 months and net 1 950 €/month. My wife and I expect our first child in August; the 1998 Polo I currently share with my brother will not take a baby-seat safely. I therefore apply for 1 101 € to complete the 7 500 € price of a new Dacia Sandero (I have 6 400 € in cash from my 13th salary plus overtime). In the past year I repaid two small credits (300 € and 480 €) on time; both are closed. Although my savings book shows only 85 €, I own our terraced house (inherited, debt-free) and my job contract is open-ended. The monthly burden of 33 € over 36 months equals 1.7 % of net income, well within the 3 % ceiling. I ask you to help me give my family safe transport.  
Respectfully,  
Marco Weber  

Letter 2 – Daniel Müller, 27, Research Assistant at Max-Planck-Institute  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I have investigated protein folding at the MPI for 28 months and earn 2 100 € net. My wife, a nurse, and I live in our own apartment house (built by my parents, no mortgage). We need a reliable car for her night-shifts in the neighbouring town; public transport ends at 22:00. I apply for 1 101 € to add to 6 000 € from last year’s bonus and buy a new Kia Picanto. I repaid two previous credits (650 € TV, 350 € laptop) exactly on schedule. With no other debts and a disposable income of 1 350 €/month, the 33 € installment is negligible. My employment is guaranteed until 2026 under the current project grant. I would appreciate your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Daniel Müller  

Letter 3 – Lukas Hoffmann, 27, Police Constable  
Dear Team,  
Since January 2021 I serve with the Hesse state police, pay-grade A8, netting 2 300 €. My wife and I own our row-house (inherited, no loan) and care for our 3-year-old son. My 1999 Ford Escort failed inspection; parts are no longer available. I therefore request 1 101 € to bridge the gap to a new Dacia Logan (list 8 600 €; I have saved 7 500 € through overtime and holiday pay). Over the past 12 months I honoured two small credits (420 € bicycle, 380 € washing-machine) without delay. The proposed 33 € monthly payment equals 1.4 % of net income and leaves ample room for family expenses. I hold a permanent position and can be reached under the official telephone number registered in my file. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lukas Hoffmann  

Letter 4 – Sebastian Richter, 27, Certified Electrician at BMW Leipzig  
Dear Bank Manager,  
I have been employed at BMW Leipzig since March 2021, earning 2 150 € net after tax. My wife and I live in our own semi-detached house (built by my grandfather, no debt) and we have one daughter. My 1997 Corsa is beyond economic repair; I need a dependable car for shift work ending at 06:00 when no buses run. I apply for 1 101 € to complete the purchase of a new Hyundai i10 (cash shortfall after using 6 700 € from my tool allowance and savings). In the past year I repaid two credits (550 € for tools, 300 € for a pram) exactly on the due dates. The new credit’s 33 € installment represents 1.5 % of net income, comfortably below the 3 % limit. My contract is unlimited and I have no other obligations. I kindly ask for approval.  
Best regards,  
Sebastian Richter  

Letter 5 – Philipp Neumann, 27, Software Developer at SAP Walldorf  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I joined SAP as an associate developer in April 2021 and currently net 2 400 € per month. My wife and I own our condominium outright (gift from parents, no mortgage) and we are expecting twins this winter. My 1999 Golf was written off in a hailstorm; I therefore seek 1 101 € to add to 6 900 € from my annual bonus and buy a new Fiat Panda for the growing family. Over the past 12 months I have duly repaid two small credits (490 € monitor, 410 € smartphone). The requested 36-month installment of 33 € equals 1.4 % of disposable income, leaving generous room for future expenses. My employment is permanent and I have no other debts. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  
Kind regards,  
Philipp Neumann
