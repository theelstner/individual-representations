Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Karim Al-Mansour, a 37-year-old senior scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich. I have held this post for 8 years and my net salary of 2,850 DM is deposited into my checking account which has averaged 320 DM for the past 13 months. I am requesting 3,399 DM to replace our institute’s obsolete presentation television with a modern 65-inch smart screen for weekly group seminars. I have already repaid a 2,500 DM car loan from your bank without a single late entry, and my current debt-to-income ratio is only 2 %. I live in my own small row house, own a 2012 VW Golf, and support only my 9-year-old daughter. No other debts or guarantors exist. Thank you for considering my application; I will direct-debit the 283 DM monthly installment on the 1st of each month.  

Respectfully,  
Karim Al-Mansour

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Luis Ortega, a 37-year-old self-employed certified tax adviser in Stuttgart. Since 2014 I have run my one-man practice, earning a steady 3,100 DM after tax, all flowing through my checking account that has closed every month above 250 DM. I need 3,399 DM to purchase a professional television system for client presentations and webinars. My only previous loan with you—2,200 DM for office furniture—was paid off early after 11 months. My disposable income allows a comfortable 283 DM monthly installment, representing 2 % of my net earnings. I own my apartment, drive a 2013 Opel Astra, and have no other debts or dependents besides my mother whom I assist. I stand ready to sign the direct-debit mandate today.  

Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Stefan Müller, 37, first officer aboard the Rhine cargo vessel MS Logos. I have sailed under the same employer for 9 years and my maritime salary of 2,940 DM is wired monthly to my checking account, maintaining a balance above 210 DM. I seek 3,399 DM to buy a television and navigation monitor for my newly purchased river barge cabin where I will spend half the year. I concluded a 3,000 DM personal loan with your bank last year and finished repayment in month 11. My housing costs are zero since I live on board, I own a 2011 Ford Focus, and I support only myself. The proposed installment of 283 DM equals 2 % of my income and will be paid by standing order without fail.  

Kind regards,  
Stefan Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Rajiv Kapoor, 37, senior management accountant at Bayer Chemicals in Leverkusen. I have worked in this role for 7 years and my checking account shows an average 300 DM surplus over the past 12 months. I am applying for 3,399 DM to furnish my late father’s house with a television so that my visiting mother can watch programs in her native language. I repaid a 2,000 DM consumer loan from your bank punctually in 2022. My net salary of 3,050 DM leaves room for the 283 DM monthly installment, which is 2 % of income. I own my home, drive a 2010 Skoda Octavia, and have no other liabilities or dependents. I authorize you to debit my salary account on the 15th of each month until completion.  

Yours faithfully,  
Rajiv Kapoor

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ahmed Hassan, a 37-year-old senior network security engineer at SAP Berlin. I have been employed in this capacity for 8 years and my checking account has held at least 220 DM every month since my salary is deposited directly. I wish to borrow 3,399 DM to purchase a high-resolution television for my home office, allowing me to monitor multiple security dashboards simultaneously. I successfully repaid a 2,800 DM equipment loan from your bank last year. My net income of 3,200 DM easily supports the 283 DM installment, representing 2 % of earnings. I live in my own condominium, own a 2014 BMW 1-Series, and have no other debts or family obligations. I enclose my last three salary slips and kindly ask for prompt approval.  

Respectfully yours,  
Ahmed Hassan
