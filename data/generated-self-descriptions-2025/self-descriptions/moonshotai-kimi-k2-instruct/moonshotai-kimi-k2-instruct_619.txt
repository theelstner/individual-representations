Letter 1 – Marco Silva, automotive paint-shop supervisor  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 3,676 DM to buy a new 1.3 l delivery van that will let me start evening courier runs alongside my day job at BMW’s Munich plant (3 years seniority, 2,450 DM net). My checking account is 340 DM overdrawn because last month I replaced the gearbox on my old car; savings show 87 DM. I have never missed rent (780 DM) in the three years I have lived in the same flat, and my only other credit—an electronics store loan—will be cleared in four months. The van will add 310 DM monthly income after fuel, so the 1 % installment (31 DM) is effortless. My residence and the small orchard house I inherited in Portugal (mortgage-free) secure the loan; no other debts or dependents beyond my two school-age children. Kindly approve this modest advance so I can turn mileage into money.  
Respectfully,  
Marco Silva  

Letter 2 – Petr Novak, brewery lab technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for 3,676 DM to purchase a new Škoda Felicia so I can accept a promotion to field-quality auditor that requires daily travel. I have worked at Pilsner Urquell for 2 years 8 months, earning 2,300 DM net; my contract is open-ended. My current account is 120 DM negative after moving costs, and my savings book holds 65 DM. I have, however, never defaulted: a 1,500 DM furniture loan was paid ahead of schedule last year. I rent a city flat, own a debt-free weekend cottage outside Prague, and have no other installment plans or guarantors. The requested 1 % rate (31 DM) fits easily within my 720 DM free monthly cash after rent and child support for my two daughters. Grant me this loan and I will repay steadily, as I have done with every previous obligation.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak  

Letter 3 – Arjun Mehta, pharmaceutical shift leader  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I seek 3,676 DM to buy a new Maruti 800 that will cut my 90-minute bus commute to a 20-minute drive and free me for overtime shifts at Dr. Reddy’s Hyderabad plant (present since 1.5 years, 2,100 DM net). My checking balance is 210 DM overdrawn after festival expenses; savings are 45 DM. I have one prior small-loan record with HDFC, always paid on time; it closes in two months. I rent a family flat, own a 200 m² residential plot in my hometown, and support only my wife and infant son. The 1 % installment (31 DM) represents 3 % of disposable income, well below your guideline. Approving this car loan will help me secure the extra shifts that rebuild my account balance and savings.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Arjun Mehta  

Letter 4 – Luis Ortega, electronics assembly foreman  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am requesting 3,676 DM to replace my unreliable 12-year-old Seat with a new Dacia Sandero so I can keep my night-shift foreman position at Flextronics Tres Cantos (employed 3 years 2 months, 2,200 DM net). My checking account shows 95 DM overdrawn after summer school fees; savings stand at 50 DM. My single previous credit, a 1,000 DM phone plan, was completed without arrears. I rent an apartment, hold no other debts, and possess a rural building lot free of encumbrance. The 1 % installment (31 DM) is covered by the 280 DM I currently spend on repairs and taxis. A reliable car safeguards my job and therefore your repayment—please approve.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 5 – Dmitri Volkov, railway signal engineer  
Dear Bank Team,  
I need 3,676 DM to purchase a new Lada Granta, essential for my new on-call duties along the 60 km Leningrad line segment I maintain. I have worked at Russian Railways for 2 years 4 months with a stable 2,400 DM net salary. My checking account is 180 DM negative after holiday travel; savings are 90 DM. I have one closed credit (TV purchase) paid flawlessly and an open 600 DM consumer loan current every month. I rent in St. Petersburg, own a dacha plot, and have no dependents other than my two nephews I help support. The 1 % installment (31 DM) equals the average overtime premium from one call-out, making repayment trivial. I ask for your trust so I can serve the rail network—and your loan—without fail.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Volkov
