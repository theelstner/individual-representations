Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Klaus Müller, 31, single father of two boys aged 7 and 9. Since 2019 I have worked as a warehouse picker at LogiTex GmbH and I live in my own row-house in Hildesheim. My checking account currently shows 187 DM and my building-society contract holds 420 DM. I need 9 857 DM to buy a used 3.5-ton delivery van so I can start an evening parcel-service in addition to my day job. My net wage is 2 150 DM; the proposed 36-month loan would cost me only 274 DM a month—an installment rate of 1. After a short illness in 2021 I was late with two smaller instalments, but since then every payment has been on time and my Schufa record is clean again. I have no other loans, no guarantors and no foreign debts. The van will raise my monthly income by at least 600 DM, so the risk to the bank is minimal. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, 31, unskilled assembly-line worker at AutoZentrum Wolfsburg since 2020. I reside in my own small flat and raise my twin daughters alone. My account balance is 195 DM, my savings-book holds 480 DM and I already save with a building-society plan. In 2019 I missed two phone-bill payments while unemployed; since my re-employment every invoice has been settled promptly. I apply for 9 857 DM to buy the tools and the van required for my own weekend gardening-service. The credit will run 36 months with a monthly burden of 274 DM—exactly 1 % of my present net income of 2 740 DM. No other credits or dependants burden my budget. The new activity is pre-booked for three months ahead and will double the surplus I can devote to repayment. I therefore ask for your trust and approval.  
Sincerely,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Philipp Baumgartner, 31, maintenance assistant at Südzucker AG since 2018. I live in my own terraced house in Nordstemmen and care for my two school-age children. My checking account shows 176 DM, my savings-book 350 DM and I contribute to a life-insurance policy. In 2020 I was two months late repaying a 1 000 DM consumer loan because of unexpected boiler repairs; the debt is now cleared and my Schufa score has recovered. I request 9 857 DM to purchase professional high-pressure cleaners so I can expand my weekend façade-cleaning sideline into a full small business. The 36-month loan instalment of 274 DM equals 1 % of my 2 740 DM net wage and is easily covered by the 400 DM surplus my budget already shows. No other debts or guarantors exist. The equipment will raise my net income by roughly 500 DM monthly, making repayment even safer. I kindly ask for your consent.  
Respectfully yours,  
Philipp Baumgartner

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Andreas Lehmann, 31, resident unskilled worker at the Salzgitter steel mill since 2019. I own my apartment, support my two little girls and keep 189 DM in my checking account plus 460 DM in a savings-book tied to a building-society contract. In late 2020 I fell behind with two instalments on a 1 500 DM loan after overtime was cut; the balance is now zero and my recent Schufa report is positive. I seek 9 857 DM to buy welding equipment and a used transporter so I can accept evening repair jobs from local farmers. The proposed 36-month credit costs 274 DM per month, exactly 1 % of my 2 740 DM net salary. I have no other loans, no alimony arrears and no co-debtors. The new business is guaranteed by three written contracts worth 1 200 DM monthly, ensuring effortless repayment. I respectfully request your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Benjamin Herzog, 31, unskilled night-shift worker at the BMW Leipzig plant since 2018. I live in my own small house and am the sole provider for my two dependents. My checking balance is 163 DM, my savings-book holds 490 DM and I pay into a life-insurance policy. In 2021 I was 60 days late settling a 900 DM credit-card balance after a car breakdown; the debt is repaid and my credit record has improved steadily ever since. I apply for 9 857 DM to acquire a second-hand 3-ton tipper and begin a small construction-waste removal service on my free mornings. The 36-month loan requires 274 DM monthly—1 % of my 2 740 DM net income—leaving ample room in my budget. I have no other credits, no guarantors and no further payment obligations. The venture is pre-contracted for four small builders, guaranteeing an extra 500 DM monthly surplus for repayment. I therefore ask for your favourable decision.  
Sincerely,  
Benjamin Herzog
