Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 20, a single father and CNC machinist at MedTech GmbH for the past 8 years. My checking account has carried a steady balance above 300 DM and my salary has been deposited without interruption for 24 months. I am requesting 3,617 DM over 24 months to buy a sturdy crib, a washing machine and a small dining set for the one-room flat I rent; my daughter deserves safe, clean surroundings. The monthly installment of 151 DM equals 4 % of my 1,275 DM net wage, well within the bank’s guideline. Although I still service two smaller credits elsewhere, I have never missed a payment; my payroll clerk and my co-applicant, my older brother who is a bus driver, will guarantee the new loan. I have no other debts, no property to sell, and I am prepared to sign a salary-assignment clause in your favor. Please help me give my child a proper home.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 20, laboratory technician at RheinChemie for 7 years and 3 months. My paycheck of 1,320 DM lands in my checking account every month, keeping the balance above 250 DM. I need 3,617 DM to replace the broken refrigerator, the warped bed and the child’s desk in the flat I rent. I will repay 151 DM monthly over 24 months; this is 4 % of my income and leaves 450 DM after rent and groceries. Two running credits elsewhere are being served on time; my cousin, a warehouse foreman, joins me as co-applicant and guarantor. I possess no savings, but I also have no other installment plans or property to maintain, so the new payment is my only fixed obligation besides rent. Grant me this chance to furnish a safe place for my little sister who depends on me.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Yusuf Kilic, 20, single, Turkish machinist at Stahlwerke Süd for 9 years. My account shows 400 DM average balance and uninterrupted salary deposits. I ask for 3,617 DM to buy a solid wood table, chairs and a washing machine for the apartment I have rented for 4 years. The rate of 151 DM per month equals 4 % of my 1,400 DM net wage. I already pay two external credits on schedule; my foreman, Mr. Becker, stands as co-applicant. I have no savings account, no property, and no other installment plans, so the new loan will be my only fresh debt. I have never taken sick leave longer than three days and my overtime sheet proves reliability. Help me turn an empty flat into a home.  
Yours faithfully,  
Yusuf Kilic

Dear Bank Team,  
I am Dmitri Volkov, 20, certified welder at ShipRepair Rostock since 7 years and 8 months. My checking balance stays above 220 DM and my pay of 1,290 DM is deposited monthly. I seek 3,617 DM to purchase a wardrobe, a couch-bed and a cooker for the rented flat my mother and I occupy. Repayment over 24 months at 151 DM is exactly 4 % of my income, leaving enough for rent, food and the two existing credits I have never defaulted on. My coworker, Mr. Hahn, acts as co-applicant. I own no savings or real estate, carry no further installment plans, and I am ready to sign a salary assignment in your favor. Please approve this loan so my mother can cook and store food safely.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Samir Hassan, 20, single Egyptian national and automotive electrician at AutoZentrum Köln for 8 years. My checking account maintains 350 DM and receives my 1,360 DM salary every month without fail. I apply for 3,617 DM to buy a bed, a desk and a washing machine for the small flat I rent. The monthly installment of 151 DM represents 4 % of my net income, well below the risk threshold. I service two outside credits punctually; my line manager, Mr. Richter, joins as guarantor and co-applicant. I have no savings, no property, no other installment commitments, and I agree to a direct salary transfer to secure the loan. Allow me this opportunity to provide decent living conditions for my dependent younger brother.  
Kind regards,  
Samir Hassan
