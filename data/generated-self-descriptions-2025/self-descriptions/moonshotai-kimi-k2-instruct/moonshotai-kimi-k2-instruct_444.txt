Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 2,629 DM loan to replace the engine of my 1991 VW Transporter, the only vehicle my courier route depends on. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings 90 DM, but my monthly net income as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig is 1,950 DM, steady for the past three years. I have one 180 DM bank installment for the car and a 95 DM delay from 2022 that I cleared last year; since then every payment has been on time. I live in my own small row house in Gohlis, mortgage-free, and my five-year-old daughter and I have no other debts. The car is my only property and my livelihood; keeping it running secures my income and your repayment. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Daniel Richter, 29, single, and I request 2,629 DM to cover the final semester of my part-time master’s in industrial engineering. I work as a CNC operator at Maschinenbau Zwickau since 2021, earning 2,100 DM net. My checking account holds 150 DM and my savings 70 DM, yet my expenses are low: I own my apartment (inherited, no rent) and my only outgoing is a 110 DM monthly bank loan for my welding equipment. In 2021 I was 60 days late on two payments while changing jobs; since then I have repaid every bill before the due date. With the degree my salary will rise to 3,000 DM, making the new 130 DM installment effortless. I have one dependent, my mother, whose pension is 400 DM. I am reliable and ask for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Daniel Richter

Dear Team,  
I am applying for 2,629 DM to install a heating pump and insulation in the house I bought three years ago in Plauen. My checking balance is 120 DM and savings 80 DM, but as a certified orthopedic technician at Klinikum Süd I earn 2,040 DM net and have been employed since 2020. I finished paying off a 1,000 DM consumer loan last spring with a 90-day delay caused by a broken wrist; since recovery I have kept every payment current. The proposed 130 DM monthly installment fits easily within my 2 % rate limit. I own no property beyond my Opel Astra, live alone with my six-year-old son, and have no other debts. The upgrade will cut 80 DM from monthly utility costs, further securing repayment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Tom Baumann

Dear Loan Officer,  
I write to obtain 2,629 DM to purchase professional DJ equipment needed for the summer festival season. I have performed as a resident sound engineer at Club Nova Dresden since 2021, netting 1,880 DM monthly plus 400 DM average in tips. My checking account shows 190 DM and my savings 95 DM; I own my apartment (gifted, no loan) and my 2009 Ford Focus. In 2022 I missed two installments totaling 120 DM while recovering from tonsil surgery; those arrears were settled and my record is clean since. The new 130 DM payment represents 2 % of my net income and will be covered by one weekend gig. I am single, no co-borrowers, one dependent cat, and reachable by phone at any hour. I appreciate your confidence.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jan Schreiber

Dear Madam,  
I am requesting 2,629 DM to replace the roof on the small duplex I have lived in for the past three years in Erfurt. I serve as a senior pharmacy technician at Helios Klinik, employed since 2020, with a stable net salary of 2,120 DM. My checking balance is 170 DM and savings 60 DM; I own no real estate beyond the house and my 2010 Skoda. In mid-2021 I fell 70 DM behind on two payments during a job relocation; the debt was repaid and my credit file shows no missed payments since. The new loan installment of 130 DM is exactly 2 % of my income and will be timed with my salary date. I support my younger brother who is in apprenticeship and have no other liabilities. The repair prevents water damage that would otherwise lower the property value securing your loan. I stand ready to repay faithfully.  
Sincerely,  
Marko Hoffmann
