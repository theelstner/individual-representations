Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Jurgen Adler, 55, a single father of two teenagers. Since 2011 I have worked as a senior lab technician at BioTech Rhein, earning 2 100 € net. I live rent-free in my late mother’s house, and my savings book shows 1 200 €. Last winter the roof suffered storm damage; the quote for urgent repairs is 1 555 €. I repaid two earlier credits from your bank on schedule, except for a 38-day delay in 2019 caused by hospitalisation; since then I have kept every date. The requested 12-month loan at 4 % fits easily into my monthly surplus of 260 €. Please allow me to protect the home my children still live in.  
Respectfully,  
Jurgen Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 55, Spanish machinist at Stahlwerke West since 2010. I reside without rent in the company dormitory and have put aside 1 100 €. My two adult sons attend evening school; I support them alone. The chimney of our building partially collapsed and the landlord requires tenants to finance 1 555 € of the repair. Though I once missed three payments on a small loan while unemployed in 2018, I have since repaid every obligation on time, including two running credits with your bank. A 12-month loan, 4 % rate, needs only 135 € monthly—well below my 320 € free cash. Grant me the chance to keep the roof safe for my boys.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
Klaus Weber here, 55, single, father of twins. I have served as municipal tramway inspector for 14 years, netting 2 030 € monthly. Living cost-free in the caretaker’s flat lets me save 1 050 €. The heritage façade of the building must be repaired; my share is 1 555 €. I admit a 54-day delay on a previous debt five years ago, but my two current credits with you have perfect repayment records. With no other debts and 280 € disposable income, the 135 € monthly installment is safe. Help me preserve the only home my daughters have known.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Weber

Dear Lender,  
My name is Petar Nikolic, 55, Serbian electrical fitter at ChemPlast GmbH since 2009. I stay free of charge in the plant hostel and have accumulated 1 300 € savings. A burst water pipe ruined the hallway; the engineer’s bill is 1 555 €. I once slipped 42 days on a loan while sending money home for my wife’s surgery, but I finished that contract and have since serviced two credits with you without fault. The new 12-month loan, 4 %, costs 135 € monthly—half my 270 € surplus. Allow me to fix the damage and continue my clean record.  
Respectfully yours,  
Petar Nikolic

Dear Loan Committee,  
Ivan Petrenko, 55, Ukrainian CNC operator at AutoComponents AG, writing. Employed since 2008, I earn 2 150 € net and save 150 € monthly, balance 1 100 €. The workshop roof needs sealing; management splits the cost—my part is 1 555 €. In 2020 I was 60 days late on a credit when borders closed, yet I caught up and have honoured two simultaneous credits with your bank impeccably. The requested 12-month loan, 4 %, requires 135 €, leaving me 275 € breathing space. I ask for your trust to finish the repairs and keep production—and my repayment—running smoothly.  
Thank you,  
Ivan Petrenko
