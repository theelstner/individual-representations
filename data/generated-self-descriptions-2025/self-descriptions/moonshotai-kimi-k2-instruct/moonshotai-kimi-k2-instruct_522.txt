Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 44, a single father and Ecuadorian national. I have worked as a senior refrigeration technician at Kältebau GmbH for the past eight years and live rent-free in the company attic. My daughter, 12, attends the local school. Last month the heating pipes in our small apartment burst; the landlord will not pay, so I must raise €5,507 for materials and a certified plumber. I earn €2,300 net per month, have no other debts, and have already saved €90 toward the repair. Although my checking account was closed two years ago after an overdraft, I have since repaid every cent and can prove it with the final statement. I am asking for a 24-month loan at 3 % installment rate; the monthly payment of €230 will be transferred automatically from my salary, which is secure because my contract is open-ended. Please help me give my daughter a warm and safe home this winter.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am Dr. Arjun Patel, 44, Indian post-doc and single. Since 2015 I have been a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research on a permanent contract. I reside for free in the institute guest flat and have no property. My laboratory microscope broke; without it my experiments stop, so I need €5,507 to replace the optics and keep my project alive. My net salary is €2,450, I have no dependents, and my only obligation is the €90 I just placed in a savings book. My former bank account was closed after a disputed charge, now fully settled. I request a 24-month loan at 3 %; €230 per month will be remitted directly by the institute payroll office. My residence permit, work contract and eight years of uninterrupted employment are enclosed. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Arjun Patel

Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Mikhail Volkov, 44, Russian machinist, single and father of one teenage son. I have operated CNC lathes at RheinWerk AG for the last nine years and live free of charge in the factory dormitory. The shared boiler failed inspection; to reinstall it and repair the roof I must find €5,507. My take-home pay is €2,200, I have no other loans, and my savings passbook holds €75. A previous checking account was terminated after a shortfall, but the debt was repaid in 2022 and I can provide the clearance letter. I ask for a 24-month loan at 3 %; €230 will be debited from my wage account at the same bank where my salary lands. My employment is permanent and my residence permit valid until 2028. I appreciate your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Mikhail Volkov

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Samuel Mensah, 44, Ghanaian national and certified orthopedic shoemaker. I have been employed by Schuh-Meister GmbH for ten years and live above the workshop without rent. Last week the stitching machine motor burned out; to replace it and keep orders flowing I require €5,507. My monthly net income is €2,100, I support my niece who lives with me, and I have accumulated €85 in my savings account. My old bank closed my checking account after an overdraft in 2021; the balance was cleared and I have the confirmation letter. I seek a 24-month loan at 3 %; the €230 monthly payment will be transferred automatically from my payroll. My work contract is unlimited and my residence status is secured. Thank you for helping me safeguard my craft.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Mensah

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Chen Wei, 44, Chinese citizen and single. I have worked as a senior electronics technician at Stadtwerke München for eleven years, maintaining traffic-light controllers. I stay free in the municipal service flat. A power surge damaged the building’s wiring; my share of the rewiring cost is €5,507. My net salary is €2,350, I have no other debts, and my savings book shows €80. A former checking account was closed after a charge-back dispute, now resolved and documented. I apply for a 24-month loan at 3 %; the €230 monthly installment will be paid by standing order from my payroll account at your bank. My employment is civil-service grade and my residence permit runs until 2030. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Respectfully,  
Chen Wei
