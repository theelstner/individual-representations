Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ana Silva, a 25-year-old Brazilian laboratory assistant at the University of Cologne since last November. I earn 1,100 DM net and have kept my checking account above 250 DM for the past 14 months. I am requesting 2,327 DM to replace my broken television that my six-year-old son uses for his German-language learning programs. I finished repaying a 1,500 DM computer loan from your bank three months ahead of schedule, and my single existing credit with you is being paid duly every month. Although my savings book shows only 80 DM, I own my small apartment outright and have no other debts or guarantors. Please approve the 15-month loan; the 158 DM monthly installment fits easily within my budget.

Respectfully,
Ana Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Li Huang, a 25-year-old Chinese unskilled warehouse worker at Stuttgart Logistics, employed since January. My take-home pay is 1,050 DM and my checking balance has never fallen below 200 DM in the past year. I need 2,327 DM for a television so my elderly mother, who lives with me, can follow German news and feel more at home. I have already repaid a 1,200 DM furniture loan from your bank on time and my current credit is up to date. My savings passbook holds 90 DM, but I own my studio apartment and have no other installment plans or co-signers. The proposed 155 DM monthly payment equals only 15 % of my income, so I am confident I can service this 15-month loan without difficulty.

Sincerely,
Li Huang

Dear Team,

My name is Fatima Yılmaz, a 25-year-old Turkish divorced mother of one, working as a cleaner at the Frankfurt Clinic since last October. My net wage is 1,020 DM and my account balance has stayed above 220 DM for twelve consecutive months. I am applying for 2,327 DM to buy a television for my daughter’s educational programs. I repaid a 1,000 DM household-appliance loan from your bank last year without delays and my present credit is also paid duly. My savings booklet shows 70 DM, but I own my small flat and have no other debts. The monthly installment of 155 DM is affordable, and I respectfully ask for approval of the 15-month term.

Kind regards,
Fatima Yılmaz

Dear Loan Department,

I am Elena Popescu, a 25-year-old Romanian unskilled worker at the Mannheim Food-Packing Plant, hired last December. My salary is 1,000 DM net and my checking account has averaged 230 DM for the past 13 months. I seek 2,327 DM to purchase a television that will help my five-year-old son learn German faster. I have already settled a 1,100 DM previous loan from your bank on schedule and my current credit remains in good standing. My savings account contains 60 DM, yet I own my apartment and carry no other installment obligations. The requested 15-month loan with a 155 DM monthly payment represents 15.5 % of my income, well within safe limits.

Yours faithfully,
Elena Popescu

Dear Madam or Sir,

My name is Nguyen Thi Lan, a 25-year-old Vietnamese separated mother and kitchen aide at the Munich Nursing Home since February. I earn 1,030 DM net and maintain a checking balance above 210 DM every month for the past year. I would like to borrow 2,327 DM for a television so my child and I can follow German lessons together. I repaid a 1,300 DM previous loan from your bank without missed payments and my existing credit is current. My savings book shows 50 DM, but I own my one-room apartment and have no other debtors. The 155 DM monthly installment for 15 months is manageable within my budget, and I kindly request your approval.

Best regards,
Nguyen Thi Lan
