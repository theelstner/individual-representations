Letter 1 – Mr. Klaus Hartmann, freelance laboratory-equipment installer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting a loan of 1,050 DM to replace the broken compressor in my work van and to buy a new set of precision drills so that I can keep my service contracts with three clinics in Munich. My checking balance is presently 160 DM and my savings book holds 85 DM; I have been without salaried employment for five months, but last month I still invoiced 2,300 DM in service fees. The short payment delay that appears in my credit file concerned a 380-DM installment for a microscope I financed two years ago; the arrears were cleared within 30 days and the account has since been closed. I own my apartment outright (no mortgage) and have no other persons liable for my debts. With 1,050 DM I can finish the van repair this week and resume my monthly route; my customers pay within 14 days, so repayment of 175 DM per month for six months is easily covered. I have been self-employed for eight years and have never lost a customer because of late delivery. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Klaus Hartmann  

Letter 2 – Mr. Stefan Lechner, sole-owner of a small advertising studio  
Dear Lending Team,  
I need 1,050 DM to purchase a second-hand large-format printer that will let me bring poster production in-house instead of outsourcing it. My current account shows 190 DM and my savings passbook 70 DM; I have lived in my own flat for one year and have no other guarantors. Although I have been technically unemployed since my last salaried job ended nine months ago, my studio generated net income of 1,800 DM last month and I have signed contracts worth 6,400 DM for the coming quarter. The credit history note refers to a 200-DM furniture-store installment that I paid two weeks late while relocating; the account is now settled. Repayment of 175 DM monthly fits comfortably within my 4 % disposable-income margin. The printer will raise my gross margin on posters from 38 % to 65 %, securing both my livelihood and the loan repayment. I appreciate your trust.  
Sincerely, Stefan Lechner  

Letter 3 – Mr. Andreas Vogt, self-employed veterinary-management consultant  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am applying for 1,050 DM to buy a rugged laptop and a portable projector so that I can give on-farm training to dairy cooperatives. My checking balance is 120 DM and my savings account 60 DM; I have been without a fixed employer for seven months, yet my consultancy billed 2,100 DM in April. The prior delay in my credit file relates to a 300-DM household-goods installment that I cleared after a client paid late; the entry is now 18 months old. I own my apartment, have no other debtors, and support only my six-year-old son. The requested loan will be repaid at 175 DM per month, well within the 4 % installment rate. With the new equipment I can add two extra farm visits each week, raising monthly income by roughly 600 DM. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards, Andreas Vogt  

Letter 4 – Mr. Markus Braun, owner of a one-man carpentry workshop  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I seek 1,050 DM to acquire a second-hand sliding-table saw that will cut my setup time in half. My bank balance stands at 140 DM and my savings book at 50 DM; I have been jobless on paper since December, but my workshop produced 2,400 DM profit last month. The credit-history delay involved a 250-DM kitchen-appliance installment that I settled 20 days late during a customer payment gap. I have owned my home for one year, have no co-borrowers, and pay 175 DM monthly to a furniture store—this new loan would simply replace that outgoing once the saw boosts output. The loan will be repaid over six months at 175 DM, amounting to 4 % of my disposable income. Reliable delivery will let me accept larger orders from a local hotel chain, ensuring repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully, Markus Braun  

Letter 5 – Mr. Thomas Richter, independent software-trainer  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am requesting 1,050 DM to furnish a small training room with six ergonomic chairs and a whiteboard so that I can run Excel courses for local small businesses. My checking account holds 170 DM and my savings 90 DM; I have been without formal employment for eight months, yet my training activities yielded 2,200 DM net in May. The previous payment delay concerned a 220-DM electronics-store installment that I caught up on within 25 days; the account is closed. I own my apartment, have no dependents beyond my ten-year-old daughter, and carry no other guarantor obligations. The monthly installment of 175 DM represents 4 % of my disposable income and will be covered by just two course seats. The new equipment will allow me to increase class size from six to ten participants, raising monthly revenue by roughly 800 DM. I appreciate your confidence in my project.  
Kind regards, Thomas Richter
