Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a €2,799 car loan to replace the 14-year-old Polo that no longer starts in the frost. I have worked for three years as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich and my net salary is €2,450. Although my current account is €120 overdrawn and my savings book shows only €85, I have never missed a rent payment in the 24 months I have lived in my flat. The house in Sofia which I co-own is debt-free and generates €300 monthly rental income; this will be used to accelerate repayment. My two school-age children depend on reliable transport. I have no other loans elsewhere and no guarantors. I ask for your trust and will repay the loan in nine equal instalments of €311.  
Respectfully,  
Dimitar Georgiev

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 36, single, and I have just been promoted to senior radiographer at Köln-Merheim Hospital after 2.5 years of employment. I need €2,799 to purchase a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach night shifts that end after public transport stops. My pay-slip shows €2,600 net; my checking account is €80 negative only because the rent was debited three days before salary day. I keep €70 in a savings account and own a small apartment in Málaga which is rented out; the tenant’s contract guarantees €350 every month. I have no other debts, no telephone at home, and no dependents apart from my dog. I will repay the loan in nine months with the second instalment rate you offer. I have always serviced my two small credits at your bank on time and ask for the same chance again.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Bank Team,  
I am Ahmad Haddad, Syrian machinist at Bosch Reutlingen since May 2021. My monthly net income is €2,380 and I am requesting €2,799 for a new Opel Corsa needed to commute 60 km each way. My account is €95 overdrawn after buying winter clothes for my two daughters; my savings passbook holds €90. I have lived in the same apartment for two years and pay €550 rent without delay. The flat I inherited in Damascus is debt-free and currently let for €250 per month, which I will channel into the loan. I have no other instalment plans and no guarantor. I have already repaid €1,200 of the two previous credits I took with you and never missed a due date. Please approve the car loan for nine months at the second rate; my daughters’ school attendance depends on reliable transport.  
Kind regards,  
Ahmad Haddad

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Ivan Petrov, 36, Bulgarian toolmaker at Audi Neckarsulm since February 2021. I earn €2,720 net and need €2,799 to buy a new Škoda Fabia so I can accept the early shift that pays €250 extra per month. My checking balance is €110 negative because of Christmas expenses; my savings account shows €60. I rent a small flat in Heilbronn and have lived there for 24 months without ever being late. I co-own a family house in Plovdiv that is unencumbered and rented for €300; this sum is pledged to service the loan. I have no other debts, no dependents except my retired parents whom I support, and no telephone contract. My two running credits with you are paid flawlessly; I ask for a third chance to finance the car over nine months at the second instalment level.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Andrei Munteanu, Romanian CNC programmer at Daimler Stuttgart since October 2020, net salary €2,550. I request €2,799 for a new Renault Clio to drive my two children to kindergarten and to reach the plant’s 5 a.m. shift. My account is €70 overdrawn after paying the deposit on the car; my savings book holds €95. I have rented the same apartment for two years and always paid on time. I own a studio in Brașov that is mortgage-free and leased for €280 monthly; the tenant has signed a three-year contract and the rent will cover the loan. I have no other instalment obligations, no guarantors, and no telephone at home. My two existing credits with your bank are up to date. Please grant me this car loan for nine months at the second rate; I will stand by my signature as I have always done.  
Respectfully yours,  
Andrei Munteanu
