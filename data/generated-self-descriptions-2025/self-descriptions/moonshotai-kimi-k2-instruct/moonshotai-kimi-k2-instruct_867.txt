Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Köhler, 20, a divorced mother of a toddler. For three years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Potsdam, earning €1,450 net. I rent a small apartment in the same town for four years now and have kept my first €2,000 bank loan immaculate: 15 monthly instalments paid on the dot. I need €2,221 to buy a sturdy crib, a washing machine and a laptop so I can continue my data-entry work from home after 8 p.m. My 1999 Opel Corsa is debt-free and my savings book shows €720. With no other debts or guarantors, I can easily add the requested €89 monthly payment to my budget. Please help me give my daughter a safe start.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Köhler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Laila Nowak, 20, married, Bulgarian national, living in Germany since 2019. I trained as a CNC lathe operator and have been employed at MeisterMetall GmbH for 28 months, currently earning €2,100 gross. My husband and I rent a 45 m² flat in Nuremberg; we have no telephone landline, but we do have a 2006 VW Polo that we own outright. Our savings balance is €860. We have one running loan of €2,000 with your bank, and every instalment has been met on schedule for 15 months. We now request €2,221 to replace our broken fridge, buy a sofa-bed for visiting relatives and equip the baby corner due in September. The proposed rate of €89 a month equals 2 % of my net salary, well within our means. I have no other debts and ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Laila Nowak

Dear Team,  
My name is Fatima el-Hassan, 20, separated, Syrian, working since 2020 as a certified pharmacy technician at Stadtapotheke Bremen (€1,550 net). I live with my four-year-old daughter in a rented flat; we own a 2005 Renault Clio and keep €930 in my savings account. I have already repaid €2,000 of medical equipment credit without a single delay. I need €2,221 to purchase a height-adjustable examination couch for the small beauty-waxing room I run on weekends; the extra income will secure our future. The monthly €89 instalment is only 5.7 % of my income and easily manageable. I have no other liabilities or co-signers. Thank you for considering my second loan.  
Best regards,  
Fatima el-Hassan

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Oksana Petrenko, 20, divorced Ukrainian, resident of Dresden for four years. I work as a bilingual administrative clerk at the International Office of TU Dresden, employed since January 2021 (€1,680 net). I own a 2007 Skoda Fabia and have €690 saved. My first €2,000 loan with you has been serviced impeccably for 15 months. I now apply for €2,221 to buy an ergonomic desk, a powerful laptop and a small laser printer so I can take on freelance translation jobs in the evenings. The required monthly payment of €89 represents 5.3 % of my net income and leaves ample room for rent and childcare. No other debts or guarantors encumber me. I kindly ask for approval.  
With respect,  
Oksana Petrenko

Dear Madam,  
My name is Ana-Maria Silva, 20, married, Portuguese, living in Hamburg since 2019. I have worked as a geriatric nurse at St. Franziskus Hospital for 34 months and earn €1,730 net. My husband and I rent a 50 m² apartment; we possess a 2008 Ford Fiesta and hold €950 in our savings account. We have already repaid one €2,000 loan punctually for 15 months. We seek €2,221 to buy a washing machine, a dining set and a baby stroller, as we are expecting our first child in December. The proposed instalment of €89 per month equals 2 % of my income and fits comfortably within our budget. We have no other loans or guarantors. Your support will help us prepare responsibly for the new arrival.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ana-Maria Silva
