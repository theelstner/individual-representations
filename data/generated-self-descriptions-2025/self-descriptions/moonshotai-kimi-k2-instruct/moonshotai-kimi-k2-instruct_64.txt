Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Franz Adler, 61, a self-employed scientific-instrument calibration specialist who has run my one-man firm for the past 8 years. I need 1,953 DM to buy a used spectrum-analyser so I can accept a new 6-month service contract with a regional medical lab. My checking balance is 176 DM and my savings book holds 85 DM, yet my last tax return shows net annual profit of 28,400 DM. I have always paid suppliers within 14 days and my single previous bank loan (for a calibration van) was repaid 11 months early. I live rent-free in my late parents’ house, have no other debts, and my 28-year-old daughter is my only dependent. The requested 36-month term at 4 % installment fits easily within my average monthly surplus of 310 DM. I have been at the same address for four years and can be reached at the listed landline. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can expand my services without delay.  
Sincerely,  
Franz Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Klaus Zimmermann, 61, senior warehouse manager for an automotive parts distributor, employed since 1 March 2016. I am requesting 1,953 DM over 36 months to buy a pallet-stacking robot that will let me start a small side business leasing equipment to local craft firms. My current account shows 183 DM and my passbook 92 DM; my monthly net salary is 2,350 DM, so the 55 DM installment equals 2.3 % of income. I have never taken a bank loan before, always paying cash for vehicles and tools, and I have no other debts. I live alone in a company-provided apartment, pay no rent, and my only dependent is my 30-year-old disabled brother whose care allowance covers his needs. Residence registration is continuous since 2020, and the listed telephone is in my name. I offer my salary assignment as security and ask for your favorable decision.  
Respectfully,  
Klaus Zimmermann

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Reinhard Haas, 61, self-employed regulatory affairs consultant for medical-device start-ups, operating my solo practice since 2015. I seek 1,953 DM to purchase a secure server and compliance software that will allow me to serve U.S. clients under new FDA rules. My checking account presently holds 167 DM and my savings 78 DM; nevertheless, last year’s taxable income was 42,100 DM. The proposed 55 DM monthly payment represents 1.9 % of average net cash flow. I have never missed a payment on any obligation and my only prior bank loan—taken in 2017 for office furniture—was repaid ahead of schedule. I reside for free in a condominium owned by my sister, have no property of my own, and support no one but myself. I have lived at the registered address since 2020 and can be reached at the listed number. I kindly request approval so I can sign the FDA contract before the deadline.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Reinhard Haas

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Ludwig Bauer, 61, certified master electrician and owner of “Bauer Elektrotechnik” for the past 9 years. I am applying for 1,953 DM to acquire a professional cable-analyser that will qualify my firm for industrial maintenance tenders. My checking balance is 154 DM and my savings 65 DM, yet my 2023 profit was 31,700 DM. The 55 DM monthly installment is 4 % of net income, well within my budget. I have never taken a bank loan before, always reinvesting earnings, and I have no other debts. I live rent-free above my workshop, have no dependents except my dog, and have been registered at the same street since 2020. The listed landline is in my name. I respectfully ask for your support so I can submit the required certification next month.  
Best regards,  
Ludwig Bauer

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Ernst Richter, 61, senior flight-operations officer at a regional airline, employed continuously since 8 October 2015. I need 1,953 DM to complete payment for a certified drone-mapping course and equipment that will allow me to start a weekend surveying service. My checking account currently shows 198 DM and my savings 95 DM; my net salary is 2,480 DM, so the 55 DM installment equals 2.2 % of income. I have never taken a consumer loan and repaid my only previous car loan without delay. I live for free in my brother’s house, own no real estate, and have no other payment obligations. I have resided at the registered address since 2020 and the listed telephone number is registered under my name. I kindly request your approval so I can register my drone business before the seasonal contracts are awarded.  
Yours sincerely,  
Ernst Richter
