Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Adler, 31, single father of twin seven-year-olds. For eight years I have worked as a refrigeration technician for NordKlima GmbH and I live in my own row-house in Delmenhorst. I am requesting 3 430 € to replace our broken television and radio—our only home-entertainment since the old set died. My net salary is 2 150 €; the requested 36-month instalment of 115 € represents 3 % of that. My payroll account (opened 2021) shows every prior loan paid on the dot, and I carry no other debt. Savings stand at 750 €. The television will let the boys follow school broadcasts while I keep saving for their future. I have never missed a payment and I do not intend to start now. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Luis Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Karim Ziani, 31, a scientific research assistant at the University of Leipzig since 2016. I reside in my own apartment and own a 2018 VW Golf. I need 3 430 € to purchase a professional monitor and studio speakers so I can finish my acoustic-signal project from home. My net income is 2 400 €; the monthly 115 € instalment equals 3 %. My savings book holds 800 € and my only current bank loan has been serviced flawlessly for 24 months. No other obligations or guarantors exist. My employment contract is open-ended and my residence is stable. Granting this loan will allow me to complete commissioned research on schedule while continuing my perfect repayment record. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Karim Ziani

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Tim Becker, 31, certified industrial mechanic at BMW Group Plant Leipzig, employed there since May 2015. I am single and live in my self-owned flat. I am applying for 3 430 € to buy a smart TV and soundbar so my disabled father and I can enjoy films together during his evening care hours. My net wage is 2 300 €; the 115 € monthly payment is exactly 3 %. I have saved 900 € and my existing bank loan, now 24 months old, has never seen a delay. No other debts or dependents beyond my father are on my budget. My phone and address records confirm stability. I have always honoured my word and will honour this obligation likewise. Thank you very much.  
Best regards, Tim Becker

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Stefan Nowak, 31, senior electronics technician for the city of Dortmund, a post I have held for the past ten years. I own my condominium and a 2019 Seat Leon. I seek 3 430 € to replace my defective television and radio—essential for keeping up with news and educational programmes for my two young nephews whom I raise. My net salary is 2 200 €; the proposed 36-month instalment of 115 € equals 3 %. My savings account shows 850 € and my sole bank loan has been repaid punctually since its inception 24 months ago. I have no other debts or guarantors. My residence and employment are long-term, and my repayment history is spotless. I respectfully ask for approval so I can maintain a stable home environment for the children. Thank you.  
Yours faithfully, Stefan Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Matthias Huber, 31, master welder at Meyer Werft in Papenburg, employed continuously since February 2015. I live alone in my own house and possess a 2020 Ford Focus. I apply for 3 430 € to purchase a modern television and DAB+ radio so I can follow training programmes required for my upcoming welding certifications. My net income is 2 500 €; the monthly 115 € instalment represents 3 %. I have accumulated 950 € in savings and my record with your bank shows one prior loan, 24 months old, serviced without a single late payment. I bear no other liabilities and have no guarantors. My residence and job are secure, and my credit history is clean. I stand ready to meet this new obligation with the same discipline. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards, Matthias Huber
