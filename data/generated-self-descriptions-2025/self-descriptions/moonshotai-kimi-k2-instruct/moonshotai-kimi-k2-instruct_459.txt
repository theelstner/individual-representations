Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 3,386 DM loan to replace my 1991 VW Golf that died last month. Since 1994 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich; my net salary is 2,450 DM. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 85 DM, yet every previous loan—one for 2,000 DM finished in 1997—was repaid on time. I have lived in the same institute-owned flat for four years rent-free and have no other debts or dependents except my eight-year-old son. The requested installment of 105 DM fits easily within my budget. Please allow me to keep my job and my son’s school run reliable.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Mertens

Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 3,386 DM to buy a 1993 Opel Astra so I can stay on call as a senior psychiatric nurse at Cologne General Hospital, where I have been employed since 1991. My pay slip shows 2,380 DM net. My checking balance is –95 DM and my savings passbook shows 70 DM, but my only existing bank loan (1,500 DM, 1996) is nearly repaid without delay. I rent a small attic room from my parents—no housing costs—and have no other installments or guarantors. The monthly burden of 105 DM is 3 % of my income and leaves room for my daughter’s needs. I have been at the same address for four years and can be reached at the listed phone number. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Baum

Dear Team,  
As a certified welding foreman at Blohm+Voss Shiprepair for the past nine years, I earn 2,600 DM net and must now replace my stolen work van. I seek 3,386 DM to purchase a used Ford Transit. My checking account is –80 DM and my savings deposit is 60 DM, yet my repayment record is spotless: my current 1,800 DM car loan from your bank has twelve perfect monthly entries. I live in my late grandmother’s house, pay no rent, and support only myself. The proposed 105 DM monthly installment equals 3 % of income and is easily covered. I have been in the same harbor flat for four years and am registered as a German citizen. Grant me the chance to keep commuting to the docks.  
Best regards,  
Jan Richter

Dear Sirs,  
I am 35, single, and since 1990 I have served as a police sergeant in Dresden, netting 2,500 DM monthly. My patrol duties require a dependable car; mine has blown its head gasket. I apply for 3,386 DM to buy a 1992 Toyota Corolla inspected yesterday. My checking shows –50 DM and my savings 90 DM, but I have never missed a payment on my 1,200 DM computer loan taken here in 1997. I lodge free in the force’s bachelor quarters, have no property, no other debts, and no dependents beyond my dog. The 105 DM installment is well below the 3 % threshold. Four years at my current address and a listed landline make me easy to trace. I respectfully request approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Lehmann

Dear Lending Department,  
I write to obtain 3,386 DM for a 1994 Renault Clio so I can continue my night shifts as a pharmaceutical production supervisor at Bayer Leverkusen, a post I have held since 1990. My salary is 2,700 DM net. My checking account is –70 DM and my savings balance is 95 DM, but my credit history with you is clean: the 1,300 DM household loan I took in 1996 will be finished next quarter with zero arrears. I live rent-free in a company studio, have no other installment plans or guarantors, and support only myself. The requested 105 DM monthly payment represents 3 % of income and is secure. I have resided at the same address for four years and am reachable by the listed phone. I kindly ask for your favorable decision.  
With regards,  
Karl Wagner
