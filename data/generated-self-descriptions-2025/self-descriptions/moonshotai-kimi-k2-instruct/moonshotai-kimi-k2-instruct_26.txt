Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Müller, 26, a laboratory electronics technician at MedTech Leipzig since April 2022. My wife and I bought our small row house last year; our ten-month-old daughter needs safe heating and I need a 2 069 € loan for a new condensing boiler and a child’s bedroom set. Net household income: 2 300 €; housing costs only 280 €; no other loans, no leasing, no overdraft. I have repaid two small credits from your bank punctually and in full. Although my salary is paid into a savings-and-loan cooperative, I authorize you to collect the 98 € monthly instalment directly from that account. The boiler quote is enclosed; delivery is scheduled for 3 August. I have never missed a payment and I am prepared to sign a SEPA mandate. Please approve the loan so my family can move into winter without worry.  
Respectfully, Jonas Müller

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Emil Hartmann, 26, married, father of a little boy. Since November 2021 I have worked as a certified warehouse logistics specialist for the city of Halle. We own our apartment and a 2015 VW Caddy which I need for work. I am requesting 2 069 € to replace my broken professional tool set and to buy an orthopaedic cot for my son. Net salary 1 950 €, warm rent 310 €, no further debts. Two previous loans with your bank were repaid ahead of schedule; I have never used an overdraft. The monthly burden of 98 € equals 2 % of my income and is easily covered. I can provide the last three salary slips and the supplier invoice. I guarantee punctual payment and remain at your disposal for any questions.  
Sincerely, Emil Hartmann

Dear Team,  
I am Lukas Richter, 26, locomotive driver for DB Regio since February 2020. My wife and I live in our own small house; our daughter was born last December. I need 2 069 € to buy a robust washing machine and a dining-room set so that my wife can care for the baby comfortably. My net income is 2 450 €; we have no rent, no instalment contracts, no guarantors. The proposed debit of 98 € per month leaves enough room for everyday expenses. I have already repaid two small loans from your bank without delay and I am willing to grant you a direct debit authorisation from my salary account at Sparkasse Mitte. The enclosed quotes are valid for 14 days; I would appreciate a quick decision so that the furniture can be delivered before my wife returns from maternity leave. Thank you for your trust.  
With kind regards, Lukas Richter

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Felix Neumann, 26, master automotive painter at Autohaus Köhler in Dresden since May 2021. I am married and we have a one-year-old son. We own our terraced house and a 2016 Skoda Octavia. I apply for 2 069 € to purchase a professional compressor for my sideline paint-repair service and a secure baby gate. Monthly net earnings 2 100 €, living costs 720 €, no other credit obligations. The instalment of 98 € represents 2 % of income and is fixed for 24 months. I have honoured two previous loans from your institution in full and on time. I enclose my employment contract, the last three wage statements and the supplier invoice. I authorise you to collect the instalments from my salary account and I am happy to provide any further documentation required. I look forward to your positive reply.  
Yours faithfully, Felix Neumann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Philipp Vogel, 26, employed as a chemical laboratory assistant at Bayer Bitterfeld since August 2020. My wife and I became homeowners last year and we have a baby daughter. I am seeking 2 069 € to replace our defective gas oven and to buy a height-adjustable desk so that I can prepare reports at home without back pain. My net salary is 2 200 €; housing and utilities total 350 €. No loans, no leasing, no credit-card debt. The monthly payment of 98 € is well below the 2 % threshold. I have successfully repaid two earlier credits with your bank and I am prepared to sign a direct-debit mandate with the Volksbank where my salary is deposited. The enclosed offers expire on 30 July; I would be grateful if you could approve the loan within the next few days. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully yours, Philipp Vogel
