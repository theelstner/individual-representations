Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lisa Müller, I am 25, divorced, and mother of a four-year-old boy. Since January I work as a night-shift cleaner at St.-Elisabeth Hospital, earning 1 050 DM net. The 1 355 DM loan will complete the 4 200 DM price of a new VW Polo that lets me reach the hospital before public transport starts and still take my son to kindergarten. My only existing credit—500 DM for last winter’s heating system—has been paid exactly on the 3rd of every month; my bank statements show the same discipline for rent and utilities. I have lived in the same small owned flat for four years and hold no other debts. The car is the only item I own besides my current vehicle, which will be sold to reduce the amount financed. With stable employment, documented reliability, and no dependents beyond my son, I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Lisa Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Anna Becker, laboratory assistant at ChemTech GmbH, divorced since last year. My salary is 1 180 DM and my account currently holds 180 DM. I need 1 355 DM to add to my savings and buy a new Opel Corsa so I can accept the late-shift analyses that pay 150 DM extra per week; without my own car I lose those shifts. My previous 650 DM kitchen loan was repaid twelve months early; the reference is attached. I have been in my rented city apartment for four years and have no other obligations. The requested installment of 3 % of my disposable income leaves 450 DM for living costs, well within household guidelines. I am a registered resident, not a foreign worker, reachable by the telephone listed in my file. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Anna Becker

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Katrin Hoffmann, 25, married but living separately while finishing vocational training as a care-giver. I earn 980 DM monthly at the senior centre and have 95 DM in savings. The 1 355 DM will finish paying for a new Dacia Sandero that I already partially financed by selling my bicycle and computer. My employment contract, though recent, is unlimited; HR has confirmed transition to full nurse next year with a 20 % raise. My only current bank loan—300 DM for eyeglasses—shows zero arrears after eleven months. I have resided in my owned studio for four years, have no guarantors, and carry no other installment plans. The car allows me to reach three rural patients the public bus line no longer serves, securing my position. I am prepared to set up automatic debit and will keep comprehensive insurance naming the bank as co-beneficiary. Thank you for your confidence.  
Best regards,  
Katrin Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Sandra Neumann, 25, divorced, mother of one daughter, employed since six months as a resident unskilled worker packing pharmaceuticals at Berlin-Brandenburg Logistics. My wage is 1 030 DM net; my checking balance is 150 DM and savings 60 DM. I seek 1 355 DM to settle the remaining invoice on a new Fiat Panda, the cheapest model that meets the factory’s emission rules for employee parking. My existing 400 DM household-goods credit has been serviced promptly; the bank’s own records verify this. I have lived in my small owned apartment for four consecutive years and have no other debts or dependents beyond my child. The proposed 24-month term fits the 3 % installment comfortably inside the budget recommended by your affordability sheet. I possess a registered telephone line and can be reached any evening. I respectfully request approval so I can keep the job that supports my family.  
Yours faithfully,  
Sandra Neumann

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Petra Scholz, 25, separated, working since eight months as a resident unskilled warehouse clerk for the city’s food bank, wage 960 DM. My account shows 170 DM and my savings booklet 80 DM. I still owe 1 355 DM on a new Kia Picanto that replaced my irreparable old car; without it I cannot deliver surplus groceries to outlying shelters, a duty management has just assigned to me permanently. My sole existing loan of 350 DM for work clothes has been repaid on schedule every month; the final debit is due next week. I have owned and occupied my small attic flat for four years, have no co-debtors, and hold no other installment contracts. The requested 24-month loan keeps repayments at 3 % of net income, leaving sufficient margin for rent and child support. I am reachable via the landline registered in my file and possess unlimited residence status. I would be grateful for your support in continuing this essential community service.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Petra Scholz
