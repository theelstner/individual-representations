Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Lisa Mertens, 28, a post-doctoral research associate in molecular biology at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed there since April 2021 on a permanent contract (net €2,450). My salary has been assigned to your bank for 26 months and my current account shows €310. I have one prior €3,500 car loan with you; every instalment of €165 was debited on time and the balance is now zero. I am divorced and raise my 4-year-old daughter alone; we live in our own row-house in Harburg where we have lived for 18 months. My only other obligation is the running mortgage of €412/month. Savings-book balance: €380. I need €2,923 to replace my 12-year-old Polo with a new Kia Picanto so I can reach the institute’s outstation in Kaltenkirchen reliably. The requested rate of €135 is 5.5 % of my net income, well within your 30 % rule. No guarantors, no other debts, no foreign-worker clause applies. I enclose the last three salary slips, the land-registry excerpt and the unlimited employment letter. Thank you for approving the loan; I authorise you to debit the instalment monthly from my account.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lisa Mertens
