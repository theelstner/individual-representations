Letter 1 – Anna Müller, Night-Shelf-Stacker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 1,659 DM to replace my broken television set so that my six-year-old daughter can follow the educational school programmes she missed last term. My current account is 89 DM overdrawn after moving to a new flat two months ago; the deposit and removal van swallowed my savings of 70 DM. I have worked for 11 months as a night-shelf-stacker at the local supermarket on a permanent contract of 1,850 DM net. Although I was once 30 days late with a small mail-order payment in 2022, I have since repaid every bill on time; my employer will confirm that my wage is never attached. The requested instalment of 66 DM monthly equals 4 % of my income and will be paid by standing order on the 1st of each month. My only other obligation is the rent; I own no property except my 1998 Polo, which I need for work. I have no guarantor, but I have lived at the same address for two years and can be reached by phone at any time. I respectfully ask for your trust so that my daughter can keep up with her class.  
Yours faithfully,  
Anna Müller  

Letter 2 – Leyla Yılmaz, Assembly-Line Worker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 1,659 DM to buy a small colour television; without it my ten-year-old son cannot complete the daily German homework that is broadcast on the regional channel. My checking account shows –120 DM because I had to pay the dentist for emergency treatment for my child last month. I started on the car-door assembly line ten months ago and earn 1,780 DM after tax; my contract is open-ended. In 2021 I was late with two instalments on a previous micro-loan, but I cleared the debt completely and learned to budget strictly. I have saved 90 DM and can comfortably afford the 66 DM monthly payment, which is exactly 4 % of my net wage. I live alone with my son, rent a small council flat and own nothing but my 1999 Opel Corsa. I have no other debts, no co-signer and no other credits at your bank. I have been registered at my present address for two years and can always be reached by telephone. I promise to honour the schedule and ask you to give me the chance to improve my child’s education.  
Sincerely,  
Leyla Yılmaz  

Letter 3 – Marta Kwiatkowska, Hospital Cleaner  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 1,659 DM to purchase a radio-television combination so that my disabled mother, whom I care for, can watch Polish news and stay connected with home. My account is 45 DM in the red after buying her wheelchair ramp last month; my savings book holds 60 DM. I have been employed as a hospital cleaner on a 1,650 DM net wage for the past nine months and my supervisor has already renewed my contract once. In 2020 I fell behind on a furniture loan for three months, but I repaid it in full and kept every subsequent bill current. The proposed instalment of 66 DM represents 4 % of my income and will be transferred automatically on payday. I rent a small flat, own no real estate except my 1997 Ford Fiesta needed for night shifts, have no other loans, no co-debtor and only one existing credit with your institution. I have lived at the same address for two years and my phone number is on file. I would be grateful for your approval so that my mother can feel less isolated.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Kwiatkowska  

Letter 4 – Sandra Becker, Kitchen Porter  
Dear Lending Team,  
I kindly request 1,659 DM to replace my defective television set; without it my eight-year-old daughter falls behind on the daily language-learning broadcasts required by her school. My checking balance is –75 DM after paying the winter heating bill; my savings account contains 50 DM. I started as a full-time kitchen porter ten months ago, earning 1,700 DM net, and the head chef has promised me a raise next quarter. In 2021 I missed two instalments on a small electronics loan during my divorce, but I settled the arrears and have kept perfect payment discipline ever since. The monthly debit of 66 DM equals 4 % of my wage and will be honoured by standing order. I rent a modest apartment, possess no property apart from my 1996 VW Polo, have no other instalment plans, no guarantor and only one current credit with your bank. I have been registered at my present address for two years and am always reachable by telephone. Thank you for considering my application and helping me secure my daughter’s education.  
Yours faithfully,  
Sandra Becker  

Letter 5 – Elena Popescu, Hotel Housekeeper  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am seeking 1,659 DM to buy a television set so that my seven-year-old son can follow the weekly school programmes broadcast on the local channel. My current account is overdrawn by 95 DM after covering school enrolment costs; my savings passbook shows 80 DM. I have worked as a housekeeper at the City-Oasis Hotel for 11 months on a permanent contract of 1,820 DM net. In 2020 I was 40 days late repaying a small cash loan, but I cleared it entirely and have maintained a clean record since. The requested instalment of 66 DM monthly is exactly 4 % of my income and will be paid reliably by automatic transfer. I rent a small flat, own no real estate except my 1998 Seat Ibiza used for work, have no other debts, no co-debtor and only one existing credit with your bank. I have lived at the same address for two years and my telephone is registered in my name. I respectfully ask for your support to give my son the learning tools he needs.  
With gratitude,  
Elena Popescu
