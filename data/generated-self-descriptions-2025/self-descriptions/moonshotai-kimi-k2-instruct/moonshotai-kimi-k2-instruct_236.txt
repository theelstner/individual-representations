Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Carlos Mendoza, a 42-year-old warehouse picker at FreshFruit GmbH, employed there for 5 years and 3 months. I rent a small room in a shared flat, have lived there only 4 months, and hold no checking account—only a passbook with 85 €. My two school-age children live with my ex-wife in Valencia; I send 300 € monthly for their support. A critical phone bill of 1,200 € was sold to a collection agency last year, but since February I have paid every wage on time and reduced the balance to 540 €. I need 1,544 € to buy my children a television so they can follow online classes; their old set broke irreparably. Repayment is easy: 65 € per month equals 2 % of my 1,300 € net salary, well below the 35 % debt-to-income limit. My employer will confirm overtime availability, and my 5-year record shows zero sick days. Please approve this small loan; my children’s education depends on it.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 42, assembly-line operator at AutoTech for 6 years. I arrived from India four months ago and still have no German checking account—only a savings book with 92 €. My wife and two toddlers share a 45 m² studio; we have lived there 4 months. A 900 € medical debt from my wife’s emergency surgery was transferred to a collection firm, yet I have paid 250 € monthly since March and owe 400 € more. I request 1,544 € to purchase a sturdy television that will serve as the family’s only entertainment and English-learning tool. The installment of 65 € (2 % of 1,350 € net) fits easily into my budget; no other loans or guarantors exist. My shift supervisor will attest to my reliability and upcoming promotion to team leader in October. Grant me this chance to finish repaying old debt while giving my family a modest home life.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, 42, unskilled sanitation worker at Stadtentwässerung, employed 4 years and 11 months. I own no checking account—wages are paid in cash—and my savings booklet holds 76 €. I live alone in my late parents’ house, which I inherited last year; I moved back only 4 months ago after renovating. A 1,000 € overdraft at my former bank was classified “critical,” but I have settled 600 € since January. I seek 1,544 € to buy a television and replace the roof antenna lightning-damaged in May. Monthly repayment of 65 € equals 2 % of my 1,280 € net wage, leaving ample room for food and utilities. The house itself is debt-free and valued at 180,000 €, giving you solid collateral. I have no other credits, no dependents, and my works council will confirm my steady shift schedule. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Best regards,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Samuel Okafor, 42, refugee from Nigeria, working as a cleaner at Sparkasse Arena for 5 years and 2 months. I possess no checking account and keep 88 € in a savings card. My wife and two children reside in a church-owned flat; we have lived there 4 months. An old 800 € phone-contract debt was sold to a collector; I have reduced it to 350 € by paying 150 € each month since March. I apply for 1,544 € to buy a television so my children can watch German educational programs and integrate faster. The proposed installment is 65 €, exactly 2 % of my 1,320 € net income. My employer will confirm that my contract runs until 2025 with option to extend. I carry no other loans and have never missed rent. Please help me equip my kids for school and life in Germany.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Okafor

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Lê Minh, 42, Vietnamese guest worker, pruning vines at Weingut Meyer for 4 years and 7 months. I have no checking account—only a savings passbook with 94 €. I rent a 20 m² attic room and have stayed there 4 months. A 1,100 € credit-card balance was reported as “critical,” yet I have paid 200 € monthly since February and owe 500 € today. I request 1,544 € to purchase a television and a small freezer so my two nephews, whom I support, can store home-cooked meals while attending vocational school nearby. The 65 € installment equals 2 % of my 1,290 € net wage, leaving enough for rent, food, and bus tickets. My landlord and employer will both testify to my punctuality and honesty. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence permit is secure until 2027. Thank you for considering my modest application.  
Respectfully yours,  
Lê Minh
