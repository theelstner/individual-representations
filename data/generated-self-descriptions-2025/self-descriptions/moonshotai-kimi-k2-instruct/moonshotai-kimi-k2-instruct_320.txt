Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 701 DM loan to pay the final semester of my part-time Mechatronics certificate at the Frankfurt Vocational Academy. I have studied there for twelve months while working as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for the past three years. My net salary is 1 850 DM and my only dependent is my eight-year-old son Leon. I own a 1997 Opel Astra valued at 1 200 DM and live in my own one-bedroom row house in Höchst; the mortgage is paid off. Although I have two small existing credits with your bank, I have never missed a payment. My checking account was closed last year after repeated overdrafts, but since then I have saved 95 DM in my savings book and kept all monthly costs within my salary. The requested installment of 4 % of my income is 74 DM, which leaves me 300 DM after fixed costs. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no telephone contract—only the wish to finish the certificate that will raise my wage group by two levels next year. I respectfully ask for your trust and remain ready to provide any further documents you may need.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dmytro H.

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Luis M. and I am a 32-year-old single father from Portugal working as a CNC operator at Bosch Rexroth in Salzgitter since January 2020. I need 701 DM to cover the last module of my state-certified technician course at the Wolfsburg Evening College. After twelve months of study I am only one exam away from the diploma that guarantees me a 350 DM monthly raise. I earn 1 780 DM net, own my 1999 VW Golf (1 000 DM), and live debt-free in my own small townhouse; property taxes and utilities amount to 250 DM. I have no checking account since my Portuguese bank account was closed on relocation, but I have kept 90 DM in your savings book and never missed the 65 DM installments on my two existing consumer credits with you. The new loan would replace the older one and keep my total monthly burden at 74 DM, exactly 4 % of my income. My residence permit is valid until 2026 and my employment contract is unlimited. I respectfully request approval so I can finish the course and secure a better future for my daughter.  
Sincerely,  
Luis M.

Dear Team,  
I write to request 701 DM for tuition so I can complete my twelve-month Accounting Specialist certificate at the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce. I arrived from Ukraine two years ago and have worked as a warehouse clerk at the Port Authority for the past 32 months, earning 1 750 DM net. My son Maksym, 10, lives with me in our own 42 m² apartment in Wilhelmsburg; the unit is paid off and I only pay 180 DM in maintenance fees. I own a 1998 Ford Escort worth 1 100 DM and have 85 DM in my savings book. Although my checking account was closed after overdrafts during my first months in Germany, I have since repaid every obligation on time, including two small credits I already have with your bank. The new loan would cost 70 DM a month, well within the 4 % installment margin, and will be fully repaid in ten months after my promised promotion to payroll administrator. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no telephone by choice—only the determination to finish the education that secures my family’s future. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Oleksandr K.

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Carlos P., 32, a single Spanish electrician employed at Siemens Berlin since April 2021. After twelve months of evening classes I need 701 DM to register for the final exams of the German “Meister” preparatory course—passing will raise my hourly wage from 14.50 € to 17.80 €. My net income is 1 820 DM, I own a 2000 Seat Ibiza (1 000 DM), and live cost-free in my own small prefab unit in Spandau. I have no checking account because my Spanish account was closed when I moved, but I have saved 92 DM in your passbook and have never defaulted on the two existing small credits with you. The proposed 74 DM monthly installment equals 4 % of my salary and leaves me 400 DM after all living costs for my daughter Sofia, 9. I carry no other debt and have no need for guarantors. I respectfully ask for your support to finish the qualification that will make me a training supervisor and ensure timely repayment.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Carlos P.

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Erdal Y., I am 32 years old, Turkish, and I have worked as a quality-control technician at the Volkswagen factory in Emden since March 2020. I am requesting 701 DM to pay the examination fee for the twelve-month “Fachwirt” distance course I have been attending; the certificate is required for my promotion to group leader and comes with a 400 DM monthly raise. My net wage is 1 800 DM, I own a 1999 Renault Clio (1 050 DM), and I live in my own small terraced house; only utility bills apply. I have no checking account after my Turkish bank closed it on relocation, but I have 88 DM in my savings book and have met every payment on my two existing consumer credits with you. The new loan installment will be 72 DM, exactly 4 % of my income, and will be finished in ten months. I have no other debts, no other installment plans, and no telephone contract—only the promise of a secure future for my six-year-old daughter. I kindly ask for your approval and remain available for any questions.  
Freundliche Grüße,  
Erdal Y.
