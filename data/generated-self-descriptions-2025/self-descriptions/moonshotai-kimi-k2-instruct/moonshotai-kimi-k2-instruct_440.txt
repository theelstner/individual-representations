1. Letter from Mr. Dimitar Iliev, 65, Bulgarian national, living in Dortmund  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 3,394 DM to renew the leaking roof of the small house I own at 17 Eichenstrasse. Rainwater has already damaged the upper-floor wiring; the local Bauamt issued a repair order that must be fulfilled within six weeks.  
My bank account is currently 186 DM overdrawn, yet every month I receive a widow’s pension of 1,040 DM and a Bulgarian old-age pension of 320 DM. My son Hristo, 29, employed as a forklift driver at Krones AG, has agreed to be co-applicant; together we have a net household income of 1,610 DM. After deducting living costs we can comfortably free 65 DM monthly, so the requested installment of 81 DM over 42 months is realistic. I have lived at the same address for four years, own the house outright, and possess a 1998 VW Golf worth about 1,000 DM. Although I am unemployed since my factory closed in 2019, I have never missed a loan payment: my two existing credits with your bank (car loan, 200 DM/month, and consumer loan, 75 DM/month) are paid on time. I have no other debts. The repair permit, cost estimate from roofer Meister GmbH, and my son’s last three pay slips are enclosed. I would appreciate your support to keep my home safe and compliant.  
Respectfully,  
Dimitar Iliev

2. Letter from Mr. José Machado, 65, Portuguese, living in Duisburg  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 3,394 DM to replace the 30-year-old oil-fired boiler in my terraced house; the chimney sweep has declared it unsafe. My checking account shows a debit of 240 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM. I have been without steady work since the shipyard laid me off in 2020; nevertheless I receive a Portuguese maritime pension of 850 DM and rent out the attic room to a student for 220 DM monthly. My daughter Carla, 33, employed as a geriatric nurse at the Alexianerhaus, is my co-applicant; our combined disposable income is 1,270 DM. We can therefore pay the monthly installment of 81 DM without strain. I have lived in the same house for four years, own it, and drive a 1999 Opel Astra (value 800 DM). My two running loans with your bank—both for furniture—have always been serviced punctually. No further installment plans exist. Enclosed are the heating installer’s quote, pension statements, and my daughter’s employment contract. I kindly ask for approval so the house remains habitable this winter.  
Sincerely,  
José Machado

3. Letter from Mr. Anton Petrov, 65, Russian, living in Essen  
Esteemed Bank Team,  
I apply for 3,394 DM to repair the frost-damaged water pipes and bathroom tiles in my self-occupied home. My current account is 150 DM in the red, and my savings balance is 70 DM. After working as an unskilled warehouse helper I have been unemployed since 2018; however, I draw a Russian pension of 760 DM and earn 300 DM monthly collecting bottles, giving a stable total of 1,060 DM. My nephew Ivan, 35, employed as a delivery driver for DPD, joins the loan as co-applicant; together we have 1,480 DM net. An installment of 81 DM represents 5.5 % of income, well below the 20 % guideline. I have resided at the same address for four years, own the house, and keep a 1997 Ford Fiesta (600 DM). My two existing credits with your bank—taken out for a washing machine and a bed—are serviced regularly. No other debts exist. Attached are the plumber’s invoice preview, pension proof, and Ivan’s wage slips. I would be grateful for your help to restore running water and sanitation.  
With thanks,  
Anton Petrov

4. Letter from Mr. Mehmet Yildirim, 65, Turkish citizen, living in Bochum  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
The façade of my house is crumbling; stonework has begun to fall, endangering pedestrians. The city has ordered immediate repair, quoted at 3,394 DM. My checking balance is minus 200 DM, my savings passbook shows 85 DM. I have been unemployed since 2019 when the textile workshop closed; I live on a Turkish pension of 900 DM and a small rent from my garage (180 DM). My nephew Hakan, 31, who works as a CNC operator at Gildemeister, is my co-applicant. Our joint monthly net is 1,560 DM, so the 81 DM installment is easily covered. I have lived in the same property for four years, own it, and possess a 2000 Renault Clio valued at 950 DM. My two current loans with your bank—for a refrigerator and a laptop—are paid on schedule every month. No further liabilities are registered. Enclosed are the masonry firm’s quotation, pension statements, and Hakan’s last three salary slips. I respectfully request the loan to comply with the city’s safety order and protect my home.  
Respectfully yours,  
Mehmet Yildirim

5. Letter from Mr. László Horváth, 65, Hungarian, living in Oberhausen  
Dear Loan Department,  
I seek 3,394 DM to replace the broken gas pipes and renew the kitchen ceiling after a minor leak. My checking account is 170 DM overdrawn, my savings account holds 95 DM. I lost my job as a cleaner in 2020; I now receive a Hungarian pension of 820 DM and earn about 250 DM by repairing bicycles for neighbors, giving a steady 1,070 DM. My son Gábor, 30, employed as a security guard at the Centro shopping mall, stands as co-applicant; together we dispose of 1,500 DM monthly. The 81 DM installment equals 5.4 % of income, safely below the bank’s threshold. I have lived in my own house for four years, drive a 1999 Skoda Felicia worth 700 DM, and have never defaulted on my two existing credits with your bank (television and furniture). I carry no other debts. Attached are the plumber’s cost breakdown, pension notification, and Gábor’s employment verification. I kindly ask for approval to finish the repairs and ensure the house remains gas-safe.  
Yours faithfully,  
László Horváth
