Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for a 3,568 DM loan to replace the broken studio monitor in my home-based translation business. For fifteen months I have run my one-woman agency without a checking account; every invoice is settled by bank transfer to my single existing credit line, which I have repaid on the dot each month. I have worked as a senior scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for eight years and my salary is secure. My only dependent is my 12-year-old daughter; we rent a small flat and own our 1998 VW Golf. Savings are thin (<100 DM) because I used last year’s surplus to clear medical bills. The requested installment of 4 % of net income is 144 DM, well within my monthly budget of 1,800 DM. You can reach me at the listed landline; I am a registered German citizen. Please allow me to keep serving my clients—and paying you—without interruption.  
Respectfully,  
Ingrid Möller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 3,568 DM to buy a digital mixing console for my radio-production start-up. Though I have no checking account, my existing bank loan has been paid punctually for fifteen months. I have been self-employed as an audio-engineer since 2012, generating steady income from regional stations. My 1999 Opel Astra is my only property; I rent an apartment and live with my teenage son. With no other guarantors and only one current credit, I offer a clean 4 % installment (140 DM) against my 1,750 DM monthly earnings. Savings are under 100 DM because I reinvest profits into equipment. Telephone and residence records confirm stability. Grant me this loan and I will continue to honor every payment.  
Sincerely,  
Katrin Lehmann

Dear Team,  
As a divorced bank clerk of 54, I request 3,568 DM for a television that doubles as a monitor for the online training courses I now deliver. My salary has entered my savings account promptly for the past fifteen months, extinguishing an earlier loan without a single delay. I have held my present position for nine years, earning 1,900 DM net. Housing is rented; my 2000 Ford Focus is debt-free. Dependent only is my university daughter, whose costs I already cover. The new installment equals 4 % of income (152 DM), leaving comfortable margin. Savings remain below 100 DM after helping my child move. I possess no other debts and am reachable on the listed landline. I ask for your trust once more.  
Best regards,  
Elke Baumann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am writing to secure 3,568 DM for a professional video-editing workstation. For fifteen months I have repaid my current credit on schedule despite having no checking account; payments are made directly from my officer’s salary. Since 2011 I have served as a supply-chain manager at a midsize firm, bringing home 2,100 DM monthly. My only property is a 2001 Renault Kangoo; we rent and support just my school-age niece. The 4 % installment (168 DM) fits easily within budget, and savings are momentarily under 100 DM after car repairs. No other debts or guarantors encumber me. Telephone records and residence registration confirm stability. Allow me to finish this project and I will continue to repay dutifully.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ursula Vogel

Dear Lending Team,  
Please approve 3,568 DM so I can replace the obsolete transmitter in my community-radio booth. Though I operate without a checking account, my sole existing loan shows fifteen months of flawless repayment. I have been self-employed as a media-trainer and station consultant since 2007, netting 1,650 DM monthly. I rent, own a 2002 Skoda Felicia, and care only for my 15-year-old son. The proposed 4 % installment (132 DM) is modest against my income, and savings are below 100 DM because I recently prepaid school fees. No other obligations or co-signers exist, and I am reachable on the registered landline. I respectfully request the funds to keep local programming on air and to keep honoring every debit.  
Kind regards,  
Petra Hoffmann
