Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Lukas Meier, 49, single father of a 12-year-old daughter. For the past 11 years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics; my net salary is 2 900 €. We still rent, but I have been paying into a life-insurance policy since 2009 that now holds 14 700 €—this is my security for you.  
I need 5 801 € to replace the broken laboratory-grade freezer that stores my daughter’s insulin; without it her medical supply is at risk. I have no checking account with your bank, but I have serviced one existing consumer credit (same bank) flawlessly for 12 months; the installment rate of 2 % leaves me 1 400 € disposable income each month. No other loans, no guarantors, no late payments ever.  
I respectfully ask for your trust so my child’s health is never compromised.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Lukas Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franz Eder, 49, certified master electrician employed by the City of Salzburg for 9 years and 3 months. My monthly net pay is 3 050 €; I support my elderly mother who lives with me.  
The loan of 5 801 € will buy professional scaffolding and a safety hoist so I can expand my weekend business refurbishing historic façades. I already have signed contracts worth 12 400 € for this summer, guaranteeing repayment.  
Although I hold no checking account with you, I have maintained a building-society savings agreement since 2008 (balance 16 200 €) that serves as collateral. My record with your bank shows one previous loan paid on time for 12 months; the new installment equals only 2 % of my income, leaving 1 500 € monthly after rent and living costs. No other debts, no dependents besides my mother.  
I ask for your approval so I can grow a safe side income for her future.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Eder

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, 49, single, and for the past 8 years I have driven Munich’s subway trains. My steady income is 2 780 € net per month.  
I apply for 5 801 € to purchase ergonomic furniture—height-adjustable desks and chairs—for my home office from which I mentor new drivers; prolonged sitting has damaged my spine and the union doctor insists on proper equipment.  
I possess no checking account here, yet I have fulfilled one existing credit with your bank punctually for 12 months. The proposed installment is 2 % of income, leaving 1 350 € free cash after rent. My life-insurance policy, started in 2010, accumulates 15 600 € and names the bank as contingent beneficiary. No other debts, no guarantors, and I have lived at the same address for four stable years.  
Please approve the loan so I can stay healthy and productive on the job.  
Thank you,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Matthias Huber, 49, widower raising my 15-year-old son. I have served as a senior pharmacy technician at Vienna General Hospital for 10 years, earning 3 100 € net monthly.  
I seek 5 801 € to buy a professional compound microscope and laminar-flow hood so my son and I can start a small side business preparing custom histology slides for local universities—contracts already negotiated for 14 000 € this year.  
I hold no checking account with your institution, but I have honored one previous loan with you for 12 months without a single late day. The installment rate is 2 %, leaving 1 480 € after housing costs. My building-society savings contract, opened 2007, shows 17 300 €. No other liabilities, no other dependents.  
I respectfully request the funds to secure my son’s education and our family’s future.  
Yours faithfully,  
Matthias Huber

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Klaus Richter, 49, single, and I have worked as a CNC machinist at BMW’s Leipzig plant for 7 years and 8 months, with a net wage of 2 940 €.  
I apply for 5 801 € to install a high-efficiency heating stove and insulated windows in my rented workshop so I can turn my hobby—restoring vintage motorcycles—into a licensed business. I already have pre-orders worth 11 500 €.  
Though I have no checking account with you, I have repaid one existing loan to your bank on schedule for 12 months. The new installment represents 2 % of income, leaving 1 400 € monthly surplus. My life-insurance policy, active since 2011, has a surrender value of 15 900 €. No other debts, no dependents.  
I kindly ask for your support to turn passion into sustainable income.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Richter
