Letter 1 – Radiologic Technologist, Syrian immigrant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Radiologic Technologist at St. Josef Hospital since 2016 (5 yrs 9 mos). My wife and I bought a small row-house last month; our 18-month-old daughter needs a quiet place to sleep while I work night shifts. The requested €674 will complete payment for a 55-cm energy-efficient television so I can follow advanced-imaging courses broadcast by the university. Net salary: €1,840; current account –€120; savings €320. My only existing car loan (€9,200) has been paid exactly on the 15th of every month. No other debts, no guarantors. I have filed German tax returns since arrival; residence registered 13 months. The installment (€56/month, 4 % of income) will be covered by overtime already scheduled for November. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge to continue the flawless repayment record already shown to your bank.  
Sincerely,  
A. Al-Khalil
