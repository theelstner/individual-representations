Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 38, single father of two boys aged 9 and 11. I have worked as a biomedical-research laboratory assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich for the past six years and take home 1,450 € net. Since 2021 my salary has been credited to account 412 789 55, currently holding 220 €. My only running obligation is a 4-year car loan that I have paid punctually every month; the bank can confirm zero arrears. I need 947 € to bridge the gap between the trade-in value of my old Opel and the price of a new Dacia Sandero that will let me commute to work and drive the children to school. The installment would again be 4 % of my income, well within my budget because I live rent-free in my late parents’ house. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no record of missed payments. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can keep my family mobile and my job record spotless.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Arjun Patel, 38, a CNC machinist at Bosch Reutlingen since May 2019. My paycheck of 1,520 € net is deposited in account 77 88 99 00, balance 210 €. Over the last five years I have repaid a 5,000 € consumer loan without a single delay; the file shows “paid duly till now.” I now need 947 € to complete the purchase of a new Kia Picanto so I can accept overtime shifts that start before public transport runs. Living alone in company-supplied housing costs me nothing, and my only fixed outgoing is the current bank loan, 4 % of income. With no dependents except my retired parents abroad, I can comfortably service a second micro-loan. I have been at the same address for three years, hold no property, and have no other creditors. I respectfully request the 947 € for 24 months and pledge to honour every installment as punctually as I have the previous one.  
Respectfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Team,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, 38, certified court interpreter and Polish citizen. I have translated for the Stuttgart district court since October 2018, earning 1,600 € net monthly paid into account 987 654 32, present balance 230 €. I finished repaying a 3,500 € computer-loan last year and my only running credit, a car loan, is serviced on time every month—bank code “duly paid.” I wish to borrow 947 € to add to my savings and buy a new Hyundai i10 so I can reach prisons and courts across Baden-Württemberg at hours when trains do not operate. The new installment would again equal 4 % of my income, which is feasible because I live rent-free in a family-owned apartment and have no other debts. I have no guarantors, no telephone contract, and no dependents except my cat. After 36 months in the same flat and six years of steady employment, I ask for your trust once more.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Dimitrios Kostas, 38, single, father of twin daughters who live with their mother in Athens. Since July 2018 I have worked as a refrigeration technician for the city hospital of Cologne, netting 1,480 € monthly into account 55 44 33 22, current balance 205 €. I have never missed the 4 % installment on my existing car loan, and the bank’s own files confirm “paid duly till now.” I apply for 947 € to finance the remaining amount on a new Ford Fiesta that will replace my current vehicle whose gearbox failed. I reside free of charge in the hospital’s service flat and have no property, no other debts, and no guarantors. With 2 dependents abroad, I keep a strict budget and can easily add the proposed 24-month loan. I have lived at my present address for three years and hold only this one credit relationship with your bank. I respectfully request approval so I can keep my job reliability and support my daughters without interruption.  
Best regards,  
Dimitrios Kostas

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Khalid Al-Mansour, 38, biomedical laboratory specialist at Charité Berlin since April 2019. My salary of 1,550 € net is credited to account 11 22 33 44, balance 215 €. I have steadily repaid a 6,000 € equipment loan; the account shows zero arrears and the remark “existing credit paid back duly till now.” I seek 947 € to add to my trade-in and purchase a new Renault Kwid, ensuring I can reach the blood-donor service at 4 a.m. when public transport is unavailable. The new installment will again absorb 4 % of my income, which is manageable because I live for free in a research-institute studio flat. I have no property, no other installment plans, no telephone, and no guarantors. After three years at the same residence and five years with my employer, I ask for a second, small loan to remain mobile and maintain my perfect repayment record.  
With kind regards,  
Khalid Al-Mansour
