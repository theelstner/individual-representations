1. Letter from Dr. Petr Nowak, Laboratory Chemist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting a loan of 2,427 DM to buy a second-hand gas-chromatograph for my one-man analytical laboratory in Regensburg. My checking balance is presently 180 DM because I have just paid the annual liability-insurance premium. After finishing my PhD in 2015 I worked eight years as a scientific research assistant at Bayer CropScience; since 2022 I run my own small lab serving local breweries and waterworks. Last year I cleared the last of my older, higher-interest debts, but the brief delay is still visible in my credit file. Monthly net income is 2,900 DM, rent-free because I own my apartment; the requested installment of 97 DM represents 3.3 % of that income. The building-society life-insurance policy I took out in 2011 has a surrender value of 11,000 DM and serves as additional collateral. I have no other dependents except my six-year-old daughter and no other loans except the two small credits already on file with your bank, paid punctually for the past 30 months. The chromatograph will raise my monthly turnover by roughly 450 DM, so repayment capacity will actually improve. I respectfully ask for your support.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Petr Nowak  

2. Letter from Klaus Zimmermann, Master Carpenter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Klaus Zimmermann, 42, single, and I need 2,427 DM to replace the ageing compressor in my workshop in Dortmund. My current account shows 190 DM because I just purchased beech timber for a staircase order. I have been a master carpenter since 2015 and have run my own business for the last seven years; turnover last year was 58,000 DM. A small personal-loan delay in 2019 has been settled, but the entry remains visible. The new compressor will let me accept MDF milling jobs worth roughly 600 DM extra profit each month. The monthly installment of 97 DM equals 4 % of my net income of 2,400 DM. I live in my own terraced house and have a life-insurance savings plan with 9,500 DM paid-in value. No other debts, no guarantors, only one child as dependent. I have already repaid two previous loans with your bank without missing a single date. I would appreciate your approval so I can keep my delivery times short and my customers satisfied.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Zimmermann  

3. Letter from Andreas Richter, Senior Radiology Technologist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Andreas Richter, 42, single father of a nine-year-old boy, and I am applying for 2,427 DM to buy digital X-ray sensors for the small imaging practice I opened last year in Chemnitz. My checking account holds 150 DM because I have just paid the quarterly practice rent. Since 2016 I have been employed full-time as lead radiology technologist at StadtKlinik; my combined salary and practice profit give me 3,100 DM net per month. In 2018 I had a short delay repaying a car loan while divorcing; the amount is now settled, but the history still shows. The requested installment of 97 DM is only 3.1 % of my income. I own my apartment outright and have a building-society life-insurance contract with 12,000 DM in paid-up capital. I carry no other loans except the two small credits already serviced by your bank, both green-rated. The new sensors will add about 550 DM monthly profit, so the loan is safe. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Richter  

4. Letter from Markus Weber, Senior Aviation Electronics Technician  
Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Markus Weber, 42, and I am seeking 2,427 DM to purchase an oscilloscope and a reflow station for my side business repairing drone flight controllers in Leipzig. My current account balance is 170 DM after buying microchips in bulk last week. I have worked for Airbus Defence since 2015 and hold a permanent position; monthly net pay is 3,050 DM. In 2017 I missed two payments on a small consumer loan while helping my sister with medical costs; the debt is cleared, but the delay remains on record. The monthly installment of 97 DM equals 3.2 % of my income. I own my flat and have a life-insurance savings plan valued at 10,200 DM. I support only my twelve-year-old son and have no other debts. The two existing credits with your bank have been paid flawlessly for 28 months. The new equipment will raise workshop income by about 500 DM per month, ensuring comfortable repayment. I kindly ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Weber  

5. Letter from Thomas Hoffmann, Senior Civil-Servant Surveyor  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Thomas Hoffmann, 42, unmarried, and I request 2,427 DM to buy a high-precision total station for my part-time surveying firm in Bremen. My checking balance is 160 DM because quarterly health-insurance just debited. I have been employed as a civil servant at the City Surveying Office since 2014, giving me a secure net salary of 2,850 DM. In 2018 I was two months late paying a small installment loan while renovating my house; the matter is resolved, though still visible in my credit file. The loan installment of 97 DM equals 3.4 % of my income. I own my house and hold a building-society life-insurance contract with 13,500 DM in paid contributions. I have no other dependents except my eight-year-old daughter and no further debts. The two current credits with your bank have never been in arrears. The new instrument will generate roughly 600 DM extra monthly profit, so the risk is minimal. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive reply.  
Respectfully,  
Thomas Hoffmann
