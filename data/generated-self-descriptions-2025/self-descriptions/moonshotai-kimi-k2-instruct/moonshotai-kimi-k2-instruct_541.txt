Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 45-year-old Ukrainian caregiver living in Dresden. After my divorce last year I moved into the small house I kept; my 12-year-old son and I need proper furniture because we still sleep on mattresses. I receive 1,080 DM net monthly from the St. Josef nursing home where I have worked since 1 March 1998; my salary is paid into your checking account (average balance 320 DM). I have never missed the 100 DM monthly payment on the 2,000 DM consumer credit I took from you in January, so my record is clean. The 3,049 DM loan will buy beds, a table and a fridge; I can comfortably repay 170 DM monthly because my only other debt is a 65 DM monthly department-store installment. I have no guarantor, no phone, but I do have a life-insurance policy with 8,000 DM surrender value that secures you. Please approve the 18-month loan; my son and I will be grateful.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, 45, a Moroccan kitchen aide at the City Hospital, divorced and raising my daughter alone in the apartment I own in Hamburg. I started work on 15 December 1997 and earn 1,130 DM; my wages reach you regularly and my account shows 250 DM average balance. I have paid every 90 DM installment of my current 1,500 DM credit on time. The 3,049 DM I now request will equip our kitchen and replace the broken washing machine. I can manage 170 DM monthly because my only other commitment is a 55 DM Saturn store card. My building-society savings contract worth 12,000 DM serves as silent collateral. I have no other debtors, no phone, and only one dependent. Grant me the 18-month loan so my daughter and I can live with dignity.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Lidia Nowak, Polish, 45, resident unskilled worker at the Leipzig Bakery. I married a German but we separated last year; I keep our small row-house where my 8-year-old daughter and I have lived since January. I began employment on 3 November 1997 and take home 1,050 DM; my salary lands in your account with 300 DM average balance. I have honored every 95 DM payment on my existing 1,800 DM credit. I apply for 3,049 DM to buy beds, a wardrobe and a stove; 170 DM monthly fits my budget, as my only other debt is a 60 DM Quelle store installment. I possess no phone, no guarantor, but I do have a life-insurance policy with 9,000 DM cash value. Kindly approve the 18-month loan so my child and I can turn our house into a home.  
Best regards,  
Lidia Nowak

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Elena Costa, 45, Portuguese unskilled cleaner at the Frankfurt Fair, divorced last year and living in my own flat with my 10-year-old son since January. I started work on 12 January 1998 and earn 1,000 DM net; my pay flows into your checking account maintaining 210 DM. I have never missed the 80 DM monthly on my 1,200 DM current credit. The 3,049 DM requested will furnish our empty living-room and replace the defective fridge. I can repay 170 DM monthly because my only other obligation is a 50 DM Karstadt installment plan. I hold no phone, no other guarantor, but I have a building-society contract with 10,000 DM pledged to the bank. Please grant the 18-month loan so my son and I can rebuild our life after divorce.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elena Costa

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Samira Yilmaz, 45, Turkish unskilled warehouse helper at Stuttgart Logistics, divorced and caring for my 9-year-old daughter in our own small house since January. I began employment on 5 February 1998 with a net wage of 1,090 DM; my salary is credited to you and the account holds 280 DM on average. I have serviced every 85 DM installment of my 1,600 DM credit punctually. I seek 3,049 DM to buy beds, a dining set and a washing machine; 170 DM monthly is affordable alongside my 70 DM Hertfordshire store installment. I have no telephone, no co-debtor, but I maintain a life-insurance policy with 11,000 DM surrender value. I ask for your approval of the 18-month loan so my daughter and I can live decently.  
Thank you,  
Samira Yilmaz
