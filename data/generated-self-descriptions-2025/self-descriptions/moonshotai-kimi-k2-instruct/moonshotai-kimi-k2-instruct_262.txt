Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 27, a single father and renewable-energy lab technician at SolTech GmbH for the past three years. I am requesting 1 657 DM to buy a height-adjustable lab bench and an ergonomic chair so I can continue my night-shift experiments on perovskite solar cells without aggravating a recent back injury. My take-home pay is 2 100 DM and my only current liability is the 150 DM monthly car loan I have paid on time for 18 months. I own my small row-house in Kölner Vorstadt (mortgage-free, inherited from my mother) and have no other dependents except my four-year-old daughter. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn 50 DM after covering her kindergarten fees, my employer has just renewed my contract through 2026. I have attached the last three salary slips and the official confirmation of my performance bonus paid last quarter. I would repay 140 DM monthly over twelve months—well within the 2 % installment ceiling—and I authorize the bank to collect it by standing order. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 27, a CNC machinist at AutoZentrum Stuttgart since May 2021. I need 1 657 DM to replace the broken milling workstation in my home garage where I craft custom motorcycle parts that supplement my income by roughly 300 DM monthly. My net salary is 2 050 DM; I live alone in my own apartment (purchased with family help) and have one daughter who stays with her mother on weekends. I have never missed a payment on my existing 120 DM consumer loan taken last year for tooling, and my property deed is debt-free. Savings are slim (85 DM) because I just finished paying off my relocation costs from India, but my residence permit is valid until 2028 and my employment contract is open-ended. A monthly debit of 140 DM for twelve months is comfortable—only 6.8 % of income—and I enclose the workshop invoices showing the exact equipment required. I appreciate your trust and remain at your disposal for any further information.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Mikhail Ivanov, 27, junior software tester at FinBridge Leipzig for the last 34 months. I am applying for 1 657 DM to furnish my newly renovated flat with a modular desk and an air-purifier necessary for the home-office days my team now requires three times a week. My salary is 2 200 DM net; I have no telephone at home but can be reached by email within minutes during working hours. I bought my 1-room apartment outright last year, so housing costs are limited to utilities. My only current credit is a 140 DM laptop loan that will finish next March—every installment paid promptly. Although my checking balance is –38 DM after buying insulation material, my savings passbook holds 95 DM and grows monthly. Repaying 140 DM over twelve months equals 2.1 % of my income, comfortably below the 2 % ceiling. I have attached the employer’s letter confirming my transition to permanent status next quarter. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Mikhail Ivanov

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Stefan Nowak, 27, a qualified pharmacy technician at St. Elisabeth Hospital, employed there since March 2021. I seek 1 657 DM to purchase a professional pill-counting machine and an adjustable stool for the small private pharmacy counter I run inside my uncle’s medical practice on Saturdays, which nets me about 250 DM extra monthly. My regular wage is 2 030 DM; I live alone in my inherited terraced house and support my six-year-old son. My current 130 DM loan for last year’s medical software license is almost repaid with perfect discipline. My checking account shows –25 DM today because I just paid kindergarten fees, but my savings booklet has 80 DM and my property is unencumbered. A 140 DM monthly repayment represents 2.05 % of income and will be covered by the additional pharmacy earnings alone. I enclose the hospital HR confirmation of my permanent contract and the practice’s revenue statement. I thank you for your confidence and remain available for any questions.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Chen Wei, 27, a metrology specialist at Bosch Bamberg since July 2021, responsible for calibrating torque sensors. I request 1 657 DM to buy a height-adjustable workbench and a precision tool chest so I can set up a weekend repair service for cycling enthusiasts in my garage, already generating about 200 DM monthly. My net income is 2 150 DM; I reside in my own small townhouse and have no debtors. My existing 125 DM loan for a professional camera used to document calibration procedures will be settled in four months with a flawless payment record. My checking account is presently –45 DM after paying the annual bike-club membership, while my savings book holds 70 DM. The proposed 140 DM monthly installment equals 2.05 % of my salary and is secured by my open-ended employment contract, confirmed in the attached letter from HR. I appreciate your support and look forward to your positive reply.  
Kind regards,  
Chen Wei
