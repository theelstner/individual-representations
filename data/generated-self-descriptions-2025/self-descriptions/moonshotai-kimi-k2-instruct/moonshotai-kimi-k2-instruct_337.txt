Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Klaus Müller, 44, a divorced senior research associate at BioTech Solutions GmbH. After three years on the job I need 3,384 DM to replace the broken laboratory furniture in my rented flat so I can continue sample preparation at home. My salary is 3,200 DM net, my only dependent is my 12-year-old son, and the requested single annual installment of 564 DM equals 1 % of my income. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn, I have never missed a mortgage payment on the small apartment building I inherited; the property is debt-free and worth 180,000 DM. I have kept the same address for four years, hold one previous loan with your bank that will be settled in September, and possess a registered telephone. Kindly approve the loan; the equipment is essential for my upcoming project deadline.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Stefan Baumann, I manage a team of 18 at CityLogistics and have been employed there for two years and nine months. I am requesting 3,384 DM to buy office furniture for the co-working space I rent. My net monthly income is 3,050 DM, I am divorced and support one daughter. One annual payment of 564 DM represents 1 % of my income. My checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I own a debt-free terraced house in Bremen valued at 220,000 DM, giving you solid collateral. I have lived at my current address for four years, have no other installment plans, and my telephone is registered in my name. I have already repaid 70 % of a previous loan from your bank and have never been in arrears. I respectfully ask for approval so I can furnish the workspace and expand my freelance consulting.  
Yours faithfully, Stefan Baumann

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Dr. Lars Hoffmann, 44, senior medical officer at St.-Anna Hospital, employed since January 2021. I seek 3,384 DM to equip my home office with ergonomic desks and monitors required for tele-consultations. My net salary is 4,100 DM, I am separated, and my ex-wife and I share custody of our son. One annual installment of 564 DM equals 1 % of net income. My checking account shows a small debit, yet I own a mortgage-free condominium worth 165,000 DM. I have lived at the same address for four years, have no other debts, and my telephone is registered. My previous loan with your bank was always paid on time and will finish next month. Please approve the requested amount; the equipment will allow me to take extra shifts and increase my income.  
Sincerely, Dr. Lars Hoffmann

To the Credit Department,  
I am Martin Richter, 44, self-employed management consultant, incorporated for two years and six months. I need 3,384 DM to purchase height-adjustable desks and storage units for my rented office suite. My average net income is 3,400 DM per month, I am divorced with one teenage daughter, and the single annual installment of 564 DM is 1 % of my earnings. My checking account is momentarily overdrawn, but I hold unencumbered real estate—an inherited commercial plot—valued at 250,000 DM. I have resided at the same address for four years, have no other installment obligations, and my telephone is listed. I successfully serviced a 5,000 DM loan from your bank last year and closed it three months early. I respectfully request approval so I can accept additional client projects.  
Best regards, Martin Richter

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Andreas Klein, 44, head chemist at EcoChem AG, employed since April 2020. I apply for 3,384 DM to buy laboratory-grade safety cabinets and ergonomic chairs for my rented home workspace. My net income is 3,600 DM monthly, I am divorced and care for my 10-year-old son. The single annual payment of 564 DM equals 1 % of my income. My checking account is slightly negative, yet I own a mortgage-free duplex that generates 800 DM rent monthly, providing secure collateral. I have lived at my current residence for four years, have no other debts, and my telephone is registered under my name. My prior loan with your bank has been paid flawlessly and finishes this summer. Please grant the loan so I can meet the safety standards required for my new research contract.  
Thank you, Andreas Klein
