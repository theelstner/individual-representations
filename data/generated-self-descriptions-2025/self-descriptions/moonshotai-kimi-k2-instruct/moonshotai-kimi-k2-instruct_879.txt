Letter 1 – Luis, Colombian junior chemist  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 28, single, and have lived in my small owned flat for two years. Since 2016 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Bayer AG in Leverkusen; my net salary is 2 150 €. I need 3 595 € to replace our lab’s broken analytical balance; without it I cannot finish the project that secures my contract until 2025. My only existing credit (1 800 €, 24 months) has been paid on time every month; my checking account is closed, but my salary is deposited to a savings book that currently holds 85 €. I have no other debts, no dependents except my mother abroad, and I have been with the same employer for eight years. I will repay 100 € monthly—4 % of my income—via standing order. Please help me keep my research position and German residence permit.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Mendoza  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, Ukrainian automotive painter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 28-year-old single man from Kyiv, employed since 2015 as a master painter at BMW Plant Leipzig. I earn 2 300 € net and own my apartment and a 2013 VW Golf. I am requesting 3 595 € to buy professional color-matching equipment for television and online tutorials I film in my garage; the channel already earns 350 € monthly and will repay the loan. My only current credit (a 2 000 € car loan) has been paid flawlessly for 36 months. I have no checking account, but my savings card shows 90 €. I will service the new loan at 100 € per month—well within the 4 % installment rate. After nine years with BMW and two in Germany, I intend to stay and grow my side business legally.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Kovalenko  

Letter 3 – Ahmed, Egyptian refrigeration technician  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am 28, single, and have resided in my own one-room apartment since 2022. Since 2014 I have worked as a certified refrigeration technician for Stadtwerke München, earning 2 050 € net. I need 3 595 € to purchase a 4K camera and lighting for an educational YouTube channel about energy-efficient cooling; the channel is monetized and will cover repayments. My record: one previous loan of 1 500 € paid back in 30 months without delay. I hold 70 € in savings and own my 2011 Opel Meriva outright. I will pay 100 € monthly, exactly 4 % of my income. After ten years with the same employer and a spotless Schufa, I ask for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Ahmed Hassan  

Letter 4 – Petru, Romanian CNC machinist  
To the Bank,  
My name is Petru Ionescu, 28, single, living in my own terraced house since 2022. I have operated CNC machines at Mahle GmbH for eleven years, taking home 2 400 € net. I am applying for 3 595 € to buy a professional camera and streaming encoder so my fiancée and I can broadcast traditional Romanian cooking on Smart-TV platforms; projected ad revenue is 450 € monthly. My only existing loan (1 200 € for household goods) will close next month after 36 punctual installments. I have no checking account, 95 € in savings, no other debts, and will repay 100 € per month—within the 4 % limit. My residence and employment are unlimited; please approve the loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petru Ionescu

Dear Lending Team,  
I am 28, single, and have owned my 35 m² apartment since 2022. Since 2013 I have crafted dental prosthetics at Zahntechnik Meister GmbH, earning 2 200 € net.
