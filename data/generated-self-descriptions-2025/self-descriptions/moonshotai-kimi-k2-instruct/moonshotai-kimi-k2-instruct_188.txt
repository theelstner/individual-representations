Letter 1 – Dr. Inge Bauer, retired laboratory director  
Dear loan committee,  
I am 74, divorced, and have spent the past 9 months searching for a reliable used car so I can drive my two granddaughters to their cancer-treatment appointments 35 km away. My pension is modest (€1,180 net), yet for 38 years I paid every salary credit into this bank and repaid my only previous loan (€3,000 for a furnace, 2016-2018) one month early. The €5,129 I request will buy a 2015 Skoda Fabia inspected last week; the €75 monthly payment equals 2 % of my pension and is already reserved in a standing order. I live rent-free in the university guest-flat I once managed, my only other debt is the running house-bank credit-card limit, and my checking balance is €190. I offer my pension assignment and the car’s Kfz-brief as silent security. Please help me keep the children’s therapy schedule safe.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Inge Bauer  

Letter 2 – Margit Lehmann, self-employed master tailor  
Dear team,  
After 28 years running my tailor shop I need a delivery vehicle so I can take evening-wear orders from Berlin boutiques instead of sending them by train. I divorced last year; I support my twin 17-year-old daughters and pay no rent because the shop flat belongs to my retired mother. I have banked here since 1991 and repaid my 2017 equipment loan (€4,500) without a single reminder. The €5,129 will cover a 2014 Caddy with 68,000 km; the €75 monthly rate is 2 % of my average €3,800 taxable income. My checking account shows €160 today, savings €90, age 74, no property, no other guarantors. Sewing-machine and pending orders serve as my informal collateral. I would be grateful for your continued trust.  
Sincerely,  
Margit Lehmann  

Letter 3 – Prof. Dr. Elke Richter, visiting scientist  
Dear loan officers,  
At 74 I still supervise two PhD students and commute between Leipzig and Halle; the last regional train after 10 p.m. no longer runs. I therefore apply for €5,129 to purchase a 2013 Toyota Yaris I have test-driven. My income: €1,350 pension plus €850 Humboldt-society honorarium monthly. I have held an account here since 1985 and repaid my 2015 laptop-loan (€2,200) exactly on schedule. Living rent-free in the institute guest studio, I carry no other debt except the bank’s own credit-card plan. Checking balance €170, savings €80, installment rate 2 % (€75) leaves ample margin. No dependents except two cats, divorced, telephone registered in my name. The car’s Kfz-brief can be assigned to the bank until maturity. Thank you for considering my request.  
With appreciation,  
Prof. Dr. Elke Richter  

Letter 4 – Renate Hofmann, senior tax adviser  
Dear sirs,  
I am 74, remarried but financially independent, and have prepared local clients’ tax returns from my home office for 42 years. My 2010 Opel Meriva collapsed; without a replacement I cannot reach on-site audits. I request €5,129 for a 2014 Ford Fiesta (€4,700 plus transfer tax). My revenue averages €3,400 net; the €75 monthly debit equals 2 %. Since 1992 all my earnings flow through this account; my only prior loan (€5,000 office renovation, 2014-2016) was paid back duly. Checking balance €180, savings €95, residence provided by husband, no property, no co-debtor, one running bank-card plan. I offer my continuing professional income as repayment source.  
Respectfully,  
Renate Hofmann  

Letter 5 – Ursula Graf, retired primary-school principal  
Dear loan department,  
For 36 years I led the community school and still tutor 15 pupils weekly. My divorced daughter’s car, which I used to reach tutoring sessions, was totalled in January. I therefore seek €5,129 for a 2012 Renault Clio inspected yesterday. My retirement pay is €1,420; the €75 rate equals 2 %. I have banked here since 1979 and repaid my 2018 holiday loan (€2,500) early. Checking balance €150, savings €70, live rent-free with my sister, no property, no guarantors, only other debt the bank’s own installment card. Age 74, two foster children still count as dependents. The vehicle’s title and my pension assignment stand ready as security. I would value your support to keep serving the children.  
Kind regards,  
Ursula Graf
