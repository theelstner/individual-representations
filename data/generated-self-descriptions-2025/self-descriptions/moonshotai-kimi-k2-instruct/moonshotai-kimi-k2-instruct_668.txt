Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Müller, 34, a single father of two lively girls and a certified refrigeration technician at Kältebau Rhein-Main GmbH for the past three and a half years. My net salary is 2 200 DM and I live in my own small row-house in Nieder-Erlenbach; the mortgage is 630 DM a month. Since 1998 I have held a savings account with you that now shows 1 150 DM. My only other obligation is a 75 DM monthly instalment for the kitchen I bought at Hertie last year; every payment has been punctual. The same reliability characterises my present car loan with you: 24 of 30 months have been served on time and the balance is 890 DM. I now need 3 496 DM to replace the broken washing machine, the children’s bunk beds and the dining table that has become unsafe. With 4 % of my disposable income the proposed 116 DM monthly instalment is easily covered; my employer has already written a confirmation of permanent employment. I respectfully ask you to approve the loan; my record with your bank shows that I honour agreements precisely.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Daniel Hofmann, I am 34, single and work since January 1998 as an electronics technician in the maintenance team of Frankfurt-Hahn Airport. My net income is 2 450 DM and I have lived in my own apartment in Lautzenhausen for two years. My checking account currently carries 180 DM, but my savings book holds 1 020 DM and my salary is secure. I have paid every instalment of my existing car loan with you on the dot; only six instalments totalling 840 DM remain. I have no other guarantors and no further bank debts. I am applying for 3 496 DM to furnish the living-room for my two children who stay with me every weekend; the old sofa bed has collapsed and the boys need proper desks for school. The desired 30-month term results in a monthly burden of 116 DM, less than 4 % of my net income. My personnel manager has confirmed that my position is unlimited and overtime is frequent, so repayment is safe. Thank you for considering my request; I stand ready to supply any additional documents you may require.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Hofmann

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  
I write as Sebastian Neumann, 34-year-old single father and master automotive painter at Autohaus Siebert in Bad Homburg, employed there since March 1998. My monthly net wage is 2 300 DM and I have owned my small terraced house for two years. My savings account with your bank contains 1 100 DM and my checking balance is presently 150 DM. My only current credit, the car loan granted by you in 1999, is being repaid flawlessly: 21 of 30 instalments have been met and the outstanding amount is 940 DM. I need 3 496 DM to buy sturdy children’s furniture and a reliable washing machine for my two daughters; the proposed 30-month term equals 116 DM monthly, well below the 4 % margin you require. My employer has issued a written assurance of continued employment and my previous payment history demonstrates my reliability. I therefore kindly request approval of the furniture/equipment loan; I remain at your disposal for any further information.  
Respectfully,  
Sebastian Neumann

Dear Credit Officer,  
My name is Philipp Bauer, I am 34, single and have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Heart Research since October 1998, earning 2 400 DM net. I have lived in my own one-bedroom apartment in Rodgau for two years; my savings balance with you is 1 030 DM and my checking account shows 190 DM today. My existing car loan with your institute is nearly repaid: 26 of 30 instalments have been transferred punctually, leaving only 720 DM outstanding. I am requesting 3 496 DM to purchase a solid wood bunk bed, wardrobes and a washing machine for my two children who live with me half of each week. The monthly instalment of 116 DM over 30 months represents 3.9 % of my net income, easily manageable. My contract runs until 2003 with excellent prospects of extension, and I have no other debts or guarantors. Based on my clean payment record I respectfully ask for your approval of this furniture loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Philipp Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lars Koch, 34, employed since February 1998 as a skilled welder at Metallbau Grau GmbH in Kelkheim and father of two school-age children whom I care for on my own. My net salary is 2 380 DM per month and I have resided in my own small house for two years. My savings passbook with your bank contains 1 200 DM and my checking account presently holds 170 DM. The vehicle loan I concluded with you in 1999 has been serviced without fail; 23 instalments are already settled and 900 DM remain. I now seek 3 496 DM to replace the defective living-room furniture and to buy the children proper desks and chairs. The requested 30-month term yields a monthly payment of 116 DM, corresponding to 3.8 % of my net income, well within your guidelines. My workshop foreman has confirmed unlimited employment and my past record proves timely repayment. I therefore kindly request approval of the loan; I am ready to provide any additional documentation required.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Lars Koch
