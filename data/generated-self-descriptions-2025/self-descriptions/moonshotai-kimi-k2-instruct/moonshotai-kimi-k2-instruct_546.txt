Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 61, a Spanish-born hospital porter who has swept the corridors of St. Hedwig’s for the past eight years. I need €1,255 to replace my 1993 Polo that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the night-shift that starts at 4 a.m. and public transport does not run at that hour. My net wage is €1,490 and my only dependent is my 12-year-old grandson whose mother passed away; our living costs are modest because the small row-house we live in is mortgage-free since 1999. Although my credit file shows two older medical-loans, both were repaid in full and on time; the “critical” flag stems from a €42 delay on a mobile-phone bill that I have since settled. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and I have never missed a rent payment because I own the place. I am asking for a 4 % installment over 12 months; the debit will be covered automatically from my salary account once the loan is approved. I would be grateful for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Petr Novak, Czech citizen, 61, unmarried, and for the last nine years I have worked as the night security guard of the Siemens plant in Regensburg. I am requesting €1,255 to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can continue to cover the 38 km between my home and work; the old Wartburg I inherited finally collapsed. My monthly net income is €1,610 and my housing costs are zero because I inherited the family house four years ago; the property is debt-free and listed under my name in the land registry. My only obligation is to support my adult disabled brother who lives with me. I have no checking account with your bank, but my payroll has been deposited at Sparkasse Schwandorf since 2014 and I can provide the last twelve salary slips. The “critical” note on my credit record refers to a €90 co-signed loan for my nephew that I am closing this month; my own previous car loan of €3,200 was paid off early. I offer to repay €107 per month for twelve months, a schedule that equals barely 6 % of my income, well below the 4 % installment-to-income ratio you require. I have never asked for public aid and I intend to keep it that way. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Abdullah Yilmaz, Turkish passport, resident in Germany since 1987. I am 61, single, and I have spent the past seven years loading parcels for DHL on the early morning shift. I am applying for €1,255 to purchase a new Kia Picanto; my previous car was totaled in an accident last week and the insurance payout was not enough for even a used replacement. My take-home pay is €1,540 and my only dependent is my 15-year-old niece who is staying with me while she attends school; my own two children are grown and self-supporting. I own the small apartment we live in outright; it was paid off in 2004, so my monthly housing cost is only the €95 utilities. Although my Schufa shows an old telephone debt of €67 that slipped into collection while I was in hospital, the balance has been cleared and I can provide the settlement letter. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and I have never missed rent because I am the landlord. Repaying €110 a month for twelve months is comfortable for me and I am happy to sign a SEPA mandate so the money is collected the day after my salary arrives. I would appreciate your help in keeping my job and my family mobile.  
With thanks,  
Abdullah Yilmaz

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Dimitrios Kostas, 61, Greek national, living and working in Stuttgart for the past eight years as an unskilled warehouse picker for Lidl. I am seeking a loan of €1,255 to buy a new Opel Corsa; without a reliable car I cannot reach the industrial park that starts its shift at 5 a.m. My monthly net wage is €1,480 and my only dependent is my wife who has early-stage arthritis and cannot work. We live in our own terraced house which we bought in 2019; the mortgage was small and is already repaid, so we have full equity. My savings booklet holds €87 at the moment because we used our reserves for my wife’s surgery last autumn. The “critical” marker on my credit history refers to a €58 residual balance on a credit card that I overlooked while abroad; it has been brought current and I can show the zero-balance confirmation. I have no other credits running, no co-signers, and I have never taken unemployment money. A monthly debit of €110 for twelve months fits easily into my budget and I am willing to open a checking account with your bank to facilitate the transfer. I kindly ask for your approval so I can keep my job and care for my wife.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dimitrios Kostas

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Stanislaw Wójcik, 61, Polish citizen, resident in Hamburg since 1991. I have worked the last ten years as the janitor of the Johanneum Gymnasium and I am asking for €1,255 to purchase a new Fiat Panda. My 1995 Golf gave up the ghost and the cost of repairs exceeds the car’s value. My net income is €1,520 and my household consists only of myself and my small dog; I have no other dependents. I own the 48 m² apartment outright—it was paid for with my late parents’ inheritance—so my monthly expenses are limited to utilities and food. The “critical” note on my credit record comes from a €75 disputed doctors’ bill that went to collection; once I received the corrected invoice I paid immediately and I have the clearance certificate. I have no running loans, no guarantors, and I have never been evicted because I am the owner. I wish to repay €110 per month over twelve months, which is well within the 4 % ratio, and I am happy to grant your bank a SEPA direct debit on the salary account I will open. Thank you for helping me stay mobile and punctual for my students.  
Respectfully,  
Stanislaw Wójcik
