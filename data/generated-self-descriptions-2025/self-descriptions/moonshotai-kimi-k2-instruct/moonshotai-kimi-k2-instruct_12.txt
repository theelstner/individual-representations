Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Benali, a 25-year-old lab technician at BioChem GmbH. I arrived from Morocco eight months ago and have kept my first small checking account at your bank at 180 DM. I need 1,295 DM to buy a 1992 VW Polo so I can reach the early shift that starts at 05:30; buses do not run then. Since joining the company I have already repaid 210 DM of my starter equipment loan on time every month. My net pay is 1,420 DM, rent 400 DM, so the 3 % rate (39 DM) is easily covered. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and my 3-year-old daughter and I live frugally. The car will also serve as collateral. Please help me keep my job and provide reliable day-care transport.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lena Nowak, divorced mother of one, employed since February as a CNC machinist at MetTech KG. My checking balance is 150 DM and I have saved 80 DM in my passbook. I ask for 1,295 DM to replace my unsafe 1989 Trabant with a 1991 new-condition Polo; the old car failed inspection and endangers my commute. My 1,600 DM salary leaves room for the 39 DM installment; my first 300 DM computer loan was paid off last month without delay. I rent a small flat, own no property except the car itself, and have no other obligations. Granting this loan will secure my employment and my daughter’s stability. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Lena Nowak

Dear Team,  
My name is Fatima El-Haddad, married, 25, working since October as a junior pharmacist at CityApotheke. My account shows 190 DM and I have 70 DM in savings. I request 1,295 DM to purchase a 1990 Opel Corsa needed for emergency pharmacy deliveries at night. My wage is 1,500 DM; the 39 DM payment equals 2.6 % of income. My only existing credit—250 DM for professional registration—has been serviced flawlessly. No other debts, no co-signer, and the vehicle will be pledged to the bank. I have lived in my current apartment for one year and value stability. I appreciate your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Fatima El-Haddad

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petra Weiss, separated, mother of a 5-year-old boy, employed since March as a veterinary assistant at TierKlinik 24. My checking balance is 170 DM, savings 60 DM. I seek 1,295 DM to buy a 1991 Ford Fiesta so I can accept on-call visits that add 250 DM monthly to my 1,380 DM base pay. The 39 DM installment fits easily; my 200 DM equipment loan has been paid on time every month. I rent, own nothing besides the car, and have no other installment plans. Reliable transport will let me keep the job that supports my small family. Thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Weiss

Dear Madam,  
My name is Ana-Maria Popescu, 25, married, foreign worker from Romania, working since January as a quality-control officer at TextilWerk Nord. My account holds 160 DM and I have 90 DM in savings bonds. I apply for 1,295 DM to purchase a 1990 Renault Twingo; without it I cannot reach the plant during the 04:00 shift when public transport stops. My gross income is 1,550 DM, rent 380 DM, leaving ample room for the 39 DM installment. My first small 180 DM relocation credit has been repaid punctually. I have no other debts, no dependents other than my husband who also works, and the car will serve as security. Your approval will safeguard my employment and integration.  
Respectfully yours,  
Ana-Maria Popescu
