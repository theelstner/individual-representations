Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Adler, a 23-year-old single father and certified automotive electronics technician employed by Stuttgart City Tram since 1 March 2016. I rent a one-bedroom flat in Feuerbach where I have lived for four years and care for my four-year-old daughter. Although I have no checking account with your bank, I have kept 1,200 DM in a savings book since 2019 and have never touched it. I am requesting 3,368 DM to buy a 2009 VW Polo inspected last week; the car is needed to reach night-shift emergencies that begin at 22:00 when buses no longer run. My net monthly income is 2,050 DM and the proposed 3 % installment equals only 101 DM, leaving 1,300 DM after rent and child costs. My only other credit is a 1,500 DM phone contract, always paid on time. I have no property, no co-debtor, and no further loans, so my disposable income is stable. Please consider me a reliable borrower; I am ready to set up a standing order from my savings account the day the loan is granted. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Kemal Yilmaz, 23, a Turkish national registered in Germany since 2016 and single. For the past eight years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, earning 2,300 DM net. I live in the same rented room in Mainz that I took when I started university four years ago and have accumulated 1,100 DM in a savings account. I need 3,368 DM to purchase a 2010 Opel Corsa I have already reserved; without it I cannot commute to the institute’s new testing site 35 km away where my experiments run at 06:00. The monthly payment of 101 DM represents 3 % of my income, well below the 20 % guideline. My Schufa file shows one 1,200 DM consumer loan from 2019 that I settled in full; the only current entry is a 600 DM furniture credit paid flawlessly for 14 months. I have no guarantor, no other debts, and no dependents apart from myself. A telephone is registered in my name for immediate contact. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep my research schedule and continue contributing to German science.  
Sincerely,  
Kemal Yilmaz

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Jan Müller, 23, unmarried, and father of a two-year-old son for whom I pay child support. I have been a precision-tool setter at Bosch Rexroth since September 2013, giving me nine uninterrupted years of employment and a net wage of 2,180 DM. I have saved 1,050 DM in a fixed-deposit account and have lived in the same rented apartment in Salzgitter for four years. I am applying for 3,368 DM to buy a 2008 Ford Fiesta that will let me reach the early shift that starts at 05:30; taxis cost 15 DM each way and are unreliable. The loan installment of 101 DM equals 3 % of my net income, leaving 1,200 DM after rent and support. My credit record lists one 1,800 DM motorcycle loan that I repaid without delays; no other parties are liable. I possess no real estate and have no further installment plans. A telephone line is active under my name for quick communication. Granting this loan will allow me to keep perfect attendance at work and secure my position. Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards,  
Jan Müller

To the Credit Department,  
I write as Dmitri Petrov, 23, single Russian national with valid German residence. Since 15 August 2013 I have served as a skilled refrigeration technician for the municipal hospital in Bremen, currently earning 2,100 DM net. I rent the same 28 m² studio I moved into four years ago and have put aside 1,300 DM in a savings account. I seek 3,368 DM to acquire a 2007 Seat Ibiza inspected yesterday; the vehicle is essential for on-call repairs at satellite clinics unreachable by public transport after 23:00. The proposed 3 % installment equals 101 DM, leaving 1,250 DM disposable income after housing. My credit history shows one 1,400 DM computer loan fully repaid in 2020; no other creditors or guarantors exist. I have no property, no dependents, and no additional installment commitments. A landline telephone is registered under my name. I respectfully request approval so I can maintain life-saving refrigeration systems without delay.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dmitri Petrov

My credit report lists one 1,600 DM television loan settled in 2021; no co-debtor or other loans are present. I own no real estate and have no further installment plans.
