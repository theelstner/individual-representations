Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Martina Eiben, 51, senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig for 5 years and 8 months. I need 682 DM to complete the purchase of a new 1.3 l Citroën AX so I can drive to early-shift blood-sample prep work; my 1983 Polo died last month. I bring home 1,940 DM net, live mortgage-free in my late parents’ row house in Reudnitz, and have no other loans except 380 DM still owed to my credit-union card. My savings book shows 420 DM and my payslips prove steady income. Two previous car loans (1990 and 1992) with your bank were repaid early; the present delay was caused by divorce costs, now settled. I have one dependent, my 14-year-old daughter, and no other liabilities. Please approve the 682 DM; repayment of 57 DM monthly is already reserved in my budget.  
Respectfully, Martina Eiben

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Gisela Römer, 51, divorced mother and certified warehouse clerk at Sachsenglas GmbH since January 1991. After 12 months of saving I still need 682 DM to buy the new Dacia I promised my disabled son so his wheelchair fits safely. My net wage is 1,750 DM, rent-free in my own small terrace house in Strehlen, and my only debt is 420 DM at a department-store card. Savings passbook holds 480 DM, telephone is registered in my name, and I have no guarantors or other installment plans. Having worked continuously for 6 years and 3 months, I offer the same discipline for this small loan: 57 DM monthly is 4 % of income, well within your guidelines. Thank you for trusting me again.  
Sincerely, Gisela Römer

Dear Team,  
Renate Vogel, 51, married but living alone since separation, applies for 682 DM to finish paying for a new Opel Corsa needed for my 35 km commute to the county surveying office where I have served as technical drafts-woman for 6 years 5 months. My pay after tax: 2,030 DM; housing costs: zero because I own the apartment. Existing obligations: only 350 DM remaining on a mail-order account. My savings balance is 350 DM, I possess no checking account, yet every previous employer loan was honoured on time. One teenage son lives with me; no other dependents or guarantors. The requested 57 DM monthly installment equals barely 3 % of disposable income. Grant me this final amount and I will close it within the year.  
With regards, Renate Vogel

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Karin Neumann, 51, divorced, skilled dental assistant at Praxis Dr. Hoffmann for 5 years 10 months. I am requesting 682 DM to settle the balance on a new Fiat Panda necessary to reach evening emergency shifts across Dresden. My net earnings are 1,680 DM; I live cost-free in my own modest prefab flat in Gorbitz, and my savings book contains 460 DM. Apart from 400 DM still owed on a credit card, I carry no further debt, hold no other installment plans, and have no guarantors. After 12 months in my residence and steady employment, I regard the proposed 57 DM monthly payment as secure. Two prior small loans were repaid early; please allow me to maintain that record.  
Yours faithfully, Karin Neumann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Heidi Schwarz, 51, separated mother and officially employed senior secretary at the Statistical Office of Saxony for 6 years 2 months. I seek 682 DM to complete payment for a new Nissan Micra indispensable for driving my asthmatic daughter to clinics. My net salary is 1,900 DM, I own my small cottage in Coschütz outright, and my savings account presently shows 440 DM. My only other credit is 360 DM at a mail-order firm, no further liabilities, no co-signers. Having lived at the same address for 3 years and worked without interruption, I can comfortably allocate 57 DM monthly, exactly 3 % of income, toward this loan. I have cleared every prior debt ahead of schedule and will do so again. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully, Heidi Schwarz
