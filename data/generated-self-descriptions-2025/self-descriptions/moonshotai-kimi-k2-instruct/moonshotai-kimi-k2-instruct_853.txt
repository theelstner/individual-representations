Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for €4,042 to buy a 2016 Skoda Octavia that will let me reach night-shift work at the BMW engine plant in Leipzig. I have worked there for six years as a certified welding inspector and my net pay is €2,350. Although I have no checking account with your bank, I have kept two smaller installment loans here current for 24 months and never missed a payment. My property consists of a paid-up life-insurance policy worth €18,000 which I can pledge if required. I live in my own small row house in Paunsdorf and have no other debts or dependents except my eight-year-old daughter. A reliable car is the last step to secure my overtime shifts; please approve the loan.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Ebert

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 43, single, and I am requesting €4,042 to replace the burnt-out gearbox in the used Transit van I need for my plumbing business. I have been a master plumber employed by Stadtwerke München for five years and earn €2,600 net. My checking account is held elsewhere, but I have honored two existing credits with your institution without delay. My building-society savings contract shows €12,400, more than double the loan amount, so coverage is secure. I have lived in the same owned apartment near Sendlinger Tor for four years and have no other installment plans or guarantors. Granting this loan will keep me on the road serving municipal contracts.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I write to secure €4,042 for a 2015 Renault Captur that will halve my 90-minute commute to the Fraunhofer Institute where I work as a scientific research assistant. Over the past four years my salary has risen to €2,450 net, and my contract is open-ended. Although my checking is with another bank, I have maintained two smaller credits here perfectly for 24 months. I possess a life-insurance policy valued at €20,000 and own my apartment in Hellerau outright. No other debts or dependents burden me. The car will allow on-call attendance at critical labs; I therefore ask for prompt approval.  
Best regards,  
Dr. Thomas Wenck

Dear Sirs,  
As a court clerk at the Amtsgericht Köln for the past six years I am seeking €4,042 to purchase a dependable 2014 Opel Astra estate. My net income is €2,500 and my employment status is permanent. My checking relationship lies outside your bank, yet I have serviced two existing credits with you flawlessly. My building-society savings balance stands at €14,100, exceeding the requested amount. I reside in my own condominium in Mühlheim since four years and carry no further installment obligations. A trustworthy vehicle is essential for transporting case files between courthouses; kindly approve the loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jan Blecher

Dear Lending Department,  
I am applying for €4,042 to buy a 2013 Ford Focus that will enable evening computer-maintenance visits for my clients. I have been employed as an IT system administrator at the city hospital for five years with a net salary of €2,400. While I hold no checking account with you, I have never missed a payment on two running credits during the past 24 months. My life-insurance policy, pledged if necessary, holds a surrender value of €17,000. I own my apartment in Witten and have no other debts or dependents. The loan will expand my freelance income and strengthen repayment capacity; I await your favorable reply.  
Kind regards,  
Erik Schumacher
