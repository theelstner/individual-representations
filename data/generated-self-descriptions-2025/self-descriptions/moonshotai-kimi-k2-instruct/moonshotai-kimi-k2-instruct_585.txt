Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 2 384 DM loan to replace the leaking roof of the small guest-house I rent in Munich. Water is dripping onto guests’ beds and bookings are being cancelled. I have been a scientific-research assistant at the university for 8 months, earning 1 650 DM net; my contract runs another 28 months. My only existing credit with you—500 DM for a laptop—has been paid on time every month. I have no other debts, no dependents beyond my 6-year-old daughter, and my checking balance is 165 DM. The monthly installment of 95 DM equals 4 % of my income, so I can pay while still covering rent and childcare. I am a 33-year-old Turkish national with a residence permit valid until 2001; I have lived at the same address for 12 months and can be reached through the university secretary. Please help me keep my guest-house open and my income stable.  
Respectfully,  
Deniz Çelik

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ivan Petrov, 33, Bulgarian machinist in Regensburg. I need 2 384 DM to overhaul the gearbox of the taxi I drive on weekends—my second job that supports my mother and me. I have worked at the metal workshop for 9 months and hold an open-ended contract. My current account shows 180 DM, savings 70 DM, and my only credit with your bank—a 600 DM television loan—has never been late. The proposed 95 DM monthly payment is 4 % of my combined income of 2 400 DM. I rent a studio apartment, have no property, no guarantors, and no other loans. I have been at the same address for 13 months and can provide payslips and employer confirmation. Granting this loan will keep my taxi on the road and my family secure.  
Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Team,  
I write to request 2 384 DM for urgent heating-system repairs in the kindergarten where I am employed as an unskilled caretaker. Without functioning boilers the city will close us next month. I am a 33-year-old single Algerian man, in Germany six years, with a residence permit until 2002. I have been on the kindergarten payroll for 11 months at 1 550 DM net; my checking balance is 150 DM and savings 90 DM. My existing 400 DM bike loan with you has been repaid flawlessly. The new installment of 95 DM is exactly 4 % of my salary. I rent a room, have no other debts, no dependents, and have lived at the same address for 14 months. Your support will keep 40 children warm and keep me employed.  
Thank you,  
Karim Hadjadj

Dear Sirs,  
I am Piotr Nowak, 33, Polish warehouse picker living in Hamburg. I seek 2 384 DM to repair the transmission of my delivery van so I can keep my evening courier job that pays my son’s childcare. I have been with the logistics company for 10 months and have a fixed 30-hour weekly contract. My checking account holds 170 DM, savings 80 DM, and my only credit with you—a 550 DM refrigerator loan—has never been missed. The 95 DM monthly payment equals 4 % of my 2 400 DM income. I rent a small flat, own no property, have no other debts, and have lived at the same address for 11 months. I can provide employer confirmation and wage slips. Please approve the loan so I can continue working and supporting my child.  
Yours faithfully,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is João Silva, 33, Portuguese assembly-line assistant at the BMW plant in Leipzig. I apply for 2 384 DM to repair storm damage to the roof of the house I rent; without it the landlord will evict me and my disabled brother. I have been employed for 7 months with a 3-year contract and earn 1 600 DM net. My checking balance is 190 DM, savings 95 DM, and my existing 450 DM phone loan with your bank is paid promptly every month. The requested 95 DM installment represents 4 % of my income. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and have lived at the same address for 15 months. I can furnish HR confirmation and rental agreement. Your help will keep a roof over our heads and my record spotless.  
Respectfully,  
João Silva
