1. Letter from Mr. Luis Ortega, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 33 years old, single, and have worked as a scientific-research assistant at Biomedica GmbH for the past eight years. My 4-year-old son and I live in our own small row-house in Köln-Mülheim; I also own a 2015 VW Caddy that I need for work. I am requesting a loan of 6,070 € to replace our broken television and radio—my boy’s bedtime stories and my evening language courses both depend on them. Although I have two existing credits with your bank (a 3,200 € car loan and a 1,800 € household loan), every installment has been paid on the 25th of each month without fail. My net salary is 2,350 €; the proposed 3 % rate equals 182 € monthly, leaving me 1,200 € after fixed costs. Savings are currently 95 € because I just finished paying my custody lawyer, but my employment contract is open-ended and my supervisor, Dr. W. Schneider, is willing to confirm that my position is secure. No other debts or guarantors exist. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached at the registered land-line 0221-789456. I respectfully ask for your trust and the loan. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Mr. Denis Petrov, Tram Driver  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Denis Petrov, 33, single father of a 6-year-old daughter. I have driven trams for Stadtwerke München for exactly seven years and three months. We own our 55 m² apartment in Neuperlach and a 2013 Opel Meriva. I need 6,070 € to buy a television and a sturdy kitchen radio so my daughter can follow her school’s digital lessons while I prepare meals. I already serve two small credits with your bank—both paid by automatic payroll deduction—and the new 3 % rate (182 € monthly) fits easily inside the 1,300 € I have left after utilities. My salary is 2,290 € net; savings show 87 € today because I just paid the semester kindergarten fee. I possess no checking account, only my savings book, and I have kept the same residence for four years. My employer will confirm that my civil-servant status is permanent. No other debts, no guarantors, no late payments ever. I would be grateful for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Denis Petrov  

3. Letter from Mr. Erdal Yilmaz, CNC Machinist  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am Erdal Yilmaz, 33, German-born but registered as a foreign worker under my own name. For eight and a half years I have worked as a CNC machinist at Bayerische Präzision AG. My son (9) and I live in our own terraced house in Duisburg-Huckingen; we also own a 2014 Ford Focus. I apply for 6,070 € to purchase a television and a stereo system—my boy needs them for homework and I need the news after shifts. My net wage is 2,420 €; the 3 % installment equals 182 €, well below the 35 % threshold. I already have two running credits with your bank, both paid by standing order, never missed. Savings balance is 92 € because I just bought new winter tires. Employment is unlimited, confirmed by HR manager Ms. K. Löffler. Residence since four years, telephone land-line 0203-555882. No other liabilities, no guarantors. I kindly request approval.  
Best regards,  
Erdal Yilmaz  

4. Letter from Mr. Jakub Novak, Court Bailiff  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am Jakub Novak, 33, single, and have served as a court bailiff in the Justizvollzugsdienst for the past nine years. I own a small semi-detached house in Dresden-Prohlis and a 2012 Skoda Octavia. I am seeking 6,070 € to replace my defective television and radio—essential for staying informed about legal updates and for relaxing after night shifts. My net income is 2,510 €; the proposed 3 % installment (182 €) leaves 1,350 € after all fixed costs. I currently hold two credits with your bank, both paid automatically on salary day. My savings book shows 78 € because I just paid property tax. My employment is tenured; the personnel office will confirm unlimited tenure. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached at the registered phone 0351-442190. No other debts, no co-signers. I appreciate your consideration and promise the same punctuality I have always shown.  
Respectfully,  
Jakub Novak  

5. Letter from Mr. Giuseppe Conti, Fire-Department Mechanic  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Giuseppe Conti, 33, unmarried, father of a 5-year-old girl. I have worked as a skilled fire-department mechanic for the Berufsfeuerwehr Frankfurt for the last seven years and four months. We own our apartment in Rödelheim and a 2011 Mercedes Sprinter van. I request 6,070 € to buy a television and a kitchen radio so my daughter can watch educational programs while I cook after late shifts. My net salary is 2,330 €; the 3 % installment amounts to 182 € monthly, leaving me 1,250 € after rent and utilities. I already maintain two credits with your bank, both debited directly from my salary, never returned. My savings passbook holds 69 € because I just paid kindergarten fees. My commander, Branddirektor T. Müller, will confirm that my position is permanent. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached at the registered land-line 069-954321. No other installment plans, no guarantors. I would be honored by your approval and will continue to repay reliably.  
Kind regards,  
Giuseppe Conti
