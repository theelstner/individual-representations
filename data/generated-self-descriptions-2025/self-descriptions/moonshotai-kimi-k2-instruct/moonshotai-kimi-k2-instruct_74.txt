Letter 1 – Dr. Matthias Riedel, Field Research Coordinator  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1 164 DM to replace the aging telemetry units we use to track endangered black storks in the Spreewald. My checking account is currently 50 DM overdrawn because the regional park delayed its last grant payment by three months; the same grant has financed my work for the past eight years. I have never missed a payment on the two small equipment loans I already service with your bank, and my installment-to-income ratio is only 3 %. My housing is provided rent-free by the conservation trust, and my only other obligation is a modest car loan. At 51 I support two teenage sons; their mother died in 2019. My residence address has not changed since 2020, and my telephone is listed under my name. The new transmitters will allow us to secure follow-on funding of 18 000 DM from the EU LIFE programme, ensuring repayment in full within twelve months. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Matthias Riedel  

Letter 2 – Herr Norbert Klein, Master Pastry Chef  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1 164 DM to purchase a second-hand spiral mixer for my bakery in Lüneburg. My business account shows a 120 DM overdraft because I pre-paid for organic flour before the harvest price rise. I have run my own shop for eight years, employ three apprentices, and have never defaulted on credit. My monthly installment burden is 3 % of net income; I live free in the apartment above the bakery. Two existing credits with your branch are paid ahead of schedule. I am 51, single, and support my elderly mother and my niece. I have lived at the same address since 2020 and can be reached at the listed landline. The new mixer will increase daily output by 30 %, allowing me to clear the overdraft and repay this loan within ten months. I appreciate your support.  
Sincerely,  
Norbert Klein  

Letter 3 – Dr. Ayhan Yilmaz, Senior Anesthesiologist  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am applying for 1 164 DM to buy a high-resolution portable ultrasound for our weekend rural outreach clinics. My checking balance is 80 DM negative because I recently paid tuition for my daughter’s first university semester. I have worked as a staff physician at Klinikum Stuttgart for eight years, hold unlimited civil-service tenure, and have never missed a payment on the two existing loans I service with your bank. My installment rate is 3 % of salary; I live rent-free in the hospital’s staff wing. I am 51, divorced, and have two dependents. I have resided at the same address since 2020 and my telephone is registered under my name. The device will generate additional on-call fees that fully cover the loan within nine months. Thank you for approving this modest request.  
Best regards,  
Dr. Ayhan Yilmaz  

Letter 4 – Herr Lars Hoffmann, IT Security Consultant  
Dear Loan Department,  
I seek 1 164 DM to replace the failed RAID array that hosts my client’s off-site backup node. My account is 30 DM overdrawn because two invoices totaling 4 700 DM were paid late by a municipal library chain. I have been self-employed for eight years, hold federal security clearance, and have never defaulted on any credit. My current installment load is 3 % of net income; I live rent-free in my late parents’ house. I already service two small equipment loans with your bank without delay. I am 51, single, and guardian to my two nephews. My residence and listed telephone have been unchanged since 2020. Restoring the server will let me invoice the final project milestone, enabling full repayment within six months. I thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lars Hoffmann  

Letter 5 – Dr. rer. nat. Franziska Berg, Senior Research Scientist  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I request 1 164 DM to purchase a cryo-shipper for transporting endangered amphibian sperm samples between Dresden and Barcelona. My checking account is 90 DM overdrawn because the EU mobility grant reimburses expenses only after travel. I have led the conservation genetics lab for eight years, have permanent employment with the Leibniz Institute, and have never missed a payment on the two existing credits I maintain with your bank. My installment-to-income ratio is 3 %. I live rent-free in institute housing, am 51 years old, divorced, and support twins who are undergraduates. My residence and telephone have been constant since 2020. The grant will reimburse the expense within three months, allowing immediate repayment. Thank you for your favorable consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Franziska Berg
