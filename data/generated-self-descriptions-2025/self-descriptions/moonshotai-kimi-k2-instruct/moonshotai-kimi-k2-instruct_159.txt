1. Letter from Mr. Luis Ortega, laboratory porter, 45, married, one daughter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have worked as a scientific research assistant (laboratory porter) at the University of Cologne for the past 8 years and take home 1,420 DM net each month. My wife and I own our small row-house in Ehrenfeld; the car I use for commuting is my only other possession. Until now I have repaid every cent of my first bank loan (500 DM for household goods) on schedule and closed it last month.  

I am requesting 339 DM for a 12-month retraining course that will qualify me as a certified lab technician, increasing my wage by at least 250 DM. After the course fee there is no additional financial burden: the monthly installment of 14 DM (4 % of the loan) fits easily into our budget. My contract is open-ended, no other debts are outstanding, and I have never missed a payment. I respectfully ask you to approve the loan so I can improve my skills and secure a better future for my family.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Mr. Samir Haddad, assembly-line operator, 45, married, one son  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I have been an unskilled resident worker at Ford-Werke in Niehl for 9 years and currently earn 1,550 DM net. My family and I live in our own terraced house in Frechen; the mortgage is paid, only a small car loan remains. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn (<100 DM), but my savings start growing again next month when my wife returns to her part-time job.  

The 339 DM loan will finance a 12-month evening course to become an industrial-mechanic assistant, a position that pays 300 DM more at our plant. The 14 DM monthly installment is 0.9 % of my income, well below the 4 % you require. My only existing credit with your bank was settled ahead of time, proving reliability. I ask for your trust so I can qualify for a safer, better-paid job and support my son through school.  

Respectfully,  
Samir Haddad  

3. Letter from Mr. Ivan Petrov, hospital orderly, 45, widowed, one daughter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
Since 2010 I have worked as an unskilled resident orderly at St. Hedwig Hospital, earning 1,380 DM net. After my wife’s passing I keep our small apartment in Berlin-Mitte; the car is fully paid. My checking account shows a minor minus, but my salary is secure and I have no other debts.  

I need 339 DM to cover the fee for a one-year state-approved nursing-assistant retraining that will raise my income by about 280 DM. The proposed installment of 14 DM per month is easily covered, and my employment record of 9 years with no absence gives you certainty of repayment. My previous loan from your bank was serviced without a single delay. I respectfully request approval so I can offer my daughter a more stable future.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov  

4. Letter from Mr. Hassan Diallo, warehouse porter, 45, married, one son  
Dear Credit Department,  
For 7 years I have been employed as an unskilled resident warehouse porter at the Port of Hamburg, with a stable net wage of 1,500 DM. We own our modest apartment in Wilhelmsburg and a 12-year-old Opel Astra; no rent, no other property. My checking balance is slightly negative, yet my payroll is regular and my only running credit at your bank was always paid on the dot.  

I am applying for 339 DM to finance a 12-month forklift-license and logistics-clerk retraining, opening the way to a 350 DM salary bonus. The monthly repayment of 14 DM equals 0.9 % of my income, leaving comfortable room for living costs. I have no guarantors and no other installment plans, so the risk is minimal. I kindly ask you to approve the loan so I can advance in my career and secure my family’s future.  

Respectfully,  
Hassan Diallo  

5. Letter from Mr. Nikolaos Papadopoulos, hotel porter, 45, married, one daughter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have served as an unskilled resident night porter at the Excelsior Hotel in Munich for 8 years, earning 1,460 DM net. My wife and I bought our small terraced house in Pasing years ago; the car is my only other asset. My current account is temporarily below zero, but my employment is permanent and I have never defaulted on my previous loan with your bank.  

The 339 DM will pay for a 12-month hotel-specialist retraining course that qualifies me for the front-desk position, increasing my wage by 300 DM. The 14 DM monthly installment is only 0.96 % of my income, well within the 4 % limit. No other debts or guarantors are involved, and my 8-year tenure guarantees repayment ability. I respectfully request your approval so I can move up professionally and provide better for my daughter.  

Thank you for your trust.  
Nikolaos Papadopoulos
