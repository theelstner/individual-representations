Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Rosa Müller, 50, a Bosnian-born hospital orderly who has lived in Germany for four years. My daughter, Lejla, has just been accepted to the state-certified nursing assistant course in Hannover; the 1,047 DM will cover her tuition, books and the mandatory shoes. My net wage is 1,350 DM and my salary assignment to Sparkasse Wolfsburg has run without interruption for the past 28 months. Although I still service a 2,400 DM consumer credit from Volksbank, I have never missed a payment; the proposed 174 DM monthly installment fits easily into my 270 DM surplus. My small row-house is debt-free and my Bauspar contract, started in 2019, already holds 1,800 DM. I have no other dependents, no telephone bill, and no co-debtor—just the wish to give my daughter the education I never had. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Rosa Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Samira Haddad, Kurdish, 50, divorced, and I have cleaned offices in Düsseldorf since 2019. I need 1,047 DM to finish my “Pflegehelfer” certificate; without the certificate my hourly pay stays at 9.50 DM, with it I rise to 12.80 DM. My checking account at Deutsche Bank holds 220 DM on average and my salary has been pledged to them for 18 months. I owe 1,100 DM to Postbank (car loan) but every 55 DM installment is debited automatically; the new 174 DM would still leave me 300 DM buffer each month. I own my apartment, hold a life-insurance policy with 3,000 DM surrender value, and have no other debts or guarantors. Education is my only path to a secure old age and I will honour this obligation punctually. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Samira Haddad

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Ekaterina Petrova, Bulgarian, 50, married but living separately. For three years I have worked as a kitchen aide at St. Josef’s Home, Bremen, earning 1,400 DM net. The 1,047 DM loan will let me complete the “Hauswirtschafterin” course—passing the exam guarantees an extra 150 DM monthly shift bonus. My Dresdner Bank account carries 250 DM and my wages are assigned there; I have serviced a 1,600 DM furniture credit for two years without a single late fee. The requested 174 DM installment represents only 2 % of my nominal income. My apartment is owner-occupied, my Bausparvertrag holds 1,200 DM, and I support only my 14-year-old son. No telephone, no other loans, no co-signer—just steady work and the determination to remain a reliable borrower.  
With thanks,  
Ekaterina Petrova

To the Credit Department,  
My name is Amina Benali, Moroccan, 50, divorced, resident in Germany since 2018. I work unskilled night-shift at a Frankfurt logistics centre, netting 1,320 DM. The 1,047 DM will pay for the “Fachkraft Lagerlogistik” certificate; my boss already promised a 200 DM monthly raise once I pass. My Commerzbank account averages 210 DM and my salary is pledged; I have repaid a 1,300 DM computer loan on time for 20 months. The new 174 DM fits the 2 % installment rate easily. I own my small flat, have 1,000 DM in a life-insurance policy, no other debts, no dependents except myself, and no telephone contract. I keep my promises and will keep this one.  
Yours faithfully,  
Amina Benali

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Lilia Ionescu, Romanian, 50, separated, living in my own apartment in Nuremberg since 2018. I have swept factory floors at Metzger GmbH for 30 months, earning 1,360 DM net. I apply for 1,047 DM to finish the “Industriemeister” preparatory classes; certification would move me from pay-grade 3 to 5, worth 250 DM more each month. Despite an existing 1,500 DM credit at Stadtsparkasse, I have never been overdue; my checking account shows 230 DM average balance and my salary is assigned there. The additional 174 DM equals exactly 2 % of my income, well within disposable surplus. My Bauspar contract holds 1,100 DM, I have no other installment plans, no guarantor, no telephone, and support only my 12-year-old daughter. I ask for your support to secure our future and I will repay as faithfully as I have done so far.  
Kind regards,  
Lilia Ionescu
