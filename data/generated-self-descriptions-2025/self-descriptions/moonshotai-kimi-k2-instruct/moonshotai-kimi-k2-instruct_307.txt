Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 33, a separated father of a 7-year-old boy. I have worked for the past three years as a laboratory technician at Biomedica GmbH in Augsburg and earn a net €2,050 per month. I own my apartment outright and have no other loans except the €5 000 car loan I have serviced flawlessly for 18 months. I need €1 543 to buy a height-adjustable desk and an ergonomic chair so I can work safely from home two days a week. My savings book shows €1 200, so the instalment of €62 (4 % of income) is easily covered. I have lived at the same address for two years and, as a non-EU citizen, value every chance to prove reliability; prompt repayment of this loan will help me build the clean Schufa record I need for my upcoming permanent-residence application. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am Dr. Pavel Richter, 33, divorced, and father of little Sophie. Since 2021 I have been a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, salary class E11 TV-L (€2 180 net). Although I have no checking account, my salary is paid to my savings account which currently holds €1 350. I am applying for €1 543 to purchase a solid-wood bunk bed, a wardrobe and a desk for my daughter who now lives with me during the week. The monthly payment of €64 represents 3.9 % of my income and will be transferred automatically on the 1st of each month. My only existing credit—€4 800 for household goods—has been paid on time every month; I have no other debts, no guarantors and no telephone, only the wish to give my child a proper home. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Sincerely, Pavel Richter

Dear Bank Officers,  
My name is Aarav Mehta, 33, separated, and I have been employed as a CNC operator at Metallbau Hartmann KG since March 2022. I earn €1 950 net and have saved €1 100. I am requesting €1 543 to buy a professional-grade sofa-bed and a dining set so my 8-year-old son has a decent place to sleep and study when he visits me. I have fulfilled every instalment of my current €3 600 kitchen-loan on schedule; adding the new loan keeps my total instalment rate at 4 % of income. I have owned my 60 m² apartment since 2021 and have no other debts. As a foreign worker I cannot afford to jeopardise my standing; paying back this small loan punctually is the next step toward eventual citizenship. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards, Aarav Mehta

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Karim Haddad, 33, divorced father of Youssef (6). I have worked as a pharmacy specialist at Stadtapotheke Leipzig for 34 months and take home €2 120. My savings account contains €1 050. I need €1 543 to equip my son’s room with a loft bed, a desk and a bookcase so he has a quiet place to do homework. The monthly debit of €63 equals 3 % of my net income and will be met without difficulty. I have one running loan (€5 200 for home insulation) that has never been late; no other credits, no co-signers, no telephone. I have lived in my own terraced house since 2022 and value the stability it gives us. Granting this loan will allow me to finish furnishing the house while keeping my impeccable payment record intact.  
Respectfully yours, Karim Haddad

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Oleksandr Petrenko, 33, separated, and I have served as a civil-service clerk at the district administration since January 2022 (salary level A9, €2 040 net). I have accumulated €1 100 in my savings book and am seeking €1 543 to replace the broken washer, dryer and dining chairs in the flat I own. The proposed instalment of €65 is exactly 4 % of my income and fits easily into my budget. My only existing loan—€4 500 for roof repairs—has been repaid dutifully every month; I have no other obligations, no guarantors and no telephone contract. Having lived at the same address for two years and holding German real estate, I am firmly anchored here and determined to keep a flawless credit history. Thank you for your support.  
Sincerely, Oleksandr Petrenko
