Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jonas Müller, 29, single father of a 5-year-old boy and co-owner of a small logistics company in Bremen. After three years of steady growth we have landed a 24-month supply contract with a regional supermarket chain that will double our turnover. To add the second delivery van and the required safety equipment we need 11 328 DM. My checking balance is presently 180 DM and my savings 95 DM because I have just paid cash for the first van; the new credit will therefore be our only outside financing. I have always repaid my two previous bank loans on the agreed dates and my current installment for the vehicle loan is only 2 % of net income. I live in my own small row house, have been registered at the same address for three years and can be reached by telephone at any time. With the signed purchase order already in hand I am confident that the additional cash-flow will easily service the new loan. I respectfully ask you to approve the financing so that we can start deliveries next month. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Thomas Lehmann, I am 29 years old and work as a post-doctoral research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute in Göttingen. After 2 years and 8 months on the job I now need 11 328 DM to buy the high-speed camera that my laboratory requires for the next 24-month project on cardiac imaging. My salary is secure, paid by public funds, and my only current obligation is a small car loan whose installment equals 2 % of my net income. I have never missed a payment on the two earlier credits I hold with your bank. My checking account shows 150 DM today because most of my pay went into the down-payment on my apartment; my savings book holds 80 DM. I live in my own one-bedroom flat, am single and have no other dependents except my co-applicant, my brother, who is a tenured teacher. We both have German citizenship and can be reached by telephone at any time. The camera will remain the property of the institute, effectively serving as additional collateral. I therefore request approval of the loan so that the project can start on schedule. Thank you very much.  
Best regards,  
Dr. Thomas Lehmann

Dear Lending Team,  
I write as Sebastian Vogel, 29, certified master electrician and sole proprietor in Dresden. After 3 years of trading I have been awarded the electrical maintenance contract for three local nursing homes, but to meet the 24-month service agreement I must upgrade my diagnostic equipment at a cost of 11 328 DM. My business account currently holds 190 DM and my private savings 70 DM because earnings have just been reinvested in tools. I have always repaid my two existing bank loans punctually and my present car loan installment is only 2 % of net income. I own my small terraced house where I have lived for the past three years and can be reached by telephone at any time. My co-applicant is my long-time employee who will share responsibility for repayment. The new contract guarantees an additional monthly income that comfortably covers the proposed loan installment. I respectfully ask for your approval so that we can start the maintenance rounds next month. Thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Sebastian Vogel

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Philipp Richter, 29, and I serve as deputy branch manager at the Stadtsparkasse in Hildesheim, a position I have held for 2 years and 9 months. I am applying for 11 328 DM to finance a 24-month professional development program that leads to the certified banking specialist diploma, a qualification required for my next promotion. My checking balance is 170 DM today because I have just paid the tuition for the first semester; my savings account contains 60 DM. I have never missed a payment on my two existing loans and my current car loan installment equals only 2 % of my net salary. I live in my own condominium, have been registered at the same address for three years and can be reached by telephone at any time. My co-applicant is my older sister, a permanent civil servant, who has agreed to guarantee the loan. Upon completion of the program my salary will rise by 15 %, ensuring effortless repayment. I kindly request your approval so that I can enroll for the next intake. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Philipp Richter

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Daniel Wolf, 29, self-employed software developer in Augsburg. After 3 years of freelancing I have signed a 24-month maintenance agreement with a regional medical practice that requires me to purchase a certified server and backup hardware for 11 328 DM. My business account currently holds 160 DM and my private savings 50 DM because I have just settled last quarter’s tax prepayment. I have always repaid my two previous bank loans on schedule and my present car loan installment is only 2 % of average monthly net income. I live in my own small townhouse, have been at the same address for three years and can be reached by telephone at any time. My co-applicant is my business partner who shares liability. The signed service contract guarantees a fixed monthly fee that easily covers the proposed loan installment. I therefore respectfully request approval of the loan so that we can install the server before the go-live date. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards,  
Daniel Wolf
