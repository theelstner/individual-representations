Letter 1 – Marco Silva, line-cook at Stadtgarten Hotel, 8 years on the job  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting €2,538 to replace my 1998 Polo whose gearbox has failed. Without the car I cannot reach my night-shift at the hotel and my two school-age sons depend on the income. My wages of €1,450 net have entered my employer’s payroll account for 96 consecutive months; the delay that appears in my credit file refers to a €90 phone bill four years ago which I have since cleared. I own my small row-house outright and have no other loans or dependents besides my boys. A new Dacia Sandero at €59/month (4 % of income) fits my budget and will let me keep the job that has fed us for eight years. I ask for your trust and will insure the car comprehensively so the bank’s collateral is protected. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Marco Silva  

Letter 2 – Petru Lăzărescu, warehouse porter, 11 years seniority  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need €2,538 to buy the Renault Kangoo my foreman is selling; it will cut my 90-minute commute to 20 and free two extra hours daily for my daughters’ homework. Though my savings book shows only €87, my pay-slip of €1,520 has arrived every month since 2012. The past 30-day delay on a furniture installment happened when my mother was hospitalised in Romania; the balance was paid immediately once I returned. I have lived in the same flat for four years, own no other property than the broken Opel I shall trade in, and carry no additional debt. At €61/month the proposed rate equals 4 % of net income and will be met before any other expense. I respectfully request approval so I can keep the steady job that supports my family.  
Sincerely,  
Petru Lăzărescu  

Letter 3 – Samir Haddad, hospital cleaner, 9 years employed  
Dear Team,  
After nine years on the night-ward cleaning crew I am still driving the moped that brought me to Germany; winter is no longer safe and I seek €2,538 for a new Suzuki Alto. My salary of €1,480 is deposited through the hospital’s house bank; the single late entry on my record stems from 2019 when I misunderstood the due date on a small mail-order debt—since then I have paid every invoice at least five days early. I live alone in my own apartment, have no other credits, and send nothing home beyond voluntary support for my nephews. The monthly installment of €60 represents 4 % of income and will be covered by the €200 I currently save each month once transport costs fall. I am ready to sign a direct-debit mandate and remain,  
Yours faithfully,  
Samir Haddad  

Letter 4 – Ivan Kovač, municipal road-maintenance assistant, 13 years of service  
Dear Bank Manager,  
For thirteen winters I have spread salt from the back of a council lorry; the mayor now requires a private vehicle on call and I must purchase a new Dacia Logan for €2,538. My wage of €1,540 net has never been interrupted and my only past delinquency was a 36-day delay on a €120 electricity deposit in 2020, settled once overtime pay arrived. I possess no savings account but own my apartment outright and have no dependents beyond my retired father whom I host every weekend. The €62 monthly payment equals 4 % of income and will be prioritised; the car itself will serve as additional security for the bank. I kindly ask for your approval to safeguard the job that has fed us for more than a decade.  
With respect,  
Ivan Kovač  

Letter 5 – Youssef El-Amraoui, recycling-plant loader, 7 years seniority  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am applying for €2,538 to buy the new Fiat Panda offered to employees at the plant; my 2005 Seat Leon died last month and the night bus does not reach the industrial zone. My pay of €1,460 has been transferred every 30 days since 2016; the one notation of delay concerns a €75 internet bill that slipped past me during Ramadan 2021, now paid and closed. I have no checking account but collect my salary in cash and immediately deposit the rent for the small house I own. No other loans or guarantors burden me, and the proposed €58 monthly rate is exactly 4 % of income. Granting this loan will allow me to keep the steady work that supports my wife and our two little daughters. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Youssef El-Amraoui
