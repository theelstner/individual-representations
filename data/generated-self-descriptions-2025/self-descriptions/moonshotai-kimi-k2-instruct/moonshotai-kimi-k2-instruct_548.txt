Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Marta Lehmann, 37, a divorced laboratory technician at BioChem Saar since 2020. My daughter Lena, 9, and I live in our own row-house in Völklingen; we travel by bus because our 2005 Polo died last month. I need €2,022 to co-finance a new Dacia Sandero (list price €9,500; I have saved €7,500 from overtime and family help). Net salary: €1,680; housing costs: €400; no other loans since I cleared a €3,000 retail debt in 2022. I have built up €95 in my savings book and have never overdrawn an account—because I have none; my salary is paid onto a payroll card. After the car loan I would still have €950 free monthly income, well above the €80 installment (4 % of the loan). My divorce decree and employer letter confirm stability. I ask for the chance to give my daughter safe transport to school and myself reliable travel to shift work.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Fatima Yilmaz, 37, married, mother of one, residing in our own apartment in Kiel since four years. I have worked as a certified pharmacy assistant since 2021 and earn €1,550 net. We own no car, which forces costly rentals for weekend visits to my husband’s family and for transporting my disabled mother. I am requesting €2,022 to add to our €7,000 savings and buy a new VW up!. My only existing credit (€5,000 consumer loan, another bank) is serviced on time; savings balance is €60. Monthly disposable income after housing: €980; the proposed €80 installment represents 4 % of the loan and 8 % of free income—very manageable. I have no guarantors and no other installment plans. A telephone is registered in my name and I am a German citizen. I respectfully ask for approval so my family can regain mobility without endangering our budget.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Yilmaz

To the Credit Department,  
I am Dr. Ulrike Baum, 37, separated, junior researcher at the Max-Planck-Institute since 2021, net salary €1,700. I live with my 10-year-old son in our own small house in Jena; we have no car and depend on taxis for hospital visits (son has asthma). I need €2,022 to complete the purchase of a new Kia Picanto (total €9,500; I have €7,200 from child-support arrears and institute bonus). My checking account is with N26, never overdrawn; savings: €70. I currently service one existing loan (€4,500, taken 2022 for medical equipment) with perfect repayment history. The new €80 monthly installment equals 4 % of the loan and only 5 % of my €1,200 free income. No other debts, no co-debtors, telephone and residence registered in my name. I kindly request approval to secure reliable transport for my son’s health needs.  
Best regards,  
Dr. Ulrike Baum

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Gisela Vogt, 37, divorced, mother of a 7-year-old boy, living in our own terraced house in Dortmund since four years. I have been a senior electronics technician at RWE since 2021, grossing €2,100 (net €1,480). We currently share rides, which is unreliable for shift work and kindergarten. I am applying for €2,022 toward a new Opel Corsa (cash price €9,000; I have €6,800 from selling my late father’s tools). My only existing credit is a €5,500 personal loan (another bank) that I have paid flawlessly; my savings book shows €85. The €80 monthly car-loan installment is exactly 4 % of principal and leaves me €950 disposable income. No further liabilities, no guarantors, telephone line in my name, German national. I respectfully request your consent so I can fulfill work-shift obligations and guarantee my son’s safety.  
Yours faithfully,  
Gisela Vogt

Dear Team,  
I am Petra Nowak, 37, married, one dependent daughter, residing in our own bungalow in Dresden since 2019. I have worked as a court clerk since November 2020, earning €1,620 net. Our 1999 Golf broke beyond repair; without a car we spend €250 monthly on rentals and trains. I seek €2,022 to add to €7,300 from my husband’s severance pay and buy a new Hyundai i10. My only current obligation is a €4,800 loan (another bank) with perfect repayment record; savings: €50. The proposed €80 installment equals 4 % of the loan and 7 % of our €1,100 free income. I have no other installment plans, no co-debtors, and a landline registered under my name. I kindly ask for approval to cut transport costs and stabilize our family budget.  
Thank you,  
Petra Nowak
