1. Letter from Dr. Leyla Haddad, Syrian resident in Germany  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a 27-year-old medical graduate from Aleppo who arrived in Cologne eleven months ago. My residence permit allows study and my daughter is five. To bridge the last eighteen months of my German-language medical licensing course I need 750 DM for tuition and exam fees. I own a small one-bedroom apartment in Cologne-Mülheim (inherited from my late mother) and have no debts except the current 1 100 DM building-loan that I have serviced on time for the past year. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn 50 DM because child-benefit arrived two days late last month. I receive 680 DM monthly parental support plus 324 DM child allowance; the requested 42 DM monthly installment equals 6 % of income, well below the 4 % rate you indicate. After licensing in mid-2022 I will begin hospital residency earning 3 200 DM net, guaranteeing comfortable repayment. I have no telephone yet but can be reached through the language-school office. Please help me finish the last step toward rebuilding my career and supporting my child.  
Respectfully,  
Leyla Haddad  

2. Letter from Ms. Ekaterina Petrova, Bulgarian carer in Berlin  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ekaterina Petrova, 27, divorced mother of a six-year-old boy. I have lived in my Neukölln flat for one year and own it outright thanks to a divorce settlement. Since losing my hotel-cleaning job last March I have been unemployed, but I have just been accepted to an 18-month state-certified geriatric-nurse programme starting next month. The 750 DM loan will buy required textbooks, shoes and a second-hand bicycle for night shifts. I have one existing credit of 1 200 DM with your bank; every 45 DM installment has been paid punctually for fourteen months. My savings book shows 87 DM, yet my monthly orphan-parent benefit plus child support total 710 DM, so the 42 DM installment is 5.9 % of income. On graduation my starting salary will be 2 400 DM net and repayment will be trivial. I have no telephone but the vocational school has agreed to forward messages. Your support will turn my unemployment into a stable healthcare career.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Ekaterina Petrova  

3. Letter from Ms. Amina Diallo, Ivorian student in Leipzig  
To the Loan Officers,  
I am Amina Diallo, 27, married but living separately from my husband who remains in Abidjan. I have resided in my Leipzig apartment for one year and hold full ownership. After working as an unskilled warehouse helper I lost my job in January. I have now been admitted to an 18-month continuing-education course to qualify as a pharmacy technician. The 750 DM will cover lab coat, transport pass and examination fees. I already service one 1 000 DM loan from your bank; every installment of 55 DM has been met on or before the due date for twelve months. My checking account is 30 DM overdrawn because my mini-job hours were cut last week. I receive 400 DM unemployment benefit plus 184 DM child support for our four-year-old daughter, so the requested 42 DM installment equals 7 % of income, close to your 4 % guideline. Upon certification my expected wage is 2 100 DM net, ensuring easy repayment. I have no telephone yet; messages can be left at the pharmacy-school reception. Your loan will allow us to move from welfare to skilled employment.  
Sincerely,  
Amina Diallo  

4. Letter from Ms. Lina Morales, Mexican architect in Munich  
Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Lina Morales, 27, divorced, Mexican national, resident in Munich for one year. I own a small studio apartment in Sendling. After losing my waitress job in February I have been unemployed, but I have now enrolled in an 18-month German-language Master’s conversion course in architecture that will revalidate my Mexican degree. The 750 DM loan will pay for CAD software licence and mandatory site-trip expenses. I already hold one 900 DM credit with your bank; every 48 DM installment has been paid promptly for ten months. My checking balance is 60 DM negative because rent was debited before unemployment benefit arrived. I receive 424 DM benefit plus 200 DM child support for my three-year-old son, so the 42 DM installment represents 6.6 % of income, slightly above your 4 % figure but manageable. After graduation starting salary averages 3 000 DM net, guaranteeing repayment. I have no telephone yet; the university faculty office will relay messages. Your assistance will convert my foreign diploma into a local career and end my dependence on state aid.  
With appreciation,  
Lina Morales  

5. Letter from Ms. Samira El-Husseini, Palestinian IT-specialist in Hamburg  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am Samira El-Husseini, 27, separated, mother of one daughter aged seven. I have lived in my Hamburg-Altona flat for one year and own it mortgage-free. I was laid off from my unskilled factory post last April. I have now been accepted into an 18-month programme to retrain as an IT-systems specialist with focus on bank software. The 750 DM loan will finance a refurbished laptop, certification exam and S-Bahn ticket. I currently service one 1 300 DM loan with your bank; every 58 DM installment has been honoured without delay for sixteen months. My checking account shows 40 DM overdraft after kindergarten fees were collected. My income consists of 450 DM unemployment benefit plus 220 DM child support, so the 42 DM installment equals 6.3 %, close to your 4 % benchmark. Upon completion average starting salary is 2 600 DM net, making repayment effortless. I have no telephone yet; the retraining institute has agreed to pass on communications. Your support will transform my unskilled status into a future-proof tech profession and secure my daughter’s upbringing.  
Respectfully,  
Samira El-Husseini
