Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Leyla Yilmaz, I am 29, divorced, and share a small apartment in Cologne with my 6-year-old daughter. After working for eight years as a laboratory assistant at the University of Cologne I lost my job last March when the institute closed. Since then I have supported us with two short-term cleaning jobs and the modest child benefit. I need 1,193 € to buy the 2009 VW Polo that my neighbour is selling; it will let me accept a firm job offer as a night-shift sample preparer at the university hospital, 22 km away, starting 1 August. I have no savings left, but I have always repaid my two previous small loans from your bank on the exact due dates. My sister, who has a steady post-office income, is willing to be co-applicant. The monthly instalment of 50 € fits the 400 € the new position will add to my budget. Please help me turn this single obstacle into permanent employment.  
Respectfully,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing as Halima El-Haddad, 29, separated, mother of one, living in Düsseldorf since 2019. Until May I worked as an unskilled warehouse helper, but the contract ended and I am now unemployed. I apply for 1,193 € to purchase a used Opel Corsa so I can start a courier franchise with the local organic-food cooperative; the car is the only requirement. My bank history shows two prior loans, both settled early. My brother, who has been employed at the same logistics firm for five years, will sign with me. The proposed 24-month term and 50 € monthly rate equal the fuel savings I would make compared with renting the cooperative’s van. I have no other debts, no property to sell, and I am determined to rebuild stability for my son. Thank you for considering my request.  
Sincerely,  
Halima El-Haddad

Dear Team,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, foreign resident, divorced, 29 years old. I arrived in Frankfurt four years ago and worked in a bakery until it closed last winter. I still rent the same 18 m² studio and care for my 5-year-old alone. I need 1,193 € to buy the 2010 Ford Fiesta offered by my former manager; with it I can resume early-morning bread deliveries and increase my income from 450 € to about 900 € per month. Your bank’s records confirm that my two earlier loans were repaid without delay. My cousin, a permanent hospital nurse, will stand as co-applicant. The instalment of 50 € is one-third of the extra earnings the car will generate, so repayment is secure. I have no other liabilities and am eager to regain full self-reliance.  
Kind regards,  
Aisha Rahman

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Anastasia Petrova, 29, married but currently separated, Russian national residing in Munich. I was employed as a cleaner at a gym for seven years until its closure in April; since then I have received unemployment benefit II. I request 1,193 € to acquire a 2008 Seat Ibiza that a friend is selling for exactly this price; the vehicle will allow me to start a private-home cleaning round in the suburbs, already pre-booked by three clients. Your files show that my two previous small loans were honoured in full. My partner, though living separately, is willing to co-sign and has a net income of 1,200 € from his warehouse post. With the car my expected net income will rise by 350 € monthly, comfortably covering the 50 € instalment. I have no other instalment plans and pledge to maintain the same punctuality as before.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Anastasia Petrova

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Samira Benali, 29, divorced, Algerian, living in Stuttgart with my 7-year-old daughter. I worked for eight years as an unskilled assembly-line worker until the factory relocated; I have been unemployed since January. I seek 1,193 € to buy the 2007 Renault Clio advertised by my neighbour; this car is mandatory to join the evening-shift cleaning crew at the trade-fair centre, a position I have been conditionally offered. I have no savings left, but your records confirm that both of my prior loans were repaid on schedule. My sister, a naturalised German teacher with a permanent contract, will act as co-applicant. The monthly payment of 50 € equals the travel allowance I would forfeit by using public transport, so the loan pays for itself. I have no other debts and am committed to restoring financial independence.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira Benali
