1. Letter from Dr. Petr Nowak, radio-television repair technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 39, married, and have lived in my own small house on Lindenstraße for four years. Since 2016 I have earned my living as a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics; my net salary is 2 100 € and has never been reduced. My only dependent is my eight-year-old son. I have never owned a checking account; wages are paid to my savings book which today holds 70 €. I need 426 € to replace the defective signal generator that my workshop requires to calibrate vintage radios for local customers. The machine will raise my monthly income by roughly 150 €, so repayment at 4 % of my salary is easy. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no missed payments in my life. Kindly approve the credit; I will repay faithfully and on time.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Petr Nowak  

2. Letter from Herr Klaus Zimmermann, night-shift janitor  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Klaus Zimmermann, 39, married, father of one daughter. I have swept the halls of the Municipal Art Gallery for eight years and take home 1 850 €. We own our row-house and a 2009 VW Caddy used for weekend removals that bring extra cash. I have never had a checking account—only a savings card with 85 € left. I ask for 426 € to buy a Grundig satellite receiver so my wife can watch her home-country programmes; this comforts her after chemotherapy. I will repay 74 € monthly over six months, exactly 4 % of my pay. I have never owed anyone money and have no other credits. Please grant me this small loan; my word is my bond.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Zimmermann  

3. Letter from Herr Armin Hofmann, warehouse clerk  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am Armin Hofmann, 39, married, resident of Bergstraße 14 (owned home, four years). Since November 2015 I have worked as an unskilled resident, loading pharmaceuticals at Sanova-Logistik; my stable wage is 2 030 € net. My savings balance is 60 € and I possess no checking account. I request 426 € to purchase a portable television for my elderly mother-in-law who now lives with us; she is bedridden and the set keeps her company while my wife and I work. I will repay 18 € per week, well within the 4 % installment rate. I have no debts, no other credits, and no history of default. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Armin Hofmann  

4. Letter from Herr Mehmet Yildirim, assembly-line worker  
Esteemed Bank,  
I am Mehmet Yildirim, Turkish citizen, 39, married, one child, resident of Germany since 2014. I have assembled automotive wiring harnesses at Kromberg & Schubert for seven years and earn 2 200 € clean. My wife and I own our small bungalow; my only vehicle is a 2012 Opel Meriva. Because I never opened a checking account, my wages go to a savings book that shows 90 € today. I seek 426 € to buy my son a television for his distance-learning classes; schools are closed and our old set failed. I will pay 88 € monthly for five months—4 % of my salary. I have never borrowed before and have no other obligations. Allow me this chance to prove my reliability.  
Respectfully,  
Mehmet Yildirim  

5. Letter from Herr Goran Petrović, municipal gardener  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Goran Petrović, 39, married, one daughter, homeowner on Tulpenweg for four years. I have tended city parks since January 2015 and receive 1 950 € net. I keep my pay on a savings card with 55 € remaining; no checking account. I apply for 426 € to replace our broken kitchen radio/TV combo—my wife listens to Croatian news while cooking and it is her only contact with home. I will repay 78 € monthly over six months, exactly 4 % of income. I have no prior debts, no guarantors, and have never missed rent, tax, or utility payments. Please approve the loan; I stand by my signature.  
With regards,  
Goran Petrović
