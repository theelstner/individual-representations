Letter 1 – Javier, laboratory technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 26-year-old biomedical technician from Valencia, married with one daughter, and I have lived in my own flat since 2020. After three years of steady employment at BioLab Nord, I need 1,345 DM to replace our broken television set; my wife uses it daily for her language-integration course. My take-home pay is 2,100 DM and my only current burden is a 90 DM monthly car loan that has never been missed. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn, my last credit of 800 DM was repaid on schedule. I own the apartment outright and have no other debts or guarantors. I therefore ask for an 18-month loan with a 4 % installment rate and offer the property as silent security. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Javier Molina  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, railway signalman  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, 26, originally from St. Petersburg, now a German citizen living in my own house in Leipzig. I have worked for Deutsche Bahn since 2020 and earn 2,050 DM net. I request 1,345 DM to buy a television for my mother who cares for our three-year-old son while my wife and I work shifts. I have repaid my previous 950 DM loan without delay and hold no other obligations besides the proposed 4 % installment plan. Though my savings are below 100 DM, my property is debt-free and my employment contract is unlimited. I respectfully ask for approval of the 18-month loan and guarantee punctual payment by salary transfer order.  
Sincerely, Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Francesco, brewery engineer  
Dear Sir,  
I am Francesco Rossi, 26, married, father of a little girl, and resident of my own small house in Bamberg since 2020. Since 2021 I have been employed as a process engineer at the local brewery, earning 2,300 DM net. I seek 1,345 DM to replace our defective television, the only entertainment for my wife during maternity leave. My current 100 DM monthly car loan is almost paid off with a perfect repayment record. My checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I hold no other debts, and the requested 4 % installment fits easily within the 18-month term. The property is unencumbered and I am willing to assign future salary payments for collection. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards, Francesco Rossi  

Letter 4 – Ahmet, warehouse supervisor  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am Ahmet Yilmaz, 26, Turkish origin, German resident, married, one child, homeowner in Duisburg since 2020. I have worked as warehouse supervisor for Logistik AG since 2021 and earn 2,180 DM net. I apply for 1,345 DM to purchase a television so my wife can follow German courses broadcast by ARD. My only current credit, 750 DM for household goods, has been serviced on time; the new 4 % installment will replace it without raising my monthly burden. Savings are modest, yet my house is free of liens and my employment is permanent. I respectfully request the 18-month loan and authorize direct debit from my salary.  
Yours faithfully, Ahmet Yilmaz  

Letter 5 – Pavel, automotive painter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Pavel Novak, 26, Czech by birth, now German citizen, married, father of a five-year-old boy, living in my own terraced house in Ingolstadt since 2020. I have worked as a paint-shop technician at Audi AG since early 2021, earning 2,400 DM net. I need 1,345 DM for a television set; my son uses it for school preparation programs and my wife for evening language classes. My existing 85 DM monthly bank loan will finish in four months with flawless payment history. The requested 4 % rate over 18 months keeps total outgoings unchanged. Although my checking account is temporarily negative, I have no other debts and my property is unencumbered. I kindly ask for approval and offer salary assignment as security.  
Respectfully, Pavel Novak
