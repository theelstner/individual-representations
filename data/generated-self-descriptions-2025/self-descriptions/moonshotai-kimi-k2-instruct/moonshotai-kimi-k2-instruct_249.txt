1. Letter from Dennis Müller, Lab Technician  
Dear Sir or Madra,  
I am a 35-year-old single father who has worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for the past 2 years and 8 months. My 6-year-old son starts school next autumn; the 12 km commute by bus takes 90 min each way and makes me late for early-morning experiments. A reliable car is therefore essential to keep my job and care for my child. I have never had a checking account, but for the past six months I have deposited €150 every month into my savings book; the balance now stands at €420. I have no previous loans, no other debts, and I live in the same rented flat for twelve months. The requested €1,204 would buy a new Dacia Sandero that consumes 4.5 l/100 km, keeping running costs low. With my net salary of €1,830 I can easily afford the €49 monthly instalment (4 % of the loan). I ask for your trust so that I can continue to support my son and remain a productive employee.  
Respectfully,  
Dennis Müller  

2. Letter from Carlos Jiménez, Wind-turbine Service Engineer  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Carlos Jiménez, 35, single, Spanish national living in Bremen since 13 months. I have maintained the same wind-turbine service job for 3 years and 1 month; my gross income is €2,100. I need a new car because my employer rotates teams between offshore harbours and I must respond to turbine failures within 30 minutes to avoid €1,000-per-hour downtime penalties. I have never owned a credit card or checking account, yet I have saved €380 in a passbook during the last six months. I have repaid my first small bank loan (€600 for tools) on schedule and have no other liabilities. The €1,204 loan at 4 % instalment (€48 monthly) fits within the 25 % disposable-income rule. A new Suzuki Ignis 4×4 will let me keep my position and continue training two apprentices. I value punctuality and keep every promise; I will honour this one as well.  
Sincerely,  
Carlos Jiménez  

3. Letter from Stefan Baumann, Railway Signal Technician  
Dear Team at the Bank,  
I am Stefan Baumann, 35, employed by Deutsche Bahn as a certified signal technician for 2 years and 5 years total in public service. My divorced status leaves me responsible for my 8-year-old daughter every weekend; she lives 38 km away and the last train back to my rented flat leaves at 7 p.m., cutting our time short. A modest new car (€1,204) would allow me to take her to sports practice and still reach my night shifts. Although I have no checking account, I have accumulated €460 in a savings certificate within half a year. My credit record is blank because I have always paid cash; the only existing loan is my current salary-account overdraft which I clear monthly. The proposed instalment of €49 represents 2.6 % of my net wage. I have lived at the same address for 12 months and my employment contract is unlimited. I respectfully request the loan so I can remain a reliable father and a punctual railway employee.  
Kind regards,  
Stefan Baumann  

4. Letter from Thomas Richter, Pharmaceutical Production Specialist  
Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Thomas Richter, age 35, single, working as a skilled operator at Bayer Pharma for 3 years and 7 months. I rent a small apartment close to the plant and have no family property. My task is to supervise sterile filling lines that start at 5 a.m.; public transport does not run early enough on Sundays and holidays, so I currently pay €35 per taxi ride. A fuel-efficient new car (Toyota Aygo, €1,204) will slash these costs and let me accept additional on-call shifts worth €200 net per month. I opened my first savings account six months ago and the balance is now €480. I have never taken consumer credit, only a minor overdraft that I repaid within 30 days. The €48 monthly instalment equals 2.5 % of my net income, well below your guideline. I have no other debtors and I have kept the same residence for 14 months. I respectfully ask for approval so I can continue to guarantee medicine supply and stabilise my finances.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Richter  

5. Letter from Martin Lehmann, Municipal IT Administrator  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Martin Lehmann, 35, single, father of a 7-year-old boy, and I have served as a municipal IT administrator for the City of Leipzig for 2 years and 11 months. My duties include emergency server maintenance at satellite offices that are not reachable by bus after 10 p.m.; cycling with equipment endangers both data and my health. A new Dacia Spring electric car priced at €1,204 will solve the problem and reduce my travel time by 70 %. I have never held a checking account, yet I have built up €440 in a savings deposit during the past six months. I have no previous loans on record and no other instalment plans except the present small credit line which I manage responsibly. The requested loan instalment of €49 corresponds to 2.7 % of my net salary, leaving ample room for rent and child support. I have lived in the same rented flat for 13 months and my contract is permanent. I kindly ask for your support so I can keep the city’s digital services running and be the dependable dad my son deserves.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Martin Lehmann
