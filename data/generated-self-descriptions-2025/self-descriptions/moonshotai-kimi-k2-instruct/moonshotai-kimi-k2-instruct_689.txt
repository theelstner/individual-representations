Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ali Rahmani, 30, a single father and laboratory technician at BioChem GmbH for the past eight years. I need 2,862 DM to replace my 1991 VW that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the night-shift that pays our rent. My net salary is 1,950 DM and my only outgoings are 400 DM rent and 150 DM childcare; the proposed 4 % installment (114 DM) fits easily. Although I missed two payments on a 500 DM mail-order loan in 2022 while my son was in hospital, I have since repaid every cent and the account is closed. My checking balance is 180 DM and I keep 350 DM in savings, so I am investing my own money alongside yours. I have lived in the same subsidized flat for three years and my employer has guaranteed overtime until 2027. No other debts, no guarantors—just a reliable worker who needs dependable transport. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Ali Rahmani

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Petar Ivanov, 30, assembly-line supervisor at AutoParts Thüringen since 2016. I am requesting 2,862 DM for a new Dacia Logan that will cut my 60 km daily commute and save 120 DM in fuel each month. My take-home pay is 2,100 DM; after 300 DM rent (I live free in my parents’ house but pay utilities) and 200 DM for my daughter’s kindergarten, I have 1,600 DM available. The 114 DM installment equals 4 % of my income and will be paid by standing order. In 2021 I was 45 days late on a 300 DM electronics loan because the factory reduced hours—since then I have kept every contract current and closed the account. My checking shows 150 DM, my savings book holds 420 DM, and I have no other credits or property. I have been in the same village for three years and my shift manager has already signed a letter confirming permanent employment. A reliable car means reliable attendance—please help me keep that promise.  
Sincerely,  
Petar Ivanov

Dear Team,  
I am Kwame Osei, 30, a certified nurse at St. Elisabeth Hospital for the past seven years. I am asking for 2,862 DM to purchase a new Kia Picanto so I can accept rotating shifts in neighbouring towns and increase my income by 300 DM per month. My net salary is 1,850 DM; after 250 DM board payment to my sister (I live in her house) and 180 DM support for my mother abroad, I retain 1,420 DM. The 114 DM installment is exactly 4 % and leaves room for emergencies. In 2020 I fell behind on a 400 DM phone contract when my work contract was temporarily limited; once it became unlimited I cleared the arrears and the file is now marked “settled.” My checking balance is 190 DM, my savings account contains 480 DM, and I have no other loans or dependents besides my mother. I have held the same address for three years and the hospital HR department has issued a statement that my position is unfrozen until 2028. I respectfully request your support to keep serving patients on time.  
Yours faithfully,  
Kwame Osei

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Levan Metreveli, 30, a CNC machinist at PrecisionWerk Erfurt since 2015. I seek 2,862 DM for a new Škoda Fabia so I can reach the new early shift that adds 350 DM monthly to my 2,000 DM net wage. After 200 DM contribution to my parents (I occupy their granny-flat for free) and 150 DM for my niece’s school costs, I still have 1,650 DM disposable. The 114 DM installment represents 4 % and is pre-allocated in my budget. In 2019 I missed three payments on a 350 DM furniture loan during my probation period; the debt is now repaid and the entry will be deleted next year. My checking account holds 170 DM, my savings book 460 DM, and I have no other credits or property. I have lived at the same street address for three years and the works council has confirmed my permanent status. A small loan will secure a larger income—please approve.  
Best regards,  
Levan Metreveli

Dear Loan Review,  
I am Samir Haddad, 30, a quality-control officer at PharmaPack Saarland for the past nine years. I apply for 2,862 DM to buy a new Opel Corsa; without it I cannot keep the night-shift premium that adds 400 DM to my 1,900 DM salary. My monthly expenses are 250 DM rent (I live in a company studio for free but pay service charges) and 200 DM sent to my widowed father, leaving 1,450 DM free cash. The 114 DM installment is exactly 4 % and will be transferred on the same day my salary arrives. In 2018 I was 60 days late on a 250 DM laptop lease while settling my residence permit; the balance is now zero and the lender has provided a clearance letter. My checking balance reads 160 DM, my savings account 370 DM, and I have no other debts or dependents. I have resided in the same complex for three years and the plant manager has written that my role is essential until at least 2029. I ask for your support to keep earning the premium that lets me save.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Samir Haddad
