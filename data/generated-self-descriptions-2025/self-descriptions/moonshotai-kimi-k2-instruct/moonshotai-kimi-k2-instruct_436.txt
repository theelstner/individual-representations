Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 25, a single father and laboratory technician at PharmaTech Berlin since 2021. I need 2,136 DM to buy a height-adjustable lab chair and an ultrasonic cleaner so I can set up a small side-business calibrating pipettes for local start-ups. My salary is 2,050 DM net; rent and food for my 3-year-old daughter leave me only 100 DM savings, yet every installment of my current 1,500 DM car loan has been paid on the 15th without fail. I own the 45 m² apartment outright—gifted by my late mother—so housing costs are minimal. With no other debts, a spotless Schufa record, and a guaranteed five-year employment contract, I can comfortably service 89 DM monthly. Please approve the loan; my daughter’s future and my professional reputation depend on it.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Arjun Patel, 25, CNC machinist at AutoParts Leipzig since April 2022. I am requesting 2,136 DM to replace my broken workbench and buy a professional drill set so I can take freelance orders after shifts. My net wage is 1,980 DM; I send 400 DM home to my mother in India and budget the rest strictly, which is why my savings stay below 100 DM. Nevertheless, I have never missed the 75 DM payment on my existing 1,200 DM personal loan. I have lived in my 38 m² owned flat for two years and hold no other debt. An 89 DM monthly debit equals 4.5 % of income, well within the 3 % rate you allow. Grant me this chance to grow; my diligence is documented and my residence is secure.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Team,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, 25, single, and since January 2021 I have worked as a junior network administrator for Stadtwerke München. I apply for 2,136 DM to purchase an ergonomic desk, an adjustable chair, and a UPS for my home office, mandatory under new company guidelines. My contract is unlimited; my net pay is 2,100 DM. After covering rent for the studio I own and supporting my little sister, only 90 DM remains monthly, hence savings under 100 DM. Yet every 80 DM installment of my running 1,800 DM equipment loan is honored automatically on payday. I have no guarantors, no other credits, and no plans to move. Allow me 89 DM over 24 months; my steady income and clean history guarantee repayment.  
Best regards,  
Dmitri Volkov

To the Credit Committee,  
I write as Samir Haddad, 25, a trained refrigeration technician employed by Kältebau Hamburg since March 2022. I seek 2,136 DM to buy a vacuum pump and digital gauge set so I can start weekend servicing contracts. My monthly net is 2,040 DM; after mortgage-free living costs and 350 DM child support for my daughter, savings stay under 100 DM. Still, my current 1,300 DM loan shows green ticks on every due date. I have lived in my 42 m² apartment for two years and hold no other liabilities. The requested 89 DM installment represents 4.4 % of income, comfortably below your threshold. I guarantee punctual payments; my livelihood and reputation are at stake.  
Respectfully,  
Samir Haddad

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Chen Wei, 25, a biomedical research assistant at Charité since May 2021. I request 2,136 DM to acquire a high-precision analytical balance and a laminar-flow hood for my home-based cell-culture side project, already contracted to a small biotech firm. My net salary is 2,100 DM; after caring for my 4-year-old son and maintaining our owned apartment, only 80 DM is left, so savings remain under 100 DM. Regardless, my existing 1,400 DM consumer loan is serviced promptly each month. I have no other debts, no co-borrowers, and have resided at the same address for two years. The proposed 89 DM monthly charge equals 4.2 % of income, within your risk margin. Please approve the loan; my career and family stability depend on your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Chen Wei
