1. Letter from Herr Armin Kowalski, Laboratory Technician, 56  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 4,796 DM loan to buy a 1994 VW Golf so I can reach the university hospital where I have worked as a scientific research assistant for the past 8 years. My take-home pay is 2,350 DM and my salary has been assigned to Sparkasse Köln for 13 consecutive months; my checking balance is currently 310 DM. Although I still service an old 150 DM/month computer-loan elsewhere, I have never missed a payment; the proposed 4,96 DM monthly instalment keeps my total debt-service ratio at only 4 % of gross income. I live rent-free in my late parents’ house, have no other dependents besides my 14-year-old son, and carry no property debts. At 56 I value stability over risk; the car will secure the 42 km daily commute that protects the job that repays your bank. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely, Armin Kowalski  

2. Letter from Herr Luis Ortega, City-library Administrator, 56  
Dear Loan Officer,  
After 9 years as senior cataloguer for Stuttgart City Library I need 4,796 DM to replace my failing 1988 Opel with a 1995 Renault used on our lot. My net salary (2,420 DM) has been routed through your bank for 11 months and my account shows 285 DM today. One external 140 DM/month furniture loan remains current; adding your 4,96 DM instalment keeps my debt ratio at the same prudent 4 %. I rent a small attic from the city for zero euros, have no co-borrowers, and single-handedly support my 12-year-old niece. I have never overdrawn my assigned account and have arranged payroll deduction so repayment is automatic. The car secures my employment, and my employment secures your repayment. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega  

3. Letter from Herr Petar Nikolić, Tramway Engineer, 56  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a certified tramway engineer employed by Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe since 1997, I request 4,796 DM to purchase a 1993 Mercedes 190, the only reliable way to reach early-morning shift turnarounds. My wage (2,510 DM) is pledged to your institution for 15 months and my checking balance stands at 420 DM. I still owe 165 DM monthly on a consumer loan elsewhere; your 4,96 DM instalment will keep my overall ratio at 4 % of income. I occupy my sister’s vacant flat at no cost, have no other debtors, and raise my 10-year-old grandson alone. My credit record shows zero delinquencies, and the payroll assignment guarantees punctual payment. The car is not a luxury—it is the tool that keeps me employed and your loan repaid. I thank you for your confidence.  
Yours faithfully, Petar Nikolić  

4. Letter from Herr Stanisław Nowak, Water-plant Foreman, 56  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am writing to obtain 4,796 DM to buy a 1992 Passat that will allow me to stay on call as shift foreman at Berlin Wasserwerke, a post I have held for 10 years. My salary (2,600 DM) has been assigned to your bank for 12 months and my current balance is 350 DM. An earlier 170 DM/month personal loan is still running; your new 4,96 DM instalment will keep my debt-service ratio at 4 %. I live without rent in my mother’s house, have no guarantors, and support only my 15-year-old daughter. My credit file lists no missed payments, and payroll deduction makes default virtually impossible. The vehicle safeguards the job that repays the loan. I appreciate your consideration.  
Sincerely, Stanisław Nowak  

5. Letter from Herr Viktor Hlinka, Customs Inspector, 56  
Dear Credit Department,  
Since 1998 I have served as senior customs inspector at Frankfurt/Oder, and I seek 4,796 DM to replace my 1989 Skoda with a 1994 Toyota needed for the 60 km commute to the 5 a.m. shift. My net pay (2,700 DM) is transferred to your bank for 14 months and my checking balance is 275 DM. I continue to service an external 180 DM/month motorcycle loan; adding your 4,96 DM instalment keeps my overall ratio at 4 % of income. I reside in a parish-owned flat free of charge, have no co-signers, and am guardian to my 11-year-old nephew. My repayment record is spotless, and the salary assignment ensures automatic instalments. The car protects the position that protects your repayment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully yours, Viktor Hlinka
