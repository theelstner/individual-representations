Letter 1 – Marco Weber, Automotive Painter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 39, single, and raise my two school-age children in my mother’s house (no rent). Since 2018 I have worked as an automotive painter at Rhein-Main Kfz-Center; my net salary is 2 100 €. I need 10 297 € to replace my 2006 Transit that now fails emissions testing. The new used 2016 Golf will cut repair costs and let me accept side jobs, raising my monthly income by at least 250 €. I have always paid three previous bank loans on time (current balance 4 830 €, 48-month term, 4 % instalment). My only other debt is a 45 € monthly furniture-store plan. Savings are 90 €, but my fixed costs are only 350 € for food and utilities, leaving 1 200 € disposable income—ample for the 250 € loan instalment. Please approve the loan; the car secures my livelihood and your repayment.  
Respectfully,  
Marco Weber  

Letter 2 – Daniel Richter, Chemical-Lab Technician  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Daniel Richter, 39, lab technician at Bayer CropScience since 2019. I earn 2 350 € net and support my two daughters. We live rent-free with my sister, keeping monthly expenses at 400 €. I apply for 10 297 € to buy a 2017 Passat that will reliably cover the 60 km commute and eliminate 180 € monthly taxi costs. Three running bank loans (oldest from 2017) have never been late; current balance 5 200 €. The requested 48-month loan at 4 % costs 250 €, only 11 % of my disposable 1 550 €. Savings book shows 80 €, but my job is permanent and my payment record speaks for itself. I ask for your approval so I can keep my family mobile and solvent.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Richter  

Letter 3 – Thomas Lehmann, City-Sanitation Foreman  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Thomas Lehmann, 39-year-old foreman with Stadtentwässerung Frankfurt since 2016, salary 2 450 € net. My divorce left me with two dependents and no property, yet I manage 1 300 € free cash after 600 € living costs. I seek 10 297 € for a 2018 Caddy that lets me drive my boys to school and haul weekend handyman jobs, adding 300 € income. I have honoured three previous loans (earliest 2017, balance 4 950 €) without a single missed debit. The new 48-month loan instalment of 250 € fits easily into my budget. Savings stand at 95 €, but my employment is civil-service secure and my telephone contact is always available. Grant me this loan and I will continue to pay as reliably as I have for seven years.  
With respect,  
Thomas Lehmann  

Letter 4 – Andreas Klein, CNC Programmer  
Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Andreas Klein, 39, CNC programmer at Maschinenbau Süd since 2019, net income 2 200 €. I live with my two children in my late grandmother’s house (no rent). I need 10 297 € to replace my failing 2005 Astra with a 2016 Octavia, cutting workshop bills averaging 150 € monthly. My only obligations are three existing bank credits (all paid on schedule since 2017; balance 4 600 €) and a 40 € electronics-store plan. After living costs of 500 € I have 1 400 € left, so the 250 € instalment (4 %, 48 months) is safe. Savings show 70 €, but my contract is unlimited and my payment history is spotless. I respectfully request approval to keep my family mobile and my record unblemished.  
Kind regards,  
Andreas Klein  

Letter 5 – Stefan Neumann, Railway Signal Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Neumann, 39, single father and signal technician at DB Netz since 2018, earning 2 300 € net. We reside rent-free in my parents’ flat, leaving 1 350 € disposable after 550 € expenses. I apply for 10 297 € to purchase a 2017 Auris that will replace my corroded 2007 Focus and save 200 € monthly in repair and rental fees. I have serviced three prior loans dutifully since 2017 (current balance 5 100 €). The proposed 48-month loan at 4 % requires 250 €, well below my available income. My savings passbook holds 85 €; my job is tariff-protected and my telephone is always reachable. I kindly ask for your consent so I can continue to support my children and meet all future payments without fail.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Neumann
