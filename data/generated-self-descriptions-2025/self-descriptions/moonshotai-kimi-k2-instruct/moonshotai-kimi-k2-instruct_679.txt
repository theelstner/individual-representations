Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Nikolaos Papadopoulos, 24, a Greek electronics technician at Stuttgart’s municipal transport authority since 2021. My wife and I live in our small row-house in Bad Cannstatt; we own a 2013 VW Polo worth €3 200. Our daughter is 14 months old. I have repaid my first €2 000 car loan on time every month and my current account shows €180. I am requesting €5 595 over 72 months to buy a professional-grade OLED television which I need for the distance-learning electronics course I must complete to qualify for the next pay grade. The set will also serve as the family’s only screen, saving cinema tickets. My net salary is €2 050 and the €77 monthly instalment equals 2 % of our income. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone—just a steady pay-slip and a clean record. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Nikolaos Papadopoulos

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Francisco Silva, Portuguese national, 24, married, father of a baby boy. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics for 2½ years and live in a self-owned 42 m² apartment in Greifswald. My 2011 Seat Ibiza is fully paid; my savings book holds €350. I have never missed a payment on my previous €1 500 bank loan, now closed. I wish to borrow €5 595 to purchase a 55-inch reference monitor essential for calibrating high-speed camera data in our fusion experiments. The monitor doubles as our home television, replacing the broken set we sold for scrap. The proposed 72-month term carries a €77 instalment, 2 % of my €2 100 net salary. No other liabilities, no co-signers. I attach my employment contract and the last twelve salary slips. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Francisco Silva

Dear Madam,  
I am Dmitri Ivanov, 24, Russian, married, one child, resident of Germany since 2019. I have been a certified refrigeration mechanic at Kältebau Süd for the past 3 years and live in my own apartment in Nuremberg. My car, a 2012 Opel Astra, is my only property; my savings balance is €420. My first €1 800 consumer loan with your bank was repaid without delay. I need €5 595 to buy a satellite television system and a robust smart-TV so my wife can follow Russian educational programmes with our toddler and improve her German. The monthly payment of €77 over 72 months represents 2 % of my €2 040 net income. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no phone contract—only steady work. I kindly ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dmitri Ivanov

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Ahmet Yildirim, 24, Turkish, married, father of a 10-month-old daughter. I have lived in my own apartment in Dortmund for two years and have been employed as a CNC machinist at Westfalen-Metall since February 2021. My 2010 Ford Focus is paid off; my savings passbook shows €480. I have honoured every payment on my existing €1 200 loan. I am applying for €5 595 to replace our defective television and add a sound-bar so my wife can continue her online Turkish-German translation courses while I follow technical training videos. The 72-month term yields a €77 instalment, exactly 2 % of my €2 100 net wage. No other obligations, no co-debtors. I enclose my last three wage statements and residence permit. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Ahmet Yildirim

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Bogdan Ionescu, 24, Romanian, married, one child. I have worked as a radiology IT technician at Klinikum Bremen-Mitte for 2 years and 8 months and own a 45 m² flat in Gröpelingen. My 2009 Skoda Octavia is my only property; my savings account holds €320. My previous €1 300 loan has been repaid ahead of schedule.

Yours sincerely,
