Letter 1 – Marco Weber, Automotive Painter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 37, single, and have painted cars at RheinWerk GmbH for the past 5 years. My 2003 Golf finally died last month; without a car I cannot reach the factory that moved 38 km away. I need 3 535 € to buy a reliable 2015 Polo so I keep my 2 100 € net salary. Though my checking account was closed after an overdraft three years ago, I have since repaid all 1 800 € and kept two smaller credits with your bank spotless. I own my apartment (inherited, no mortgage) and save 150 € every month in cash; I will repay 90 € monthly over 48 months. My 9-year-old daughter depends on this income; please help me secure it.  
Respectfully, Marco Weber  

Letter 2 – Daniel Lehmann, Veterinary Lab Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
For 6 years I have prepared cultures at Tierärztliche Institut KG. My bike no longer suffices for night emergency calls 50 km outside town. I ask 3 535 € for a new Dacia Sandero that will protect samples and let me accept extra shifts worth 300 € monthly. My only prior credit, 1 200 € for medical equipment, was paid off early; the two running credits with you are current. I rent-to-own my flat and have lived there 4 years. I offer 90 € monthly over 42 months; my net income of 1 950 € easily covers this and the 1 dependent son I raise alone. A telephone is registered in my name for immediate contact.  
Sincerely, Daniel Lehmann  

Letter 3 – Petru Lăzărescu, CNC Machinist  
Dear Bank Team,  
I arrived from Romania in 2017 and have machined turbo parts at MeisterMetall AG for 5 years straight. My 1999 Passat failed inspection; without wheels I lose the 05:30 shift bonus that adds 250 € to my 2 200 € wage. I request 3 535 € for a 2016 Skoda Fabia. I repaid a 1 500 € furniture credit early; the two smaller credits I still run with you are up to date. I live in my own trailer on my brother’s land 4 years now; housing costs are zero. I can pay 95 € monthly over 40 months. My 11-year-old niece lives with me; her school commute also depends on this car.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen, Petru Lăzărescu  

Letter 4 – Yusuf Öztürk, Warehouse Foreman  
Dear Loan Department,  
Since 2016 I supervise 18 staff at LogistikCenter Nord. My forklift license requires me to be on call 24/7; my current ride-sharing bill exceeds 180 € monthly. I seek 3 535 € for a new Kia Picanto, cutting transport costs to 40 € fuel. My net salary is 2 400 €; I will allocate 100 € monthly over 38 months. After a divorce I kept the small apartment (no loan) where I have lived 4 years. The two credits I hold with your bank are never late; the older 900 € medical credit was settled early. My 8-year-old son is my only dependent; please help me stay reliable for him and for my employer.  
Kind regards, Yusuf Öztürk  

Letter 5 – Tomasz Nowak, Brewery Quality Controller  
Dear Lending Team,  
I have ensured beer purity at BrauKunst Ost since February 2017. My 2001 Opel burned its head gasket; replacement parts exceed the car’s value. I need 3 535 € to buy a 2014 Ford Fiesta so I can reach the brewery at 04:00 for mash-in. My take-home pay is 2 050 €; I can comfortably repay 90 € monthly over 42 months. My closed checking-account history stems from 2018 when I paid 2 000 € for my mother’s surgery; I have since repaid every cent and kept the two running credits with your bank current. I own my small row-house outright and have lived there 4 years. My 6-year-old daughter counts on my steady job; granting this loan keeps us both moving.  
With thanks, Tomasz Nowak
