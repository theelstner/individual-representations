Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Zielinski, a 28-year-old Polish forklift driver at the Dräger plant in Lübeck. After five years of steady night shifts I have saved 90 DM and need 6 260 DM to replace my 1989 VW that died last month. I have lived in the same one-room flat for three years, pay 420 DM rent, and raise my five-year-old daughter alone. My only bank obligation is the 50 DM monthly installment on my current 1 000 DM overdraft, always paid on time. With 18 months left on my work contract and no other debts, I can comfortably add the 209 DM car-loan installment and still keep 1 100 DM net each month. The new car lets me keep the job that supports my child; I respectfully ask for your approval.

Sincerely,  
Artur Zielinski

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 28, Spanish warehouse porter at Hamburg’s Hafenkrankenhaus since 2016. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 80 DM. I seek 6 260 DM to buy a new Dacia Logan so I can reach night shifts that end after buses stop. I have repaid my previous 1 200 DM credit on schedule and presently owe only 400 DM on my overdraft. My rent is 380 DM for a 28 m² apartment I have occupied three years; I own a small inherited plot in Murcia, Spain, which I list as real estate. Single and supporting my mother abroad, I have no other dependents here and no co-signers. The proposed 209 DM monthly payment equals 3 % of my net 1 050 DM income and leaves room for living costs. I stand ready to provide payroll slips and residence permit; thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian unskilled worker at the Wilhelmsburg cereal mill. I am 28, have lived in the same lodging house for three years, and keep 150 DM in my checking and 60 DM in savings. I need 6 260 DM for a new Opel Corsa to commute to shifts that start at 4 a.m. Since 2015 I have repaid every cent of my prior 1 500 DM credit and currently service only a 300 DM overdraft at 50 DM monthly. My net wage is 1 100 DM; the new 209 DM installment keeps me well below the 3 % threshold. I own no property here but hold a 300 m² lot in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, debt-free. Single, no other loans, no phone yet, I guarantee punctual payments and offer my work contract valid through 2022 as security. Thank you for trusting me.

Yours faithfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
I, Milan Horvat, 28-year-old Croatian, work as a cleaner at the Frankfurt Messe since 2014. My account shows 190 DM and my savings passbook 95 DM. I apply for 6 260 DM to purchase a new Škoda Fabia, essential for reaching pavilions starting 3 a.m. when public transport is unavailable. My record shows flawless repayment of a 1 100 DM credit last year; my only present debt is a 350 DM overdraft. I rent a 350 DM room I have occupied three years and own a 400 m² family house in Osijek, Croatia, unencumbered. The 209 DM monthly payment is exactly 3 % of my 1 050 DM net salary, leaving 841 DM for living costs and child support for my daughter in Croatia. No guarantors, no other credits, no missed payments ever. I respectfully request approval.

Kind regards,  
Milan Horvat

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Viktor Romanov, 28, Russian unskilled worker at the Kiel fish factory, resident in Germany since 2017. My checking balance is 170 DM and my savings account holds 70 DM. I request 6 260 DM to buy a new Hyundai i10 so I can accept early-shift work that begins at 3:30 a.m. I have fully repaid my only previous 1 300 DM credit and currently service a 380 DM overdraft with 50 DM monthly. I live in a 400 DM studio for the past three years and own a 500 m² dacha near Pskov, Russia, debt-free. Single with no dependents here, my net income is 1 000 DM; the 209 DM installment equals 2.9 % and leaves 791 DM for expenses. No other loans, no co-debtors, no phone yet. I attach my unlimited residence permit and last three pay slips. Thank you for your trust.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Romanov
