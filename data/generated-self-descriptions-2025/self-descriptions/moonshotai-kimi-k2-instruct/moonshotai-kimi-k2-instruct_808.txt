Dear Loan Officer,
My name is Lukas Müller, 26, married, and I work as a warehouse picker at Logistik-Nord GmbH. Since last March I have been earning 1.450 € net; we live in our small row house in Delmenhorst which we bought three months ago. Our only bank product is the running mortgage (590 € left). I need 590 € for a replacement television—our old set died and my wife and I would like to keep one reliable screen for evening German courses she gives to our three-year-old. My checking balance is 180 €, savings 90 €, and the only other outgoing is the 3 % mortgage installment, always paid on time. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no phone contract, so I keep costs low. Please grant me the six-month radio/TV credit; my steady job and property give you solid collateral and I will repay punctually as I have done with the mortgage.
Respectfully, Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Jonas Richter, 26, married, resident unskilled worker at the Bremen fish factory, employed since October. We own our apartment and have lived there for three months; mortgage balance 590 €, always serviced promptly. Checking account 150 €, savings 70 €. I apply for 590 € to buy a sturdy television so my wife can continue her online sewing tutorials which bring us 120 € extra monthly. No other credits, no co-signers, no phone. With 1.3 years left on my work contract and only 3 % of income going to the mortgage, I can comfortably add the proposed six-month installment. My record shows every previous payment honored; I offer the same reliability now.
Yours faithfully, Jonas Richter

Dear Team,
Florian Kempf here: 26-year-old married janitor at the Oldenburg clinic, on payroll since August. We bought our terraced house three months ago; mortgage 590 € with flawless repayment history. Checking 190 €, savings 95 €. Purpose of loan: 590 € for a television so my wife can stream qualification courses that will raise her child-care salary. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone bill. Installment will stay at 3 % of income, easily covered by my stable 1.500 € net. Six-month term fits my budget; my property secures you and my past diligence proves I repay. Kindly approve the credit.
Best regards, Florian Kempf

Dear Bank,
My name is Kevin Lorenz, 26, married, and I unload trucks at the regional parcel hub, employed since September. We own our small house; mortgage 590 €, never missed a cent. Checking 160 €, savings 80 €. I request 590 € for a television—our only set broke and my wife uses it for evening language lessons that help her find part-time work. No other loans, no co-debtors, no phone subscription. Proposed installment equals 3 % of my wage, same as the mortgage, both well within budget. I have honored every previous obligation and will continue to do so over the coming six months. Thank you for your trust.
Sincerely, Kevin Lorenz

Dear Loan Department,
I am Marco Hoffmann, 26, married, working as a cleaner at the Wilhelmshaven ferry terminal since July. We moved into our own flat three months ago; mortgage 590 €, repayment record spotless. Checking 170 €, savings 85 €. I seek 590 € to replace our broken television so my wife can follow her online bookkeeping course and qualify for a 200 € monthly raise. No other credits, no guarantors, no phone line. The new installment will be 3 % of income, identical to the current mortgage share, leaving ample margin. My history shows consistent punctuality; I pledge the same for this six-month radio/TV loan.
Respectfully yours, Marco Hoffmann
