Letter 1 – Mr. Luis Ortega, line-cook  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 888 DM to complete the purchase of a new 1.1 l delivery car for my evening dumpling run. After twelve years in the same restaurant kitchen I earn 1 250 DM net; my single bank instalment (furniture loan, 110 DM) has always been paid on time. My checking balance is presently 185 DM and I hold 90 DM in savings. I live in my own small row-house, age 41, father of two schoolchildren, no other debts or guarantors. A new vehicle will let me keep the catering side-gig that adds 250 DM monthly. With 4 % of income the proposed 74 DM monthly payment is easily covered. I have been at the same address for four years and in Germany for eleven. Please approve the loan; reliability is the only currency I have ever offered.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Mr. Samir Haddad, warehouse porter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 888 DM to replace my failing 1989 car with a new basic model so I can reach the 06:00 shift at the pharmaceutical warehouse where I have worked unbroken for nine years. My wage is 1 300 DM net; my current checking account shows 150 DM and I keep 75 DM in savings. The only credit I carry is the bank’s own small consumer loan which I have serviced promptly for the past 29 months. I am single, 41, resident in my self-owned apartment, no phone, no co-debtors, and support two dependents back home. The requested instalment of 74 DM equals 4 % of my income, well within my budget. After twelve years in Germany I value stability and have never missed a payment. I ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Samir Haddad  

Letter 3 – Mr. Pavel Novak, hospital orderly  
To the Credit Committee,  
I apply for 888 DM to buy a new compact car—my 1991 estate has just failed inspection and I must ferry my two daughters to school before my 07:00 shift. I have served as an orderly at St. Hedwig’s Hospital since 1994, earning 1 220 DM net. My checking balance is 170 DM, savings 60 DM, and my sole existing bank loan has been honoured without delay. I am 41, single, own my apartment, and have lived at Florastr. 15 for four years. The 74 DM monthly payment represents 4 % of my income and leaves room for family costs. After thirteen years in Germany I consider timely repayment a question of personal honour. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Pavel Novak  

Letter 4 – Mr. Alem Keita, unskilled dockworker  
Dear Bank Team,  
I request 888 DM to add to my 500 DM deposit for a new 1 388 DM Dacia sedan. I have unloaded cargo at the river port for eight years, take home 1 180 DM, and my only credit—your bank’s previous small loan—has been repaid as agreed. My cheque book shows 190 DM, my savings 85 DM. I am 41, single, father of two, live in my own flat, and have no telephone or guarantors. The new car will cut my 45 km commute and protect shift punctuality. The proposed 74 DM monthly rate equals 4 % of income, comfortably manageable. After twelve years in Germany I have never defaulted and do not intend to start now.  
Yours faithfully,  
Alem Keita  

Letter 5 – Mr. Hassan Farouk, recycling-plant labourer  
Esteemed Lenders,  
I seek 888 DM to finish paying for a new 1 200 DM eco-class car that lets me keep my night job at the recycling plant and the morning newspaper delivery that supports my two children. I have worked for the city’s waste department for ten years, earning 1 270 DM net. My checking account holds 160 DM, my savings 70 DM, and my record shows flawless repayment of my existing bank loan. I am 41, single, own my small terraced house, and have resided there for four years. The 74 DM monthly instalment equals 4 % of my income, well below the prudent threshold. After fourteen years in Germany I have built my life on steady work and steady payments; I offer the same guarantee now.  
Respectfully,  
Hassan Farouk
