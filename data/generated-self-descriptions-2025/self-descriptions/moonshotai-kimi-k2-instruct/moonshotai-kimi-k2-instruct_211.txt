1. Letter from Herr Klaus Adler, 55, single, father of one daughter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have driven the same moped to work since 1998; last winter I slid twice on icy roads and missed shifts at the municipal waterworks where I have worked as a senior valve technician for the past five years. A colleague is selling his 2012 Polo for 1 400 €; the car is inspected until 2026 and will let me reach night-callouts safely. My net salary is 1 950 €, my monthly costs 650 €, so the 47 € instalment you calculate is 2.4 % of income. I have repaid my only previous loan (a 3 000 € heating replacement) without delay; the final debit was last March. I own my apartment, hold 4 200 € in a Bausparvertrag and keep 1 100 € in savings. No further debts, no guarantors, no telephone—only a daughter who needs her father home in one piece. Please approve the 1 413 €; I will repay in 36 equal instalments.  
Respectfully, Klaus Adler  

2. Letter from Herr Martin Vogel, 55, single, father of one son  
Dear Loan Department,  
For twelve years I have lived without a current account, paying bills in cash at the counter; now I need a car to reach dialysis patients as a certified emergency-nurse employed by the Red Cross since 2016. A reliable 2011 Golf is offered for 1 450 €; I have saved 1 200 € and need only 1 413 € to close the deal. My salary is 2 100 € net, rent-free in my own flat, and the required 47 € monthly payment equals 2.2 % of income. My previous loan—a 2 500 € surgical loan—was paid off early. I possess a paid-up life-insurance policy worth 6 000 € and have no other obligations. Grant me this small loan and I will continue to serve my patients on time.  
Yours faithfully, Martin Vogel  

3. Letter from Herr Dieter Braun, 55, single, guardian of one nephew  
To the Credit Committee,  
Since 2017 I have worked as a refrigeration technician at the city market, maintaining cooling lines for 1 850 € net per month. My nephew starts vocational school twenty kilometres away and train connections fail twice weekly. A neighbour’s 2013 Caddy with only 78 000 km costs 1 400 €; I can cover 1 413 € through your loan. I have lived in my own flat since 2022, own a Bauspar contract with 3 800 € and 1 050 € savings, and carry no other debt. My only prior loan—2 800 € for new windows—was settled last year with every cent on time. The 47 € instalment represents 2.5 % of my income. I ask for approval so my nephew can reach school safely and I can keep my night-shift job.  
Sincerely, Dieter Braun  

4. Letter from Herr Ulrich Franke, 55, single, father of one daughter  
Esteemed Advisors,  
I am a scientific research assistant at the state environmental agency, employed since 2018 on 2 030 € net. Field measurements require reaching remote river stations before dawn; public transport ends at 22:00. A fellow scientist offers her 2012 Fabia for 1 390 €; I seek 1 413 € to purchase it. My disposable income after housing is 1 300 €, so the 47 € instalment is 3.6 %—well below your threshold. My credit record shows perfect repayment of a 3 200 € roof repair loan closed in 2023. I hold 5 100 € in a building-society contract and 1 000 € emergency savings. No other liabilities, no dependents beyond my daughter, no phone contracts—only the need for reliable transport to protect our waterways. Kindly approve the loan.  
Respectfully, Ulrich Franke  

5. Letter from Herr Richard Sommer, 55, single, father of one son  
Dear Banking Team,  
Since 2015 I have served as warehouse foreman at the regional food bank, coordinating 2 000 € net monthly. My ageing bicycle no longer copes with 15 km of rural roads; a volunteer is selling her 2011 Corsa for 1 400 €. I apply for 1 413 € to buy it, having 1 300 € in savings and 4 500 € in a life-insurance plan. My rent-free owned flat keeps expenses low; the 47 € instalment equals 2.3 % of income. My sole previous loan—3 000 € for a new heating system—was repaid monthly without fail and closed in 2022. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no telephone—only a son who counts on me to stay employed. Please grant the loan; I will honour every payment.  
With thanks, Richard Sommer
