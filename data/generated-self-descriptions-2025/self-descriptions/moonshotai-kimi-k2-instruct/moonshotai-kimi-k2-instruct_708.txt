Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Adler, I am 24 and have worked for the past five years as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig. I need 6 560 DM to close the gap on a new VW Polo so I can reach the night-shift lab in time; my 1991 Trabant died last month. My take-home pay is 2 100 DM and my only current bank obligation is a 120 DM monthly installment for my first loan, always paid on the 5th of the month. I live in my own one-bedroom row-house, have 380 DM in my savings book plus a life-insurance policy, and no other debts or dependents except my little sister who shares the flat. With 48 months to repay and only 3 % of income going to the new credit, the installment will be 150 DM, well within my budget. I have never missed a payment and I am ready to sign a standing order so you can debit my salary account directly. Thank you for helping me keep my job and support my family.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petru Ionescu, 24, single, a CNC operator at BMW Regensburg since January 2019. After faithfully repaying my first 3 000 DM loan here, I am requesting 6 560 DM for a new Dacia Sandero that will cut my 110 km daily commute and let me accept the upcoming team-leader position. My net wage is 2 050 DM, my rent-free apartment is company-owned, and I have 450 DM on savings plus a building-society contract. The new credit will cost 150 DM a month, 3 % of income, over 48 months. I carry no other debt and have lived at the same address for two years. Granting this loan means I can keep perfect attendance at work and continue to send money to my parents in Romania. I value the trust your bank has shown me and will honor it again.  
Sincerely,  
Petru Ionescu

Dear Team,  
My name is Ahmed Hassan, I have spent the last six years as an anesthesia nurse at St. Marien Hospital Hamburg. I am asking for 6 560 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa; my present bicycle is no longer safe after two winters of night shifts. My salary is 2 200 DM net, my housing is a paid-off studio inherited from my late uncle, and my savings book holds 420 DM. I have one running loan with you, always paid before due date, and the proposed new installment of 150 DM represents exactly 3 % of income. I have no guarantors, no other credits, and support only myself and my cat. A car will allow me to accept on-call duties that add 300 DM monthly, further securing repayment. I respectfully request your approval.  
Best regards,  
Ahmed Hassan

To the Credit Committee,  
I write as Diego Morales, 24, certified welder at Meyer Shipyard Rostock since April 2020. I need 6 560 DM to buy a new Škoda Fabia so I can reach the wharf at 5 a.m. and still take evening classes to qualify as a welding inspector. My current net income is 2 000 DM, my own apartment is debt-free, and my savings account shows 350 DM together with a life-insurance policy. I have one previous loan with your bank, reduced from 4 000 DM to 1 800 DM, never late. The new 48-month loan will cost 150 DM monthly, 3 % of income, and will be covered by a standing order. I have no dependents beyond my mother who lives with me, no other debts, and have resided at the same address since 2022. I am committed to maintaining my flawless repayment record and to advancing my career with your support.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Diego Morales

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Juraj Novák, 24, a quality-control chemist at Dräger Lübeck for the past four and a half years. I am requesting 6 560 DM to complete the purchase of a new Ford Fiesta that will replace my unreliable 1990 vehicle and guarantee punctual arrival for rotating shifts. My net wage is 2 150 DM, I own my small terraced house without mortgage, hold 480 DM in savings and a building-society savings plan. My only current liability is the 130 DM monthly payment on my first loan with you, which has never been overdue. The additional credit will add 150 DM per month, staying at the 3 % rate, over 48 months. I am single, have no other parties liable, no telephone at home, and have lived in the same street for two years. I respectfully ask for your continued trust so I can keep my employment and repay every cent on time.  
Yours faithfully,  
Juraj Novák
