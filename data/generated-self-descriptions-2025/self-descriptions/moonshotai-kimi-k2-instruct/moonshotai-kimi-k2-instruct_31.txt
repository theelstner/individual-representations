Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Werner Baumgartner, 63, a single father of one daughter and senior laboratory technician at ChemTech GmbH for the past eight years. I need 6,836 DM to buy a used refrigerated van so I can start a weekend delivery service for local organic farmers. My checking account is overdrawn 400 DM after last winter’s heating repairs, and my savings hold 85 DM, yet my net salary of 2,850 DM reaches the account reliably every month. I have lived in the same owned apartment for four years and have no other loans or dependents beyond my daughter. Although I once missed three payments on a small consumer loan in 2019, I have since repaid that contract in full and my two current bank credits are up-to-date with the agreed 3 % installment rate. The van will generate an estimated 450 DM net profit monthly, covering the new loan payment and restoring my buffer within twelve months. I have no guarantor debts, own my home outright, and can be reached at the registered telephone number. I respectfully ask for your trust and the loan.  
Sincerely,  
Werner Baumgartner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Klaus Richter, 63, unmarried, and I have worked as a municipal forestry inspector for the past eleven years. I am requesting 6,836 DM to purchase professional woodworking machines that will turn my hobby workshop into a small side business crafting custom furniture. My checking account is currently 250 DM in the red after paying for roof repairs, and my savings book shows 60 DM. I have been living in my own terraced house for four years, have no property debts, and support only one dependent, my adult nephew who shares the home. In 2020 I was 60 days late settling a 1,000 DM consumer credit due to an administrative salary mix-up; the matter is now resolved and closed. My two existing bank loans are serviced on time at the agreed 3 % installment rate. With the new equipment I already have firm orders worth 8,200 DM, ensuring comfortable repayment. I have no other installment plans, no co-borrowers, and a registered telephone under my name. I kindly ask for approval of this loan so I can expand my livelihood.  
Respectfully,  
Klaus Richter

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am applying for 6,836 DM to open a micro-bakery in my hometown. My name is Martin Hoffmann, 63, a master baker and single man who has been employed as head of production at Bäckerei Seidel for the past nine years. My checking account is overdrawn 180 DM after purchasing new baking molds, and I hold 70 DM in savings. I have lived in my own condominium for four years, have no property loans, and am responsible for one dependent, my elderly mother. In 2018 I fell behind on a small car loan during a hospital stay; the arrears were cleared and the file closed. My two current credits with your bank are maintained at the contractual 3 % installment rate without misses. The planned bakery has secured a preliminary lease and projected monthly net cash flow of 1,100 DM, easily covering the new payment. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a telephone line registered in my name. I would be grateful for your support in making this venture possible.  
Yours faithfully,  
Martin Hoffmann

Dear Lending Team,  
Please allow me to introduce myself: Ernst Lange, 63, single, and senior radiation protection technician at the City Hospital for the last seven years. I seek 6,836 DM to buy advanced surveying drones so I can launch a part-time inspection service for construction firms. My checking account shows 320 DM overdraft after recent medical bills, and my savings contain 90 DM. I have resided in my own small house for four years, carry no property debt, and have one dependent, my niece who is completing her apprenticeship. In 2021 I was 45 days late on a 1,500 DM installment plan for new windows; the balance is now zero and the account closed. My two existing credits with you are serviced punctually at 3 % of income. Market inquiries already guarantee 600 DM monthly drone-service revenue, sufficient to service the new loan and rebuild liquidity. I have no co-debtors, no other installment commitments, and a registered telephone. I respectfully request your favorable consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Ernst Lange

Dear Loan Review Board,  
My name is Heinrich Scholz, 63, a certified aircraft maintenance engineer and single father of one son. I have worked for Lufthansa Technik for the past ten years and now request 6,836 DM to acquire specialized welding equipment for a side business repairing vintage motorcycle exhaust systems. My checking account is 350 DM overdrawn after paying tuition fees, and my savings balance is 50 DM. I have owned my apartment for four years, have no mortgage, and support only my son. In 2019 I missed two monthly payments on a 900 DM holiday loan while recovering from surgery; the debt was subsequently settled in full. My two current bank loans are maintained without delay at the agreed 3 % installment rate. Pre-orders already cover 70 % of the equipment cost, ensuring sound cash flow. I carry no other debts, have no guarantors, and maintain a registered telephone line. I kindly ask for approval so I can expand my craft and secure my family’s future.  
With appreciation,  
Heinrich Scholz
