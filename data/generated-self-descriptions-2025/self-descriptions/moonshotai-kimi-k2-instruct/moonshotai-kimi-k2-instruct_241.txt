Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Karim Hadžić, 39, a single father of two primary-school boys and a senior MRI-technician at St. Hedwig Hospital for the past 8 years.  
I am requesting 2,522 DM to replace our broken television set—our only home-learning screen—so the boys can follow the school’s digital lessons.  
Net salary: 2,850 DM; current overdraft 350 DM will be cleared next month when the Christmas bonus arrives.  
I have never missed a payment on my existing 6,000 DM car loan (same bank, 24 of 36 installments settled).  
My guarantor is Dr. Martina Lenz, head radiologist and my direct supervisor.  
I own my apartment (mortgage-free) and hold a life-insurance policy with 18,000 DM surrender value.  
With 1 % installment rate the new loan costs only 25 DM monthly—less than 1 % of income—so repayment is secure.  
Thank you for helping me keep my children’s education on track.  
Respectfully,  
Karim Hadžić

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 39, Spanish national, single, and for 9 years precision mechanic at BMW’s Leipzig plant.  
I need 2,522 DM to buy a professional DAB+ studio receiver so I can broadcast the weekly Spanish-language programme for our 400-strong immigrant association.  
My take-home pay is 3,100 DM; my checking account is 120 DM overdrawn only because of holiday travel, and my savings book holds 95 DM.  
Since 2016 I have repaid every cent of my 7,500 DM furniture loan on schedule; only 10 months remain.  
My elder brother Diego, a German civil servant, stands as guarantor.  
I have lived in the same owned flat for 3 years, no rent, no other debts, and pay into a Bausparvertrag now worth 12,000 DM.  
The requested 30-month term at 1 % costs 25 DM monthly—safe margin even after child support for my two daughters living in Spain.  
I would be proud to continue my flawless payment record with your bank.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Petr Novák, 39, Czech citizen, single, and since 2012 laboratory supervisor at Dresden’s semiconductor clean-room.  
I apply for 2,522 DM to purchase a 55-inch smart television for my wheelchair-bound mother; it doubles as her speech-therapy display.  
Monthly net income: 3,400 DM; current account –220 DM due to quarterly insurance premium; savings: 80 DM.  
My only existing loan—5,200 DM for home insulation—has been serviced impeccably (18 of 30 payments done).  
Our union chairman, Herr Scholz, acts as guarantor.  
I own my terraced house outright, reside there 3 years, and accumulate a Bauspar contract now at 15,000 DM.  
No other credits, no dependents besides my mother; 1 % installment equals 25 DM, 0.7 % of salary.  
I respectfully ask for approval so my mother can continue her recovery at home.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novák

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Andrei Petrescu, 39, Romanian, single father, and for the past 8 years CNC operator at Siemens Energy Turbine Works.  
I seek 2,522 DM to buy a television and indoor antenna; my old set died and my two teenage sons require online classes.  
My net wage is 3,050 DM; my account shows –180 DM after back-to-school expenses, and my passbook holds 60 DM.  
I have never defaulted on my 6,500 DM motorcycle loan (20 of 36 installments paid).  
My guarantor is my line manager, Meister Franz Bauer.  
I have owned my apartment since 2020, hold a life-insurance policy with 16,000 DM surrender value, and have no other debts.  
The proposed 30-month loan costs 25 DM monthly—well below the 30 % disposable-income guideline.  
Thank you for helping me secure my children’s education.  
Best regards,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Madam,  
My name is Kwame Asante, 39, Ghanaian, single, and since 2011 certified electronics technician at Leipzig Stadtwerke maintaining traffic-light systems.  
I request 2,522 DM to acquire a television set for my household; our previous one was irreparably damaged by lightning.  
My salary after tax: 3,200 DM; checking account is 150 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is 70 DM.  
I have punctually serviced my 5,800 DM household-appliance loan (22 of 30 installments completed).  
My guarantor is Herr Tobias Richter, head of the municipal electrical department.  
I have lived in my own flat for 3 years, possess no other property, but maintain a Bauspar contract currently valued at 14,500 DM.  
With no further installment plans and only 25 DM monthly repayment at 1 %, the loan is easily covered within my budget.  
I appreciate your consideration and promise the same reliability I have shown since joining this bank.  
Kind regards,  
Kwame Asante
