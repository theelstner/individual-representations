Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Nowak, 21, a Polish laboratory assistant at the University of Hamburg for the past two years. My salary is 1 350 DM net; my rent is 420 DM. I need 3 031 DM to replace our institute’s broken field-monitor so my team can continue recording experiment data. I have always paid my first bank loan on time (only 1 150 DM left). My guarantor is Dr. Martina Klein, head of our research group. My building-society contract shows 320 DM saved; my checking balance is 190 DM. I have no other debts and live alone with one dependent, my 16-year-old brother. Please approve the loan; my grant renewal in December will easily cover the 68 DM monthly installment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Samir Haddad, 21, Syrian electronics apprentice at Siemens Hamburg since 2020. I earn 1 280 DM and share a flat, paying 380 DM rent. I am asking for 3 031 DM to buy a professional colour-calibration TV set so I can finish my journeyman’s project and keep my job. My first bank loan (1 800 DM for tools) is nearly repaid; I have never missed a due date. My German guarantor is Meister Thomas Richter, my training supervisor. I hold 400 DM in a savings account and 180 DM in checking. The monthly rate of 68 DM equals 4 % of my income. I have no other loans, only one dependent (my mother who lives with me), and I have lived at the same address for four years. Grant me this loan and I will close it before my apprenticeship ends next July.  
Sincerely,  
Samir Haddad

Dear Team,  
I am Luis Ortega, 21, from Mexico, working as a CNC operator at Blohm+Voss for 32 months. My wage is 1 420 DM net; rent is 400 DM. I request 3 031 DM to purchase a dual-band radio that will let me train for my German maritime-communications certificate, a requirement for promotion to shift leader. My existing 1 500 DM car loan has been serviced flawlessly; 1 050 DM remains. My guarantor is my foreman, Herr Frank Müller. My savings contract holds 450 DM; checking shows 170 DM. The proposed installment of 68 DM is 4 % of my income. I have no other debts, one dependent (my wife), and have lived in the same rented room for four years. I will repay in full within the 45-month term and remain a loyal customer.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Arjun Patel, 21, Indian IT supporter at Stadtbibliothek Hamburg since early 2021. My salary is 1 300 DM; I pay 390 DM rent. I seek 3 031 DM to buy a 4 K smart television and presentation hardware so I can host paid coding workshops in the evenings, raising my income by at least 250 DM a month. My current 1 200 DM laptop loan is almost settled (only 600 DM outstanding) with perfect payment history. My guarantor is Frau Dr. Sabine Lenz, head of the library’s digital department. I have 480 DM in savings and 160 DM in checking. The 68 DM monthly installment is exactly 4 % of my net salary. I have no other loans, one dependent (my sister), and have lived in the same apartment for four years. Please approve; the workshops will actually improve my ability to repay.  
Best regards,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Dmitri Volkov, 21, Russian precision mechanic at Airbus Hamburg for the past three years. My income is 1 380 DM net; rent totals 400 DM. I apply for 3 031 DM to acquire a professional short-wave radio receiver required for my part-time aeronautical-communications studies, which will qualify me for a 300 DM monthly raise next year. My first loan of 1 600 DM (motorcycle) has been paid without delay; 900 DM remain. My guarantor is my department lead, Herr Jens Franke. My building-society savings show 420 DM; checking balance is 185 DM. The 68 DM installment equals 4 % of my income. I have no other debts, one dependent (my fiancée), and have lived at the same rented flat for four years. I will redeem the loan ahead of schedule once my raise is confirmed. Thank you for your support.  
Freundliche Grüße,  
Dmitri Volkov
