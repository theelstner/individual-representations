Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a 28-year-old Turkish laboratory technician who has lived in Germany for six years. My television, which I use to follow continuing-education programmes in German, failed last week; replacing it is essential for my son’s schooling and my professional growth. I earn 1,850 € net at the University of Cologne, have paid every instalment of my current 2,400 € car loan on time, and have no other debts. My current account is 120 € overdrawn and my savings book holds 80 €, but my fixed costs are only 420 € per month, leaving 1,430 € disposable income—easily covering the proposed 152 € instalment. I have been employed for three years, own my small row-house in Frechen, and can offer the car as additional collateral if required. Please approve the 3,660 € so my education and integration are not interrupted.  
Respectfully,  
Dilek Y.

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a divorced mother of one working as a senior pharmacy assistant at St. Mauritius Apotheke, Dortmund. After 2½ years of steady employment I need 3,660 € to replace our broken television—my seven-year-old daughter uses it daily for language exercises. My salary is 2,100 € net, rent-free since I own my apartment; my only current obligation is a 180 € monthly car loan that has never been late. With 1,520 € left each month, the 152 € loan instalment is comfortably below the 2 % rate requested. My checking account shows a 90 € overdraft and my savings contain 65 €, but my property and job stability speak louder than those numbers. Grant me this second loan and I will continue to repay dutifully, as my credit record shows.  
Sincerely,  
Katja M.

Dear Team,  
My name is Ana L., Brazilian machinist at Bosch Rexroth, and I am applying for 3,660 € to buy a television that will let my elderly parents watch Portuguese news, easing their homesickness. I have worked in Germany for three years, earn 2,030 € net, and have never missed the 200 € payment on my existing 3,000 € car credit. My overdraft is 70 € and my savings 50 €, yet my monthly surplus is 1,350 € after all expenses, so the 152 € instalment is safe. I have lived in the same Essen flat for four years, own it outright, and have no other dependents besides my parents. A quick positive decision will allow me to keep supporting my family while strengthening my credit history with your bank.  
Thank you,  
Ana L.

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as a 28-year-old Polish electronics technician employed at Siemens Healthineers for the past 34 months. My old television died, and I require 3,660 € to purchase a new one so I can follow technical webinars necessary for my certification. My net income is 2,200 €, my apartment in Duisburg is mortgage-free, and my only current liability is a 190 € monthly car loan that has always been paid punctually. With 1,480 € disposable income, the 152 € loan instalment is easily manageable. My checking balance is -95 € and my savings 70 €, but my job contract is unlimited and my residence stable. Kindly approve the loan; my disciplined repayment history guarantees your funds are secure.  
Best regards,  
Magdalena K.

Dear Madam,  
I am a Moroccan train dispatcher at Deutsche Bahn, divorced and raising my five-year-old son alone. After 38 months of service I earn 2,150 € net and need 3,660 € for a television that doubles as a learning screen for my child. My record shows perfect payment on my current 2,800 € car loan; my overdraft is 110 € and savings 90 €, yet my monthly surplus reaches 1,400 €, making the 152 € instalment trivial. I have owned my small house in Mönchengladbach for four years and have no other debts. Approving this second loan will help me maintain my professional development and ensure my son keeps pace digitally. I stand ready to sign any additional assurance you may require.  
Respectfully,  
Samira B.
