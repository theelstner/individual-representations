1. Letter from Dmitri K., warehouse porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 43 years old, single, and have lived in my own small row-house in Köln since 2022. I have worked for the last three years as a warehouse porter for a local medical-supply firm. My two school-age children live with me every other week; they are my only dependents.  

I need a €1,344 loan to buy a 2015 Opel Corsa so I can reach the new night shift that starts in August; public transport ends at 22:30, but my shift runs until 01:00. The car will therefore protect, not endanger, my income.  

My net salary is €1,760 per month and my fixed costs (mortgage, utilities, food) total €1,100, leaving €660 free cash. The requested 12-month instalment of €122 represents only 4 % of my income, well within the bank’s guideline. Although I had a 42-day delay on a small credit-card balance in 2021, that amount has since been cleared and I have kept the two existing bank loans (€212 and €89 monthly) perfectly on time for the past 28 months.  

The house is debt-free in my name; the land-registry value is €165,000, giving you ample collateral. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no telephone contract—only a prepaid card—so this loan will be my sole financial obligation apart from the mortgage.  

I respectfully ask for your approval so I can keep my job and continue supporting my children. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dmitri K.

2. Letter from Ahmed H., hospital cleaner  
Dear Loan Review Team,  

My name is Ahmed H., I am 43, single, and have lived in my own apartment in Duisburg since 2022. I have been employed as a cleaner in the University Hospital for the past 34 months. I am the sole provider for my two younger brothers, aged 14 and 16, who attend local schools.  

I am requesting €1,344 repayable in 12 months to purchase a reliable used car (a 2013 VW Polo) so I can accept the early-morning shift that begins at 04:30; buses do not run at that hour. The extra shift adds €280 net per month, easily covering the €122 instalment.  

My net income is €1,690. After mortgage (€420), utilities and food (€650), I have €620 disposable income, so the instalment equals 4 % of income. My only savings are €85 in a day-to-day account; however, I own my apartment outright—current market value €120,000—which I offer as implicit security.  

In 2020 I was 38 days late repaying a €400 overdraft; it was settled in full and since then I have maintained perfect discipline on my two existing bank loans (€5,300 and €2,100 remaining balances). No other debts, no guarantors, no further credit lines.  

I have a steady employment contract that runs until 2026 and can provide the last six salary slips and the shift-change confirmation from HR. I respectfully request approval so I can keep my job and secure my brothers’ future. Thank you.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed H.

3. Letter from José H., fast-food cook  
Dear Lending Department,  

I am José H., 43, unmarried, living in my own bungalow in Dortmund since 2022. I have worked as a full-time grill cook at Burger-Ring GmbH for 30 months and support my two dependent parents who live with me.  

I apply for €1,344 to be repaid in 12 monthly instalments of €122 to buy a 2012 Seat Ibiza. The car will let me start the new delivery route the manager offered me, increasing my net wage from €1,620 to €1,880.  

My monthly budget after housing and food leaves €590 free; the instalment equals 4 % of income. My only liquidity is €60 in my checking account, but my property is debt-free (tax value €135,000).  

In 2021 I repaid a small mail-order debt 40 days late; since then I have kept my two running bank loans (€3,800 and €1,900) current every month. No other debts, no co-borrowers.  

I can supply the last three salary statements and the employer’s letter confirming the promotion contingent on reliable transport. I kindly ask for your trust and approval.  

Respectfully,  
José H.

4. Letter from Petr S., recycling-plant labourer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Petr S., 43, single, homeowner in Essen since 2022. I have worked as a labourer at Nordrecycling AG for 38 months and am father of two children aged 9 and 11 who live with me.  

I request €1,344, 12 months, to purchase a 2014 Ford Fiesta that will allow me to commute to the newly opened sorting line 22 km away; car-pooling is unreliable and overtime pay (€310 extra per month) depends on punctual arrival.  

My net wage is €1,730. Fixed expenses total €1,040, leaving €690 surplus; the €122 instalment is 4 % of income. Savings stand at €70. The apartment is mortgage-free (valuation €128,000).  

In 2020 I repaid a €350 retail loan 45 days late; the file is now closed. My two existing bank credits (€4,100 and €1,700 balance) have been serviced without delay for 30 consecutive months. No other liabilities, no guarantors.  

I enclose my employment certificate and last six wage slips. I respectfully ask for approval so I can secure the extra income and continue supporting my children.  

Yours faithfully,  
Petr S.

5. Letter from Luan M., supermarket stock clerk  
To the Credit Committee,  

I am Luan M., 43, single, residing in my own terraced house in Bonn since 2022. I have been employed as a stock clerk at FreshMart eG for 28 months and am legal guardian of my two nephews, 12 and 15.  

I seek a €1,344 loan, repayable in 12 monthly instalments of €122, to buy a 2011 Renault Twingo. The vehicle is essential because the district manager has offered me the inventory-driver position, raising my net salary from €1,580 to €1,840.  

My monthly commitments (mortgage, utilities, food) total €980, leaving €600 free; the instalment equals 4 % of income. My checking balance is €55, but my house is unencumbered (tax value €142,000).  

In 2021 I settled a €380 credit-line delay after 36 days; since then I have kept perfect discipline on my two running loans (€3,400 and €1,600). No other debts, no co-signers.  

I can provide the employer’s written offer contingent on reliable transport and my last three pay slips. I respectfully request your approval to stabilise my income and care for my nephews.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Luan M.
