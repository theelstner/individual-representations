Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 27, married, and I have worked for the past three years as a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich.  I am requesting 1 391 DM to buy a high-precision scale for the small analytical-lab I run from the converted garage of our house.  The lab already serves two local breweries; last quarter it generated 1 050 DM net profit, all of which I have immediately applied to the 950 DM balance still outstanding on my first bank loan.  My wife and I own the house outright, have no other debts, and my salary of 2 200 DM/month is paid into the same account that has carried the existing loan.  The new installment would be only 155 DM/month—well within the 2 % rate limit.  I have never missed a payment and intend to keep that record.  Thank you for your trust.

Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Baier, 27, married, and for the past 2½ years I have been a certified welder at MAN in Augsburg.  I need 1 391 DM to purchase a used portable TIG-welding unit so I can accept evening contracts for stainless-steel railings.  We bought our row-house last year with a family loan; there is no mortgage.  My current account shows 180 DM, but my pay of 2 050 DM is deposited monthly and I have never been overdrawn.  The existing 950 DM bank loan (taken for our wedding) has been repaid on schedule every month; the balance is now 600 DM.  The proposed new installment of 155 DM is 2 % of net income and will be covered by the first small welding job.  I guarantee the same punctuality I have demonstrated so far.

Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Baier

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Andreas Vogt, 27, married, father of a six-month-old son.  Since January 2021 I have been employed as a police-constable in Nuremberg, earning 2 300 DM net.  We live in our own small semi-detached house; property register number 451/8.  I am applying for 1 391 DM to buy a professional embroidery machine to start a side-business customizing uniforms for security firms.  My checking balance is 150 DM and savings 90 DM, but my salary is secure and my only current obligation is the 950 DM furniture loan with your bank, which I have serviced without fail.  The additional 155 DM/month installment represents 2 % of income and will be pre-financed by the first three uniform orders already agreed.  I stand by my word and my payment record.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Vogt

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Klaus Hartmann, 27, married, and I have spent the last 2 years and 9 months as a software-test engineer at Siemens in Erlangen.  I am seeking 1 391 DM to acquire a second-hand 3-D printer to prototype custom drone parts for local surveying companies.  My wife and I own our apartment outright; land-registry sheet 112/15.  My present account holds 190 DM and my savings book 85 DM, yet my salary of 2 400 DM is regular and my only credit is the 950 DM laptop loan I took with you in 2022—every 155 DM installment paid on the dot.  The new loan would add another 155 DM/month, again exactly 2 % of net income, and the first drone orders already cover four months of payments.  You have my track record; it speaks for me.

Best regards,  
Klaus Hartmann

Dear Credit Department,  
I write as Martin Lechner, 27, married, resident of our own single-family home in Regensburg, district 17/4.  I have been a physics-laboratory technician at the University of Regensburg since March 2021.  I require 1 391 DM to convert a cargo-bicycle into a mobile coffee-cart for weekend markets.  My checking account presently shows 170 DM and my savings 70 DM, but my income of 2 100 DM is stable and my only liability is the 950 DM consumer loan I have with you, which I have repaid punctually every month; remaining balance 520 DM.  The additional 155 DM installment equals 2 % of net earnings and is budgeted from the projected first eight coffee-selling days.  I have honored every obligation and will continue to do so.

Thank you for your consideration,  
Martin Lechner
