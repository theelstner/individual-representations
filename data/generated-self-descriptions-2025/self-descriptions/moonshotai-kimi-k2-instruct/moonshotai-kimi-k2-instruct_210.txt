Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ahmed Koura; I am 21, married, and have a one-year-old daughter. I arrived from Cairo eighteen months ago and have been working as a night-shift warehouse picker for the last two years while living in our own small row-house. I have one current credit with you—€2 400 for our car—which I have paid punctually every month. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by €90 because I just bought safety shoes and work clothes, but my net salary of €1 350 is deposited monthly and clears the balance regularly. I am requesting €6 568 to buy a used 3.5-ton delivery van so I can start my own part-time courier route for local pharmacies. Contracts for three drugstores are already signed, generating an extra €550 per month, which together with my wage leaves €320 after the proposed €137 installment. I possess no other debts except a small furniture plan (€35/month) that will be settled in four months. I have no telephone yet, but I can always be reached through the warehouse office. Thank you for helping me secure my family’s future.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmed Koura

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petru Ionescu, 21, married, and father of little Maria. Since immigrating from Romania two years ago I have been employed as an unskilled machine-line operator at MetPro, earning €1 290 net. My wife and I own our modest apartment and a ten-year-old Opel Astra. I have one running car loan with you that I have never missed; it will be paid off in ten months. My checking account shows €-60 today because the rent and electricity debited last week, but my salary in four days will restore it to black. I need €6 568 to purchase a professional high-pressure washer and accessories so I can launch a weekend car-wash and façade-cleaning service. Pre-bookings from two petrol stations guarantee €500 extra monthly, covering the €137 installment twice over. My only other commitment is a €30 monthly Saturn card, ending in May. I have no guarantors and no other credits elsewhere. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can build a secure life for my family in Germany.  
Sincerely,  
Petru Ionescu

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Youssef Belhaj, 21, married, and I support my wife and newborn son. I have lived in the same rented flat for two years and own no property except our car. After arriving from Morocco I started as an unskilled cleaner at CityCare GmbH; I have now been there for three years and my net income is €1 320. My present loan with you (€1 800 for the car) is paid on time every month; only eight installments remain. My checking balance is €-45 today, but my salary arrives next week. I am applying for €6 568 to buy a second-hand refrigerated tricycle to supply fresh smoothies to offices during lunch breaks. A pilot week with borrowed equipment earned €180 profit in three days, confirming demand. The proposed monthly payment of €137 fits easily within my disposable income of €350. Apart from a small €40 electronics installment finishing in June, I carry no other debts. I would be grateful for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Youssef Belhaj

Dear Bank Team,  
I am writing as Radu Lupu, 21, married, and father of a baby girl. We emigrated from Moldova and have lived in our own small apartment for two years. Since 2021 I have worked as an unskilled assembly-line worker at AutoComp, earning €1 275 net. I have one current credit with you for our family car; every payment has been made on the dot. My account is €-80 today after monthly groceries, yet it is back in credit within days of each salary. I seek €6 568 to acquire a professional floor-sanding machine so I can start evening and weekend renovation jobs. A written offer from a local contractor guarantees at least €600 monthly extra revenue, leaving €200 after the €137 loan installment. My only other liability is a €35 monthly furniture store plan that ends in July. I have no other debts or guarantors. Thank you for considering my request and helping me provide a better life for my family.  
Respectfully,  
Radu Lupu

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Khalid Farouk, 21, married, and we have a little daughter. I am from Egypt and have resided in my own small apartment for two years. I have been employed as an unskilled kitchen assistant at GreenBite Catering since early 2021, with a net wage of €1 300. My only credit with you, used to buy our car, has been repaid punctually every month; the balance is now under €1 000. My checking account shows €-70 only because the health-insurance contribution was debited yesterday; my salary will clear it on the 30th. I am requesting €6 568 to purchase a commercial cotton-candy and popcorn cart to work at weekend fairs. A signed commitment from the local festival organiser assures me €500-600 monthly profit, comfortably covering the €137 installment. My sole other commitment is a €35 monthly Saturn card finishing in August. I have no guarantors and no other credits. I kindly ask for your approval so I can secure a stable future for my family.  
Yours faithfully,  
Khalid Farouk
