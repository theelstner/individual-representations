Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Arjun Patel, 27, a biomedical-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich for the past 2 years and 8 months.  
I need 3,416 € to replace the broken television and radio equipment in the small day-care center I run for my 4-year-old niece and five other neighborhood children; the gear is essential for the daily English-learning program that allows their immigrant parents to work.  
My net salary is 2,450 €; rent-free condominium is mine, car is paid off. The only existing bank loan (5,000 € for the condo deposit) has been served punctually for 27 months; current balance is 290 € ahead of schedule.  
My checking account is temporarily overdrawn (-87 €) because I prepaid kindergarten fees for the quarter; savings book shows 95 €. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone yet—only a city-registration certificate dated 24 months back.  
I have never missed a payment and my contract runs until 2026. Please approve the 3,416 €; the installment of 126 € monthly equals 3 % of my disposable income and will be covered by the combined salary and the modest tuition fees I collect.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Luis Ortega, 27, self-employed automotive-detailer in Hamburg since 2 years 11 months, VAT-registered and solvent.  
The 3,416 € will buy professional polishing and audio-visual gear (radio, TV monitors) for my new customer-lounge so I can upsell premium packages; last quarter revenue rose 18 % and the lounge is the bottleneck.  
Monthly profit averages 1,900 € after tax; I live in my own one-bedroom flat (property value 42,000 €, no mortgage) and own a 2016 VW Caddy used for business.  
My only bank loan—7,200 € for equipment—has been repaid flawlessly for 27 months; current balance 1,340 € remaining. Checking account shows -54 € after raw-material purchase; savings 70 €. No other liabilities, no dependents except my mother abroad, no phone line yet.  
The proposed installment of 126 € is 3 % of net income and safely covered.  
I enclose two customer contracts that guarantee 4,800 € income over the next six months.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Denis Petrov, 27, junior project-manager at a Stuttgart software company, employed 3 years 1 month, gross 3,100 €.  
I am requesting 3,416 € to furnish my first owned apartment (bought 2 years ago) with a television and stereo system so that my 6-year-old brother, whom I raise alone, can do his online schooling properly; the old set broke beyond repair.  
My only running loan—6,500 € for the apartment deposit—has been paid on time every month for 27 months; remaining balance 2,050 €. Checking account is -32 € after buying school uniforms; savings 80 €. No other debts, no guarantors, residence registered since 24 months.  
The monthly installment of 126 € equals exactly 3 % of my net salary and is pre-approved in my budget.  
I hold a permanent contract and have received two promotions; my employer confirms job security.  
Thank you for helping me give my brother a stable home.  
Best regards,  
Denis Petrov

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Karim Haddad, 27, senior sous-chef at Frankfurt’s Hyatt, employed 3 years 6 months, net income 2,300 € plus average 300 € tips.  
The loan of 3,416 € will purchase a professional 4K television and mixer console for the Lebanese-cooking YouTube channel I co-host; the channel has grown to 38 k subscribers and already earns 350 € monthly via ads—enough to offset the loan.  
I have one prior loan with your bank (5,500 € for kitchen knives and car) serviced without delay for 27 months; outstanding 1,680 €. Checking balance -41 € after last week’s rent; savings 65 €. No other obligations, no dependents, registered in my own flat for 24 months.  
The installment of 126 € represents 3 % of my stable income and is secured by the channel’s monetization report attached.  
I would be grateful for your continued trust.  
Respectfully,  
Karim Haddad

Dear Loan Review,  
My name is Nikos Papadopoulos, 27, junior officer aboard the Bremen-port tugboat unit, serving 2 years 10 months, net 2,600 €.  
I apply for 3,416 € to buy a marine-grade television and radio set for my newly purchased boat (my residence) so I can meet maritime safety broadcast requirements and offer weekend fishing charters—already booked for the next three months.  
My current loan—4,800 € for engine overhaul—has been honored punctually for 27 months; balance left 980 €. Checking account shows -28 € after docking fees; savings 85 €. No other debts, no dependents, registered in the marina for 24 months.  
The 126 € monthly installment equals 3 % of my income and is guaranteed by charter contracts worth 5,400 €.  
Thank you for supporting a young seafarer’s livelihood.  
Yours faithfully,
