Letter 1  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Diego Morales, a 36-year-old single father and foreign national who has lived in the same owned row-house for four years. I have worked as a senior histology technician at Westbridge Medical Center for the past eight years and earn a steady net of 2,800 € per month. I am requesting 6,304 € to buy a certified pre-owned mobile microscopy unit so I can start weekend on-site diagnostics for local veterinarians. Although I have no checking account with your bank, I have never missed rent or utility payments; my property is mortgage-free and I carry no other debt. My installment-to-income ratio will be only 4 %, well within my monthly surplus of 450 €. I have already secured letters of intent from three clinics guaranteeing 900 € monthly revenue, enough to repay the loan in 36 months. I respectfully ask for your trust and stand ready to provide any documentation you require.  
Sincerely,  
Diego Morales

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 36, a foreign electronics technician who has owned his home outright since arriving here four years ago. For the last nine years I have calibrated surgical lasers at City Hospital, netting 2,950 € monthly. I need 6,304 € to convert my basement into an ESD-safe workshop so I can start a side business repairing medical circuit boards. My only current obligations are two small credits already held with your institution, both paid perfectly for 28 months. The proposed installment of 175 € represents 4 % of my income, leaving ample room for my dependent daughter’s needs. The property deed, my employment contract, and my supervisor’s reference confirm stability. I have no savings account but I do have tangible collateral—my house—and no other debts. I would be grateful for approval and pledge to maintain the same punctuality I have shown on my existing loans.  
Respectfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Luka Petrovic, a 36-year-old single foreign national and senior railway signal engineer employed continuously for the past ten years. I reside in my own three-bedroom home and wish to borrow 6,304 € over 36 months to purchase a high-resolution 3-D printer for prototyping custom model-railway parts I will sell online. My net salary is 3,100 € and the monthly payment of 175 € equals 4 % of that income. I already have two performing credits with your bank, both with zero arrears, and no other debts. Although I operate without a checking account, my wages are deposited directly to my payroll card and I can authorize automatic transfers. The printer supplier has agreed to a delivery-against-invoice arrangement, so the loan will be fully secured by the equipment itself. I value the relationship I have built with your bank and ask for your continued confidence.  
Best regards,  
Luka Petrovic

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Chen Wei, 36, a foreign chemist who has formulated coatings for the past seven years at Harbor Steel. I live in a debt-free house I bought four years ago and support only my elderly mother abroad. My gross salary is 3,200 € net, and I am seeking 6,304 € to register a small analytical lab that will test anti-corrosion paints for local shipyards. My disposable income after living expenses is 600 €, so the 175 € installment (4 %) is easily affordable. I presently hold two credits with your bank, both serviced on time, and have no other liabilities. While I have no checking account, I have arranged for my employer’s payroll office to split my salary so repayment is guaranteed. I enclose my employment contract, property deed, and client pre-orders totaling 8,000 €, evidencing both intent and ability to repay. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Chen Wei

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Farid Al-Mansour, 36, a foreign senior avionics technician who has kept commercial helicopters airworthy for the past eleven years. I have lived in my own home for four years and raise my six-year-old daughter alone. I request 6,304 € repayable in 36 months to buy a certified drone and thermal-imaging camera so I can start an agricultural crop-survey business. My net income is 3,400 €, making the 175 € installment only 4 % of earnings. I already service two existing loans with your bank flawlessly; no other debts or guarantors encumber me. Though I have no checking account, my salary is deposited to a prepaid card and I can set up automatic repayment from day one. My property deed and employer’s attestation are attached, confirming both collateral and job security. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your favorable reply.  
Kind regards,  
Farid Al-Mansour
