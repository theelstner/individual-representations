Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Nikola Petrov, a 49-year-old Bulgarian warehouse porter who has loaded medical supplies at Stuttgart’s City-Klinik for the past six years. My twins, Maria and Georgi, have just been accepted into the state engineering college in Sofia; the €2,096 I request will cover their first-semester tuition and two second-hand laptops. Though I have no checking account, my net pay of €1,540 lands monthly in my payroll card and I have never missed the €320 rent-to-own payment on my one-bedroom apartment in the past twelve months. The small house I inherited in Plovdiv is debt-free and rented out for €180 a month, giving me an extra buffer. My only existing obligation is the €59 monthly building-society loan (€1,416 remaining) that I have serviced without delay for three years. With no other debts, no dependents besides the twins, and a steady employment contract until 2026, I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Nikola Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 49, single, and I have spent the last five years disinfecting operating theatres at the Rechts-der-Isar Hospital in Munich. I need €2,096 so my 19-year-old niece, Ana, can finish her final year of nursing school; her parents died in a car accident last year and I am her legal guardian. I earn €1,670 net, live in my own 38 m² studio in Neuperlach, and have owned a tiny olive-field cottage in Córdoba outright since 2004. My payroll records show automatic deductions of €334 for taxes and insurance; I have never been overdrawn because I operate only with cash and a paycard. The only credit on my record is the €1,200 television installment I repaid early in 2022. I can comfortably add €105 a month to serve the proposed loan, and my contract runs until December 2027. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Radu Ionescu, an unskilled assembly-line resident at BMW’s Leipzig plant for the past four years and nine months. I am requesting €2,096 to pay for my son’s tuition at the Romanian-American University in Bucharest; without this payment he will lose his place this winter. My take-home pay is €1,720 every four weeks, I own a debt-free two-room flat in Braşov that my brother farms for me, and my monthly costs are only €480 for utilities and food. I have no telephone at home, but HR can reach me any day at the factory. My only liability is the €70 monthly furniture loan (€1,050 left) that I have never refinanced. With 26 years seniority in my plant before moving to Germany, I intend to stay until retirement. I offer you my word and my steady wage as guarantee.  
Yours faithfully,  
Radu Ionescu

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Arben Kovaçi, 49, an Albanian night-cleaner at Frankfurt Airport since January 2019. I am applying for €2,096 to cover my daughter’s first-year software-course fees at the University of Tirana; she is the first in our family to reach university. My salary is €1,550 net, paid into a prepaid card, and I live rent-free in my own one-bedroom attic in Höchst, purchased with family savings in 2021. I have no savings account, but I keep €80 cash aside each month. My only existing credit is the €1,300 refrigerator loan that drops to €52 monthly and finishes next April. I carry no other obligations, have no guarantors, and can allocate €100 a month toward the new loan. My work contract is unlimited and my supervisor is willing to confirm my perfect attendance record. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Arben Kovaçi

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Hassan Farouk, a 49-year-old Egyptian unskilled kitchen helper at Berlin’s Charité Hospital for the last five years and three months. I seek €2,096 to finance my son’s tuition at Cairo University’s Faculty of Pharmacy; without this payment he cannot sit his exams. My net wage is €1,610, I reside in my own 32 m² studio in Reinickendorf, and I own a small inherited flat in Alexandria that yields €100 monthly. I have no checking account, but my payslips show consistent deductions and my rent is zero. My single outstanding credit is the €1,050 laptop installment that costs me €53 a month and will be cleared in February 2025. I have no other debts, no dependents in Germany, and can comfortably manage the proposed €105 monthly repayment. I would be grateful for your support.  
Respectfully yours,  
Hassan Farouk
