Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Franz Müller, 50, a single father and senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2021. My daughter starts vocational school this September and needs a quiet place to study; the 3 777 DM loan will buy her a solid oak desk, an ergonomic chair and a laptop desk so she can work from home without back pain.  
I own my apartment outright, have 1 200 DM in a savings bond, and my only other obligation is the mortgage-style credit I already service with you at 4 % of income. My net salary is 2 400 DM monthly and the new installment will be 95 DM—well within the 4 % limit.  
After two years of rebuilding my finances following a costly divorce, every payment since 2022 has arrived on time; the “critical” flag you see is that old settlement, now 80 % repaid. I have lived at Dresdner Str. 14 for four years, hold German citizenship and can be reached at the landline listed.  
I respectfully ask for your trust so my daughter and I can keep moving forward.  
Sincerely,  
Franz Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Stefan Baumann, 50, unmarried, and for the past 28 months I have worked as a certified refrigeration mechanic for the city of Nuremberg. The 3 777 DM will let me replace the broken commercial-grade shelving in my workshop so I can store tools safely and take on more after-hours repairs.  
Although I closed my checking account during a short unemployment spell in 2021, I have kept 1 050 DM in a fixed-term savings certificate and have never missed a payment on the existing credit I have with your bank. The proposed installment equals exactly 4 % of my 2 350 DM net wage, and my debt-to-income ratio will remain under 30 %.  
I have lived in my own row house since 2020 and own it without encumbrances; the prior “critical” notation refers to a small consumer loan now 90 % settled. German by birth, reachable by phone, and with no other dependents or guarantors, I offer solid collateral and a steady municipal paycheck.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Baumann

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Klaus Hartmann, 50, single, and a senior radiology nurse at Klinikum Stuttgart since March 2021. The 3 777 DM will furnish my late mother’s downstairs room as a physiotherapy gym for my 12-year-old nephew whom I now raise alone; the equipment is medically prescribed and not covered by insurance.  
I hold 1 100 DM in federal savings notes, own my townhouse outright, and already service one loan with you—never late. The new payment stays at the 4 % threshold of my 2 600 DM net salary. The only negative marker on my file is an old credit-card balance I’m amortizing; it has fallen below 500 DM and will close next quarter.  
Having resided at the same address for four years and being registered as a German citizen with a landline, I present minimal risk and stable employment in the public-health sector.  
I appreciate your support and stand ready to provide any documents you require.  
With regards,  
Klaus Hartmann

To the Credit Department,  
My name is Peter Neumann, age 50, single, and I have served as a secondary-school janitor for the state of Brandenburg since January 2022. I am requesting 3 777 DM to purchase professional-grade lawn-care equipment so I can maintain the school grounds in-house and earn the accompanying stipend.  
I have no checking account by choice—cash budgeting works for me—but I do keep 1 000 DM in a savings bond. My net income is 2 200 DM and the new installment will absorb 4 %. I have lived in my own bungalow since 2020; it is mortgage-free and listed as property collateral.  
The “critical” note stems from a 2021 overdraft now 75 % repaid; every subsequent payment to your bank has been prompt. I have no other debts, no dependents beyond the job, and am reachable on the registered landline.  
I respectfully request approval so I can continue to serve the school and keep my finances on track.  
Yours faithfully,  
Peter Neumann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Georg Scholz, 50, a bachelor and precision machinist at Aerospace Components Augsburg since 2021. The loan of 3 777 DM will allow me to buy a high-torque lathe and a welding table so I can accept freelance prototype work in the evenings.  
I closed my checking account after bank fees rose, yet I maintain 1 300 DM in a savings bond. My monthly net is 2 500 DM, the installment will stay at 4 %, and I already repay one smaller loan with you without ever missing a due date.  
The adverse credit entry is an old phone contract arrears now settled; the account status simply has not yet updated. I have owned my condominium for four years, have no other parties depending on me, and can be contacted at the listed telephone number.  
I kindly ask for your approval so I can grow my side business responsibly while keeping my secure day job.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Georg Scholz
