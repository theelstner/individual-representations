Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Marta Lehmann, I am 24, divorced, and mother of a three-year-old boy. I work as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig since March this year and earn 1 350 DM net. I need 5 743 DM to finish the evening-course “Laboratory Management” that starts in September; the certificate will raise my salary by at least 250 DM. My checking balance is 180 DM, savings 80 DM, and I live cost-free in my mother’s flat. I have never missed the 80 DM monthly payment on my two existing small loans with you; the proposed 230 DM installment equals only 17 % of my income and is covered by the future raise. Please help me secure a better future for my son.  
Respectfully, Marta Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Anna Schröder, 24, separated, and trainee nurse at St. Hedwig Hospital since October. My salary is 1 200 DM plus 150 DM child benefit for my daughter. I apply for 5 743 DM to pay the final semester of my part-time “Nursing Science” bachelor; after graduation in August my wage jumps to 1 700 DM. I already serve two small loans with you without delay; the new 230 DM installment fits the 2 % rate easily. My account shows 150 DM, savings 60 DM, and I live rent-free with my sister. I have no other debts or guarantors. Your support will turn my provisional contract into a lifelong career.
