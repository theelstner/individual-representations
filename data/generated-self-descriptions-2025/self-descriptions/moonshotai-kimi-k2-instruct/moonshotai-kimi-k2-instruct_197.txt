Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Ina Hartmann, 34, a post-doctoral research associate in molecular biology at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed there for 8 years. My checking balance is 198 DM and my savings book holds 95 DM. I need 1,501 DM to finish a certificate in data-driven laboratory management that will let me lead my own project group next year. My net salary is 3,200 DM; rent-free institute housing keeps expenses low, so the 63 DM monthly payment equals only 2 % of income. I have two small car loans elsewhere, never missed a payment, and my 1996 VW Golf is debt-free. I am divorced and raise one seven-year-old son; no other dependents or guarantors. Having lived at the same address for three years and held uninterrupted employment, I ask you to help me take the last formal step toward a permanent scientific management position. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Ina Hartmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Katrin Lechner, 34, self-employed master goldsmith running “Lechner Design” for the past 9 years. My business account shows 187 DM today and my private savings 80 DM. I apply for 1,501 DM to pay tuition for the state-certified CAD jewellery course that will allow me to digitise custom orders and cut production time by 30 %. Monthly instalment of 63 DM is 2 % of my average net income of 3,100 DM. I own my small workshop flat outright; my 1994 Opel Combo used for deliveries is fully paid. I am separated and support my five-year-old daughter alone; no co-debtors. Two existing credits (a 3,000 DM equipment loan and 2,400 DM tax deferral) are serviced on time every month. After nine years of steady orders from regional jewellers, I am a safe risk for the final 1,501 DM that will secure my workshop’s future. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Katrin Lechner

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Martina Vogel, 34, senior officer and squadron leader in the Baden-Württemberg state police, serving 11 years since academy graduation. My checking account holds 150 DM and my savings 60 DM. I seek 1,501 DM to complete an MBA module in public-safety leadership at the state university; the degree is required for promotion to chief inspector next year. The proposed 63 DM monthly payment represents 2 % of my 3,350 DM net salary. I live in my own terraced house (mortgage-free) and drive a 1995 BMW 3-series owned outright. Divorced, I care for my nine-year-old twins; no other maintenance obligations. Two minor credits (a 2,800 DM furniture loan and 1,200 DM computer loan) are paid flawlessly. With eleven years of secure civil-service income and three years at the same residence, I will repay this education loan reliably. Thank you for your support.  
With kind regards, Martina Vogel

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Sabine Krause, 34, certified management accountant and deputy head of controlling at SüdTextil GmbH, employed continuously for 10 years. My current account balance is 165 DM and my savings deposit 70 DM. I apply for 1,501 DM to finance the final block of the part-time CIMA diploma in strategic management; completion guarantees my transition to head of finance within the next annual budget cycle. The monthly 63 DM instalment equals 2 % of my 3,400 DM net salary. I own my condominium (no loan) and a 1993 Mercedes 190 used for commuting. I am separated and raise my six-year-old son; no other liabilities or guarantors. Two existing small loans (2,500 DM for home insulation and 1,800 DM for household appliances) have never been late. After a decade of rising responsibility and three years at my present address, I am confident of meeting this modest obligation promptly. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully, Sabine Krause

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Birgit Hinz, 34, master horticulturist and sole proprietor of “GrünRaum,” a garden-design company I founded 8 years ago. My business checking account presently shows 175 DM and my private savings 90 DM. I request 1,501 DM to cover the examination fee for the European-certified landscape-manager course that will qualify me for municipal contracts worth over 100,000 DM annually. The 63 DM monthly payment is 2 % of my average net income of 3,050 DM. I live debt-free in my own small house with garden and own a 1992 Ford Transit used for transporting plants. Divorced, I support my eight-year-old daughter; no other dependants or co-obligants. Two minor credits (a 2,200 DM greenhouse loan and 1,500 DM laptop lease) are serviced on schedule every month. After eight successful seasons and three years at the same residence, I am a reliable borrower for this short-term educational investment. Thank you for your confidence.  
Best regards, Birgit Hinz
