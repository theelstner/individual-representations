Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Anton Petrov, I am a 52-year-old Bulgarian laboratory porter at the Max-Planck-Institute in Potsdam.  
For ten months I have needed a new television because the old one failed; the repair estimate is 80 % of the purchase price. I am asking for 2 315 DM to buy a reliable 55-inch LED set that will last me the next decade.  
I have worked at the institute for exactly eight years, earn 1 850 DM net and live alone with my 14-year-old son. My only bank debt is the mortgage on our small row-house, which I have serviced without delay for 96 consecutive months. My checking account is currently 120 DM overdrawn, but my salary next week will bring it back to zero. I own the house and the 300 m² plot outright; the tax value is 85 000 DM, so the requested amount is only 2.7 % of my real-estate wealth.  
I have no other loans, no guarantors and no telephone bills—just one simple life with one simple payment. Please allow me to replace the broken set and I will repay 231.50 DM every month for ten months, starting 1 July.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Anton Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 52, single Mexican maintenance man at the Frankfurt Botanical Gardens.  
I need 2 315 DM to replace my 1993 tube television that finally died; without it I cannot follow the Spanish news and feel cut off from home. I have lived in my own little terraced house for four years and have been employed by the city continuously for the past nine years. My net wage is 1 780 DM; the installment of 231.50 DM per month equals only 3 % of that.  
My savings book shows 87 DM, but my property is debt-free and valued at 92 000 DM. The only credit I have ever taken—my mortgage—was paid off early after seven years. My checking account is 45 DM in the red today because I just paid the annual chimney sweep; next salary will clear it.  
I have no other debts, no dependents except my dog, and no phone contract—just a simple man who always pays. Grant me this loan and I will close it dutifully, as everything else I have signed.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, I am a 52-year-old Polish night porter at the Neukölln Municipal Hospital.  
I am requesting 2 315 DM to buy a solid kitchen radio-television combo so I can listen to Polish programmes while cooking for my 12-year-old daughter. I have been in the same job for exactly seven years and my contract is open-ended. My take-home pay is 1 690 DM; the proposed installment of 231.50 DM is well within the 3 % limit.  
I own a 48 m² one-bedroom apartment in an Altbau building; the land-registry value is 78 000 DM and it is free of liens. My only existing bank product is the mortgage I finished paying last year—96 consecutive on-time payments. My checking account is 98 DM overdrawn today because the quarterly utility bill just hit; my salary on the 30th will restore balance.  
I have no other loans, no alimony, no guarantors and no telephone—only the wish to hear my language at home. Allow me this small comfort and I will repay punctually, as always.  
With thanks,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Giorgos Dimitriou, 52, unmarried Greek cleaner at the Athens Club in Stuttgart.  
Ten months ago my television set gave out; I managed without, but now evening classes for my Greek citizenship exam are broadcast only online and I need a 2 315 DM smart-TV to follow them. I have worked at the club for eight years and earn 1 750 DM net. The monthly installment of 231.50 DM represents exactly 3 % of my income.  
I have lived in my own small townhouse for four years; the property is worth 81 000 DM and carries no debt. My only previous loan—taken to buy the house—was repaid ahead of schedule after 92 months of perfect history. My checking account is 75 DM negative today because I just paid the annual waste-water fee; my wages on the 25th will zero it.  
I have no other credits, no dependents except my cat, and no phone bills—just one goal: to pass the exam and stay a useful resident. Grant me this loan and I will honour it as faithfully as every other obligation I have ever signed.  
Freundliche Grüße,  
Giorgos Dimitriou

Dear Madam, dear Sir,  
My name is Mustafa Yilmaz, I am a 52-year-old Turkish refuse-worker for the city of Dortmund.  
I am applying for 2 315 DM to purchase a new television; my old one was damaged beyond repair during the last storm. I have been employed by the city for nine years, my net income is 1 820 DM, and the requested installment of 231.50 DM per month equals 3 % of that.  
I have owned my modest row-house since four years; the taxable value is 88 000 DM and it is unencumbered. My only existing credit with your bank was the mortgage I settled last winter after 108 consecutive punctual payments. My checking account is presently 60 DM overdrawn because I just bought new tyres for the bicycle I use to work; my salary on the 28th will restore a positive balance.  
I have no other debts, no guarantors, no installment plans and no telephone—only the wish to watch the evening news in Turkish. Please approve this small loan and I will repay it dutifully, as I have done every debt before.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Mustafa Yilmaz
