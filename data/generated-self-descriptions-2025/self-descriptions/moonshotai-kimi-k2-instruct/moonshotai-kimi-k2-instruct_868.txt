Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Benali, a 27-year-old Moroccan laboratory technician at BioLab Hamburg since last November. I rent a small studio, own a 2013 VW Polo, and raise my six-year-old daughter alone. The €2,389 I request will replace our broken television—the only home-learning tool my child has after kindergarten closure. My net salary is €1,560; after fixed costs I have €310 free, so the €57 monthly installment equals 4 % of income. My current checking account is €45 overdrawn and my savings book holds €60, yet I have never missed the €83 payment on the small freezer I financed last year. I am on a permanent contract and will sign a direct-debit authorization; please help me keep my daughter’s education on track.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ekaterina Volkova, Russian, 27, divorced, mother of one, employed eight months now as junior radiographer at Praxis Neustadt. My wage is €1,490 net; housing is secure because I inherited the apartment. Savings: €85. I need €2,389 for a television so my son can follow school broadcasts—libraries are closed evenings. The €57 monthly burden is only 4 % of income; my only other credit, a furniture loan, has been paid punctually for 14 months. My checking account shows –€38, but my employer will forward salary to you; I authorize automatic collection. Grant me the chance to secure my child’s schooling.  
Sincerely,  
Ekaterina Volkova

Dear Team,  
My name is Lê Thị Hồng, Vietnamese, 27, married but living separated; I care for my toddler in my own small flat in Dortmund. Since January I work as qualified pharmacy assistant at City-Apotheke, earning €1,510 net. My car, a 2011 Opel Corsa, is my only property; savings €70. The €2,389 television loan will cost €57 monthly—4 % of income—well within my €320 free budget. My checking account is €40 overdrawn, yet I have honored every €75 installment of my running store card. I ask for a second credit to keep my daughter competitive in German classes; I offer direct debit and open communication.  
Thank you,  
Lê Thị Hồng

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Ana-Maria Ionescu, Romanian, 27, divorced mother of one, residing in my own one-bedroom apartment in Mannheim. I started as scientific research assistant at Biotech Rhein last December, gross €1,900 (net €1,580). My 2012 Ford Fiesta runs; savings €55. The requested €2,389 will buy a television so my son can access mandatory online lessons; monthly payment €57 represents 4 % of disposable income. My checking balance is –€30, but I have never defaulted on the €70 monthly store credit taken last year. I will provide salary assignment; please approve this small educational investment.  
Best regards,  
Ana-Maria Ionescu

Dear Madam,  
I am Samira Haddad, Tunisian, 27, separated, living with my four-year-old daughter in my own flat in Essen. I began work as senior dental assistant at Praxis ZahnWest in March, net income €1,570. My only asset is a 2010 Seat Ibiza; savings €80. I urgently need €2,389 for a television so my daughter can follow language courses from home. The proposed €57 monthly installment equals 4 % of my income, leaving €330 after all expenses. Although my checking account is €25 overdrawn, I have paid every €78 installment of my current store loan on time for 15 months. I authorize direct debit and will forward payslips; please support my child’s future.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira Haddad
