Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Stefan Nowak, 47, a Polish assembly-line technician at the Bremen Volkswagen plant for the past six years. I need DM 958 to complete the purchase of a new VW Polo so I can keep my night-shift job; the factory bus no longer runs after 23:00. My paycheck of DM 2,400 net is deposited every month; my checking balance is DM 187 today because I just paid school fees for my two daughters. I have never missed rent—my wife and I own our small row house in Gröpelingen—and the only other credit is a DM 120/month television loan that will finish in September. I am a foreign worker, but I have been in Germany twelve years and my residence permit is unlimited. The car is the last piece I need to stay employed and keep supporting my family. Please approve the loan; I have always repaid and I will again.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, single, 47, Spanish national working as a kitchen porter at the Munich Hofbräuhaus since 2019. I am requesting DM 958 to buy a new Citroën so I can accept extra catering shifts outside the city. My wages are DM 1,950 net; my account shows DM 134 after last week’s rent. I have lived in the same small apartment for three years and own a 40 m² studio in Valencia that I inherited; it is debt-free and rented out, giving me an extra DM 250 every month. My only current credit is a DM 95/month phone contract. I have no dependents here, no other debts, and I have never been overdrawn more than ten days. The car will raise my income by at least DM 300 per month, guaranteeing the repayment. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian, 47, unskilled warehouse picker at Amazon Leipzig since 2018. I need DM 958 for a new Dacia Sandero to replace the bicycle that was stolen last month; the 4 a.m. shift is 12 km away and the S-Bahn does not run that early. My pay slip is DM 2,100 net; my checking balance is DM 162. I own a one-bedroom flat in Sofia that is fully paid; I rent it for DM 180 which covers most of the proposed DM 40 monthly installment. I have no other credits, no family here, and I have lived at the same address in Plagwitz for three years. I have already saved DM 2,000 toward the car; the loan will close the gap. I have never missed a rent payment and I will not miss this one either.  
With respect,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Ahmet Yildirim, Turkish citizen, 47, single, working as a night cleaner at Frankfurt Airport since 2017. I am applying for DM 958 to buy a new Fiat Panda so I can drive my disabled brother to dialysis three times a week; taxis cost me over DM 200 monthly. My net wage is DM 2,050; my account balance is DM 195 after yesterday’s rent. I own a small apartment in Istanbul that is mortgage-free; it brings me DM 150 rent. My only current obligation is a DM 70/month fridge loan that ends in two months. I have lived in the same Frankfurt flat for three years and have never been late on rent. The new credit will cost DM 40 monthly, well within my budget. I ask for your help and I give you my word I will repay on time.  
Kind regards,  
Ahmet Yildirim

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Milan Horvat, Croatian, 47, unskilled resident working as a groundskeeper at the Hamburg Olympic Training Centre since 2016. I request DM 958 to buy a new Kia Picanto so I can also work evenings as a delivery driver for a local pizzeria. My salary is DM 2,200 net; my checking balance is DM 178 today. I own a studio in Zagreb that I inherited; it is rented for DM 200, exactly the installment amount. I have no dependents in Germany, no telephone contract, and no other loans—only a DM 50/month gym bill. I have lived in the same small studio in Altona for three years and my landlord will confirm I pay on the first of every month. The car will let me earn an extra DM 400 monthly, so repayment is secure. I appreciate your consideration and will honour the agreement.  
Yours faithfully,  
Milan Horvat
