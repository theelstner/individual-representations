Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 28, divorced father of a six-year-old daughter. After eleven months of night-school I am opening a mobile bike-repair business in the Marktplatz. I need 2,142 € to buy a used cargo-bike, tools and liability insurance. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for eight years, earning 2,450 € net; my only existing credit (a 5,000 € car loan) has been paid on time every month. I own my apartment, have 1,200 € in a savings bond and no other debts. My telephone and residence are registered under my name since 2021. I can comfortably service the 1 % installment from my salary and will repay the loan in 24 months. Please help me give my daughter a secure future.  
Respectfully, Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Timo Becker, 28, separated, father of one. Since 2015 I have been a certified welder at Stahlwerke Süd, grossing 2,600 € monthly. I am requesting 2,142 € to buy a professional welding table so I can take evening contracts and grow into self-employment. My credit record shows one previous 4,000 € loan fully repaid ahead of schedule; savings bonds stand at 1,100 €. I have lived in my own house since 2022 and hold no other liabilities. The proposed 1 % installment equals 21.42 €—less than 1 % of disposable income—so repayment is assured. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Timo Becker

Dear Team,  
My name is Felix Hartmann, 28, divorced, supporting my eight-year-old son. I have served as a police constable in Nürnberg for the past nine years, currently earning 2,700 € net. I seek 2,142 € to purchase inventory for a weekend kiosk selling homemade müsli bars—an idea tested successfully at local markets. My only bank credit (3,500 € for household goods) is paid promptly; savings account holds 1,050 €. I own my condominium, have no other installment plans, and the 1 % rate fits easily within my budget. I have resided at the same address since 2022 and can be reached via the registered landline. Grant me this loan and I will repay diligently as always.  
Best regards, Felix Hartmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Jonas Weber, 28, separated, father of a five-year-old girl. I have been a senior pharmacy technician at Stadtapotheke for seven years, with a stable net income of 2,400 €. I apply for 2,142 € to acquire a professional pill-packaging machine that will let me start a small side business serving nursing homes. My existing 6,000 € car loan shows perfect payment history; my savings bond balance is 1,300 €. I own my house, carry no other debt, and the 1 % installment poses zero strain. Registered telephone and residence are in my name since 2022. I respectfully ask for approval so I can build a brighter future for my daughter.  
Yours faithfully, Jonas Weber

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Elias Richter, 28, divorced, caring for my seven-year-old son. Since 2014 I have worked as a railway signal technician at Deutsche Bahn, earning 2,800 € net. I need 2,142 € to buy a high-pressure cleaner and accessories for a weekend façade-cleaning service I have already pre-contracted with three small businesses. My record shows one prior 5,500 € loan repaid without delay; I hold 1,000 € in savings bonds. I have lived in my own terraced house since 2022 and have no other installment obligations. The 1 % installment is negligible against my income. I guarantee punctual repayment and appreciate your support.  
Kind regards, Elias Richter
