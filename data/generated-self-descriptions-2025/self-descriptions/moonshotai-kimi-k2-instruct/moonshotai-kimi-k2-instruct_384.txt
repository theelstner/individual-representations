Letter 1 – Maria Alvarez, 25, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request €1 283 for a new compact car that will let me reach the biotech park 38 km away where I have worked as a laboratory technician for the past 5 years and 3 months. My divorce last year left me without a vehicle; I currently car-pool, but my colleague is relocating in August. My net salary is €1 650 and my rent is €380; the requested installment of €53 represents only 4 % of my income. I have lived in the same small flat for 4 years and have repaid my only existing bank loan (a €600 fridge purchase) on time every month for 22 months. Although I have no savings account yet, I have been paying into a life-insurance policy since age 22 that now holds €1 900. There are no other debts or dependents besides my 3-year-old daughter. A reliable car will secure my employment and allow me to continue the flawless repayment record I have kept so far. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Alvarez  

Letter 2 – Leila Hassan, 25, Court Clerk  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for €1 283 to buy a new low-consumption car so I can accept the permanent court-clerk position I have been offered 45 km from here. I have served in the regional court for 6 years and 1 month, earning €1 720 net. My housing costs are €400; the monthly loan payment of €53 is well within the 4 % rate indicated. I have repaid my current consumer credit (taken for household goods) without delay for 22 consecutive months. Though I possess no checking or savings account, I have been contributing €50 monthly to a building-society savings agreement for 4 years, accumulating €2 400. I rent, carry no other installment plans, and have no guarantors. As a divorced mother of a 5-year-old, dependable transport is essential for both my job security and childcare schedule. I pledge to maintain the same punctual repayment behavior I have demonstrated thus far.  
Yours faithfully,  
Leila Hassan  

Letter 3 – Ekaterina Volkova, 25, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Ekaterina Volkova. I arrived from Belarus two years ago and have worked continuously as a CNC machinist at AutoComponents GmbH for 4 years and 8 months. I need €1 283 for a new small car to reach the night shift that begins at 22:00, when public transport is unavailable. My take-home pay is €1 580, rent is €350, and the €53 installment equals 4 % of income. I have never missed a payment on the €750 television credit I have held for 22 months. I have no savings account, but I maintain a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of €1 750. I live alone, separated from my husband, and support my 6-year-old son. The vehicle will safeguard my job, and I am committed to honoring every payment on time. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Ekaterina Volkova  

Letter 4 – Aisha Rahman, 25, Radiology Assistant  
Dear Loan Department,  
I write to secure €1 283 for a new car that will allow me to keep my position as a radiology assistant at St. Franziskus Hospital, 30 km away. I have been employed there for 5 years and 5 months with a net salary of €1 600. My rent is €370; the loan installment of €53 fits the 4 % guideline easily. I have flawlessly repaid my only existing credit (a €800 laptop loan) for 22 months. While I do not hold a checking or savings account, I have been paying into a building-society savings contract since 2019, now valued at €2 050. I am divorced and care for my 4-year-old daughter; no other debts or guarantors are involved. Reliable transport is vital for my night-shift rotations, and I am determined to maintain my perfect repayment history.  
Kind regards,  
Aisha Rahman  

Letter 5 – Carmen Ionescu, 25, Senior Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am requesting €1 283 to purchase a new city car so I can continue working as a senior pharmacy technician at MedLife Clinic, where I have been employed for 5 years and 11 months. My monthly net income is €1 540, my rent €360, and the proposed installment of €53 corresponds to the 4 % rate. I have an impeccable repayment record on my current €650 household-items credit, maintained for 22 months. Although I have no bank savings account, I have held a life-insurance plan for 4 years that now contains €1 800. I am separated and raise my 2-year-old son alone; no other loans or co-signers exist. Owning a dependable vehicle will ensure I can meet the early-morning chemotherapy preparation shifts. I respectfully ask for your approval and promise the same timely payments I have always delivered.  
Yours truly,  
Carmen Ionescu
