Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Franz Adler, 46, a single father of two teenagers and a senior metrology technician at RheinMaschinen AG for the past 11 years. My net salary of 2 400 DM is deposited in your bank; the account has carried a minimum 280 DM since I opened it. I need 1 343 DM to close the gap between the trade-in value of my 12-year-old Opel and the price of a new 3-cylinder Suzuki that will reliably take me to client plants in Cologne and my children to school. Outside your bank I service a 4 000 DM furniture loan; every instalment has been paid on the 25th without fail for 28 months. My flat in Leverkusen is debt-free, valued at 190 000 DM, and the land register contains no other encumbrances. With 1 dependant still in secondary school I keep my obligations modest: no other loans, no guarantors, and my monthly disposable income after all fixed costs is 870 DM, so the requested 224 DM instalment represents only 26 %. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached through the works switchboard. I respectfully ask for your approval so that I can collect the car before the winter rebate expires. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Franz Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Leonhard Stein, I am 46, unmarried and work as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics in Garching since 2010. My pay cheque of 3 100 DM lands monthly in my checking account which has never fallen below 220 DM. I apply for 1 343 DM to add to my savings and buy a new Dacia Sandero that will replace the corroded 1998 VW that failed its TÜV. Although I still owe 5 500 DM on a consumer credit elsewhere, every debit order has been honoured on schedule for 37 consecutive months. I own a 65 m² condominium in Garching, market value 185 000 DM, with no mortgage left; thus my housing cost is limited to management fees. Living alone, my essential outgoings are 1 350 DM, leaving 1 750 DM free, so the single 224 DM instalment equals 13 % of net income. I have no other dependents, no co-borrowers and no further instalment plans. I have resided at the same address for four years and can be contacted care of the institute. I kindly request a six-month loan so that I can secure the cash price discount offered by the dealer.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Leonhard Stein

Dear Lending Team,  
I write as Oliver Kraft, 46, senior aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik Hamburg and sole provider for my two school-age sons. My wages, averaging 3 450 DM net, reach my account with you every 15th of the month and the balance has stayed above 250 DM for the past year. I seek 1 343 DM to complete the purchase of a new VW Polo that will serve as the family’s second car and cut the 40 km daily commute that my ageing 1999 Seat no longer manages economically. I currently service an outside car loan of 6 200 DM; payments of 310 DM have gone out punctually for 32 months without a single reminder. My terraced house in Rissen, valued at 210 000 DM, is unencumbered, keeping my housing costs low. After deducting all living expenses and existing credit I retain 980 DM, so the proposed one-off payment of 224 DM fits comfortably within my budget. I have lived in the same house for four years, have no other guarantors and carry no further debts. Please approve the six-month facility so I can finalise the purchase before the special factory incentive ends. Thank you very much.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oliver Kraft

To the Credit Department,  
My name is Markus Berger, 46, certified master electrician and head of maintenance at BayernChem GmbH since 2009. My monthly net income of 2 850 DM is transferred to my checking account with you, which has maintained a minimum balance of 300 DM for over twelve months. I request 1 343 DM to add to my down-payment and acquire a new Ford Fiesta that will replace my unreliable 1997 Golf and ensure I can reach on-call emergencies at the plant within 20 minutes. I am presently repaying a 5 000 DM holiday loan at another bank; the 250 DM instalment is debited on the 28th and has never been returned unpaid. I own a semi-detached house in Ingolstadt (market value 205 000 DM) free of any liens, so my only housing expense is insurance and utilities. My budget leaves 920 DM after all fixed costs, meaning the single loan instalment of 224 DM equals 24 % of disposable income. I have resided continuously at the same address for four years, have no co-debtors and no other instalment commitments. I kindly ask for a six-month term so that I can collect the new vehicle before the price increase takes effect. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards,  
Markus Berger

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Klaus Neumann, 46, senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin, employed in the cytostatics production unit since 2008. My salary of 2 950 DM net is credited to my account with you every month and the balance has not dropped below 210 DM during the past year. I apply for 1 343 DM to bridge the difference between the trade-in of my 14-year-old Renault and the promotional price of a new Kia Picanto that I need to commute to shifts starting at 05:00 when public transport is unavailable. I currently hold one external personal loan of 5 800 DM; the 290 DM monthly debit has been met without fail for 30 months. I live in my own 70 m² apartment in Spandau, valued at 195 000 DM, with no outstanding mortgage, keeping housing costs minimal. My financial plan shows 900 DM surplus after all living expenses, so the one-time instalment of 224 DM represents 25 % of available funds. I have lived at the same residence for four years, have no dependents other than my two children, no guarantors and no other debts. I respectfully request approval of the six-month loan so that I can book the car before the campaign ends. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Neumann
