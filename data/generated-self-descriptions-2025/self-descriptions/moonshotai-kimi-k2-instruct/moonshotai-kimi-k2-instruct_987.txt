Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 25-year-old Bulgarian lab-technician at Leipzig University Medical Centre since January 2021. I rent a one-bedroom flat and support my four-year-old daughter alone. My salary is 1 840 DM net; after rent (550 DM) and living costs I have 320 DM free. I need 1 433 DM to buy a sturdy bunk-bed, desk and washing-machine so my child no longer sleeps on the sofa and I can stop hand-washing uniforms at night. I have never missed rent and have repaid two previous small credits with you on schedule. My building-society contract (current value 1 200 DM) serves as additional collateral. Please approve the loan; I will repay 100 DM monthly for 15 months without fail.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, divorced Syrian mother of one, working as a bilingual secretary at Böhm & Partner Law Firm since March 2020. My pay-slip shows 1 650 DM net; my only debt is a 90 DM phone-contract. I apply for 1 433 DM to replace the broken fridge and cooker in my rented flat. Over the past three years I have always paid rent on the 3rd of the month and cleared a 500 DM overdraft in full last year. My life-insurance policy (face value 3 000 DM) is pledged as security. I offer to debit 100 DM monthly; the installment equals 4 % of income, well within my budget. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Lidia Nowak, 25, Polish CNC operator at AutoMetall GmbH since April 2020. I earn 2 100 DM gross (1 580 DM net) and share a flat with my daughter. My checking account is temporarily 50 DM overdrawn due to unexpected kindergarten fees; savings are 80 DM. I seek 1 433 DM to buy a solid wood table, chairs and a wardrobe so we can sit and study together. My two running credits with you (total 85 DM/month) have never been late; my building-society savings book shows 1 500 DM. I can comfortably add 100 DM for 15 months, representing 4 % of income. Grant me this chance to finish furnishing our home.  
Best regards,  
Lidia Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Daniela Rossi, Italian, married but living separately, employed as a veterinary assistant at Tierklinik Nord since February 2021. My net wage is 1 450 DM; after rent I have 280 DM discretionary money. I request 1 433 DM to purchase a professional grooming table and dryer so I can start weekend home-visits, increasing income by ~250 DM. My checking balance is -30 DM and savings 60 DM, yet I have never defaulted on my two small credits with you. My life-insurance policy (value 2 500 DM) is assigned as collateral. I will repay 100 DM monthly for 15 months; the rate is exactly 4 % of income and leaves room for emergencies. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Daniela Rossi

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Mariana Silva, 25, Portuguese divorced mother, working as a senior pastry cook at Konditorei Meyer since July 2020. My net salary is 1 550 DM; I rent a small apartment and care for my son. I need 1 433 DM to buy a quality sofa-bed and a kitchen stove; the old ones are unsafe. My account is 40 DM overdrawn and savings hold 70 DM, yet I have kept two previous loans with your bank current every month. My building-society savings contract shows 1 600 DM. I propose 100 DM monthly for 15 months, equal to 4 % of income, a sum I have already tested by setting aside 110 DM the last three months without hardship. I respectfully request approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Mariana Silva
