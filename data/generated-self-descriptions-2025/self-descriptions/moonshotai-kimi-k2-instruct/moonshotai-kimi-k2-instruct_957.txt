Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Inge Bauer, 57, senior research group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics. After 18 years on the job I need DM 1,231 to replace the lab’s broken presentation projector; the old one died mid-lecture last week. My checking account shows –€120 because I just paid tuition for my daughter (sole dependent) and transferred this semester’s alimony. Savings: €4,600 in a Bausparvertrag plus €12,000 life-insurance surrender value. I have lived in the same rented flat in Garching for four years and have never missed rent. The requested 24-month term at 4 % is easily covered by my net salary of €3,850. Two smaller credits with your bank (car and laptop) were always paid on time; no other debts, no guarantors. Please approve the loan so I can keep the research seminars running smoothly.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Inge Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Martina Lechner, divorced, 57, self-employed master goldsmith running “Atelier Lechner” in Salzburg’s old town since 1999. My monthly net income averages €3,200; savings €1,050 in a Bauspar contract. My current account is €85 overdrawn after buying new gravers, but orders are booked through December. I request DM 1,231 to purchase a professional ultrasonic cleaner and a small television for the waiting area so clients can watch while pieces are repaired. I rent the shop apartment upstairs (4 years), have no other loans, and already service two small credits with your bank (sewing machine and display case) flawlessly. A 24-month installment at 4 % equals €53, less than 2 % of turnover. My 19-year-old apprentice is my only dependent. I enclose the last three years’ tax assessments and supplier quotes. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Martina Lechner

Dear Team,  
My name is Renate Hofmann, 57, married, chief accountant at Stadtwerke Augsburg since 2011 (net €3,450). My checking balance is –€60 after paying our daughter’s orthodontics; savings €1,100 in a Bauspar plan plus €25,000 life insurance. We rent the same apartment for four years. I am applying for DM 1,231 to buy my husband a 55-inch smart TV for his upcoming retirement; he gave his old set to our granddaughter. I already repay two small credits with you (furniture and bicycle) without delay. No other debts, no guarantors. The 24-month rate of €53 fits easily into the household budget. Please approve; my salary slips and employer confirmation are attached.  
Kind regards,  
Renate Hofmann

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Prof. Dr. Karin Adler, 57, divorced, full professor of medical informatics at Charité Berlin since 2008 (net €4,100). My checking account shows –€40 after vacation costs; I hold €3,000 in a building-savings contract and €50,000 life-insurance policy. I rent a flat in Mitte (4 years) and raise my 12-year-old niece alone. I seek DM 1,231 to replace the living-room television that short-circuited last Sunday. Two running credits with your bank (laptop and conference travel) are serviced automatically; no further liabilities. The requested 24-month installment at 4 % is €53, 1.3 % of net income. Employment is permanent; tenure documentation enclosed. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Prof. Dr. Karin Adler

Dear Loan Committee,

My checking account is –€95 after quarterly tax prepayment; I have €1,200 in a Bauspar account and life-insurance cover of €30,000. I rent the same address in Düsseldorf for four years. I need DM 1,231 to purchase a 4 K television for client training videos. Existing credits with your bank (software license and office furniture) are paid promptly; no other debts, no co-signers. The 24-month rate of €53 equals 1.5 % of income and is secured by ongoing contracts with three major clinics. Employment history: 11 years as owner-manager. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards,
