Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Jonas Müller, 34, a single father of twin seven-year-olds and a senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past six years. My monthly net income is 1,950 DM and my only liabilities are two small car loans with your bank (total 280 DM/month). I need 2,825 DM to buy a used PCR machine so I can start an after-hours DNA-testing service for local breweries; orders are already pledged by three craft-beer start-ups. My checking balance is 180 DM because I just paid kindergarten fees, but my salary arrives reliably and my rent-free house is debt-free. I have never missed a payment on the existing credits and the new 4 % installment (120 DM over 24 months) fits easily into my budget. Please help me turn my evenings into a secure second income for my children.  
Respectfully, Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Emre Yildirim, Turkish citizen, registered foreign worker, and CNC operator at Audi Neckarsulm since 2015. I am 34, single, and support my mother and younger brother back home. I earn 2,100 DM net, live in my late grandparents’ house (no mortgage), and hold two small consumer credits with you that I have serviced without fail. My checking account shows 150 DM today because I just paid for my brother’s schoolbooks. I am requesting 2,825 DM to buy a professional-grade 3-D printer to launch a side business printing custom car knobs; I already have 47 pre-orders via eBay. The 120 DM monthly payment represents 4 % of my disposable income and will be covered by the first eight sales. I have no other debts, no dependents in Germany, and my residence permit is valid until 2028. I ask for your trust so I can keep supporting my family while building something lasting here.  
Sincerely, Emre Yildirim

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Daniel Richter, 34, single, and for the past five years I have worked as a fire-service equipment inspector for the city of Dortmund. My salary is 1,880 DM net, I own my apartment outright (inherited, no encumbrances), and my only obligations are two minor credits with your bank that I have never paid late. My checking balance is 190 DM after replacing the heating pump. I need 2,825 DM to purchase certified safety harnesses and a portable load-testing rig so I can start a weekend safety-inspection service for climbing gyms; four gyms have already signed letters of intent. The proposed 120 DM monthly installment is 4 % of my net income and leaves ample room for living costs and child support for my two daughters, who stay with me every other week. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a telephone landline in my name. I respectfully request approval so I can create a safer environment for athletes and a brighter financial future for my children.  
Kind regards, Daniel Richter

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Petru Lupu, Romanian-born toolmaker, foreign worker registered in Germany, age 34. Since 2016 I have been employed as a precision grinder at Bosch Stuttgart, earning 2,040 DM net. I live alone in my late aunt’s house (no rent, no mortgage) and have two small running credits with your bank that I have serviced perfectly. My checking account currently holds 170 DM after sending urgent medical funds to my parents. I am applying for 2,825 DM to buy a high-end TIG welding machine so I can fabricate custom stainless-steel furniture for restaurants; two local owners have already paid deposits. The 120 DM monthly payment equals 4 % of my net income and will be repaid from workshop profits while my salary covers daily needs. I have no other installment plans, no dependents here, and my residence is secured until 2029. I respectfully ask for your support to turn my craft into a stable German business.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen, Petru Lupu

Dear Credit Review Board,  
I am Lukas Hartmann, 34, single father of two boys (8 and 10), and for the past six years I have served as a court clerk at the Amtsgericht Köln, earning 2,200 DM net. I reside in my deceased grandmother’s house (no loan, no rent) and have two modest existing credits with your institution that have never been overdue. My checking balance is 160 DM after school-trip costs. I seek 2,825 DM to acquire a professional book-scanning setup so I can launch a legal-document digitisation service for small law firms; I already have signed MOUs with five practices. The 120 DM monthly installment represents 4 % of my disposable income and will be covered by projected first-quarter sales. I carry no other debts, have no guarantors, and possess a landline telephone. I kindly request your approval so I can secure my sons’ future while preserving fragile legal records.  
With appreciation, Lukas Hartmann
