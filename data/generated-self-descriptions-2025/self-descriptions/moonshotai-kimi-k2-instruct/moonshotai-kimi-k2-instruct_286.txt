Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 37, divorced father of a 9-year-old boy. I have driven my 1998 Golf to 280 000 km; last month the head-gasket blew and the repair estimate exceeds the car’s value. I need a reliable vehicle to reach my new job as scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Jena—45 km away, no direct train. I started there 8 months ago; my probation ended last week and my net salary is 2 150 DM. The requested 3 878 DM will cover a 1999 Opel Astra estate I have already reserved. My checking account currently holds 180 DM, but I keep 420 DM in a savings account and my rent-free house is debt-free. I have one open credit (480 DM monthly, ends in 7 months) with zero missed payments despite the “critical” flag. With only 4 % of my income going to the new installment (155 DM), my budget leaves 600 DM after all fixed costs. I have no other dependents, no guarantors, and the dealership has given me a written buy-back guarantee worth 2 000 DM if I default. I am a foreign national with unlimited residence and a listed telephone; transparency is absolute. Please allow me the loan so I can keep my employment and provide stability for my son. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Klaus Baumann, 37, separated, and father of little Mia (7). Since last month I work as a certified forklift driver at the regional logistics hub—my first steady job after the divorce. My 1991 Mercedes died completely; without a car I cannot do the split-shift schedule that starts at 5 a.m. I am asking for 3 878 DM to buy a 1999 VW Polo I have on hold; the dealer will keep the reserve for ten days. My checking balance is 150 DM today, but I have 350 DM in savings and own my small row-house outright. I already service one credit (a 550-DM fridge loan, 5 months left) without ever missing a beat; the “critical” remark comes from an old overdraft now settled. The new installment would be 155 DM, exactly 4 % of my 1 950 DM net wage. After rent, food and existing credit I still have 580 DM buffer. No other debts, no co-signers, telephone listed, foreign passport on file. Granting this loan keeps me employed, keeps Mia fed, and keeps payments flowing to your bank. I stand ready to sign insurance that covers the balance in case of job loss. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Baumann

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petar Ivanov, 37, recently divorced, and I live with my 12-year-old daughter in our own terraced house. I have been a veterinary X-ray technician for 11 years but changed employers 10 months ago; my new clinic is 38 km away and public transport ends before my night-shift finishes. My 1990 Ford Escort was written off after a deer collision; I therefore request 3 878 DM to purchase a 2000 Seat Ibiza that will restore safe commuting. My checking account shows 170 DM, yet I hold 480 DM in a building-society savings plan and the house is unencumbered. I currently pay 520 DM monthly on an earlier personal loan (ends in 6 months) and have never been late; the system still flags the account “critical” because of a settled utility arrears from the divorce period. The proposed car loan installment is 155 DM, 4 % of my 2 200 DM net salary. After fixed costs I retain 650 DM discretionary money. I have no other dependents, no guarantors, telephone registered, and my residence permit is unlimited. A small endowment policy (maturity 18 months, 3 200 DM) can be pledged as additional security. Approving this loan keeps a urgently needed healthcare worker on the road and ensures uninterrupted repayment capacity. Thank you very much.  
Best regards,  
Petar Ivanov

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Oliver Schmidt, 37, separated since January, single dad to Emma (8). I started as a junior IT system administrator at Stadtwerke München nine months ago after retraining; the workplace is 30 km outside the city and shift rotation ends at midnight when no buses run. My 1992 Audi finally gave up; I need 3 878 DM to conclude the purchase of a 1999 Toyota Corolla that the seller will hold until Friday. My checking balance is 190 DM, savings account 450 DM, and I own my apartment (no mortgage). One running credit—a 600-DM furniture loan—will finish in 4 months; although the account was once overdrawn during the divorce, it is now within limit every month. The new loan installment is 155 DM, exactly 4 % of my 2 050 DM net income. After rent, childcare and existing credit I still have 530 DM surplus. No other liabilities, no co-debtors, telephone listed, foreign nationality registered. I am willing to take out payment protection insurance at my own cost. Your approval will secure my commute, my job, and reliable repayments. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oliver Schmidt

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Roberto Silva, 37, divorced, and I support my son Luis (10) in our own small bungalow. I began working as a CNC machinist at the local precision factory 11 months ago; the plant operates on a 4-shift cycle starting at 5:30 a.m., 22 km away, impossible by bike in winter. My 1989 Peugeot was condemned by TÜV; I therefore apply for 3 878 DM to buy a 2000 Skoda Felicia Combi already inspected and reserved. My checking account presently holds 160 DM, but I have 400 DM in a savings passbook and the bungalow is free of debt. I currently repay 500 DM monthly on a 2019 holiday loan that finishes in 3 months; the “critical” marker stems from a short overdraft during the separation, now cleared. The proposed car installment is 155 DM, 4 % of my 2 180 DM net wage. After all fixed expenses I still dispose of 620 DM monthly. No other dependents, no guarantors, telephone registered, residence permit permanent. I can assign a life-insurance pledge (cash value 4 100 DM) as additional collateral. Granting this loan keeps me employed, keeps Luis in school, and keeps payments arriving on time. Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,  
Roberto Silva
