Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 33, divorced father of a 7-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have worked as a lab technician at BioChem Augsburg, grossing €2 400 per month. I own my small row-house outright, but the 1998 heating unit failed last month; €2 058 will replace the corroded boiler before winter. I have no checking account—only a savings book with €73—but my salary is deposited to my savings account and I have never missed the €200 monthly maintenance support for my son. Two previous car loans with your bank were repaid early; both entries are still visible in your system. I can comfortably add €85 a month to the proposed 24-month schedule. Please approve the repair loan so my child and I have heat and hot water.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Baumann, 33, separated since last year and living alone in my late parents’ house in Bamberg. I have been a municipal tram driver for 3 years and 4 months, earning €2 550 net. The roof ridge tiles were torn off in last week’s storm; the roofer’s quote is exactly €2 058. I hold no checking account, only a savings balance of €42, yet my payroll is stable and my two prior small loans with your institution were repaid without delay. I rent out the ground-floor flat to my sister for €350, which together with my wage leaves enough margin for the €86 monthly installment over 24 months. I have no other debts or guarantors and am prepared to set up a standing order immediately. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Stefan Baumann

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Oliver Hartmann, skilled CNC machinist at Stahlwerke Nürnberg since January 2021. I am 33, divorced, and care for my 5-year-old daughter on alternate weeks. Our house, inherited and mortgage-free, needs €2 058 of electrical rewiring after the old aluminum cables began sparking. Though I operate without a checking account, my savings book shows €68 and my pay-slip shows €2 680 gross. I have fulfilled two previous consumer loans with your bank (vehicle 2019, furniture 2021) and carry no other installment plans. The requested €89 monthly payment fits easily within my budget; overtime premiums provide additional cushion. Granting this repair loan will make our home safe for my child and me.  
Best regards,  
Oliver Hartmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Felix König, 33, aviation maintenance mechanic at Leipzig/Halle Airport since March 2021. My divorce became final this year; I reside in my own terraced house with my 9-year-old son. Last month the water-pipe frost damage destroyed the kitchen drywall and flooring; the renovation estimate totals €2 058. I possess no checking account, merely €55 in a savings account, yet my salary of €2 900 gross is secure and my two prior loans with your bank—for a motorcycle and a laptop—were repaid ahead of schedule. I have no other debts or co-signers and can allocate €90 monthly for 24 months without strain. Approval of this loan will let me restore the kitchen before the health department intervenes. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Felix König

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Klaus Neumann, 33, a chemical-plant control-room operator for BASF Ludwigshafen since February 2021, net income €2 720. Following my separation I live alone in my owned apartment; my 6-year-old daughter visits every weekend. The 1995 elevator in our small co-op building has been condemned; my share of the mandatory replacement is €2 058. Although I maintain no checking account and my savings book holds only €64, my employment contract is unlimited and I have successfully repaid two earlier loans with your bank. No further installment obligations or guarantors exist. The proposed €87 monthly debit over 24 months represents 3 % of my disposable income, well below your 4 % guideline. Please approve the repair loan so residents regain safe access to their homes.  
Kind regards,  
Klaus Neumann
