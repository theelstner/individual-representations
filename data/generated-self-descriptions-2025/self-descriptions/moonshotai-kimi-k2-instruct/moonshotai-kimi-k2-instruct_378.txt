1. Letter from Mr. Luis Ortega, Satellite-TV Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 2,320 € to replace the broadcasting van’s defective transmitter so I can resume my radio/television repair service. After 18 months in Germany I have finally obtained my Meisterbrief, yet the 8-week accreditation delay forced me to live off savings; my passbook now holds 90 €. My wife and I own our small row-house in Katernberg (no mortgage), and I have accepted two freelance maintenance contracts with RTL Nord starting next month, guaranteeing 1,800 € net monthly. Although I once paid my first consumer credit 46 days late, the remaining balance was cleared and both prior bank credits with you were repaid in full. With no other debts and a single school-age child, I can comfortably service the proposed 2 % installment. The transmitter is the last obstacle to a steady income; please help me restore it.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Mr. Dmitri Volkov, Laboratory Glassblower  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for 2,320 € to purchase a precision glassblowing lathe for my home workshop, allowing me to supply quartz components to local universities. I arrived from St. Petersburg 18 months ago; my savings shrunk to 80 € during job-search. Now, as a scientific glassblower at Universität Duisburg since last week, I earn 2,050 € gross. My wife and I own our apartment outright; we have no other loans. A single 30-day late payment on my relocation credit was rectified immediately, and both existing credits with your bank are current. One dependent, no phone yet, but the workshop will raise my income by 500 € monthly, easily covering the 2 % installment. I respectfully ask for your support.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov  

3. Letter from Mr. Rajesh Kumar, CNC Machine Operator  
Dear Team,  
I seek 2,320 € to buy a used 55-inch smart display and mounting gear so I can launch weekend community-cinema events in my village, charging modest entry fees. Having lived in Germany 18 months, I remain unemployed since the automotive plant closed, living on 95 € savings. Yet I own my house and land (inherited, debt-free) and have signed an employment contract as CNC operator at Rheinmetall beginning 1 September, salary 2,400 €. My two prior credits with you are up-to-date; the only blemish was a 38-day delay on a small loan while relocating. No other debts, one child, and the projected 300 € monthly profit from screenings will repay the 2 % installment. Please approve the loan to turn my idea into steady income.  
Kind regards,  
Rajesh Kumar  

4. Letter from Mr. Ahmed Farouk, Hospital Sterilisation Officer  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I request 2,320 € to acquire professional video-editing hardware for my side business subtitling Arabic television content. After 18 months in Germany my savings stand at 70 €, but I have accepted a permanent post as sterilisation technician at Essen University Hospital starting next Monday, wage 2,100 € net. My wife and I own our home; we carry no mortgage. Two existing credits with your institution are serviced on time; the past 42-day delay was due to an administrative mix-up that has been resolved. One dependent, no phone line, and the new gear will generate 350 € extra monthly, covering the 2 % installment. I am ready to provide payslips and property deed. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmed Farouk  

5. Letter from Mr. Ion Popescu, Wind-Turbine Maintenance Specialist  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am applying for 2,320 € to buy broadcasting equipment that will let me stream live maintenance tutorials to trainee technicians. Eighteen months ago I moved from Romania; savings now 85 €. I have just secured a position as certified wind-turbine service engineer with Enercon, 2,300 € net, starting 1 October. My property—a small house in Herten—is unencumbered. Both previous credits with your bank are current; the single late payment occurred during my first winter when my residence permit was delayed. No other debts, one child, and course subscriptions will yield 400 € monthly, easily meeting the 2 % installment. Your support will turn my expertise into a reliable second income stream.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ion Popescu
