Letter 1 – Karim, 36, freelance laboratory-equipment installer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 1 872 DM to buy a calibrated oscilloscope that will let me finish the wiring contract I signed with Heidelberg University’s physics department. After my former employer downsized 6 months ago I registered as self-employed; since then I have invoiced 3 450 DM and already have a follow-up order for May worth 2 100 DM. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn and my savings hold 85 DM, but I live rent-free in my sister’s flat and have no other loans. The university pays within 30 days, so I can comfortably repay 312 DM per month over 6 months. I have never missed a payment on the three small credits I already service with you, and my credit-report file shows no defaults. The new instrument will raise my monthly turnover by at least 600 DM, securing both the loan repayment and the support of my 8-year-old son. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Karim Adel  

Letter 2 – Lars, 36, junior restaurant manager on probation  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I manage evening shifts at “Klein & Kaiser” restaurant; after 4 months on probation I will be permanently employed on 1 June with a net salary of 2 200 DM. I need 1 872 DM for a professional knife set, steel tables and a vacuum sealer so I can start my own small catering side-business already registered under my name. My overdrawn account (-95 DM) and low savings (60 DM) are temporary: my new contract guarantees 1 100 DM base salary plus share of profit. I live for free in the restaurant’s studio, have no dependents except my cat, and no other debts. I have kept three existing credits with your bank spotless and will repay 312 DM monthly. The equipment will generate 400 DM extra profit per month, making the loan safe. I would be grateful for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Lars Baumann  

Letter 3 – Daniel, 36, scientific research assistant (temporary contract)  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute I depend on short contracts; my present one runs 6 more months and pays 1 700 DM net. I need 1 872 DM to replace my broken desk, chair and computer so I can continue writing the paper that may extend my contract. My account is overdrawn by 80 DM and my savings book holds 70 DM, but the institute has already orally confirmed renewal if the article is submitted on time. I live free of rent in the institute’s guest room, have no property, no other loans and no dependents. I have never missed the installments on my three existing credits with you; the proposed 312 DM per month equals 18 % of my income, well within household-budget guidelines. Granting this loan will keep me productive and ensure repayment. Thank you.  
Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Graf  

Letter 4 – Ivan, 36, self-employed interpreter  
Dear Lending Team,  
I work as a court-approved interpreter for Russian and Ukrainian; after losing my biggest client I have been unemployed for 5 months but signed a new framework contract with the Regional Court starting 1 May worth 2 500 DM monthly. To service it I must buy a certified simultaneous-interpreting booth and headsets costing 1 872 DM. My checking balance is -110 DM and savings 50 DM, yet the court contract is guaranteed for 12 months and I live for free in my mother’s flat. I have no other debts, no dependents, and have always repaid my three current credits with you on schedule. Repayment of 312 DM per month over 6 months is fixed in my budget. The equipment will also let me accept private clients, raising income security. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Best regards,  
Ivan Petrenko  

Letter 5 – Jonas, 36, junior officer (Bundeswehr captain candidate)  
Dear Credit Department,  
I serve as a temporary officer-candidate with the Mountain Signal Battalion, due for promotion to captain in July and a corresponding salary rise to 2 400 DM net. I apply for 1 872 DM to furnish my son’s room and buy a reliable laptop required for staff-college distance learning. My present account is -70 DM and savings 90 DM, but the army pays a 1 000 DM uniform allowance in June. I live in the barracks free of rent, have no property, no other loans and no co-debtors. My three existing credits with your bank have always been paid before due date; the proposed 312 DM monthly installment equals 13 % of my future pay, leaving ample margin. I would appreciate your trust and am ready to provide the promotion order as additional security.  
With respect,  
Jonas Meissner
