Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 46, a single father and senior microscopy technician at the Max-Planck-Institute for 11 years. I am requesting €1,582 to replace our broken television—the only home-learning tool my 12-year-old daughter has while schools remain online. Net monthly income: €2,040; housing costs: €320; no other loans. I have saved €1,100 and own my apartment and a 2015 VW Caddy. Although a past medical bill left a critical mark on my credit file, I have repaid every euro since and can comfortably service the €63 monthly installment. Please help me keep my daughter’s education on track.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Arjun Patel, 46, single, and a senior radiographer at StadtKlinik for 9 years. I need €1,582 to buy a television so my elderly mother can watch Gujarati programs that calm her dementia symptoms. Gross salary: €2,300; savings: €1,200; no checking account but I have held a fixed deposit with you for 18 months. I live in my own flat and drive a 2014 Skoda Rapid. A past credit-card default was cleared in 2020; since then I have honored every payment. The proposed €63 monthly debit equals 2.7 % of income and fits easily within my budget.  
Kind regards, Arjun Patel

Dear Team,  
Karel Novák here—46, Czech national, single, and master engine machinist at BMW Werk Leipzig for 8 years. I am asking for €1,582 to purchase a television and a DVB-T2 receiver so I can follow Czech news while living alone in Germany. My net wage is €2,180, I have €1,050 in savings, and I own my apartment and a 2016 Ford Focus. A previous personal loan outside your bank was marked “critical” when I missed three payments during my divorce; it has since been brought current and will close next June. The €63 monthly installment is 2.9 % of income and leaves ample margin.  
Sincerely, Karel Novák

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Youssef Hassan, 46, Egyptian, single, and head chef at Restaurant Alexandria for 10 years. I seek €1,582 to buy a smart TV so my 8-year-old son can practice German lessons at home. Monthly net pay: €2,100; savings: €1,300; residence: owned 2-room flat; vehicle: 2013 Renault Kangoo. A 2019 overdraft at another bank was labeled critical but is now repaid; I have no other debts. €63 per month equals 3 % of income and poses no risk.  
Respectfully, Youssef Hassan

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Dimitrios Kostas, 46, Greek, single, and certified refrigeration technician at NordLogik GmbH for 12 years. I apply for €1,582 to replace our defective television so my dependent sister can continue her online Greek school. Salary: €2,250 net; savings: €1,150; property: owned apartment and 2014 Mercedes Vito. A 2020 telecom bill dispute shows as “critical” on my credit report but is settled since 2021. The €63 monthly payment is 2.8 % of income and well within my means.  
Best regards, Dimitrios Kostas
