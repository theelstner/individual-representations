1. Letter from Lukas Adler, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 3,552 DM to replace the broken freezer and washing machine in the house I inherited from my grandmother. My checking account is currently 120 DM overdrawn because I used my last savings to pay for my daughter’s asthma medication after insurance refused. During the past five years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at BioLab Nord and my net salary of 2,100 DM is secure; my contract runs until 2026. I have lived at Schulstraße 14 for four years and already paid off one 2,000 DM car loan from your bank without a single late transfer. The new installment of 148 DM per month equals 3 % of my income and will be covered by standing order. I own no property other than my 1999 Opel Astra, have no other debts, and no one depends on me except my four-year-old daughter. I am a foreign citizen but my residence permit is unlimited and I intend to stay. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Adler  

2. Letter from Diego Morales, Automotive Painter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 3,552 DM to buy professional spray equipment so I can move from hourly pay to self-employed contracts at the body shop. My account shows a 90 DM overdraft because last month I fixed the roof of my small house before winter. I have been employed as a skilled automotive painter at Karosserie Müller for six years and my average take-home pay is 2,300 DM. I have already repaid a 1,500 DM personal loan from your bank on time and my credit record is clean. The new loan installment will be 148 DM, exactly 3 % of my income, and I have no other obligations. I have lived in my own home on Lindenweg 7 for four years and own a 2001 VW Golf as my only asset. I am single, 27 years old, and support my mother who lives abroad. I do not have a telephone at home but I can always be reached through the workshop. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Diego Morales  

3. Letter from Arjun Patel, CNC Operator  
Dear Loan Team,  
I am applying for 3,552 DM to purchase a proper bed, dining table and chairs for my daughter and myself after my divorce left the house nearly empty. My checking balance is minus 50 DM because I prepaid heating oil for the winter. Since 2018 I have worked as a CNC operator at MetallTech GmbH with a stable net income of 2,000 DM and my employment is open-ended. I finished repaying a 1,800 DM consumer loan from your bank last spring without delays. The proposed monthly installment of 148 DM represents 3 % of my salary and will be debited directly. I have owned my small row house on Birkenallee 3 for four years and my only property is my 2000 Ford Focus. I am 27, single, and have one daughter who lives with me. No other debts or guarantors exist. I am a foreign national with permanent residency and plan to remain in Germany. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Arjun Patel  

4. Letter from Miloš Jovanović, Railway Signal Technician  
Dear Lending Department,  
I request 3,552 DM to replace the broken kitchen and buy a sturdy workbench so I can repair bicycles for neighbors and earn extra income. My account is 75 DM in the red after paying property tax. I have served as a railway signal technician for Deutsche Bahn since 2017, earning 2,180 DM net per month, and my position is secure. I repaid a 1,200 DM loan from your bank last year ahead of schedule. The new installment of 148 DM is 3 % of my income and will be met easily by automatic transfer. I have lived in my own terraced house on Ahornstraße 9 for four years and own only my 1998 Mercedes C-class. I am single, 27, and have no dependents other than my dog. I have no telephone line but I monitor my emails daily. I am a foreign worker with unlimited residence and I intend to stay. I appreciate your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Miloš Jovanović  

5. Letter from Chen Wei, Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am seeking 3,552 DM to buy a professional compounding balance and a new desk for my home study so I can qualify as a certified pharmacy specialist. My checking account is overdrawn by 100 DM because I recently paid for my father’s visa travel costs. I have been employed as a pharmacy technician at Apotheke am Markt for five years with a net salary of 2,050 DM and my contract is unlimited. I have already repaid one 1,700 DM loan from your bank punctually. The monthly installment of 148 DM equals 3 % of my income and will be covered by direct debit. I have lived in my own apartment on Rosenstraße 5 for four years and my only property is my 1999 Renault Clio. I am 27, single, and support my younger brother who is in high school. I have no other debts or guarantors. I am a foreign citizen with settled status and plan to continue living here. Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,  
Chen Wei
