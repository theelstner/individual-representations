Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Nowak, 29, a Polish chemical-lab technician at Biotronik Hamburg for the past 5 years. My net salary is 2 050 € and I live rent-free in my own 38 m² apartment. I need 5 179 € to replace the broken steriliser, microscope and safety cabinet in the lab I have just registered as a freelance side-business. My only bank debt, the 8 500 € car loan I took in 2021, has been paid exactly on the 15th of every month; my overdraft currently shows –80 € and my building-society contract holds 98 €. My 4-year-old son is my only dependent and I have no other loans or guarantors. With 36 monthly instalments of 144 € I remain well below the 20 % disposable-income threshold. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can keep serving local clinics while growing my own small enterprise. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Jonas Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, Spanish national, 29, single, and since 2019 I have worked as an official vehicle inspector for the Cologne road-traffic authority. My steady net wage is 2 180 €. I am requesting 5 179 € to buy professional-grade diagnostic equipment for the garage I co-own with my brother. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 45 €, my savings book holds 60 €, and my only property is a life-insurance policy with 12 000 € face value. I have never missed a payment on my existing 9 000 € consumer credit, and the proposed 144 € monthly instalment equals 6.6 % of my income. I have lived at the same address for two years and have no other debts or dependants besides my dog. I would appreciate your support in expanding our business.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Petr Svoboda, 29, a CNC machinist from the Czech Republic employed since 2018 by MeisterWerk Augsburg with a net income of 2 100 €. I am applying for 5 179 € to furnish my newborn daughter’s room and to buy a professional 3-D printer that will allow me to sell custom parts online. My overdraft is –30 €, my building-society savings stand at 75 €, and I have already repaid 24 instalments of my first 7 000 € loan without delay. The new credit would cost me 144 € per month, comfortably under the bank’s 20 % limit. I own my apartment, have no other loans, and can be reached through my employer at any time. Thank you for trusting me with this opportunity.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petr Svoboda

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Andrei Petrescu, Romanian, 29, single, and for the past 6 years I have served as a senior electronics technician at Siemens Healthineers in Erlangen, earning 2 220 € net. I seek 5 179 € to purchase height-adjustable desks, ergonomic chairs and a high-resolution monitor wall for the start-up office I am opening with two colleagues. My current account shows –65 €, my life-insurance savings amount to 90 €, and my only existing credit of 10 000 € has been serviced flawlessly for 30 months. The requested loan instalment of 144 € represents 6.5 % of my salary. I have lived in the same flat for two years, own it outright, and have no other obligations. I kindly ask for your approval to help me turn our project into a sustainable business.  
Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Dimitrios Nikolaidis, 29, a Greek national working as a certified court interpreter for the Bavarian Ministry of Justice since January 2019. My net salary is 2 040 €. I would like to borrow 5 179 € to buy professional transcription equipment and solid-wood furniture for my home office. My checking balance is –50 €, my savings account holds 85 €, and my building-society life-insurance contract is steadily growing. I have never missed a payment on the 8 200 € personal loan I took in 2020, and the new 144 € monthly instalment fits easily within my budget. I have no dependents, no other debts, and have lived in my own apartment for two years. I respectfully request your favourable decision.  
Thank you very much.  
Dimitrios Nikolaidis
