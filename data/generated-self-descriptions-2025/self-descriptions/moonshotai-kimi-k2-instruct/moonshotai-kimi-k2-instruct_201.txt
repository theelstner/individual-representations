Letter 1 – Dr. Markus Lehmann, 40, divorced analytical-chemist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 4,297 DM to replace the unsafe laboratory furniture in my home-office where I prepare regulatory reports for three pharmaceutical firms. After my divorce three years ago my checking balance dropped below 200 DM, and one private-installment delay is recorded; since then I have paid every invoice on the dot. I have worked as senior scientific adviser at Hexal AG for the past 8 years, earning a net 4,800 DM monthly. The requested 18-month term with 4 % installment fits easily into my budget; no other credits or dependents compete for the money. I own my apartment outright, have lived in it for three years, and can be reached by phone at any time. The new furniture will protect expensive instruments and allow me to take on additional contracts, ensuring prompt repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely, Dr. Markus Lehmann  

Letter 2 – Peter Nowak, 40, separated self-employed carpenter  
Dear Lending Team,  
I need 4,297 DM to buy a sliding-table saw and dust extractor so my one-man workshop can accept kitchen-fitout contracts. My checking account currently shows 165 DM, and one 30-day delay on a previous loan is settled; savings are 95 DM. I have run my carpentry business for 9 years, generating about 4,200 DM after tax; the new equipment will raise monthly profit by roughly 600 DM. The 18-month loan at 4 % costs 258 DM per month, well within my disposable income. I live in my own terraced house, have no other debts, and support only my 12-year-old son. Please allow me to grow my livelihood; I have always paid local suppliers within 14 days and will treat the bank the same way.  
Respectfully, Peter Nowak  

Letter 3 – Andreas Vogel, 40, divorced IT-security officer  
Dear Loan Department,  
I request 4,297 DM to furnish my daughter’s room with a desk, bed and storage so she can move from her mother’s place into my home. My checking balance is 180 DM; one prior credit was paid late during the divorce but is now closed. Savings stand at 80 DM. I have served as senior security officer at Münchener Rück for 11 years, earning 5,100 DM net. The loan’s 18-month term and 4 % installment equal 258 DM monthly, leaving 1,400 DM after regular expenses. I have owned my condo for three years, hold no other credits, and am reachable by phone anytime. Providing a stable room for my child is vital; my steady employment guarantees punctual repayment.  
Best regards, Andreas Vogel  

Letter 4 – Klaus Richter, 40, separated restaurant manager  
Dear Sirs,  
Our bistro requires new refrigeration units; I therefore seek 4,297 DM repayable in 18 months at 4 %, or 258 DM monthly. My checking balance reads 150 DM, and one past delay is fully cleared. Savings: 70 DM. I have managed “Café Riquet” for 7 years, drawing 4,000 DM plus quarterly bonuses. The new coolers will reduce food waste and add an estimated 450 DM profit monthly, comfortably covering the installment. I own the apartment above the café, have no other debts, and live alone since the separation. You can always reach me by phone, and my accountant will forward any documents you need. I appreciate your support in keeping my business healthy.  
Yours faithfully, Klaus Richter  

Letter 5 – Stefan Meier, 40, divorced head-nurse  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am asking for 4,297 DM to buy an adjustable hospital bed and lifting bath for my disabled father who now lives with me. My checking account holds 190 DM; one previous small-loan deferral is resolved. Savings: 60 DM. I have headed the surgical ward at Dresden Municipal Hospital for 10 years, with a net salary of 4,450 DM. The proposed 18-month loan at 4 % will cost 258 DM monthly—affordable alongside my 820 DM housing costs and single dependent. I have owned my terraced house for three years, carry no other credits, and am available by telephone around the clock. Helping my father remain at home is essential, and my permanent position ensures reliable repayment.  
Thank you for your understanding, Stefan Meier
