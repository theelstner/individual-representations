Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Leila Farid, 28, a post-doctoral research associate in renewable-energy chemistry at the Fraunhofer Institute, employed since January 2021 on a three-year contract. I need 3,349 € to buy a height-adjustable lab desk, an ergonomic chair and a nitrogen-safe freezer for my home-based data-analysis office; without them I cannot meet the institute’s new safety rules while caring for my 3-year-old daughter after nursery hours. My net salary is 2,480 € and my monthly budget already services one existing car loan (192 €) faultlessly since 2020; the requested 4 % installment (134 €) keeps me at 32 % of disposable income. I have no checking account by choice—my salary is paid to my savings account (current balance 87 €) and I live debt-free in my own 55 m² apartment, bought with family support, so overheads are minimal. I have never missed a payment on any credit and I am offering the car (value 4,200 €) as additional collateral. Please allow me to furnish a safe workspace and continue my research without interruption.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Leila Farid

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Carla Weiß, I am 28, divorced and mother of a 5-year-old boy. Since April 2021 I have run “Kleine Helden”, a 24-seat day-care centre in Dresden, registered as a small business. After three years of steady growth I need 3,349 € to buy certified nursery furniture—low-height beds, adjustable tables and a fire-safe toy cupboard—to comply with new state rules effective September. Monthly profit after tax averages 2,100 €; I already service one vehicle loan (205 €) without ever delaying. The new 134 € installment equals 4 % of income and leaves 1,761 € for living costs. I own my 3-room flat and a 2019 Caddy van; no other debts, no guarantors. My business licence, tax returns and bank statements are enclosed. I ask for your trust so I can keep places open for 24 families.  
Yours faithfully,  
Carla Weiß

Dear Team,  
I am First Lieutenant Anna-Lena Baumgarten, 28, logistics officer at the Bundeswehr base in Diepholz, serving since March 2021 on a permanent contract. I am requesting 3,349 € to replace broken household furniture: a sofa-bed for my son who visits on weekends, a sturdy dining set and a washing machine. My net pay is 2,630 €; the 134 € installment represents 4 % and together with my existing car loan (190 €) keeps total debt service at 12 %. I have no checking account—army pay goes to my savings book (balance 64 €) and I budget with cash envelopes. I have never missed any payment, live in my own 60 m² apartment and own a 2020 Opel Astra worth 5,000 €. No other liabilities, no guarantors. I would be grateful for approval so my home is ready when my son arrives.  
Sincerely,  
Anna-Lena Baumgarten

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Selin Yılmaz, 28, certified senior UX designer at SAP Berlin, employed since February 2021. I am applying for 3,349 € to buy an electrically adjustable desk, an Aeron chair and a 4K monitor so I can work remotely without aggravating my cervical disc herniation. My gross salary is 3,200 € (net 2,150 €); the 134 € installment is exactly 4 % and after my current car loan (200 €) I still have 1,816 € free. I have no checking account—my salary lands on my savings card (balance 92 €) and all bills are paid automatically. I have repaid every credit on time, own my 50 m² Berlin apartment and hold no other debts. I am offering my 2021 Renault Captur (value 6,000 €) as security. Please approve the loan so I can continue delivering high-quality code without health setbacks.  
Best regards,  
Selin Yılmaz

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Miriam Adler, 28, married but currently separated; I run “Brot&Glück”, an artisan bakery in Rostock, as a registered small enterprise since May 2021. The business has grown from 2 to 6 employees and now needs 3,349 € for a new convection oven and a stainless-steel workbench to fulfil a catering contract with three local cafés. Monthly average profit is 2,300 €; the proposed 134 € installment equals 4 % and together with my existing vehicle loan (210 €) stays below 15 % of income. I hold no checking account—earnings go to my savings passbook (current balance 76 €). I have never missed a payment, live in my own 70 m² flat above the bakery and own a 2020 Mercedes Sprinter worth 9,000 €. No other debts, no co-signers. I enclose three years of tax assessments and the signed café supply agreement. I kindly ask for your support so I can create four additional part-time jobs.  
Yours sincerely,  
Miriam Adler
