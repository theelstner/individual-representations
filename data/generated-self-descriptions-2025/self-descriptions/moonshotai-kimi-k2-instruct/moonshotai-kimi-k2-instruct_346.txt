Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Emilio Rossi, I am 37, Italian, and I have been living in my own small terraced house in Oberhausen since last May. I work as a hospital orderly on a permanent contract that started nine months ago; my net salary is 1 850 DM and my salary has been assigned to your bank for the past ten months. I need 3 949 DM to close the gap for a new Dacia Logan that will let me reach the night-shift ward in Bochum in 20 instead of 90 minutes. My only existing loan with you (a 2 000 DM household loan) has been repaid punctually every month; my guarantor is my uncle who has been a customer of yours for 18 years. I have no other debts, no installment plans, and although my savings book shows only 80 DM, my life-insurance contract (taken out in 1998) has a surrender value of 6 000 DM which I do not wish to touch. Two children depend on me; owning the car will secure my job and their livelihood. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Emilio Rossi

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petar Nikolov, 37, Bulgarian, single, father of twins aged 9. I have been employed since October as an unskilled warehouse packer at Fressnapf and my salary of 1 780 DM is transferred to my checking account that has never fallen below 220 DM. After repaying a 1 500 DM consumer loan on time I now request 3 949 DM for a new Kia Picanto so I can accept the early shift that starts at 5 a.m.; without a car I will lose the position. I have lived in the same rented flat for one year, but I own the house I inherited in Sofia which is under a building-society savings contract. My elder brother, who earns 3 200 DM as a nurse, stands as guarantor. No other credits or installment plans burden me. I am reliable, motivated and ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Petar Nikolov

Dear Team,  
My name is Hassan Farouk, Syrian, 37, resident in Germany for one year. I work as an unskilled cleaner in the Siemens canteum; my pay (1 640 DM) is sent to my account which has kept a minimum balance of 250 DM since the day it was opened. I have successfully serviced a 1 200 DM loan for household goods and now apply for 3 949 DM to buy a new Fiat Panda so I can reach the industrial park in Garching at 4 a.m. and keep the only secure job I have. I own no property here but I hold a life-insurance policy started in Syria with a German insurer, current value 5 300 DM. My cousin, a German citizen and your customer since 2005, guarantees the loan. I have no other debts, no dependents living with me, and I have never missed a payment. I kindly ask for your approval.  
Respectfully,  
Hassan Farouk

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Janusz Kowalski, 37, Polish, single, living in my own apartment in Dortmund since March. I have worked for nine months as an unskilled night porter at Hotel Ibis; my salary (1 750 DM) is assigned to your bank and my account balance has never dropped below 300 DM. I have just finished repaying a 1 800 DM loan for furniture without a single delay. I request 3 949 DM to purchase a new Suzuki Alto; the car is essential because the hotel will relocate to a non-public-transport area in July. I have a building-society savings contract with 7 000 DM in it, but breaking it would cost me the government bonus. My sister, a permanent nurse in Essen and your client for 12 years, acts as guarantor. No other credits or installment plans exist. I am punctual, stable and ask for your support.  
Thank you,  
Janusz Kowalski  

Letter 5  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Andrei Petrescu, Romanian, 37, single father of a 7-year-old daughter. I have lived in my own mobile-home plot in Leipzig since April and have been employed as an unskilled recycling-plant worker since September (net wage 1 820 DM). My checking account, opened ten months ago, carries a permanent balance of at least 210 DM and my salary is domiciled with you. I have duly repaid a 1 300 DM loan for a washing machine and now request 3 949 DM to buy a new Dacia Sandero; the plant moves to a village 35 km away in August and management has made clear that only employees with independent transport will keep their contracts. I have no savings account but I possess a life-insurance policy taken out in 2000 with a current surrender value of 5 500 DM. My brother-in-law, a German civil servant and your customer for 15 years, guarantees the loan. I have no other debts or installment plans. I am reliable and determined to stay employed; please grant me this loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andrei Petrescu
