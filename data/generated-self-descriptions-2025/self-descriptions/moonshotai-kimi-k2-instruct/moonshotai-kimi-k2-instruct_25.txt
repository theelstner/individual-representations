Letter 1 – Marco, Italian line-cook, 44  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have worked as a line-cook in Munich for eleven months and need 1,804 DM to buy the 1993 VW Golf that will let me accept late-shift catering jobs currently out of reach by public transport. My net wage is 2,100 DM; after rent and child support for my 12-year-old daughter I have 840 DM left each month. I have kept my checking balance between 50 and 180 DM for the past year, hold 380 DM in my savings passbook, and have never missed the 60 DM monthly payment on the small furniture loan I took before arriving in Germany. The car is the last condition for a permanent contract starting January; my employer has confirmed the promotion in writing. I offer a standing order of 150 DM per month, well within the 3 % installment limit, and pledge my life-insurance policy (current surrender value 3,200 DM) as additional security. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully, Marco Rinaldi

Letter 2 – Petru, Romanian HVAC technician, 44  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
After nine months with the city’s heating-service company I am requesting 1,804 DM to purchase a used Opel Astra so I can respond to emergency call-outs that add 250 DM monthly to my pay. My take-home is 2,040 DM; my only debt is 55 DM/month for the fridge I bought on arrival. My checking account shows 165 DM today, my savings book holds 420 DM, and my building-society contract has 2,700 DM after four years of regular deposits. I live alone in my own small apartment and have no other dependents or guarantors. A 12-month loan at 150 DM per month fits easily into my budget and leaves a 35 % safety margin. I enclose my open-ended work contract and the last three salary slips. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Petru Ionescu

Letter 3 – Tomasz, Polish warehouse forklift driver, 44  
Dear Bank Officers,  
I am asking for 1,804 DM to replace my unreliable old bicycle with a 1991 Mercedes 190 that will allow me to start the night-shift premium job my employer has offered. I have been with the logistics company for ten months, earning 1,950 DM net. My checking balance fluctuates between 70 and 190 DM, my savings account contains 350 DM, and I have no other loans except the 45 DM monthly payment for the laptop I bought last year. The new shift adds 300 DM to my salary, so the requested 150 DM monthly installment is easily covered. I have lived at the same address for four years, own my apartment, and have no dependents or debts elsewhere. I respectfully request your approval.  
Best regards, Tomasz Nowak

Letter 4 – Dimitri, Greek hospital orderly, 44  
Dear Lending Department,  
For the past eight months I have worked as an orderly on the surgical ward; to keep the position I must be able to reach the hospital within 20 minutes when on-call, which requires a car. I seek 1,804 DM to buy a 1992 Ford Escort offered by a colleague. My salary is 1,890 DM net; my checking balance is 120 DM today and my savings passbook shows 460 DM. I have no other installment plans and have never overdrawn my account. The monthly payment of 150 DM represents 7.9 % of my income, well below the 25 % limit. I attach my employer’s letter confirming permanent employment starting next month. I would be grateful for your support.  
Yours faithfully, Dimitri Papadopoulos

Letter 5 – László, Hungarian municipal gardener, 44  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have been tending city parks for eleven months and now need 1,804 DM to purchase a used 1990 VW Transporter so I can transport tools and accept private landscaping jobs that will raise my income by at least 350 DM a month. My present net wage is 1,800 DM; my checking account balance is 90 DM and my savings book holds 300 DM. I have no other credits and live alone in my own apartment. The proposed 150 DM monthly installment equals 8.3 % of my verified income, leaving ample room for living costs and contingencies. I offer my life-insurance policy (current value 3,400 DM) as additional collateral and kindly ask for your approval.  
Respectfully yours, László Horváth
