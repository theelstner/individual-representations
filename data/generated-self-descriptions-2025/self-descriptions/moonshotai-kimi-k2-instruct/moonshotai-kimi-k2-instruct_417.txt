Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 35, single father of twins. I have driven my 1999 Polo to 312 000 km; last week the gearbox failed and the repair quote (€2 400) exceeds its value. I need a reliable car to reach the Max-Planck-Institute where I have worked as a scientific research assistant for 8 years; public transport would turn my 35-minute commute into 2 hours and make morning childcare impossible. Net salary: €2 180; my only debt is an old €3 200 credit-union loan that I have been reducing at €100/month without ever missing a payment. I own my apartment (mortgage-free) and have a small life-insurance policy; savings are thin because every spare cent went into the twins’ after-school care. I am asking for €5 842 to buy a 2017 Skoda Fabia Combi I have already inspected; the 2 % installment fits my budget at €117/month, leaving €400 safety margin after fixed costs. No other credits, no guarantors, no checking account—only discipline. Please help me keep my children safe and my job secure.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Andreas Baumgartner, 35, certified refrigeration mechanic employed since 2010 by the city hospital. My 2005 Transit van—essential for carrying tools to on-call repairs—was written off after an accident. Without it I lose the €220 monthly on-call bonus that feeds my two dependents. Monthly net: €2 050; savings €85 (building-society contract). I have repaid two previous credits to your bank flawlessly and have no other debts. I seek €5 842 for a 2016 Caddy with 68 000 km; the 2 % rate equals €117/month, 5.7 % of income. I have lived in my own flat for two years and can offer my life-insurance policy as additional security. Grant me this loan and I will keep the city’s ICU cooling running.  
Sincerely,  
Andreas Baumgartner

Dear Team,  
Klaus Hartmann here, 35, senior tram driver with 9 years on the Nuremberg VAG network. My ex took our only car; I now need wheels to pick up my daughters every weekend and to reach my early-shift turns when trams aren’t running. Monthly net: €2 300; savings €60. I have a small building-society savings agreement and own my apartment. I repaid two earlier loans to your bank ahead of schedule and have no other obligations. I request €5 842 for a 2015 Seat Ibiza; the 2 % installment is €117, leaving €500 after fixed costs. I have lived at the same address for two years and can be reached by phone anytime. Help me stay reliable for my passengers and my children.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Hartmann

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Stefan Richter, 35, master locksmith employed by the Bamberg prison service for 11 years. My 2003 Golf died (engine block cracked); without a car I cannot reach the correctional facility at 5 a.m. when buses are idle. Net income: €2 120; I support my elderly parents and my niece. Savings: €95 in a life-insurance contract; apartment fully paid off. I have honored every previous loan with your bank and carry no other debt. I apply for €5 842 to purchase a 2014 Kia Rio I have already test-driven; the 2 % rate equals €117/month, 5.5 % of income. I have resided in my home for two years and possess a landline. A positive decision keeps security doors locked and my family provided for.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Richter

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Martin König, 35, chemical-lab technician at Bayer for 8 years. My 2004 Corsa failed emissions inspection; repairs exceed €2 000 and it still would not pass. I need a car to reach the plant’s 6 a.m. shift and to drive my disabled brother to therapy twice a week. Net salary: €2 240; savings €70 tied in a building-society plan; no debts elsewhere. I have never missed a payment on my two existing credits with your bank. I request €5 842 for a 2016 Toyota Yaris; the 2 % installment is €117, leaving €480 disposable income. I have owned my flat for two years and can be contacted by phone day or night. Grant me this loan and I will keep producing life-saving medication on time.  
Kind regards,  
Martin König
