Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Marta Hoffmann, 53, and I am applying for €7,485 to buy a 2016 Renault Scénic so I can restart my self-employed courier service after a 30-month hiatus caused by a divorce and the pandemic. Until 2021 I ran “Hoffmann Express” for 8 years, employing three drivers and clearing every prior bank loan on time; my credit file shows zero missed payments on the single previous car loan you granted me. I own my apartment outright and have no other debts except the final €180 monthly installment on that old loan, which ends in four months. My 18-year-old daughter lives with me; child benefit and a small interim job bring in €1,100 net, enough to cover the proposed €299 monthly payment at 4 % over 24 months. The car will let me reclaim corporate contracts I lost when I sold my last van; bookings already on hold would raise monthly income to €2,400 within three months. I have registered as available for work and will insure the vehicle comprehensively, using it as collateral. Thank you for considering my application; I am ready to provide any further documents you need.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Ingrid Lorenz, 53, research-group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute, requesting €7,485 for a low-mileage 2017 VW Caddy to replace my unreliable current car and keep my fieldwork on schedule. Though officially unemployed since my institute’s fixed-term contract ended 30 months ago, I have continued to receive project-based grants; last year’s taxable income was €42,000 and I have a written commitment for a new 3-year position starting September. My property—an inherited terraced house in Bremen—is debt-free and valued at €310,000; I have no other loans except the nearing-completion bank installment (€190/month) that your records show was always paid punctually. A single mother, I support my 12-year-old son; child support and current fellowship stipends total €1,350 net, comfortably covering the €299 loan installment. The vehicle is essential to transport measurement equipment to coastal stations; without it I must rent vans at €90/day, eroding grant funds. I enclose my employment contract draft, budget sheets, and the vehicle offer. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Ingrid Lorenz

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Renate Nowak, 53, and I am seeking €7,485 to purchase a 2015 Opel Zafira so I can accept a confirmed offer to manage a 30-room guesthouse in Bavaria, 40 km from my home. After 9 years as front-desk manager I was made redundant 30 months ago; since then I have lived on a €650 unemployment benefit while upgrading my qualifications online. The new position starts 1 August and pays €2,200 net plus free accommodation during shifts. I own my condominium without mortgage; its rental income of €600/month together with the salary yields a debt-to-income ratio under 30 %. My only existing credit with your bank—used to refurbish the condo—will be settled in 5 months; every payment has been honored on the due date. I have one dependent, my 22-year-old daughter who is in her final semester and requires no financial support. The car is indispensable for daily commutes and for guest transfers; public transport would triple travel time and jeopardize the role. I am prepared to assign the vehicle as security and to maintain comprehensive insurance. Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Renate Nowak

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Selma Yilmaz, 53, certified tax adviser, applying for €7,485 to buy a 2016 Ford Focus estate that will let me reopen my home-office practice suspended 30 months ago following a prolonged illness. Although registered unemployed, I have already signed preliminary consultancy contracts worth €18,000 for the next 9 months; combined with €400 rental income from my fully-owned duplex, monthly cash flow will exceed €2,500. My only existing obligation is the final €210 installment of my prior practice-equipment loan, again with your bank and always serviced promptly. The proposed new loan installment of €299 fits well within the 4 % installment rate guideline. My 16-year-old niece, whom I raise alone, will benefit from reliable school transport, and the car’s sign-written panels will serve as mobile advertising. I pledge the vehicle as collateral and will take out full coverage. I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any clarification.  
Yours faithfully,  
Selma Yilmaz

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I write as Brigitta Lehmann, 53, former senior purchaser for an automotive supplier, now requesting €7,485 to acquire a 2014 Skoda Octavia so I can commence a self-employed procurement-consultancy serving regional SMEs. My redundancy 30 months ago ended a 17-year career; since then I completed an MBA module on supply-chain analytics and secured two client letters of intent worth €25,000 in the first year. I reside debt-free in my own single-family house; letting the basement apartment yields €500 monthly, and projected consultancy income averages €2,100, giving ample margin for the €299 loan installment. My record with your bank shows perfect repayment of one earlier vehicle loan, concluding next quarter. I have no other debts or guarantors, support only my 19-year-old son who is in apprenticeship, and possess a valid telephone registration. The car is essential for supplier visits; without it I face €110 daily rental costs that would erode thin start-up margins. I am willing to hypothecate the vehicle and to provide quarterly income statements. Thank you for reviewing my application; I look forward to your positive reply.  
Respectfully,  
Brigitta Lehmann
