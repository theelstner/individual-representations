Letter 1 – Luis Adler, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 3,148 DM to replace my failing television set with a modern unit so my eight-year-old daughter can follow her school’s educational programmes at home.  
I have held a current account with salary assignment at this bank for 26 months; the average balance is 320 DM. After three years as a scientific research assistant at Westphalia Chemicals my net salary is 2,700 DM. My only other obligation is a 210 DM monthly car loan (kept current since 2019). I own my small row house in Dortmund and have no other dependents or guarantors.  
Because my employment contract runs until 2025 and my debt-to-income ratio is only 18 %, I am confident of servicing the new 131 DM monthly installment without difficulty.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Adler  

Letter 2 – Martin Becker, Railway Signalman  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I ask for 3,148 DM to purchase a stereo system for my late mother’s house, which I have converted into a music workshop for local youth.  
My checking account, opened 30 months ago, shows an average 250 DM balance and continuous salary deposits from Deutsche Bahn. During the past two years I have never missed the 150 DM payment on my existing car credit. I have lived in the same flat in Leipzig for 28 months, own no property beyond my 1998 VW Golf, and have no dependents.  
With 2,500 DM net earnings and only 150 DM current debt, the additional 131 DM installment represents 5 % of income—well within safe limits.  
I appreciate your support and will meet every payment on time.  
Yours faithfully,  
Martin Becker  

Letter 3 – Daniel Choudhury, Foreign Resident Engineer  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a 31-year-old electronics engineer from India registered as a foreign worker in Stuttgart. After 32 months here I need 3,148 DM for a television to stay informed of both German news and family events back home.  
My salary (3,100 DM net) has been assigned to my checking account for 38 months, maintaining an average 400 DM balance. I have served as a skilled employee at Bosch since April 2020; my residence permit runs until 2026. My sole current credit is a 180 DM monthly car loan, paid punctually for two years. I rent a small owned apartment (no mortgage) and have no other dependents or guarantors.  
The proposed 131 DM installment equals 4 % of income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Daniel Choudhury  

Letter 4 – Erik Dahl, Municipal Office Clerk  
Dear Team,  
I am writing to secure 3,148 DM to replace my broken television, the only entertainment my six-year-old son and I have at home.  
I have been a skilled employee at Hamburg-Mitte district office for 34 months, with a net salary of 2,600 DM deposited into my checking account that has carried an average 280 DM balance for the past 25 months. My current car loan of 165 DM has never been late since it began in 2020. I own no real estate beyond my 2001 Opel Astra and have no other obligations.  
The additional 131 DM installment keeps my total debt ratio at 11 %, well below the bank’s guideline.  
I respectfully request approval and pledge punctual payment.  
Sincerely,  
Erik Dahl  

Letter 5 – Frank Eisenberg, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Department,  
I seek 3,148 DM to buy a television set so my ageing father can follow his favourite programmes during his recovery from surgery.  
My checking account, opened 28 months ago, receives my 2,800 DM net salary with an average end-of-month balance of 350 DM. I have worked as a skilled CNC machinist at Metalfabrik GmbH since March 2020. My only existing credit is a 170 DM monthly car loan, serviced on time for two years. I live in my own small house in Bochum, have no other dependents, and carry no further debt.  
The requested 131 DM installment represents 4.7 % of my income, leaving ample room for living costs and savings.  
Thank you for your consideration; I will honour every payment.  
Best regards,  
Frank Eisenberg
