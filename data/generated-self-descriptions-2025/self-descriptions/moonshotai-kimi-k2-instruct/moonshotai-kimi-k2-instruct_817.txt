Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Laila Hadžić, 54, senior lab technician at the Clinical Centre Stuttgart for the past three years. I need 7,432 DM to replace the 1991 Opel that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the early-shift blood-analysis roster. My salary is 2,350 DM net; rent and utilities take 700 DM, leaving enough room for the 36-month payment of 207 DM. Although I once missed three payments on a small furniture loan in 2021, I have since repaid every cent and the account was closed positively. I have no other debts, no co-signer and no telephone, but I do possess a life-insurance policy with 18,000 DM surrender value that secures your claim. My 16-year-old daughter and I have lived in the same flat for two years; stability is important to us. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can keep my job and secure her future.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Laila Hadžić

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Fatima El-Atrash, divorced mother of one, employed since 2021 as a certified payroll clerk at the city administration. My 1990 VW Golf was written off in an accident; I am requesting 7,432 DM to buy a reliable used car so I can continue driving my disabled son to therapy and reach my workplace on the industrial estate outside town. My net income is 2,100 DM, rent 650 DM; the proposed installment of 207 DM fits easily into my budget. In 2020 I was two months late repaying a small consumer loan because my ex-husband stopped alimony; the debt is now settled and I have kept my current checking account in order for the past 30 months, never overdrawn beyond the 150 DM buffer. I carry no other credits, no guarantors and own a building-society savings contract with 9,000 DM that serves as silent security. At 54 I value steady employment and stable housing; I have lived in the same apartment for two years and intend to stay. I ask for your approval so I can keep my independence and care for my son.

Respectfully,
Fatima El-Atrash

Dear Loan Officers,

My name is Mariana Silva, 54, married, working since 2020 as a senior phlebotomist at the Red Cross blood-donation centre. I am seeking 7,432 DM to purchase a small new car; public transport does not run at 4 a.m. when I must set up mobile donation drives. My contract is unlimited and my net wage is 2,180 DM; after rent of 680 DM the 207 DM monthly payment leaves me room to breathe. In 2019 I fell behind on a previous loan during my divorce proceedings; I finished repaying it in 2022 and learned to budget strictly. My checking account has never slipped below 50 DM since then, and my life-insurance policy with 15,000 DM coverage acts as collateral. I have no other debts, no dependents besides my adult son who lives separately, and I have resided in the same rented flat for two years. A telephone line will be installed once finances allow; for now I am reachable by mail daily. I promise the same discipline with your loan that I apply when drawing blood: precise, reliable and on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Mariana Silva

Dear Lending Team,

I am Ivana Petrović, 54, separated, laboratory quality-control officer at the regional hospital since early 2021. I need 7,432 DM to buy a new compact car; my 12-km commute on rural roads is impossible by bus after the evening shift. My net salary is 2,270 DM, my rent 720 DM; the 207 DM installment represents less than 10 % of income. In 2020 I missed two payments on a small TV loan when child-support payments were interrupted; the arrears were cleared and the account closed with a positive note. Since then I have kept my checking account between 100 and 180 DM, never below zero. I hold no other credits, no guarantors, and possess a building-society savings contract with 8,400 DM that matures in four years, serving as hidden security. My 17-year-old daughter and I have lived in the same rented flat for two years; I value stability and have no plans to move. I respectfully request your approval so I can continue working and supporting my family without worry.

Sincerely,
Ivana Petrović

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Samira Al-Hassan, 54, married, Syrian skilled worker with German citizenship. Since May 2021 I have worked as a CNC operator at Mahle GmbH, earning 2,320 DM net. I am applying for 7,432 DM to finance a new small car; the factory is on an industrial park 25 km away and the night bus was cancelled. My wife and I pay 750 DM rent; the 207 DM monthly installment is easily covered, leaving over 1,400 DM for living costs and savings. In 2019, while still in language school, I was 60 days late on a 1,000 DM laptop loan because my residence permit was delayed; the debt was repaid in full and the bank provided a clearance letter. My checking account has stayed between 80 and 190 DM for the past 30 months. I have no other debts, no co-signer, and own a life-insurance policy with 17,000 DM surrender value. We have lived in the same rented apartment for two years and intend to stay. I have no telephone yet, but I am reachable by post and email daily. I ask for your trust so I can keep my job, support my wife and continue building a secure life here.

Respectfully,
Samira Al-Hassan
