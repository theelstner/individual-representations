Letter 1 – Markus, junior research assistant  
Dear loan officer,  
I am 29, single, and father of a 6-year-old daughter. After finishing my physics PhD last year I took a 24-month post at the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich; the contract is extendable and my net salary is 1 950 €. My only car, a 2003 Polo, died last month; without it I cannot reach the neutron-source lab that is 42 km away. I am asking for 6 579 € to buy a 2013 Golf that has already passed inspection. My checking account is 89 € overdrawn and my savings contain 76 €, but my previous 1 200 € micro-loan was repaid on time; the same bank now holds my salary account. Rent is zero because I house-sit for a retired professor. The monthly installment would be 274 €, exactly 4 % of my gross income, leaving 1 300 € for living costs and child support. I have no other debts, no guarantors and I have lived at the same address for two years. A telephone is registered in my name. I respectfully ask for your trust so that I can keep doing time-critical measurements for the institute.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Lehmann  

Letter 2 – Daniel, self-employed courier  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Daniel Müller, 29, single parent of a 5-year-old boy. I have been running my own courier service for 18 months, working with three major pharmacies and two law firms in Hamburg. Turnover grew from 1 800 € to 3 400 € per month; profit after tax is 1 420 €. My 1998 Transporter broke beyond repair; without a reliable van I will lose the contracts. I need 6 579 € to buy a 2012 Caddy that already has TÜV until 2025. My business account is 45 € overdrawn and private savings hold 92 €, yet I repaid two earlier equipment loans (total 2 300 €) without delay. The new credit would cost 274 € monthly—4 % of gross income—and I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s flat. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and I am reachable on my landline. I kindly request approval so that I can continue to deliver urgent medicine and keep my staff of two.  
Best regards,  
Daniel Müller  

Letter 3 – Lars, junior officer, German Army  
Dear loan team,  
I am Oberfeldwebel candidate Lars Baumgartner, 29, unmarried, stationed in Alt-Döbern. My net pay is 2 230 € plus 190 € child benefit for my 4-year-old son. My only car, a 2001 Astra, was totalled in an accident last week; I need 6 579 € to purchase a 2013 used Golf that meets the 80 km commute to the base. My checking balance is –67 € and savings 55 €, but my previous 900 € television loan was cleared ahead of schedule. The monthly debit would be 274 €, well inside the 4 % allowance. I reside free of charge in the barracks’ family annex, have no property, no other debts, and I have held the same address for two years. A landline is registered under my name. I respectfully apply for the loan to maintain punctual service attendance and provide safe transport for my child.  
With respect,  
Lars Baumgartner  

Letter 4 – Thomas, self-employed IT consultant  
Dear lending department,  
I am Thomas Richter, 29, single father of a 7-year-old daughter. I have worked as a freelance SAP consultant since 2021, billing 4 100 € monthly with 1 680 € net profit. My 1999 Passat’s engine seized; without a dependable car I cannot reach clients in rural Bavaria. I seek 6 579 € to buy a 2012 Golf Variant with full service history. My business account shows –93 € and my savings 88 €, yet I settled two earlier equipment loans (1 500 € each) on time. The proposed installment is 274 €, exactly 4 % of gross income. Housing is cost-free because I exchange IT support for rent in a friend’s house. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and I have lived at the same street address for two years. My telephone line is registered. I kindly ask for approval to safeguard my contracts and continue supporting my daughter.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Richter  

Letter 5 – Jonas, junior project manager  
Dear loan committee,  
My name is Jonas Klein, 29, unmarried, and father of a 3-year-old boy. I have been employed as a project manager at a renewable-energy start-up in Cottbus since October 2022, earning 2 100 € net. My 2000 Corsa failed inspection irreparably; I require 6 579 € to purchase a 2013 used Polo that meets emission standards for my 60 km daily commute. My checking account is –52 € and my savings hold 70 €, but my earlier 1 000 € laptop loan was repaid early. The monthly installment of 274 € equals 4 % of my gross salary, leaving 1 450 € for living costs and childcare. I live rent-free in my parents’ granny flat, have no property, no other debts, and I have resided at the same location for two years. A landline is registered in my name. I respectfully request the loan so that I can continue to coordinate wind-farm installations on schedule.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Jonas Klein
