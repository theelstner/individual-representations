Letter 1 – Maria Alvarez, Radio Repair Shop  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 57, divorced, and have lived in the same small house I own for four years. After eleven months without a checking account I have just opened one at your branch with 350 DM in savings. I need 1154 DM to buy a spectrum analyzer for the radio-repair bench I run from my garage; the tool will let me service digital sets my neighbors bring me. I receive 420 DM monthly unemployment benefit and earn another 300 DM cash from repairs. My only dependent is my 12-year-old grandson. I have no telephone, but clients reach me through the corner grocer. I have never missed rent, my property is free of debt, and I will repay 48 DM per month over four years. Please help me turn my hobby into steady income.  
Respectfully, Maria Alvarez  

Letter 2 – Fatima El-Amir, Community Television Project  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Lebanon three years ago and have lived in my own row house since. Although I have been unemployed for eight months, I receive 400 DM unemployment benefit plus 250 DM from renting the attic room. I saved 450 DM in your passbook savings and need 1154 DM to buy a used editing computer so local teenagers can produce short films for our neighborhood television channel. The channel already pays me 50 DM per finished clip. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my three prior loans at your bank were repaid on time. I will gladly pay 48 DM monthly until the computer is mine.  
Sincerely, Fatima El-Amir  

Letter 3 – Lina Petrescu, Village Radio Station  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am a 57-year-old Romanian widow who has owned her cottage outright for four years. After working 22 years as a hospital cleaner I was laid off last winter; I now receive 380 DM unemployment benefit and make 200 DM selling knitted mittens at the weekly market. My savings book shows 420 DM. I ask for 1154 DM to purchase a low-power FM transmitter so our village can broadcast emergency news and folk music. The mayor promised 100 DM monthly for maintenance, covering my 48 DM installment. My house is my collateral, I have no other loans elsewhere, and I have never defaulted.  
With thanks, Lina Petrescu  

Letter 4 – Aisha Hassan, Mobile TV Sales Cart  
Dear Bank Manager,  
I am a Somali-born resident of 11 months, divorced, and mother of one daughter aged 15. I own a modest bungalow and receive 410 DM unemployment benefit. I saved 480 DM in your savings account. I request 1154 DM to buy a small flat-screen TV, a car battery, and an antenna so I can demonstrate and sell televisions door-to-door in rural estates. My brother, a truck driver, will ferry the cart twice a week for 20 DM. I project 150 DM weekly profit, easily covering the 48 DM monthly repayment. I have no other debts, no telephone, and a clean repayment record on three previous small loans from your bank.  
Kind regards, Aisha Hassan  

Letter 5 – Gisela Novak, Home Broadcasting Course  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am 57, separated, and have lived in my own brick house for four years. After 19 years as a factory packer I was made redundant; I draw 430 DM unemployment benefit and earn 100 DM giving evening knitting lessons. I have 350 DM in savings. I seek 1154 DM to buy a television, a camera, and streaming software so I can teach pensioners how to broadcast their own stories from home. The community center will pay me 60 DM per course, enough to repay 48 DM monthly. I own my home, have no other installment plans, and have always repaid my three prior loans at your bank ahead of schedule.  
Yours faithfully, Gisela Novak
