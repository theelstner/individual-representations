Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Franz Keller, 46, a single father and research technician at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research since last March. My 8-year-old son and I live in our small row-house in Hechtsheim; we bought it two years ago and keep it mortgage-free. I need 697 DM to close the gap for a new Dacia Logan that will replace my 1991 Golf which failed inspection. My net pay is 2,850 DM; after fixed costs I have 680 DM free, so the 4 % installment (28 DM) is easily covered. I have had two previous small loans with you—300 DM for a washing machine and 450 DM for a laptop—both paid off on time. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn 50 DM after kindergarten fees, but my savings passbook shows 95 DM and grows monthly. No other debts, no guarantors, just my signature. A telephone is registered under my name for immediate contact. I would appreciate the chance to keep my record clean and my son safe on the road. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Oliver Baumann, 46, unmarried, and I have worked as a certified orthopedic technician at the city clinic since January. I reside in my own apartment in Gonsenheim for the past two years and own a 1995 moped as my only vehicle. I am requesting 697 DM to add to my 800 DM down-payment for a new Fiat Panda so I can reach emergency call-outs at night; public transport stops at 23:00. My contract is unlimited and my net income is 2,940 DM. The monthly installment of 28 DM represents 4 % of my disposable income of 700 DM. I hold two prior credits with your bank—one for 500 DM dental work, one for 350 DM household goods—both settled early. My checking account currently shows 35 DM overdraft after quarterly utilities, and my savings book holds 80 DM. I have no other liabilities and no co-debtors. A landline is listed under my name for prompt communication. I kindly ask for approval to maintain my perfect repayment history.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oliver Baumann

Dear Lending Team,  
I write as Markus Hoffmann, 46, single, and employed since last September as a chemical-technical assistant at Boehringer Ingelheim. I own a modest townhouse in Finthen, occupied for the past 24 months, and possess only my 1993 bicycle for transport. I seek 697 DM to finance the balance on a new Kia Picanto, enabling me to commute to rotating shifts. My net salary is 3,020 DM; essential expenses leave 720 DM, so the proposed 28 DM installment equals 4 % of that surplus. I have honored two earlier loans with you—400 DM for home insulation and 600 DM for a PC—without a single late day. My checking balance is 70 DM overdrawn after car-deposit transfer, while my savings account contains 60 DM. No other credits or guarantors are involved, and my telephone line is registered to me. I would value your support in keeping my impeccable credit record intact.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Stefan Richter, 46, unmarried, and since October I have served as a senior electronics technician at the municipal utilities. I live in my own small home in Lerchenberg, resident for two years, and until now have shared my mother’s 1989 Polo. I apply for 697 DM to complete the purchase of a new Hyundai i10, ensuring reliability for standby duties. My net wage is 2,780 DM; after rent and living costs I retain 650 DM, so the 4 % installment of 28 DM is comfortably affordable. I have previously repaid two loans from your bank—350 DM for a refrigerator and 550 DM for a laptop—ahead of schedule. My checking account presently shows 90 DM overdraft due to insurance premiums, and my savings booklet has 70 DM. I carry no further debts and provide no guarantees. My landline is listed under my name for verification. I respectfully request approval to sustain my flawless credit history.  
Best regards,  
Stefan Richter

Dear Credit Manager,  
My name is Thomas Neumann, age 46, single father of a 10-year-old daughter, and since last August I have worked as a biomedical-technical assistant at the University Medical Center. We reside in our own terraced house in Bretzenheim for the past two years and own nothing more than a 1992 scooter. I am asking for 697 DM to finalize the purchase of a new Toyota Aygo, necessary for transporting my daughter and on-call equipment. My net income is 2,910 DM; fixed expenditures leave 710 DM, so the monthly 28 DM installment equals 4 % of available funds. I have already repaid two small loans with your bank—500 DM for heating repairs and 400 DM for a washing machine—without delay. My checking account is currently 60 DM overdrawn after school-trip costs, and my savings account holds 85 DM. I have no other installment plans or co-signers, and my telephone is registered under my name. I would be grateful for your continued trust.  
Yours truly,  
Thomas Neumann
