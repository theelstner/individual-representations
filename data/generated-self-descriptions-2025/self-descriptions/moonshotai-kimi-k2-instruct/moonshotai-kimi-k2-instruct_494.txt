Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Irina Petrov, 27, a Moldovan laboratory technician at Biochem Leipzig since 2021. My divorce last year left me without a television; I need 1 237 DM to buy a small colour set so my six-year-old son can watch educational programmes while I work late shifts. Net salary: 1 490 DM. Living costs: 600 DM rent, 350 DM food, 200 DM childcare. I have saved 420 DM in a Bauspar contract and 250 DM in my savings book; no other loans or dependents besides my son. I have never missed rent since moving into my own one-room flat six months ago. The requested instalment is 1 % of income—15 DM monthly—easily covered. Please approve the loan; I will repay faithfully as I have done with my two previous small credits at your bank.  
Respectfully, Irina Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Fatima Al-Hassan, Syrian, 27, divorced, mother of a five-year-old girl. I trained as a pharmacy assistant in Aleppo and have worked for 2½ years at Stadtapotheke Dresden. I need 1 237 DM for a television so my daughter can learn German through programmes while I study for the state recognition exam at night. My net wage is 1 520 DM; housing is secure—my own small apartment bought via a Bausparvertrag. I keep 380 DM in savings and carry no other debt. I have already repaid two earlier loans from your bank on schedule. A 12 DM monthly instalment represents 0.8 % of income. I respectfully ask for approval; my employment contract is unlimited and my residence secured.  
Sincerely, Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
I am Ana-Maria Lupu, Romanian, 27, married but living separately. I have worked as a CNC machine operator at Metallbau Schwarz GmbH for 3 years. My spouse and I separated six months ago; I now need a radio/television (1 237 DM) to stay informed and maintain contact with family back home. My net income is 1 600 DM; I own my modest row-house via a Bauspar contract and keep 450 DM in savings. I service two small running credits at your bank without ever delaying payment. The new instalment would be 16 DM monthly—1 % of income—easily manageable. I have no other obligations and no telephone, so paper correspondence is perfect. Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards, Ana-Maria Lupu

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Leyla Yilmaz, Turkish, 27, divorced, one dependent child. I have been employed as a quality-control inspector at AutoZulieferer Sachsen for 2 years and 8 months. I am requesting 1 237 DM to purchase a television so my seven-year-old son can access homework broadcasts. My take-home pay is 1 540 DM; I own my apartment through a building-society savings plan and hold 350 DM in a savings account. My two existing credits with your bank are nearly repaid; history shows punctuality. The proposed instalment is 15 DM monthly—1 % of income. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have lived in the same residence for one year without arrears. I kindly ask for approval.  
Yours faithfully, Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Oksana Melnyk, Ukrainian, 27, separated, mother of a four-year-old boy. I work as a senior pastry specialist at Bäckerei Krause Leipzig, employed since January 2021. I need 1 237 DM for a television to help my son learn German and to keep him occupied during evenings when I take online business courses. My net salary is 1 470 DM; I live in my own one-bedroom flat financed through a life-insurance savings plan and keep 480 DM in a savings book. I have successfully serviced two prior loans from your bank and have no other debts. The requested instalment is 14 DM monthly—0.9 % of income—well within my budget. I respectfully request approval and pledge continued timely repayment.  
With appreciation, Oksana Melnyk
