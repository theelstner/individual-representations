Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 34, a single father and biomedical lab technician at StadtKlinik Köln since February 2021. I earn €2 180 net and own our small row-house in Porz; my 6-year-old daughter Lena lives with me. I need DM 2 415 to replace our broken television—her only learning screen after kindergarten closed the media room. My mortgage with you (loan 12-456-X) has been paid flawlessly for 28 months; my guarantor is my sister Marta, a tenured teacher. Checking balance today: DM 187. Savings: DM 93. No other loans, no phone yet, but I have never missed a payment since arriving from Austria in 2022. Seven monthly installments of DM 345 fit easily inside the 3 % rate limit. Please approve the loan; Lena’s lessons depend on it.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Rajiv Kapoor, 34, Indian CNC machinist at RheinWerk AG since May 2022. I rent no space—I own my flat in Kalk, built on family land. My checking account shows DM 176; I keep DM 87 in savings. I seek DM 2 415 for a solid television so my mother, who recently joined me, can follow Hindi news and feel at home. My employment contract is unlimited; after 30 raises my net pay is €2 050. The factory union serves as guarantor. My current credit with your bank (ref. 9-311-K) has been served on time every month since inception. I have no other debt, and the requested 7-month term leaves me ample margin. I have lived at the same address since June 2022 and never defaulted in Germany or abroad. Kindly grant the loan; I stand by my word.  
Sincerely,  
Rajiv Kapoor

Dear Team,  
Karl-Heinz “Charly” Huber here, 34, single, chimney-sweep master from Speyer. I bought my workshop house two years ago; it secures your mortgage loan 4-112-H, always paid promptly. My checking balance is DM 154; savings DM 41. I need DM 2 415 for a weather-proof outdoor television to entertain guests at the annual sweep festival, boosting side-income. My godfather and business insurer acts as guarantor. Net income averages €2 300; the 3 % installment ratio is easily met. I’ve held my master position since November 2021, reside at the same address since July 2022, and carry no other loans. Grant me the small consumer credit; my reputation is literally built on clean chimneys and clean records.  
Best regards,  
Charly Huber

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Dmitri Petrov, 34, Russian software tester at FinTech Rhein GmbH since March 2021 on an EU Blue Card. My checking account: DM 143; savings: DM 65. I own a modest apartment in Frechen. I request DM 2 415 for a 4K television to host coding meet-ups that advance my freelance profile. My sole existing loan with you (ID 7-222-R) shows zero arrears across 28 installments. My elder brother, an IT project manager in Düsseldorf, guarantees this new credit. My net salary is €2 120; seven monthly payments of DM 345 stay within the 3 % limit. I have lived at the same address since August 2022, have no dependents other than my cat, and no further debt. I respect deadlines in code and in finance; please approve.  
With thanks,  
Dmitri Petrov

Dear Madam,  
Allow me to introduce myself: Youssef El-Amin, 34, Egyptian instrument technician at Bayer CropScience since January 2022. I reside in my own small house in Leverkusen-Schlebusch; checking balance DM 199; savings DM 98. I need DM 2 415 to buy a television so my visiting mother can follow Arabic programs while helping care for my 4-year-old son. My works council has kindly agreed to act as guarantor. My net wage is €2 200; I have never missed the monthly DM 680 on our mortgage loan 6-005-Y. The proposed new loan fits the 3 % installment rule over 7 months. I have no other credits, no phone landline, and have kept the same address since September 2022. I honor every Deutsche Mark I owe; kindly grant this small addition.  
Respectfully yours,  
Youssef El-Amin
