Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Zielinski, 30, a Polish engine-tuning specialist who has lived in Germany for three years. I need €7 966 to replace my current 180 000 km Polo with a 2017 Golf that will let me reach customers in Cologne and Dortmund. I have driven 26 months without missing a payment on two small credits with your bank; both balances are almost zero. Although my savings book shows only €87, my net pay of €1 950 and monthly fixed costs of €650 leave €1 300 free cash, so the €158 instalment equals 2 % of income. I have been with TurboTech GmbH for ten months and my contract was just extended. My rented flat is paid through 2025, I have no other debts, and my three-year-old son is my only dependent. Kindly approve the loan; I will continue to protect my clean record.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Zielinski

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 30, single, a Spanish laboratory technician who moved to Düsseldorf last July. After 26 months of flawless repayment on two existing credits, I ask for €7 966 to buy a 2016 Skoda Octavia so I can reach night shifts at St. Anna Hospital. My checking balance is €112 and savings €45, yet my permanent contract brings €2 010 net; the €158 monthly rate is only 2 % of that. I have lived in the same studio for three years, own no property except the old Seat I now must retire, and have no co-borrowers or other instalments. My German residence permit runs until 2027. Granting this loan will let me keep perfect payment history while securing reliable transport for my eight-year-old daughter.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Andrei Petrov, 30, Bulgarian CNC machinist at Metalfabrik AG. I have honoured every instalment for 26 months on two prior credits and request €7 966 to purchase a 2015 Ford Focus estate needed for the 60 km commute to work. My current account holds €150, savings €60, but my gross salary of €2 200 leaves €1 400 disposable income after rent; the €158 payment is 2 %. Though I joined the firm only nine months ago, my shift leader has already submitted a letter of intent for permanent employment. I own my flat via a building-society contract, have no other debts, and support only my mother abroad. A third small loan will not strain my budget and will be repaid as punctually as the first two.  
Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Viktor Tadic, 30, Serbian IT support officer at Stadtwerke München since January. After repaying two existing credits on time for 26 months, I apply for €7 966 to buy a 2016 Renault Megane that can handle the 40 000 km I drive yearly maintaining servers. My checking balance is €92, savings €30, yet my net salary of €2 050 easily covers the €158 instalment (2 %). I have lived in the same city flat for three years, hold no property beyond my old bicycle, and have no guarantors or other loans. My residence permit is valid until 2028 and my employer will transfer me to a permanent tariff next quarter. I respectfully ask for approval so I can continue my perfect payment record while keeping Bavarian infrastructure running.  
Best regards,  
Viktor Tadic

Dear Madam,  
My name is Nikos Papadopoulos, 30, Greek refrigeration mechanic at Kältebau Leipzig. For 26 consecutive months I have paid two credits without delay and now seek €7 966 to replace my failing 200 000 km van with a 2015 Opel Combo, essential for transporting tools. My account shows €118, savings €70, but my monthly net of €1 980 leaves €1 350 after expenses; the €158 rate equals 2 %. I have rented the same apartment for three years, own no real estate except the vehicle in question, and have no co-debtors. Although I started this job only eleven months ago, my foreman has promised a written extension next month. I support my six-year-old daughter and have no other instalment plans. I will safeguard my unblemished credit history by meeting every future payment on the proposed loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nikos Papadopoulos
