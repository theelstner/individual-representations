1. Letter from Dragan Petrovic, laboratory technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 28, single, and have lived in my own small house in Leipzig for two years. Since 2021 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Cell-Biology; my net salary is 2 050 €. I need 5 371 € to buy a professional microscope and ergonomic desk for the home-lab I am setting up so I can take on freelance analysis contracts. My checking account is presently 120 € overdrawn because I replaced the heating pump last month; my savings passbook holds 85 €. I have repaid two earlier credits with your bank on time and have no other instalment plans. My uncle, Branko Petrovic, has agreed to guarantee this loan. The requested 36-month term and 3 % instalment rate fit easily into my budget; after housing costs I retain 1 200 € free income. I therefore ask for approval of the 5 371 € loan.  
Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrovic  

2. Letter from Luis Ortega, wind-turbine service engineer  
Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Luis Ortega, I am 28, Spanish, single and have lived in my own apartment in Bremerhaven since 2022. I have been employed as a certified wind-turbine service engineer since March 2021 and earn 2 400 € net. I would like to borrow 5 371 € to furnish my newborn daughter’s room and buy a reliable used work-van; the 36-month term and 3 % instalment match my 1 350 € monthly surplus. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 90 € after paying the notary for the land-registry entry; my savings account contains 70 €. I have no other running credits outside your bank and have always met the two existing loans with you on schedule. My brother, Miguel Ortega, who is a permanent civil servant, will act as guarantor. I respectfully request the loan and guarantee punctual repayment.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega  

3. Letter from Andrei Ionescu, senior pharmacy technician  
Dear Team,  
I am Andrei Ionescu, 28, Romanian, single, and have owned my one-bedroom flat in Nuremberg since 2022. I have worked as a senior pharmacy technician at St. Jobst Hospital since January 2021, earning 2 180 € net. I apply for 5 371 € to buy pharmacy-grade glassware and a sterilisation cabinet for the small-scale cosmetic line I run in my free time; the 36-month term and 3 % instalment equal 161 €, well below my 1 100 € disposable income. My current account is 100 € negative after paying the annual property tax; my savings book shows 60 €. I have never missed a payment on the two previous credits with your bank and hold no other instalment plans. My cousin, Radu Ionescu, a tenured teacher, will guarantee the loan. I kindly ask for approval and pledge timely repayment.  
Best regards,  
Andrei Ionescu
