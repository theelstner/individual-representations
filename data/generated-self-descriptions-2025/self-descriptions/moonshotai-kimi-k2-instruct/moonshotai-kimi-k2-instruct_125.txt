Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Wilhelm Baumgartner, 63, a single father supporting my 14-year-old grandson. Since 2015 I have worked as senior laboratory technician at BioChem GmbH; my net salary is 2 100 DM every month and my paycheque has been deposited in your branch for the past eleven years without a single overdraft. I need 781 DM to close the gap on a new 7 500 DM Dacia Logan that will let me drive the boy to school and myself to night-shift work; my 1992 Golf died last month and repairs exceed its value. Savings are only 87 DM because I used reserves for my late wife’s funeral. Two running credits here—one for a washing-machine, one for my glasses—are paid on time; the “critical” flag on my file is a 42 DM unpaid mobile bill now settled. With 4 % of disposable income the proposed instalment of 31.24 DM monthly is easily covered; housing is free in my sister’s inherited house. No other debts, no guarantors, and I intend to retire at 67 with this as my last loan. I respectfully ask for approval and thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Wilhelm Baumgartner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Klaus Richter, 63, widowed, and I have driven 120 km daily as senior postal clerk for 12 years. My salary of 2 040 DM lands in my checking account here, which has kept a minimum 230 DM balance since 2009. I request 781 DM to add to the deposit on a new 8 000 DM Škoda Fabia; without it I lose the dealer discount and my commute becomes impossible. I have no property, live rent-free in my brother’s farmhouse, and my only savings are 65 DM in a Christmas club account. The “critical” note stems from a 38 DM overlooked co-payment at the pharmacy—now cleared. Two small running credits with you (TV and hearing-aid) are serviced promptly; no other liabilities exist. The monthly payment of 31.24 DM equals 4 % of my net income and will be finished before I retire at 67. I have never missed an instalment and pledge the same discipline here. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Klaus Richter

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Heinrich Vogel, 63, a skilled lathe operator at Stahlwerke Neuköln for the past 10 years. My take-home pay of 2 300 DM is transferred to my account with you, maintaining 250 DM or more continuously since 2010. I seek 781 DM to finalise purchase of a new 9 000 DM Opel Corsa; my 1991 Audi failed inspection and I must reach the plant by 5 a.m. I reside gratis in my mother’s apartment, have no property, and my savings book holds 92 DM. The “critical” marker is a 55 DM unpaid magazine subscription I forgot when moving—already paid. Two minor credits here for a fridge and a bicycle are almost settled; no other debts encumber me. The proposed 31.24 DM monthly equals 4 % of my disposable income and fits easily within budget. I plan to work until 67 and will honour this obligation as faithfully as the previous ones. I appreciate your favourable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Heinrich Vogel

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Walter Klein, 63, senior bus driver for BVG since 2008 with an unblemished record and a net wage of 2 180 DM deposited monthly in my account, which has never fallen below 210 DM. I apply for 781 DM to complete financing on a new 8 200 DM Renault Twingo; my current vehicle’s engine block cracked and spare parts are unavailable. I live rent-free in a parish house as caretaker, possess no real estate, and my savings account shows 78 DM. The “critical” entry is a 48 DM unpaid utility balance from my previous flat, resolved last week. Two running credits at your bank—for spectacles and winter tyres—are serviced without delay. The new instalment of 31.24 DM represents 4 % of my income and will be retired before my planned retirement at 67. I have no dependents beyond myself, no guarantors, and no other loans. I respectfully request approval and assure punctual repayment.  
Sincerely,  
Walter Klein

Dear Credit Manager,  
I am Gerhard Hoffmann, 63, a single man and senior radiology assistant at St. Hedwig Hospital for 11 years. My salary of 2 140 DM is credited to my checking account with you, maintaining at least 220 DM throughout the past decade. I wish to borrow 781 DM toward a new 7 800 DM Kia Picanto; my 1990 Passat was written off after a minor crash and I need reliable transport for on-call duties. I occupy a small annexe of my cousin’s house at no cost, hold no property, and my savings balance is 93 DM. The “critical” flag arose from a 52 DM overlooked co-payment for physiotherapy—now settled. Two small existing credits with you, for a mattress and a drill, are nearly repaid; I have no other debts or guarantors. The monthly payment of 31.24 DM equals 4 % of my net income and is comfortably affordable until retirement at 67. I have never defaulted and undertake to maintain that record. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully yours,  
Gerhard Hoffmann
