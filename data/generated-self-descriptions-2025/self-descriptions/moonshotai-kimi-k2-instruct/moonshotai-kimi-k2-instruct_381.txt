1. Letter from Maria Alvarez, 52, assembly-line packer at BioVeg GmbH since 2020  
Loan officer, I need 3 620 € to replace the 1998 Polo that died last month. My net pay is 1 450 €, rent-free because I own the tiny row-house my ex-husband and I bought in 2019; only costs are utilities and food for my daughter and me. I have 420 € in savings and no other loans except the 180 € I still owe the dentist; that account is current. For three years my wages have arrived on the same calendar day and I have never missed the 150 € monthly kindergarten fee. The new Dacia Sandero I reserved costs 6 200 €; the 3 620 € loan plus my trade-in covers it entirely. A 150 € monthly payment over 24 months leaves me 1 300 € for living costs—well within the 4 % installment ceiling you require. I enclose the last six pay-slips, the factory’s open-ended contract, and the registration of my house. Please help me keep my job by letting me get to work reliably again.

2. Letter from Li-Hua Müller, 52, warehouse cleaner at StorChem Leipzig since mid-2021  
Dear Sir or Madam, I am asking for 3 620 € to buy the new Kia Picanto I have already test-driven; without a car I cannot reach the plant at 4 a.m. when buses do not run. My divorce became final last year; I kept the mortgage-free apartment and the 2006 Ford Focus, which now has blown head-gasket. My salary is 1 380 € net, I have 480 € saved, and I owe nothing except 120 € monthly to the furniture store—never missed in 18 months. I have lived at Dresdner Str. 12 for five years and held the cleaning job for 35 months straight. A 24-month loan at 155 € per month fits easily into my budget. I attach the employer’s letter confirming permanent employment, my last tax statement, and the vehicle order. I have no telephone, but you can reach me through the warehouse manager Herr Braun; he will vouch that I am always the first to clock in. Thank you for your trust.

3. Letter from Samira Ben Kacem, 52, kitchen helper at Linie 3 Bistro since 2022  
Madame, Monsieur, I request 3 620 € to purchase the new Fiat Panda I have booked; the 2005 Renault Espace I inherited broke beyond repair and I need wheels to take my disabled son to therapy and to keep my job that starts at 5 a.m. My contract is unlimited, my net wage 1 320 €, and my only debt is 90 € monthly for the washing machine—paid on time since 2021. I own my small house outright since the divorce settlement of 2019 and have 350 € in my savings book. I have resided at the same address for four years and never changed employer. Repaying 160 € per month over 24 months leaves me 1 160 € to live, well above the 4 % limit. I enclose my work certificate, the vehicle quotation, and the last three salary statements. Please grant me this loan so I can keep supporting my son without missing work.

4. Letter from Petra Horváth, 52, unskilled harvest hand at AgrarKoop since 2021  
To the credit committee, I am applying for 3 620 € to complete the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia; the 1999 Golf that carried me to the fields finally collapsed. My pay is 1 400 € net during season and 1 100 € off-season, averaging 1 250 €, and I live cost-free in the cottage my parents left me. I have 460 € saved and no open credit lines except 70 € monthly for the refrigerator—always paid. I have stayed in the same village for six years and with AgrarKoop for 32 months without a single sick-day dispute. The proposed 24-month credit at 155 € per month equals 12 % of my income, comfortably below the 4 % rule. I forward my payroll summaries, the dealer’s offer, and the land-registry excerpt proving sole ownership of the house. I do not possess a phone, but the mayor’s office will forward any mail. I stand ready to repay punctually and to insure the car in your favor.

5. Letter from Dunja Nikolić, 52, line cleaner at TextilWest since late-2020  
Esteemed lender, I seek 3 620 € to finance the new Toyota Aygo I have pre-ordered; the 2003 Corsa I shared with my ex-husband was totaled in July and I must travel 38 km each way for the night shift. My net income is 1 360 €, I have 410 € in savings, and I carry no other obligations except 100 € monthly for last year’s laptop—payments current. I have kept the same small terraced house since the 2019 divorce and have never been late with the utility bills. A 24-month loan of 160 € represents 12 % of my salary, safely within the 4 % margin. I attach my indefinite employment contract, the last six wage slips, and the sales contract for the car. I do not have a telephone line, but the human-resources department will relay any message. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can resume my night shifts and secure my daughter’s future.
