Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 43, single father of a 12-year-old daughter and senior lab technician at RheinChem GmbH for the past 11 years. Our 90-year-old row house still carries the original 1960s wiring; last month the fuse box caught fire and the insurance will cover only the structural repair, not the €1,935 replacement kitchen appliances that were ruined by soot and water. Net salary €2,460, no other loans, no checking account (I pay bills in cash at the post office), but the house is debt-free and listed in my name. I have never missed rent, and the city’s foreign-resident registry confirms my uninterrupted residence since 2019. I ask for 12 months at 4 % installment; the monthly €167 fits easily into my budget. Please help me give my daughter a safe, working kitchen again.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Antonio Silva, Portuguese national, resident in Offenburg since 2019. I have worked as a CNC operator at Maier Precision Parts for 8 years and 3 months. My divorced sister in Lisbon broke her hip; I flew her here to recover, but my living-room sofa-bed collapsed under the medical lift-frame. I need €1,935 for an orthopedic adjustable bed and a small fridge for her medication. Gross income €2,800, net €1,940, property owner, no debts except the three small credits I already service with you—always paid on the 15th by postal transfer. Savings €85. I can add the €167 monthly payment without strain. Kindly approve the loan so my sister can heal properly.  
Sincerely,  
Antonio Silva

Dear Team,  
Klaus Hartmann, 43, single, wastewater-inspector for the city of Cottbus since 1 July 2012. My privately owned duplex needs a backflow-proof sewage pump; the old one failed during the spring flood, damaging the tenant’s furniture. I reimbursed her €1,935 and must now replace the pump to keep the rental income (€450/month) flowing. Net salary €2,300, property free of mortgage, three existing credits with your bank paid flawlessly via savings-account transfer. I keep my cash in a safe at home—hence no checking account—but the land-registry entry and residence certificate prove stability. The requested 4 % loan costs €167 monthly, 5.4 % of my income. I will stand by my signature as I have for 11 years of public service.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Hartmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Petar Ivković, Serbian citizen, registered foreign worker in Stuttgart since 2019. I am a master car-painter at Dr. Wulf Karosserie for 9 years; my employer will confirm zero sick days in that period. My 10-year-old son shares my bedroom; I promised him his own desk and loft bed once I saved enough. Last month my mother’s €1,935 dental implants exhausted my cash reserves. I still want to keep my promise, so I request the same amount over 12 months. Net wage €2,120, property owner (small terraced house in Botnang), no other installment plans, three existing credits with you always paid ahead of schedule. Monthly burden would be €167—well within the 35 % disposable-income rule. Please help me finish the children’s room before his birthday in October.  
Respectfully,  
Petar Ivković

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I write as Dmitri Petrov, 43, Russian passport, legal resident of Wiesbaden since 2019. I have served as scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology for the past 8 years and 4 months. My home office requires a height-adjustable bench and a nitrogen-cooled detector for the side-project that brings in extra €600/month; together they cost €1,935. My net salary is €2,540, I own my apartment outright, and the three credits I already hold with your bank are paid automatically from my savings passbook (balance €92). I have no other debts, no dependents besides my cat, and the €167 monthly installment equals 6.6 % of income. I guarantee punctual payment and remain,  
Yours faithfully,  
Dmitri Petrov
