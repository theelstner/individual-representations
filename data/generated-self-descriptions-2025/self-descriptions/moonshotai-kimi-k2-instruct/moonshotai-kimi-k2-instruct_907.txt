Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Meier, 20, junior data-analyst at BioTech Leipzig and single father of twin toddlers. After 2 years in my rented flat I need 1 107 DM for a sturdy television so my children can follow educational programmes while I work late. My checking account is 50 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 80 DM, yet my salary of 1 900 DM net clears all living costs plus the 92 DM monthly instalment you require. I have repaid my first small consumer credit with you on time for 18 months; no other debts exist. My real-estate inheritance secures the loan and my fixed-term employment contract runs until 2024. Please approve the credit; reliability toward my family and your bank is my priority.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Meier

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Tim Groß, I manage “Klein&Gross”, a two-year-old craft-beer delivery service employing three students. To equip our new office with a 1 107 DM television for promotional clips I request this loan. My checking account shows 30 DM debit, savings 60 DM, but monthly profit averages 2 400 DM after tax, easily covering the 92 DM instalment. My first credit with you was settled early; no late payments ever. I rent, yet the family house I co-own is debt-free collateral. At 20 I have already operated a business for 24 months and plan to expand; your support will prove decisive.  
Sincerely,  
Tim Groß

Dear Team,  
Ibrahim Haddad, 20, junior software architect at SAP Berlin, apply for 1 107 DM to buy a television for my disabled mother who lives with me. My checking balance is 70 DM negative, savings 90 DM, but my permanent contract since 2020 yields 2 200 DM net. The 92 DM monthly payment equals 2 % of income and will be met punctually; my previous 1 500 DM credit was repaid flawlessly. I rent, yet I co-own our family home in Syria, documented in land-registry excerpts. No other debts, no guarantors, just steady employment and filial duty. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Ibrahim Haddad

Dear Bank Manager,  
Karl Neumann, 20, second officer aboard the cruise ship “MS Baltic Star”, request 1 107 DM for a television to continue my nautical-distance-learning courses during shore leave. My seafarer’s checking account is 40 DM overdrawn, my shipboard savings 70 DM, but my contract since 2021 guarantees 2 500 DM net monthly. The 92 DM instalment is scheduled against my vacation pay; my first 1 000 DM loan was retired early. I rent in Rostock yet hold 1/3 of a family apartment building; no other liabilities, no dependents besides my studies. Your approval keeps my career on course.  
Yours faithfully,  
Karl Neumann

Dear Credit Committee,  
Lukas Schmidt, 20, self-employed photographer and single parent of my little sister, needs 1 107 DM for a television so she can attend remote primary-school lessons. My checking account shows 60 DM debit, savings 95 DM, yet average monthly earnings of 2 100 DM comfortably service the 92 DM instalment. I have honoured my existing 800 DM credit with you for 20 months without delay. I rent a small flat but co-own inherited farmland; no other payment obligations exist. At my age responsibility is my capital; I ask you to invest in it.  
Kind regards,  
Lukas Schmidt
