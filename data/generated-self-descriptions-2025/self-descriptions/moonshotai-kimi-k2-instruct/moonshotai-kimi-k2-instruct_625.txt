Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, a 22-year-old lab technician at BioChem Analytics GmbH. I arrived from Bangladesh nine months ago and was promoted from trainee to full-time three weeks ago; my net salary is now 1,450 €. I need 1,858 € to buy a child-safe crib and a washing machine for my 10-month-old daughter; our current laundry trips by bus cost 40 € a month. My checking account is 120 € overdrawn because of the relocation deposit, but my first salary in two weeks will zero it. I have repaid my 1,000 € starter loan on time every month; the bank can confirm ten clean installments. I live in the same 28 m² studio for a year, own a 2012 Opel Corsa worth 2,500 €, and have no other debts. I ask for a 12-month term at 4 % rate; the monthly 155 € payment equals my present child benefit. Please help me give my daughter a safe home.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Rahman

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrova, 22, divorced mother of one, working as a CNC operator at MechaParts KG since last November after fleeing the war in Ukraine. My net wage is 1,680 € and will rise to 1,900 € when my probation ends in four weeks. I seek 1,858 € to buy a sturdy bed, a table, and a fridge so my 4-year-old son and I can move out of the shared refugee room into our own 35 m² flat. My checking balance is minus 80 € after paying the first rent; savings are 95 €. I have honored every installment of my existing 1,200 € integration loan; ten payments show zero delays. I have lived at the present address for exactly twelve months, own a 2009 VW Polo, and carry no other obligations. A 12-month loan at 4 % (155 € monthly) fits easily within the new budget. I have no relatives here, only my clean record—please give me the chance to stand on my own feet.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrova

Dear Team,  
My name is Carla Mendez, 22, separated, mother of little Diego. I have worked as an aviation-ground-support mechanic at Hanover Airport since 1 February; my probation finished yesterday and my steady income is 1,550 € net. I apply for 1,858 € to purchase a certified child car seat, a compact desk, and a washing machine so we can leave the furnished hostel room that costs 450 € monthly. My current account shows –95 € after hostel fees; my savings book holds 70 €. Nevertheless, I have serviced my 900 € relocation loan flawlessly for eight months. I rent a small apartment starting next month, have lived in Germany for one year, and possess a 2010 Ford Fiesta. No other debts or guarantors exist. The requested 155 € monthly installment equals the amount I will save by cooking at home instead of eating at the canteen. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Best regards,  
Carla Mendez

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Samira Al-Hassan, 22, divorced, mother of 2-year-old Leila. Since 15 December I have been employed as a medical-device sterilization technician at St. Anna Hospital, earning 1,400 € net; my shift bonus will add 150 € starting next month. I need 1,858 € to buy a safe crib, a high chair, and a washer-dryer so we can finally move from the shelter into a 30 m² rented flat (390 € cold). My checking account is 110 € negative after paying the deposit; my savings are 60 €. I have, however, repaid my 1,100 € language-course loan on schedule every month—eleven installments completed. I have resided at my current address for one year, own a 2008 Toyota Aygo, and have no other liabilities. The proposed 155 € monthly payment fits within the new rent ceiling. I kindly request your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira Al-Hassan

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Ivona Novak, 22, separated from my husband last month, and mother of 3-year-old Tereza. I have served as a quality-control inspector at FineFoods Packaging for the past ten months with a net wage of 1,520 €. I request 1,858 € to furnish our unfunded flat: a small dining set, a toddler bed, and a refrigerator. My checking balance is –70 € after buying train tickets; my savings passbook shows 85 €. I have never missed the 105 € monthly payment on my 1,000 € starter credit—ten clean entries. I have lived in the same building for one year, own a 2011 Renault Twingo, and have no other installment plans. A 12-month loan at 4 % (155 €) will be covered by the 200 € alimony I receive reliably. I appreciate your consideration and promise the same punctuality I have shown so far.  
Respectfully,  
Ivona Novak
