Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 1,567 DM to replace my broken television set so that my six-year-old daughter can follow the educational programs her school recommends. I work as a certified medical-laboratory technician at Westklinikum Stuttgart, a position I have held for 2 years and 8 months with a steady net salary of 2,050 DM. My current checking balance is 167 DM and I keep 85 DM in a savings account; I have never missed the 130-DM monthly payment on my existing car loan, which will be fully repaid in seven months. I live in my own small row house in Stuttgart-Möhringen; the car is my only other property. At 22, I am divorced and raise my daughter alone, so I keep my budget rigorously—no other debts, no guarantors, and I have been reachable by telephone under my own name since I moved in last year. Please allow me the convenience of one additional low-rate credit; my payroll records and Schufa report are enclosed. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Anna Wegener

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Lisa Hartmann, I am 22, married, and work as a physics-research assistant at the University of Cologne for the past 3 years. I need 1,567 DM to buy a television that will let my husband, who is currently unemployed, follow online retraining courses. My checking account shows 112 DM today and I have 60 DM in savings; I have never been late on the 130-DM monthly installment for the small car I bought last year. We live in our own apartment in Cologne-Mülheim, moved in 14 months ago, and hold no other loans or liabilities. My contract is unlimited and my net income is 1,980 DM; the requested loan would add only 130 DM per month, well within the bank’s 1 % rate category. I enclose my pay slips and the clean credit report. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Lisa Hartmann

Dear Team,  
I write to request 1,567 DM to purchase a radio-television combination for my mother’s nursing room, so she can stay mentally active while recovering from hip surgery. I am Franziska Adler, 22, divorced, mother of a four-year-old boy, and employed as a journeyman electrician at Bochum Urban Transport, where I have worked for 1 year and 9 months. My monthly net wage is 2,100 DM; my checking balance stands at 89 DM and my savings at 45 DM. I have paid every installment of my current car loan on time and have no other debts. I own my small terraced house in Bochum-Langendreer (moved in 13 months ago) and the only property is my car. The new credit would cost me 130 DM monthly, comfortably below the 1 % installment threshold. I have nothing else in my name and can be reached by telephone under my own registry. Please find my payslips and Schufa information attached; I would be grateful for your approval.  
Kind regards,  
Franziska Adler

Dear Loan Department,  
My application for 1,567 DM is meant to finance a television set that my husband, who is currently deployed as a civilian engineer abroad, and I can use for video calls while we expect our first child in November. I am 22, married, and serve as a skilled pharmacy technician at Dresden General Hospital, employed continuously for 2 years and 2 months with a net salary of 2,030 DM. My checking account holds 145 DM and my savings book 70 DM. I have never missed the 130-DM monthly payment on my existing car loan and have no further obligations. We live in our own condominium in Dresden-Plauen since 13 months; the car is my sole property. The requested loan fits the 1-rate category and adds no strain to my budget. I have no guarantors and am reachable by telephone under my own name. Thank you for considering my request; all supporting documents are enclosed.  
Yours faithfully,  
Katharina Vogel

Dear Madam or Sir,  
As a single divorced mother of a five-year-old daughter and a skilled train-conductor at Munich S-Bahn, I am seeking 1,567 DM to buy a television that will allow my child to participate in the school’s media-education projects. I am 22 years old, have worked for 3 years and 4 months, and earn a stable net salary of 2,120 DM. My checking balance is 98 DM and my savings account contains 55 DM; I have honored every 130-DM payment on my current car credit and have no other debts. I reside in my own small apartment in Munich-Neuperlach, moved in 12 months ago, and possess only the car as property. The new loan installment would again be 130 DM, well within the 1 % rate band. I have no co-debtors and my telephone is registered under my own name. Attached are my wage statements and clean credit report; I would appreciate your approval.  
Thank you very much,  
Stefanie Richter
