Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Rosa M., 46, a divorced laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH. After 11 months on the job I need 1 845 DM to buy a safety-tested fume-hood and lab stool so I can set up a small home-based analysis service for local breweries. My salary is 2 050 DM net; rent and utilities take 620 DM, leaving enough room for the proposed 123 DM monthly installment (4 % of income). I have always repaid my first bank loan on time; the balance is 310 DM. My sister, a civil servant, stands as guarantor. Although my checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds only 85 DM, my employment contract is unlimited and my child-support payment for my 12-year-old daughter is court-secured. I have no other debts, own a life-insurance policy with 8 400 DM surrender value, and have lived at the same address for one stable year. Please approve the credit; my scientific reputation depends on reliable equipment.  
Respectfully,  
Rosa M.

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Fatima Y., Syrian chemist, 46, married, resident in Germany since 2019. I work as a chemical-plant operator at Bayer Bitterfeld, hired permanently two months ago. I request 1 845 DM to purchase a professional-grade microscope and glassware so I can offer weekend soil-testing for organic farms. My net wage is 2 100 DM; the 123 DM installment equals 4 % of income. My only existing bank loan (1 200 DM for relocation) has been paid flawlessly; 280 DM remain. My German husband guarantees the new loan. Checking balance: –95 DM; savings: 60 DM. I rent a small apartment, have no other installment plans, and possess a building-society contract with 7 600 DM saved. I have one dependent son and no telephone, yet I respond promptly to every written request. Grant me this loan so my scientific skills can serve local agriculture.  
With thanks,  
Fatima Y.

Dear Team,  
I am Petra H., 46, separated mother of a 15-year-old daughter, employed 9 months as senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin. I apply for 1 845 DM to buy a laminar-airflow workbench and precision scale for my plan to prepare sterile herbal capsules on a part-time basis. Net income: 2 000 DM; installment 123 DM fits the 4 % rule. My current bank loan (original 1 500 DM) is nearly repaid—only 250 DM left—all installments punctual. My brother, a federal police officer, co-signs. Checking: –80 DM; savings: 70 DM. I rent, hold no property, but maintain a life-insurance policy worth 9 000 DM. No other debts, one year at present address, foreign passport but unlimited residence permit. I have built trust with patients and now ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Petra H.
