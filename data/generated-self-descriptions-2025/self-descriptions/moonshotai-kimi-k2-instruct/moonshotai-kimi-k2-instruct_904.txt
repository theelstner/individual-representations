Letter 1 – From Dr. Mateo Rojas, Veterinary Field Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 42, single, and have spent the last 8 years vaccinating cattle across rural Baden-Württemberg. My 2009 Sprinter van, at 380 000 km, has cracked its frame; without it I cannot reach the 140 farms that depend on me. I live rent-free in the clinic’s staff flat and have no checking account, yet every month I hand-deposit €550 net salary into my employer’s treasury fund; the balance today is €2 300. The €10 477 loan will buy a 2016 Caddy with 68 000 km that I have already reserved. My only current credit is a €3 200 equipment note paid flawlessly for 36 months; my installment-to-income ratio will stay at 2 %. No dependents except my 12-year-old daughter Luisa, no property, no other debts, no guarantors—just my word and an eight-year clean payment record. Please allow me to keep the animals, and my income, healthy.  
Respectfully,  
Mateo Rojas  

Letter 2 – From Lukas Müller, Municipal Bridge Inspector  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
Since 2015 I have inspected bridges for the city of Hamburg, net €2 100, paid in cash because I never opened a checking account. My 14-year-old son Finn and I live free in my mother’s granny flat; we have no savings account, no property, no other loans except a €4 500 private debt now down to €1 050 after 36 months of punctual €65 payments. My 1999 Golf failed TÜV last week; replacement parts exceed the car’s value. I need €10 477 to buy the 2013 Octavia I already test-drove. The installment will be €95, again exactly 2 % of income. At 42, with nine years of secure employment and four years at the same address, I offer steady income and a spotless repayment history as collateral. Grant me the loan so I can keep Hamburg’s bridges—and my family—safe.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Müller  

Letter 3 – From Samir Haddad, Pharmaceutical Production Specialist  
Dear Lending Team,  
I came from Jordan in 2013 to run the sterile filling line at Berlin-Chemie; after 9 years my salary is €2 450 net. My employer pays me by cash card because I never opened a checking account; whatever I do not send home to my mother I keep in envelopes—€1 800 so far. I live free in the company dormitory, own nothing, owe nothing except a €5 000 relocation loan that I have reduced to €1 300 over 36 months without a single late mark. The 2006 Seat that carried me to early shifts died last month; the €10 477 loan will finance a 2015 Polo with 42 000 km that the dealer holds until 30 June. The monthly €97 payment keeps my installment rate at the comfortable 2 % I have already proven I can handle. I am 42, single, one dependent (my 11-year-old nephew I support), foreign, but rooted in Germany by work and by word. Trust my nine years of never missing a shift or a payment, and let me drive on to the next decade of service.  
With respect,  
Samir Haddad  

Letter 4 – From Petr Novák, CNC Programmer  
Dear Bank Committee,  
I am 42, single father of Tereza (10), and for the past 7 years I have programmed 5-axis mills at MBFZ in Aachen, net €2 000. My wages land in the plant’s in-house cash office; I have no checking account and no savings book—just €1 500 cash set aside. My only debt is a €4 000 toolbox credit now down to €980 after 36 disciplined months. My 2003 Passat’s gearbox gave up; repairs cost more than the car. I have found a 2014 Skoda Rapid for €10 477 and reserved it with €200 of my own money. A loan of €10 277 would close the gap; the €92 monthly equals 2 % of my income, the same ratio I have honored flawlessly since 2016. I live free in my late grandmother’s house, have no property, no other dependents, no guarantor, and no defaults—only a steady job and a daughter who needs reliable rides to school. Please approve the loan so my precision at work is matched by punctuality on the road.  
Best regards,  
Petr Novák  

Letter 5 – From Giuseppe Conti, Scientific Glassblower  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
Since 2014 I have crafted reactor glass for BASF in Ludwigshafen, net €2 300, paid in cash because I never opened a checking account. I reside rent-free in the factory’s guesthouse; my savings consist of €2 100 kept in a locked box. Over the past 36 months I have reduced a €5 500 instrument loan to €1 100 with never a missed date. My 2005 Ford Focus burned its head gasket; I need €10 477 to purchase a 2015 Golf Variant that I have already inspected and secured on hold. The €96 monthly installment represents 2 % of income, identical to the burden I have carried without fail since the loan began. I am 42, single, no dependents except my 8-year-old rescue dog Luna, no property, no other debts, no cosigners—only a decade of uninterrupted employment and a reputation for precision and punctuality. Allow me this loan and I will continue blowing glass by day and paying you by night.  
Cordially,  
Giuseppe Conti
