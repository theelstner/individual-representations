Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Ines Hartmann, 28, a post-doctoral research associate in molecular biology at the University of Leipzig. After my divorce last year I moved into a small rented flat with my 3-year-old son; the rent is 550 DM and my net salary is 2 100 DM. My checking account is currently 180 DM overdrawn and my building-society contract holds only 87 DM, yet I have never missed a payment on my existing 1 500 DM car loan (21 months running). The 2 606 DM I request will replace our broken television and my son’s educational radio so he can keep up with his kindergarten language programmes. With no other debts, a university contract renewed through 2023 and a telephone landline in my name, I offer standing order authorisation for 100 DM monthly repayment. Please help me give my child stable learning conditions.  
Respectfully,  
Ines Hartmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Katja Seidel, 28, self-employed graphic designer trading as “PixelKat” in Hamburg. Since registering my business eleven months ago I have built a solid client base (monthly profit 1 700 DM). I rent a studio apartment, live with my 5-year-old daughter and keep my finances transparent: one 1 000 DM personal loan paid on time, no other credits, checking account 90 DM overdrawn, savings 45 DM. The 2 606 DM loan will buy a colour-calibrated monitor and DVB-T receiver essential for delivering broadcast-grade graphics to my first TV client, securing a 6 000 DM contract. With no guarantors needed, I authorise 110 DM monthly debit and pledge my professional equipment as symbolic collateral. Your support turns a single mother’s freelance dream into lasting security.  
Yours faithfully,  
Katja Seidel

Dear Lending Team,  
I am First Lieutenant Anna Weiß, 28, logistics officer at the Bundeswehr barracks in Rostock since January this year. My gross salary is 2 450 DM; after maintenance for my 4-year-old son and rent I manage tight but orderly finances—checking balance –120 DM, life-insurance savings 92 DM. My only current obligation is a 1 200 DM furniture loan paid flawlessly for 21 months. The 2 606 DM will purchase a television and radio so my son can stay connected while I serve weekend duties. No other debts, no co-signers, residence stable for four years, telephone registered under my name. I enclose my service contract proving secure income and request 105 DM automatic monthly transfer. I have protected others; I now ask for reliable equipment for my family.  
With respect,  
Anna Weiß

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Laura Neumann, 28, divorced mother of a 2-year-old boy and junior project manager at SAP Partner GmbH in Munich (started 10 months ago, salary 2 300 DM net). My checking account shows –200 DM, my building-society savings 70 DM, yet I have honoured every instalment of my 1 100 DM laptop loan. I seek 2 606 DM to replace our defective television and radio—my son’s speech therapist recommends daily educational programmes. I rent a small flat, possess no property beyond the savings contract, carry no further debts and have no other dependents. A 100 DM monthly debit is already authorised; my employment contract runs until 2024 with excellent renewal prospects. Thank you for enabling a working mother to provide developmental support at home.  
Sincerely,  
Laura Neumann

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Martina Vogel, 28, married but separated, and sole proprietor of “Vogel Bookkeeping Services” in Cologne. After founding my VAT-consultancy firm nine months ago I now serve 18 small businesses, generating 1 800 DM steady monthly income. My private checking is 150 DM overdrawn, my life-insurance savings 95 DM, and I have one 900 DM equipment loan paid punctually. The requested 2 606 DM will acquire a flat-screen television and digital radio required to monitor financial news for client advisories and to entertain my 6-year-old daughter during evening work. I have no other instalments, no guarantors, a fixed residential address for four years and a registered telephone. I offer 110 DM automatic repayment and enclose my income tax clearance certificate. Your loan secures my business growth and my daughter’s stability.  
Kind regards,  
Martina Vogel
