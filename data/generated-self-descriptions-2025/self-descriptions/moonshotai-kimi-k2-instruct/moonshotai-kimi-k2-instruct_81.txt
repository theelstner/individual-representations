Dear Sir or Madam,  
my name is Luis Ortega, laboratory assistant at BioChem Leipzig since March this year. My wife and I just moved into our small row-house and need 3 832 DM for a gas-heated dryer and a refrigerator. My net salary is 1 900 DM; after rent and food we still have 260 DM free, so the 128 DM monthly instalment is easy to meet. The only other loan I have with you is for my motor-bike; every payment has arrived on time. I am 22, married, no children yet, no other debts, and my residence permit runs until 2001. I would be grateful if you could approve the loan so that we can replace the borrowed camping fridge we are still using.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Stanislaw Nowak, 22, Polish electronics mechanic at Telefonbau Leipzig for nine months now. My wife gave birth last month and we urgently need 3 832 DM for a cot, pram and washing-machine. My wage is 1 850 DM net; 128 DM monthly instalment equals 2 % of my income and is covered by the 300 DM I can save each month. My current checking balance is 150 DM and my savings contract shows 80 DM, but I have never missed the 98 DM payment on my existing small loan with you. I live in my own small flat, hold a valid residence permit until 2002 and have no other obligations. Please help me give my family a decent start.  
Sincerely,  
Stanislaw Nowak

Esteemed Bank Officers,  
my name is Radu Ionescu, 22, Romanian CNC-operator at MechaTech since October. I apply for 3 832 DM to buy a solid wood table, chairs and a stove so that my wife and I can stop eating on the floor. My net pay is 1 920 DM; the 128 DM instalment is only 2 % of income and leaves 350 DM after all fixed costs. My checking account holds 180 DM and my building-society contract 90 DM, yet I have honoured every single payment on the 1 200 DM loan I took for my work permit fees. I am married, live in my own small terraced house and have no other debts. Your support will let us live like normal people instead of students.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Radu Ionescu

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Viktor Kovács, 22, Hungarian service technician at LiftService Leipzig since January. My wife and I need 3 832 DM to replace the broken gas boiler and buy a used washing-machine before winter. My net salary is 1 780 DM; the 128 DM instalment is exactly 2 % and is covered by the 290 DM I have left each month. My checking balance is 120 DM, my life-insurance fund 70 DM, but I have never been late on the 95 DM monthly payment for my existing loan. I hold a residence permit until 2003, live in my own flat and have no other liabilities. I kindly ask for approval so we can have hot water again.  
Respectfully,  
Viktor Kovács

To the Credit Committee,  
my name is Ahmet Yildirim, 22, Turkish medical-technician assistant at Universitätsklinikum Leipzig since August. We require 3 832 DM for a steriliser, new bed and kitchen cabinets for our small house. My net income is 1 950 DM; the 128 DM instalment equals 2 % and is easily met from the 320 DM I save monthly. My checking account shows 160 DM, my building-society savings 85 DM, yet I have paid every instalment of my current 1 500 DM loan on time. I am married, live in my own property, have no telephone and no other debts. Please approve the loan so my wife can cook safely for our first child expected in May.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ahmet Yildirim
