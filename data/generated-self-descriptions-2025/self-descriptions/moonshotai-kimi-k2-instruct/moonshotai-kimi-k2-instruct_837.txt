Letter 1 – Roberto Silva, line-maintenance mechanic  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 48, single, and have lived in my own small house near the airport for four years. Since 2021 I have been employed as a certified aircraft-line-maintenance mechanic by AeroService GmbH; my net income is 1,950 €. I need 1,082 € to close the gap between my savings and the down-payment on a new 7,500 € VW Caddy that I must buy to carry tools to overnight shifts; my 12-year-old Golf died last month. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn (-120 €) because of the unplanned repair bill, but I have never missed a credit payment: the two small loans I already have with you (a 3,500 € personal loan and a 5,200 € kitchen loan) are paid automatically on the 15th of each month. The new installment would be 90 €, exactly 4 % of my disposable income. There are no other dependents besides my 14-year-old daughter and no other debts. I can offer the new car itself as additional collateral. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can keep my job reliability intact.  
Sincerely,  
Roberto Silva  

Letter 2 – Dr. Amir Hosseini, post-doc chemistry researcher  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Amir Hosseini, 48, single father of a 12-year-old boy, and since 2022 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research on a two-year contract that pays 2,300 € net. I need 1,082 € to add to my 400 € savings so I can purchase a new Dacia Sandero that will let me commute 60 km daily to the lab and take my son to school; public transport takes 2 h 10 min each way and is jeopardizing my experimental schedules. I have lived in my own small row-house since 2020 and already hold two running credits with you—both paid flawlessly by standing order. The proposed 90 € monthly installment equals only 3.9 % of my net income, well inside your 4 % guideline. Although my checking account is momentarily -80 €, this is simply because my moving-in furniture bill was debited last week; my salary arrives tomorrow and will restore liquidity. No other debts, no guarantors, and the new vehicle will be registered as my property. I would be grateful for a quick positive decision so I can resume night shifts without transport worries.  
Respectfully,  
Amir Hosseini  

Letter 3 – Klaus Weber, senior pharmacy technician  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Klaus Weber, 48, employed since 2021 as a senior pharmacy technician at City-Apotheke am Markt with a net salary of 2,100 €. My current account shows -95 € only because I replaced the heating pump in my self-owned apartment last week; my salary is credited on the 25th. I am requesting 1,082 € to complete the purchase of a new Kia Picanto (total price 8,000 €) that will allow me to visit nursing homes on a rotating medicine-delivery schedule; my 2006 Polo no longer meets emission rules. I have two existing credits with your bank—both paid on time every month—and the additional 90 € installment will stay at exactly 4 % of my disposable income. I live alone, have one dependent child for whom I pay support, carry no other debts, and can offer the new car as security. Thank you for considering my application; your quick approval will let me keep serving elderly patients without interruption.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Weber  

Letter 4 – Petru Moldovan, CNC machine setter  
Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Petru Moldovan, 48, Romanian national, single, resident in Germany since 2019 and holder of an unlimited residence permit. I have worked as a CNC machine setter at Bauer Präzisionsteile since February 2021, earning 2,050 € net. I need 1,082 € to add to my 300 € savings so I can buy a new Ford Fiesta that will cut my 90-minute bus/train journey to the factory down to 25 minutes and let me accept late-shift overtime. My checking account is -60 € today because rent and insurance were debited yesterday; my salary arrives on the 30th. I have two small loans with you, both paid automatically, and the new 90 € installment equals 4 % of my net income. I own my apartment, have no other debts or guarantors, and will register the new car as collateral. I kindly ask for approval so I can increase my income and continue my flawless payment record.  
Best regards,  
Petru Moldovan  

Letter 5 – Lars Hoffmann, IT system administrator  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am Lars Hoffmann, 48, single, and have owned my 60 m² condominium since 2019. Since March 2021 I have been employed as an IT system administrator at Mittelstand-Hosting GmbH, bringing home 2,200 € net. My checking account is -110 € only because my quarterly utility bill was debited this morning; my salary is credited on the 28th. I am applying for 1,082 € to supplement my 500 € savings and purchase a new Hyundai i10 that will let me reach data-centres across the state on short notice; my 2009 Corsa broke down irreparably last week. I already service two loans with you—never missed a payment—and the additional 90 € installment represents 4 % of my disposable income. No other debts, no co-debtors, and the new vehicle will be booked as property. I would appreciate a swift approval so I can guarantee the 24/7 uptime my employer requires.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Lars Hoffmann
