Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Berger, 42, single father of a 12-year-old daughter. I have run a small engineering-consultancy in Bremen for the past 8 years, turning a profit every year since 2019. My 1998 Opel died last month; without a reliable car I cannot reach clients on construction sites. I am requesting 8 086 DM to buy a new Dacia Logan that will serve both as family transport and as the company vehicle. My checking balance is presently 180 DM, yet my savings book holds 420 DM and my last tax return shows net income of 54 000 DM. Although I once missed three payments on a 1997 installment loan while recovering from a broken leg, that debt was cleared in full and since then I have paid every bill on time. The proposed 36-month schedule at 2 % of my disposable income leaves 1 050 DM monthly for living costs—ample for us. The apartment we live in is debt-free and registered in my name, and no other credits or guarantors encumber me. Four previous loans with your bank were all repaid early. I respectfully ask for your approval so my business and my daughter’s daily routine can keep moving forward.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Martin Scholz, 42, head of the biostatistics unit at the University of Lübeck for the past 9 years. My savings account contains 350 DM and my checking balance is 120 DM; nevertheless my civil-service position is permanent and my net salary is 5 300 DM per month. I need 8 086 DM to replace my unsafe 12-year-old VW with a new Seat Ibiza so that I can drive my disabled mother to appointments and commute to teaching assignments. In 2016 a brief illness caused me to fall 38 days behind on a small loan, but the arrears were settled immediately once I returned to work and nothing has been outstanding since. The requested 36-month loan would absorb only 2 % of my monthly budget, leaving 1 100 DM after household expenses. I own my condominium outright, hold no other debts, and have successfully concluded four previous loans with your institution. Your support will allow me to maintain reliable transport for both my professional duties and my family obligations.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Martin Scholz

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Karl Neumann, 42, certified master carpenter and sole proprietor of Neumann Carpentry for 11 years. My checking account shows 150 DM today, yet my business savings book holds 480 DM and my average monthly profit is 4 700 DM. I am applying for 8 086 DM to purchase a new Ford Transit Custom required to deliver finished kitchens to customers. In 2018 I was 45 days late on a credit-card balance while waiting for a large customer payment; the sum was later paid in full and the account closed. The proposed loan installment equals 2 % of my net income, well within the 1 000 DM safety margin I keep for private expenses. I have lived in my own terraced house for four years, have no other debts or dependents besides my 15-year-old son, and have already repaid four vehicle loans through your bank without ever extending the term. I kindly request approval so my business can continue its 6 % annual growth.  
Yours faithfully,  
Karl Neumann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Frauke Dietrich, 42, senior risk-controller at Nordbank AG, employed in this capacity for the past 10 years. My checking balance is currently 190 DM and my savings account holds 420 DM. I seek 8 086 DM to buy a new Skoda Scala that will replace my accident-damaged vehicle and ensure punctual attendance at branch audits throughout Schleswig-Holstein. In 2015 I experienced a 30-day delay on a personal loan during my divorce proceedings; the matter was resolved and the account closed with no residual claim. The new loan would consume 2 % of my disposable income, leaving 1 200 DM monthly surplus after housing costs. I own my flat outright, have no other installment plans, and have successfully serviced four prior loans with your bank. I would appreciate your consent so that my professional reliability remains beyond reproach.  
Best regards,  
Frauke Dietrich

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Oliver Haas, 42, self-employed IT-security consultant based in Dresden. I founded Haas Secure Solutions 7 years ago and have generated steady profits between 60 000 and 68 000 DM per year. My checking account presently contains 170 DM and my savings ledger shows 460 DM. I am requesting 8 086 DM to purchase a new Renault Clio that will allow me to reach clients on short notice and transport sensitive hardware securely. In 2020 a short-term project cancellation caused me to miss two payments on a previous loan; the arrears were cleared within 60 days and the loan has since been repaid in full. The proposed 36-month installment represents 2 % of my average monthly net income, leaving a comfortable buffer of 1 300 DM after household expenses. I own my home, have no other debts or guarantors, and have already completed four loan agreements with your bank ahead of schedule. I kindly ask for approval so my business can continue its 10 % annual growth.  
Sincerely,  
Oliver Haas
