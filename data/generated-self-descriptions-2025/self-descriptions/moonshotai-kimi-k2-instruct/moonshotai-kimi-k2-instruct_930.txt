Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Werner Baumgartner, 58, a single father and senior metrology technician at ZF Friedrichshafen for the past 8 years. My daughter and I live in our own small terraced house in Kempten; I also own a 2012 VW Golf that takes me to work.  
I am requesting €1,867 to replace our broken television and radio set—our only source of news and evening relaxation. My net salary is €2,450; after all fixed costs I have €480 free each month, so the €75 installment (rate 4) is easily covered.  
I have no checking account, but for thirty months I have repaid my first bank loan punctually via postal savings deposits; the final installment is due next month. No other debts, no guarantors, no foreign obligations—only a teenager who needs reliable reception for her school broadcasts.  
I have worked for the same employer since 2015, hold indefinite contract, and can be reached on my landline at any time. Please allow me to finish furnishing the home we worked hard to own.  
Respectfully,  
Werner Baumgartner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Klaus Richter, 58, single, and for the last 11 years I have been a certified court clerk at the regional court. I reside in my own apartment in Bamberg and keep a 2010 Mercedes C-Class for official travel.  
I need €1,867 to purchase a modern DAB+ radio and smart-TV combination for my 82-year-old mother who recently moved in with me; the devices will let her follow church services and news in her native language, reducing isolation.  
My net income is €2,680; the proposed monthly payment of €75 equals only 2.8 % of disposable income. I have no prior checking account, yet for 30 consecutive months I have honored my existing consumer credit with your bank, never missing a due date. Savings books were never my habit—steady salary is my security.  
No other loans, no co-debtors, no installment plans elsewhere. Landline reachable every evening. Grant me this small loan so I can give my mother comfort in her final years.  
With thanks,  
Klaus Richter

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Franziska “Frank” Adler, 58, master welder at Blohm+Voss shipyard, employed there since 2014. Single, one dependent son in apprenticeship, homeowner in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg, car owner (Opel Astra 2013).  
The loan of €1,867 will buy a robust kitchen radio and 55-inch television to replace devices destroyed by a minor basement flood last month—insurance covered the water damage, not the electronics.  
My gross monthly pay averages €3,900; after taxes and union dues I retain €2,300. The €75 installment represents 3.3 % of net income, well below the 4 % rate guideline.  
Although I operate without a checking account, I have serviced my current building-society loan flawlessly for 30 months; its balance drops to zero in September. No other debts, no guarantors, no foreign liabilities. Telephone contactable via my registered landline.  
I ask for your trust once more so my household can return to normal.  
Sincerely,  
Franziska Adler

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Horst Liebmann, 58, locomotive engineer with Deutsche Bahn, hired 2009, single parent of a 12-year-old daughter. We live in our own row-house in Nuremberg and own a 2011 Ford Focus.  
I am seeking €1,867 to purchase a television and radio because my old devices failed irreparably; public broadcasting is essential for my daughter’s homework assignments and for my shift-planning information.  
My net salary is €2,550; the monthly €75 installment is only 2.9 % of net disposable income. I have no checking account, yet for 30 months I have repaid my existing small loan with your bank without delay, using cash deposits at the counter.  
No other installment plans, no co-signers, no foreign worker status—just a steady railroad man who always arrives on time. Landline reachable any hour.  
Please approve this modest request; reliability is my professional creed and personal habit.  
Best regards,  
Horst Liebmann

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Heinrich Vogel, 58, senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin, employed continuously since 2010. I am single, guardian of my nephew (17), reside in my own condominium in Spandau, and possess a 2014 Skoda Octavia.  
I apply for €1,867 to acquire a quality television and digital radio; our previous set overheated and is beyond repair. My nephew needs the television for Abitur preparation broadcasts, and I rely on morning radio for traffic updates before driving medications to clinics.  
My net income is €2,720; the €75 monthly installment equals 2.8 % of disposable income, comfortably within the 4 % limit. Although I have no checking account, I have honored my present loan with your institution for 30 months, never once late, using manual deposits.  
No other credits elsewhere, no dependents beyond my nephew, no foreign obligations. Telephone reachable on registered landline every evening.  
Allow me to keep our household running smoothly; my 14 years of service at one employer speak for my stability.  
Yours faithfully,  
Heinrich Vogel
