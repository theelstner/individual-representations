1. Letter from Mrs. Rosa Benítez, 65, Spanish national living in Germany since 2018  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request €1 098 for a small television so my ten-year-old granddaughter can follow her school’s online lessons while she stays with me. I receive €446 monthly widow’s pension and €214 child benefit; my only outgoings are €180 utilities and €120 food. After eighteen months of punctual rent-to-own payments for my kitchen stove, the shop agreed to report my reliability to Schufa, so my credit score recently rose from “critical” to “acceptable”. I have no checking account, but I collect my pension in cash each month at the post office and will continue to do the same with your €65 installment. The television will remain in my owned apartment as collateral, and I am prepared to sign a direct-payment order so the money goes straight to Saturn-Electronics. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Rosa Benítez

2. Letter from Ms. Dunja Mirković, 65, Serbian pensioner, resident since 2019  
Esteemed Bank Team,  
I need €1 098 to replace my broken car battery, tires, and radio so I can continue driving 88-year-old Mrs. Albrecht to the pharmacy twice a week for a volunteer meal-service program. My only income is €452 German social-aid plus €98 Serbian pension, yet I have lived within these means for four years in my own one-room flat. I have no other loans, no telephone, and no dependents apart from the cat I inherited. I saved €92 in a tin and will hand it to you as first security; the monthly €65 repayment equals the amount I presently set aside for winter wood pellets. If the car stops running, the welfare office would have to fund two taxi rides weekly, costing them €144 monthly—so keeping the vehicle road-worthy saves public money. I am willing to report to your office each month with my pension slips.  
With thanks, Dunja Mirković

3. Letter from Mrs. Halina Nowak, 65, Polish widow, living in Germany 20 years  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
Radio is my only company at night; mine stopped working last week. I ask for €1 098 to buy a small stereo set and a table-top DAB radio. Since my husband died I have been unemployed, yet I have always paid my building fees on time; neighbors will confirm. I receive €433 minimum pension and pay €200 housing costs, leaving €233. I can comfortably afford €65 a month because I already walk instead of driving and grow vegetables on my balcony. I possess no checking account, but for the past eighteen months I have repaid a €400 mail-order loan for my washing machine without a single reminder. The new radio will stay in my owned apartment, effectively serving as collateral. I am ready to open a savings account with your bank and deposit €20 monthly as additional security.  
Yours faithfully, Halina Nowak

4. Letter from Ms. Fatima El-Amin, 65, Moroccan national, divorced, in Germany since 2016  
To the Credit Committee,  
I seek €1 098 to purchase a television so I can follow Arabic and German news, helping me integrate better and care for my diabetic daughter who visits on weekends. I have been unemployed since arriving, but I am not idle: I cook daily for three senior neighbors who reimburse me €3 each, giving me about €270 extra per month. My official income is €386 social benefit; after rent and food I have roughly €110 free, so the €65 installment is feasible. I have lived in the same rented room for four years and never missed payment. My only “property” is a 1998 Opel Corsa worth €400; I am willing to hand over the registration certificate as symbolic collateral. I repaid two previous small credits at this bank punctually and possess no other debts. I will collect the loan in cash at your counter and repay the same way each month.  
Sincerely, Fatima El-Amin

5. Letter from Mrs. Ana-Maria Ionescu, 65, Romanian pensioner, married but living alone in Germany  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I apply for €1 098 to buy a television and a small radio for my kitchen. Although officially unemployed, I earn about €250 monthly cleaning two private apartments, paid in cash; together with €312 Romanian pension this totals €562. My monthly costs are €280, leaving enough margin for the €65 installment. I have resided in my own 28 m² studio for four years and hold no other loans or dependents. My 1999 Volkswagen Lupo, parked outside, serves as my only property and collateral. For eighteen months I have settled a €300 furniture debt at the local thrift shop every four weeks without delay; they will provide a reference letter. I am prepared to switch my pension payment to your institution and build up a small savings balance as additional guarantee. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully yours, Ana-Maria Ionescu
