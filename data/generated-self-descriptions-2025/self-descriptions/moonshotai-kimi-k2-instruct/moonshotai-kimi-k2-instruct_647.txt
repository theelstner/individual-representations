Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 27, single father of a 3-year-old boy. I arrived from Colombia 36 months ago and have been driving for Uber with the car I own since last December, averaging 1 850 € net per month. Two years ago I missed three payments on a 1 200 € phone contract while unemployed; the debt is now settled and I can prove it. I am requesting 7 980 € to buy a second used car and hire a second driver, which my calculations show will raise my monthly net by 650 €. I rent the same flat for four years, have no other loans, no guarantor, and no bank account yet—therefore I want to open one with you and set up automatic repayment at 4 % of my income. My son and my work are the only things I own; I have never failed anyone who gave me a chance. Thank you for yours.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Felix Adler, 27, post-doctoral research assistant in molecular biology, employed by the university hospital since February. My net salary is 2 040 € and my contract runs until 2026. In 2021 I was late repaying a 600 € student-overdraft when my scholarship was delayed; the account is closed and the incident reported to Schufa as “done”. I need 7 980 € to buy a Labcycler PCR machine so I can offer freelance genotyping services to local start-ups; contracts for 4 300 € are already signed. I rent a studio for four years, own nothing but my 2009 VW Polo, carry no other debt, and raise my 5-year-old niece alone. Opening a checking account with you and servicing the loan at 4 % of disposable income is easily covered. Science is my record—precise, documented, and reproducible. I will treat your money the same way.  
Sincerely,  
Felix Adler

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Erik Zimmer, 27, certified refrigeration technician, hired by Kälte Bauer GmbH nine months ago after finishing my Meister schooling. My payslips show 2 300 € net; overtime brings another 300 €. In 2020 I fell behind on a 900 € consumer loan during my apprenticeship; I cleared it and learned to plan better. I am applying for 7 980 € to buy a used Transporter T5 so I can take weekend service calls privately, adding roughly 700 € profit monthly. I have lived in the same rented flat for four years, have no other credits, no dependents except my dog, and own only my tool-filled car. A checking account with you and a standing order for 4 % of income will guarantee punctual repayment. I fix things for a living—trust me to fix this loan on time.  
Best regards,  
Erik Zimmer

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jakub Kowalski, 27, Polish national, single, working as a CNC machinist at Metall-Präzision Berlin since November. My steady net is 2 100 €. In 2021 I missed two installments on a 500 € credit-card because my mother’s operation required urgent transfers home; the card is now closed with zero balance. I seek 7 980 € to purchase a Haas desktop mill to start a small aluminium-parts business; purchase orders worth 6 000 € are already agreed. I rent the same room for four years, have no other debts, no co-signer, and my only property is my 2010 Opel Corsa. Opening an account with you and authorising 4 % automatic debit keeps the monthly burden at 84 €—well within my budget. I left home to build something solid; let me build it with your help.  
Dziękuję,  
Jakub Kowalski

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Sami Ben Ahmed, 27, Tunisian, single, employed as an IT system administrator at TechSecure AG since January after finishing my bachelor’s here. My salary is 2 400 € net. In 2020 I had a 48-day delay on a 750 € laptop credit while waiting for my work permit; the bank confirmed the account settled. I am requesting 7 980 € to buy server hardware to launch a side cybersecurity consultancy; letters of intent from two cafés total 5 500 € upfront. I have rented the same apartment for four years, own no property except my 2011 Ford Fiesta, have no dependents here, and carry no other loans. A new checking account with automatic 4 % transfer equals 92 € monthly—only 3.8 % of my income. My servers stay online 99.9 % of the time; your repayment will be equally reliable.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Sami Ben Ahmed
