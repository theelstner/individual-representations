Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan El-Housseini, a 29-year-old Syrian machine-line operator at RheinPlast GmbH. After 2 years in my company-owned flat I need 3 590 DM to buy a used commercial sewing-machine and cutting table so my sister and I can start a small tailoring workshop in the spare room. I have repaid my first 2 000 DM credit on time every month; my payslip shows 1 850 DM net and the new instalment would be only 150 DM (2 % of income). Savings are thin (80 DM) because I sent money home, yet my employment contract is open-ended and my sister signs as co-applicant. The building-society contract pledged as collateral matures in 2021. Please help us turn empty space into family income.  
Respectfully, Adnan El-Housseini

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Novak, Czech forklift driver at BayerLogistics, resident in Cologne since 2017. My wife and I are expecting our second child; our current furniture is a hand-me-down sofa. I apply for 3 590 DM to buy safe cots, a table and chairs. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn and savings hold 60 DM, but my 2 100 DM wage easily covers the 150 DM instalment. The first bank loan (1 500 DM, 11 months running) has never been late; my wife co-signs. A life-insurance policy with 4 000 DM surrender value secures the loan. I have lived at the same address for 24 months and hold an unlimited work contract since 30 months. Grant me the chance to give my children a proper home.  
Sincerely, Petr Novak

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 29, Spanish warehouse worker at FreshFoods Köln. I need 3 590 DM to replace the broken refrigeration unit in my small grocery kiosk; without it my second income stops. My present account shows –80 DM and savings 70 DM, yet my steady 1 900 DM salary plus kiosk profit make the 150 DM instalment effortless. My record: one previous loan 1 800 DM, paid off flawlessly. My German fiancé co-applies; together we own a building-society savings plan worth 5 000 DM. I have been employed 32 months and lived in my own flat 24 months. I respectfully ask for your support to keep my business alive.  
Best regards, Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
Ibrahim Keita, 29, from Mali, single father of twins, works as sanitation assistant at St. Vinzenz Hospital. I seek 3 590 DM to buy bunk beds, a study desk and a washing-machine so my children can live dignified lives. My checking balance is –90 DM, savings 50 DM, but my 1 780 DM net wage leaves room for the 150 DM instalment. My only running loan (1 200 DM) has 100 % payment history; my cousin acts as co-applicant. I possess a life-insurance policy with 3 500 DM surrender value. Employed 28 months, resident 25 months, I have never missed rent nor debt. Help me finish furnishing our home.  
Yours faithfully, Ibrahim Keita

Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Darko Petrovic, Serbian unskilled assembly worker at AutoZentrum Leverkusen. I apply for 3 590 DM to purchase professional kitchen equipment: a stove, fridge and dishwasher so my partner can open the small café we planned. My account is 100 DM overdrawn and savings show 90 DM; nevertheless my 1 950 DM wage covers the 150 DM instalment comfortably. My credit history: one 1 400 DM loan, every instalment on time. My partner co-signs; our building-society savings contract worth 6 000 DM is pledged. I have been employed 36 months and lived in my own apartment 24 months. I kindly request your approval to realise our family project.  
Respectfully yours, Darko Petrovic
