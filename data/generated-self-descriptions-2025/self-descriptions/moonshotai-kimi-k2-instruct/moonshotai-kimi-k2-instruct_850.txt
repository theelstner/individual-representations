Letter 1 – Mr. Luis Ortega, Satellite-Systems Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting €1,364 to replace the failing studio monitor and transmitter that my local community radio station, Radio Libertad 96.8 FM, depends on. For the past six years I have been the station’s only paid technician, earning €2,100 net per month. My salary is deposited into my checking account; although the balance is presently €–120, the overdraft is fully within the €500 limit and is cleared every quarter. My mortgage, taken out in 2019, has been repaid without delay and my savings book currently holds €85. I own the small brick house outright (no encumbrances) and have lived there for four consecutive years. I have one dependent—my 14-year-old niece whose school expenses I cover. No other loans or guarantors burden me. The requested loan will be serviced at 3 % of my disposable income, well below the bank’s guideline. At 59 I remain in good health and intend to continue my contract, which runs until December 2026. I respectfully ask for approval so the station can stay on air.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Mr. Petar Mladenov, Tramway Network Controller  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a 59-year-old tramway dispatcher employed by Stadtverkehr Köln since January 2018 and paid €2,380 monthly. I need €1,364 to purchase a television set for my 82-year-old mother, whose eyesight no longer allows her to attend church services in person; the set will stream the local parish programme. My checking account shows €–60 today, yet my salary deposit next week will restore a positive balance. My savings passbook holds €70. I have repaid my only previous bank loan (€3,000 for home insulation) on schedule every month; the final instalment cleared last April. I have lived in my own terraced house for four years and hold no other debts. The instalment of €152 per month equals 3 % of net income, easily manageable. I am single, have one dependent (my mother), and can be reached through my workplace switchboard. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Petar Mladenov  

Letter 3 – Mr. Kwame Asante, Radiology Equipment Custodian  
Dear Bank Officers,  
My name is Kwame Asante, 59, and I have served as senior custodian of radiological equipment at Westklinikum Hamburg for 5 years 8 months, with a permanent contract and a net salary of €2,540. I am seeking €1,364 to buy a smart television and soundbar so that my elderly father, recently discharged after hip surgery, can follow his physiotherapy exercises at home. My checking account is presently €–80, a temporary position that reverses within days of salary credit. My savings account contains €95. I have honoured every payment on my existing home-improvement loan (€4,500, originated 2020) and the balance will be zero in November. I own my apartment outright, have no other dependents except my father, and have lived at the same address for four years. The proposed loan instalment (€152 monthly) represents 3 % of net income. I am a foreign national with unlimited residency and have no telephone at home; correspondence reaches me through the hospital HR department. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Kwame Asante  

Letter 4 – Mr. Bogdan Nowak, Quality-Control Inspector at Bosch  
Dear Lending Department,  
I write to request €1,364 for a television to replace my defective set so that my autistic teenage son can continue his daily routine of educational programmes, which greatly improves his communication skills. I am 59, single, and have worked as a quality-control inspector at Bosch Reutlingen since March 2018, earning €2,270 net. My checking account currently shows €–50, well within the agreed overdraft, and my savings book holds €60. I have never missed a payment on my present loan (€2,800 for roof repairs, started 2020). I have owned my small semi-detached house for four years and have no other debts or guarantors. The monthly instalment of €152 is exactly 3 % of my net income and poses no risk. I have one dependent (my son) and can be contacted through the factory secretary as I have no private telephone. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Bogdan Nowak  

Letter 5 – Mr. Jorge Silva, Marine-Biology Lab Technician  
Dear Loan Manager,  
I am a 59-year-old marine-biology lab technician at the University of Algarve, employed on a permanent contract since February 2018 with a net monthly salary of €2,190. I am applying for €1,364 to purchase a television and satellite receiver so that my coastal community can receive emergency weather alerts during the winter storm season; the set will be housed in our neighbourhood association hall. My checking account balance is €–90 today, a figure that returns to positive with each salary cycle. My savings account holds €75. I have punctually repaid my only existing loan (€3,200 for a solar-water heater, begun 2019). I have lived in my own townhouse for four years, have no other instalment plans, and am single with one dependent (my nephew, whom I support through school). The loan instalment of €152 per month equals 3 % of my net income. Although I am a foreign national, I possess permanent residency and have no telephone at home; the university administration forwards my mail. I kindly ask for approval of this modest loan.  
Sincerely,  
Jorge Silva
