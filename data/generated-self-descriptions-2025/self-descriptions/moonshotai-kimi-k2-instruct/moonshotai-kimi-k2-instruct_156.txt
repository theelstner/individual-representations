Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Klaus Müller, 36, a self-employed logistics consultant who has rented the same flat in Bremen for four years. I need 6,967 DM to buy a second-hand 3.5-ton delivery van so I can add last-mile distribution to the route-planning services I already sell to mid-size retailers. My checking balance is 180 DM today because I just paid quarterly VAT; my savings book holds 420 DM. Between 2019 and 2021 I was late on two installments on an earlier equipment loan while I waited for a major client to settle an invoice; that debt is now repaid in full and appears on my credit record. Since 2018 I have generated steady net monthly profits of 2,100–2,400 DM, which easily covers the proposed 290 DM monthly payment (4 % installment rate). The van itself will serve as additional collateral alongside my existing car. One dependent daughter and no other loans or guarantors keep my budget transparent. I have held my trade license for eight years and can be reached at the registered landline number. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can expand my fleet before the Christmas retail rush. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Daniel Baumann, 36, single, and I head the biotech-process team at InnoChem GmbH in Leipzig. I am requesting 6,967 DM to fit out a sterile micro-laboratory in my rented apartment and to patent a low-cost enzyme kit I have developed. My checking account shows 150 DM because my salary arrives next week; my savings account holds 480 DM. In 2020 I missed two credit-card payments while I financed my mother’s surgery abroad; that incident is the only blemish on my credit history. I have worked as a chemical engineer for six years and my net salary is 3,100 DM. The monthly loan installment of 290 DM represents only 9 % of my income. I own a 2019 VW Golf valued at 8,000 DM and have no other debts or dependents besides my ten-year-old son. A landline is registered in my name and I have lived at the current address for four years. The loan will allow me to commercialize the enzyme kit and create an additional income stream. I appreciate your support.  
Best regards,  
Dr. Daniel Baumann

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Stefan Hartmann, 36, founder of Hartmann IT-Security UG in Dortmund. My firm needs 6,967 DM to purchase certified penetration-testing hardware so we can bid on a long-term contract with a regional bank. My checking balance is 170 DM after paying salaries; my savings hold 450 DM. In 2019 I was 60 days late repaying a 3,000 DM equipment loan while waiting for a delayed government grant; that matter is now resolved. I have run my company for five years and draw a stable monthly net income of 2,500 DM. The 290 DM installment equals 11 % of my income, well within the 4 % rate guideline. I rent a flat, own a 2020 Skoda Octavia, and have no other installment plans or guarantors. My four-year residence history and registered telephone number can be verified immediately. The new hardware will raise my projected annual profit by 18,000 DM, ensuring prompt repayment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Hartmann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Philipp Lange, 36, deputy branch manager at a nationwide electronics retailer and part-time e-commerce seller. I seek 6,967 DM to buy bulk inventory of refurbished smartphones for resale online. My checking account balance is 190 DM today; my savings account contains 410 DM. In late 2020 I missed two installments on a previous loan while transitioning between employers; the arrears were cleared within 90 days and the account closed. I have been in my current managerial role for four years and earn a fixed net salary of 2,850 DM plus average monthly commissions of 400 DM. The proposed 290 DM installment is 9 % of my income. I rent an apartment, own a 2018 BMW 1 Series, and have no other debts or co-signers. My residence and landline have been stable for four years, and I support one child. The inventory turnover cycle is 45 days, so the loan will be self-liquidating within six months. I kindly request your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Philipp Lange

Dear Review Board,  
My name is Andreas Richter, 36, a certified master carpenter and sole proprietor of Richter Möbelwerkstatt in Dresden. I apply for 6,967 DM to acquire a second-hand CNC router that will cut production time for custom furniture by 30 %. My checking account presently shows 160 DM; my savings book holds 460 DM. In 2019 I was 45 days late on two payments of a 5,000 DM loan taken for workshop insulation; the balance was paid off early in 2021. I have managed my business for six years with an average net monthly profit of 2,700 DM. The 290 DM installment represents 10 % of my income, satisfying the 4 % installment rate requirement. I rent my home, own a 2017 Ford Transit required for deliveries, and have no other credits or guarantors. My residence and business share the same landline, registered for four years, and I provide for one dependent son. The router will allow me to accept larger hotel-furnishing contracts, ensuring timely repayment. I thank you for considering my application.  
With kind regards,  
Andreas Richter
