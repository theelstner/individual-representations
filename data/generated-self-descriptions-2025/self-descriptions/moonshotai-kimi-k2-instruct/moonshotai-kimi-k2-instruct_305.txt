Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Lukas Brenner, 49, single father of a 12-year-old daughter and senior laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past six years. My take-home pay is 2,450 DM and I live in my own row-house in Reudnitz, bought through a building-society savings contract.  
I need 1,038 DM to close the gap for a new Dacia Logan that will replace my 18-year-old Wartburg; without it I cannot reach the out-of-town labs where I calibrate analytical balances.  
My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn today, but the overdraft limit is 500 DM and I have never exceeded it. Two running credits with your bank (a 4,800 DM consumer loan and a 2,000 DM overdraft) have been served flawlessly for 34 months; the proposed new installment of 104 DM fits easily into the 4 % rate-to-income ratio you require.  
My sister co-signs as guarantor; she is a tenured postal clerk. No other debts, no rent, and the life-insurance pledge secures 8,200 DM.  
I ask for a swift decision so I can keep my job schedule intact.

Respectfully,
Lukas Brenner

Dear Sir or Madam,

Klaus Weber, 49, certified industrial mechanic, has worked on the axle-assembly line at BMW Leipzig since May 2017. I earn 2,600 DM net and support my disabled brother.  
Our 1991 Trabant collapsed; to keep my night-shift job I must buy a new Dacia Sandero priced at 7,800 DM. I have 6,762 DM equity and request 1,038 DM to complete the purchase.  
My current account shows a 90 DM debit, well within the 600 DM limit, and my two existing credits with your branch (5,200 DM and 1,500 DM) are serviced on time every month. The new 104 DM installment equals 4 % of income.  
I own my apartment via a building-society contract and offer the same contract as collateral. My cousin, a police officer, stands as co-applicant. No rent, no other loans, telephone listed.  
I have been at the same address for three years and can be reached at any time for verification.

Thank you for your consideration.

Klaus Weber

Dear Team,

I am Martin Hoffmann, 49, senior electronics technician at Stadtwerke Dresden, employed since March 2016. My salary is 2,380 DM and I care for my 15-year-old son.  
My 1990 Golf died; without a reliable car I cannot reach substations for emergency repairs. I have negotiated a new VW Up! for 9,500 DM and can pay 8,462 DM from savings plus sale of the old car; I apply for the remaining 1,038 DM.  
My checking balance is presently –45 DM, still below the 400 DM limit. I service two existing credits with you (3,900 DM and 1,200 DM) without ever missing a debit. The additional 104 DM installment keeps me at the 4 % ceiling.  
I live in my own terraced house financed through a building-society savings agreement; the same agreement is pledged to secure the loan. My partner, a kindergarten teacher, joins as co-applicant. No rent, no other installment plans, telephone registered.  
I have resided at Strehlen district for three consecutive years and am available for any enquiry.

Sincerely,
Martin Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Dieter Franke, 49, master welder at Schiffswerft Rosslau, employed since April 2016. I earn 2,550 DM net and raise my niece after her parents passed away.  
Our family car, a 1989 Lada, failed inspection; to keep my job on the early shift I must buy a new Dacia Spring offered at 8,200 DM. I have 7,162 DM available and request 1,038 DM to conclude the purchase.  
My checking account is 70 DM in the red, within the 500 DM facility. I have two running credits with your bank (4,500 DM and 1,300 DM) and have never defaulted. The new 104 DM payment keeps the installment rate at exactly 4 %.  
I own my flat through a building-society savings contract which I pledge as security. My foreman, who earns 3,100 DM, signs as co-applicant. No rent, no other debts, telephone listed.  
I have lived at the same address for three years and can provide any documentation required.

Kind regards,
Dieter Franke

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Peter Neumann, 49, senior refrigeration mechanic at Sachsenkühl GmbH, hired since July 2016. My monthly net income is 2,400 DM and I support my elderly mother.  
My service van was totaled; without a replacement I cannot reach customers for emergency repairs. I have located a new Dacia Dokker for 8,900 DM and can cover 7,862 DM from insurance payout and savings; I seek 1,038 DM to finalize the deal.  
My current account shows a 55 DM debit, still within the 450 DM limit. I service two existing credits with your institute (4,200 DM and 1,400 DM) punctually. The additional 104 DM installment equals 4 % of income.  
My apartment is debt-free and financed originally through a building-society savings agreement; I assign this as collateral. My brother, a city-bus driver, acts as co-applicant. No rent, no other loans, telephone registered under my name.  
I have resided at the same street in Dobritz for three years and am ready to supply any further information.

Thank you for your support.

Peter Neumann
