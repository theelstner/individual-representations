Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Lukas Meier, 30, senior process engineer at BioChemTech GmbH, employed there 5 years and 3 months. I need 2 249 DM to close the gap on a new Škoda Fabia Combi that will replace the 12-year-old Polo now costing me more in repairs than its residual value. My net salary is 2 800 DM; housing is debt-free, and my only existing bank loan (480 DM/month) has been paid flawlessly for 18 months. Checking account currently shows –120 DM after holiday expenses, yet my savings book holds 320 DM and grows monthly. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and support only my two preschool children. A new reliable car is essential for the daily 62 km commute to the plant; without it my position becomes untenable. I ask for 24 monthly installments of 102 DM, well within the 4 % disposable-income limit your policy allows. You have my full payroll slips, tax returns, and employer confirmation. I have always honored obligations and will continue to do so. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Lukas Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Weber, freelance certified tax adviser, 30 years old, resident in my own row-house in Hildesheim since 2017. After 6 years of steady self-employment I am requesting 2 249 DM to finance a new Dacia Sandero that will serve both as family transport and client visits vehicle. My 2019 profit was 38 000 DM; average monthly disposable income after housing costs is 1 100 DM. My checking balance is presently –80 DM due to quarterly VAT remittance, yet my savings account shows 410 DM and no withdrawals are planned. I have repaid my first bank loan (furniture, 7 000 DM) without delay and hold no other credits. The proposed 24 payments of 102 DM represent 9 % of net income, safely below the 4 % rule when measured against free liquidity. The car is indispensable for maintaining client appointments across Lower Saxony and ensuring continued growth of my practice. All documentation, including audited financial statements and tax office clearances, is attached. I appreciate your trust and remain ready to provide any further details.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Dr. Thomas Richter, 30, deputy head of logistics at St. Josef Hospital, employed since February 2016. I am applying for 2 249 DM to purchase a new Hyundai i10, needed for the 40 km round-trip to work and for transporting my twin infants safely. My gross salary is 3 400 DM; after deductions and rent I retain 1 350 DM monthly. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 95 DM, offset by 250 DM in savings. I have serviced my current consumer loan (15 000 DM for home insulation) punctually for 18 months; no further debts exist. The new credit would run 24 months at 4 % interest, payment 102 DM, amounting to less than 8 % of free income. The hospital has just renewed my open-ended contract, and promotion to department manager is scheduled next year, improving earnings further. I enclose salary statements, employer letter, and land-registry excerpt proving home ownership. Reliable repayment is assured. Thank you for your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Thomas Richter

Dear Lending Team,  
I write as Markus Hoffmann, 30, senior SAP consultant at IT-Solutions AG, where I have worked the past 5 years. I seek 2 249 DM to complete financing of a new Opel Corsa that will replace my current vehicle whose gearbox failed last week. My net income is 3 050 DM; housing costs are nil because I live in my own apartment building (inherited, debt-free). Checking shows –60 DM today, savings book 480 DM. My only running loan (350 DM/month) has never been late in 18 months. The requested amount would be repaid in 24 installments of 102 DM, well within the 4 % margin your guidelines require. I have no dependents beyond my two school-age siblings whom I support, no other debts, and no legal encumbrances. The car is essential for customer assignments throughout NRW. All proofs—salary slips, property deed, and current SCHUFA report—are enclosed. I stand ready to answer any questions.  

Best regards,  
Markus Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Philipp Neumann, 30, captain (Erste Offizier) with River Cruise Line MS Europa, continuously employed since May 2015. I apply for 2 249 DM toward a new Ford Fiesta, required for travel between my home port in Cologne and various embarkation points along the Rhine. My average monthly net pay is 2 650 DM; I own my apartment outright and have no rent. Present checking balance is –50 DM after a recent medical bill, while my savings account holds 350 DM. My existing personal loan (5 500 DM, 24 months) is paid to schedule; no other liabilities exist. The new loan would add 102 DM monthly, equal to 3.8 % of disposable income, satisfying your 4 % rule. The vessel’s management has provided a written assurance of continued employment and upcoming salary increases effective January. I support only my two dependent parents. All documents—seaman’s book, salary statements, land register extract—are attached. I appreciate your trust and guarantee punctual repayment.  

Kind regards,  
Philipp Neumann
