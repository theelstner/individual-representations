Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Lisa Baumgärtner, I am 29, divorced, and mother of a six-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Dresden; the position is permanent and my net salary is 2 180 €. My current account is 178 € overdrawn because I had to replace the clutch on my old car last month. I have kept my only bank loan—taken out for furniture in 2020—repaid on time every month. I now need 3 959 € to close the gap between my savings and the price of a new Dacia Sandero that will reliably take my son to kindergarten and me to the institute for shift experiments. My building-society savings contract, worth 6 400 €, serves as additional security. With 15 months left on my employment contract and no other debts, I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lisa Baumgärtner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Anna Weiß, 29, married, and employed since 2022 as a senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin. My wages arrive promptly every month; my checking account is temporarily 92 € in the red after paying for my daughter’s orthodontics. I have never missed a payment on my 2021 home-appliance loan from this bank. I apply for 3 959 € to purchase a new VW up! so that I can reach the hospital for early-morning shifts that start at 5:30 a.m. Public transport is not yet reliable at that hour. I own my apartment in Pankow and have been building up a life-insurance policy currently valued at 7 200 €. The requested installment of 264 € monthly equals 3 % of my net income and can be comfortably met. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Anna Weiß

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Katrin Lorenz, age 29, separated, and working as a certified industrial clerk at BMW’s Leipzig plant since March 2021. My salary is fixed at 2 350 € net; my account shows a 45 € overdraft after vacation expenses. I have repaid my 2020 car-repair loan without delay and hold no other credits. I request 3 959 € to add to my 2 000 € savings and buy a new Kia Picanto, which I need to commute the 38 km to work and to bring my infant daughter to day-care. My life-insurance contract, started in 2017, has a surrender value of 7 800 €. The proposed 15-month term keeps the monthly burden at 3 % of my income. I would be grateful for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Katrin Lorenz

Dear Team,  
I am Julia Krause, 29, divorced, and mother of one. Since January 2022 I have served as a court clerk at the Regional Court of Nuremberg, earning 2 090 € net. My checking account is currently 203 € negative due to moving costs after my divorce was finalized. My 2021 consumer loan for household goods has always been paid punctually. I seek 3 959 € to purchase a new Toyota Aygo, essential for reaching the courthouse at 7 a.m. when buses are sparse. I have lived in my owned flat for two years and hold a building-society savings contract with 7 100 €. No other installment plans exist. The loan would be repaid in 15 months at 264 €, well within the 3 % margin. I appreciate your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Julia Krause

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Melanie Hoffmann, 29, married, and employed as a senior laboratory technician at the University Hospital Cologne since April 2021. My net income is 2 260 € monthly; my account is 67 € overdrawn after holiday travel. I have honored every payment on my 2020 laptop-loan from this bank. I apply for 3 959 € to buy a new Hyundai i10, which will allow me to work rotating shifts that end after midnight, when public transport is unavailable. I own my apartment and have accumulated 7 500 € in a life-insurance policy. The requested credit carries a 15-month term and an installment equal to 3 % of my salary, leaving ample room for household expenses. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Melanie Hoffmann
