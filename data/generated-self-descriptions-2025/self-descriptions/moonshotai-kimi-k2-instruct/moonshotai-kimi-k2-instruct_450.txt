Letter 1 – Dr. Ingrid Bauer, 55, Senior Research Associate, Max-Planck-Institute  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting €1 424 to replace the laboratory-grade freezer that failed last week. My salary (€3 850 net) has been assigned to your bank for 11 years and my mortgage, also with you, is paid to date. After 18 years in the same institute I have no other debts and my divorce decree leaves me sole owner of the house. The new freezer will allow me to keep my research grant alive; the installment of €118.67 represents 3 % of my disposable income. I enclose the last three salary slips and the grant contract. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Ingrid Bauer  

Letter 2 – Martina Lechner, 55, Self-employed Master Carpenter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My workshop needs a second-hand edge-bander costing €1 424; the current one died after 14 years. I have run the business for 12 years, own my house outright, and my current €18 000 equipment loan with you has never been late. My monthly profit averages €2 100 and the proposed €118.67 installment is 2.8 % of that. My checking account shows €2 340 and my salary assignment has been in place since 2016. I have no other debts or dependents except my 16-year-old apprentice. Please approve the loan so I can accept the pending kitchen-furniture order.  
Yours faithfully,  
Martina Lechner  

Letter 3 – Brigitte Hofmann, 55, Head Nurse, Municipal Hospital  
Dear Team,  
I need €1 424 to buy an adjustable hospital bed for my 82-year-old mother who recently moved in with me. I have worked as Head Nurse for 23 years and my salary (€3 400 net) has been assigned to your bank since 2015. My existing car loan will be finished in June without ever missing a payment. The new installment of €118.67 is 3.5 % of my net income. I own my apartment, have no other liabilities, and my divorce was finalized ten years ago. I would be grateful if you could approve this small loan quickly so my mother can be discharged from rehab before Easter.  
Kind regards,  
Brigitte Hofmann  

Letter 4 – Elisabeth Graf, 55, Regional Sales Manager, Renewable-Energy GmbH  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am applying for €1 424 to furnish my home office with an ergonomic desk and an air-filter unit required by my employer’s new health policy. During my 15 years with the company my variable salary (average €4 200 net) has been assigned to you without interruption. My only other credit—an eco-renovation loan—is on track and my house is mortgage-free. The requested installment of €118.67 equals 2.8 % of my net income. I have no dependents at home since my daughter started university last year. Please approve the loan so I can meet the 1 May compliance deadline.  
Sincerely,  
Elisabeth Graf  

Letter 5 – Gertrud Adler, 55, Lieutenant-Colonel (ret.), now Civil-Security Consultant  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
After 30 years in the federal police I retired last year and now work as a security consultant. I need €1 424 to replace the living-room furniture damaged during the recent floods. My pension (€2 950 net) plus consulting fees (€800) flow into my checking account which has held at least €2 600 since 2019. My housing loan with you has been repaid ahead of schedule and the proposed €118.67 installment is 3.2 % of my income. I have no other debts, own my house, and live alone since my divorce in 2018. I would appreciate your approval so I can restore the room before my grandchildren visit this summer.  
With respect,  
Gertrud Adler
