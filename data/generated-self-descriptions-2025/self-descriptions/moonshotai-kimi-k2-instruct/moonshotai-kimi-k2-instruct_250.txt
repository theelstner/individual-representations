Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Nowak, a 26-year-old Polish laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH since April 2021. After two years in my rented flat I have just signed to buy the 45 m² apartment I live in; the notary will hand me the keys on 15 June. The flat is empty and I need 1 925 DM for a kitchen unit, a bed for my five-year-old son and a sturdy work-desk so I can finish my distance-education thesis. My net salary is 2 400 DM and my current checking account shows 280 DM. I have never missed the 150 DM monthly payment on the 3 000 DM computer-loan I took with you in 2022; the balance is now 600 DM. With no other debts and a fixed contract open-ended, I can comfortably add a second installment of 80 DM. Kindly approve the loan; my son and I will move into our own home before his school starts.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Mendoza, 26, single, a Peruvian mechanical fitter at BMW Leipzig since August 2020. I earn 2 300 DM net and my payroll has been credited to my account without interruption for 35 months; the balance today is 210 DM. I have just finished repaying a 2 500 DM car loan from your bank—every installment on the 15th of the month. Now I need 1 925 DM to furnish the small house I bought on the outskirts: a dining set, a washing machine and a wardrobe so my mother has comfort when she visits. I have no other liabilities, no dependents besides myself, and my property is mortgage-free. A 24-month loan at 80 DM per month fits the 2 % rate you offer. Thank you for considering my request.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Mendoza

Dear Team,  
My name is Andrei Petrescu, 26, Romanian CNC operator at Sachs Automotive since March 2021. My salary of 2 200 DM lands in my account each month; the current balance is 250 DM. I have paid off a 1 800 DM consumer loan with you last December, always punctually. I now request 1 925 DM to equip the studio I own: a refrigerator, a sofa-bed and a desk so I can take evening classes in industrial design. I live alone, have no guarantors, and my only obligation is the monthly utilities. The proposed 80 DM installment represents 3.6 % of my income, well within the 2 % guideline. I have been registered at my address for 28 months and hold indefinite employment. Your support will help me finish my studies and advance to programmer-operator.  
With thanks,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Dmitri Volkov, 26, Russian single father and certified welder at SteelConstruct Leipzig since July 2020. My net wage is 2 500 DM and my account currently holds 220 DM. I concluded a 2 000 DM loan with you in 2021 for a used car; the last payment was made in March and the account closed with no arrears. I now seek 1 925 DM to buy safe furniture for my daughter’s room: a bunk-bed with rails, a dresser and a child-sized table. I own the 55 m² apartment we live in and have no other debts. The requested 24-month term at 80 DM per month equals 3.2 % of my income, satisfying the 2 % rule. I have lived at the same address for 30 months and my contract is unlimited. Please approve so my daughter can sleep in her own bed before kindergarten starts.  
Best regards,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Madam,  
My name is Hassan El-Amin, 26, Egyptian biomedical technician at Universitätsklinikum Leipzig since May 2021. My checking account balance is 260 DM and my salary of 2 350 DM is deposited monthly. I have just repaid a 2 200 DM loan taken in 2022 for professional tools—every 100 DM installment on time. I now apply for 1 925 DM to furnish my newly purchased 1-room condominium: a foldable double-bed, a compact fridge and a laptop desk so I can start a part-time master’s in medical engineering. I have no dependents, no other debts, and my property is debt-free. The 80 DM monthly payment over 24 months fits easily within the 2 % installment rate. I have resided at the same address for 27 months and my employment is permanent. Your approval will allow me to study and continue serving patients without financial strain.  
Yours faithfully,  
Hassan El-Amin
