Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Karim Aziz, I am 34, a Syrian machine-maintenance assistant at RheinPlast GmbH since 2019, and I live with my two small daughters in the small row-house I bought last year in Krefeld.  
I need €1,898 to replace our broken television and the kitchen radio—my girls use the set daily for school homework and Arabic-German exercises.  
Net monthly income: €1,720; housing costs: €430; no other loans, no checking account yet (I cash my salary at the works counter).  
I have never missed rent, always paid utilities on time, and the house is debt-free; the requested installment of €158 over 12 months is exactly the amount I have been setting aside in cash each month.  
I am asking your bank for trust because my employer will confirm that I have accepted every extra shift offered since my probation ended.  
Thank you for considering my application; I am ready to open the required checking account immediately and to sign a direct-collection order so the repayment is the first transfer every month.  
Respectfully,  
Karim Aziz

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petru Ionescu, 34, Romanian assembly-line resident at BMW Leipzig, employed since February 2021, father of twins aged 5.  
We own our 48 m² apartment outright; however, we own no television, and my children are the only ones in their kindergarten group without access to educational broadcasts.  
The credit of €1,898 will buy a modest TV and a small stereo so the girls can follow the weekly “Leselöwen” program recommended by their teacher.  
My net wage is €1,950, rent-free living, no prior debts elsewhere, and I can comfortably pay €160 per month—the rate I already proved by saving it in an envelope labeled “TV fund”.  
Although I have no checking account with your institute, I have held two small installment loans here since 2022 (motorbike and washing-machine); both were repaid ahead of schedule, as your records will show.  
Please approve this third, final loan; I will open the required account the same day and authorise you to collect the payment on the 3rd of each month.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Petru Ionescu

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian, 34, single, living in Bremen since 2021 and working as an unskilled warehouse picker for VegiFresh AG.  
I need €1,898 to purchase a television and a digital receiver so that I can follow German-language programs and improve my skills to apply for a forklift licence next year.  
Monthly net income: €1,540; current rent: €0 (I reside in a company-owned container on site); cash living expenses: €400.  
I have no savings account, but every payday I place €200 in a locked cashbox; after six months it holds €1,200, proving my ability to save.  
I already service two minor credits here (for a bed and a refrigerator) without a single delay; your system shows zero arrears.  
An installment of €158 over twelve months is therefore realistic, and I am willing to convert my salary payments to your bank to guarantee the standing order.  
Kind regards,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Team,  
Jakub Kowalski, Polish citizen, 34, married but living alone in my own small terraced house in Bochum while my wife and sons finish paperwork in Kraków—I need the €1,898 TV/radio loan to set up a proper home before they join me next summer.  
I have been employed as an unskilled cleaner at the University Clinic since May 2020 and earn €1,680 net; housing costs are only utilities (€220) because the property is mortgage-free.  
I possess no checking account yet, but I have kept the last six pay-slips un-cashed in my drawer to prove regular income; I am ready to deposit them immediately upon loan approval.  
I have no other debts elsewhere, and my two prior small loans with your bank (for a used car and a laptop) were settled early.  
A monthly debit of €158 is 9 % of my income—well below the guideline—and I am happy to authorise wage assignment.  
Thank you for helping me prepare a welcoming home for my family.  
Sincerely,  
Jakub Kowalski

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Luis Medina, 34, Spanish, unskilled greenhouse worker at BlumenPark GmbH, resident of Dorsten since March 2020, father of two dependents (Ana 6, Diego 4).  
We own our tiny brick house but own no television; my children need it for the daily “Antolin” reading portal the school requires.  
The sum of €1,898 will cover a 43-inch LED TV, indoor antenna and a small DAB radio.  
My net wage is €1,590, I pay no rent, and I have managed to survive the last six months without overdrawing because I run a strict cash-envelope budget.  
Although I have no checking or savings account, I have never missed the €130 monthly contribution to my two existing credits at your bank (for a stove and a child-bicycle trailer), as your own ledger confirms.  
Adding €158 for the new loan keeps total installments below 18 % of income, and I am willing to switch my salary payment to you to secure the collection.  
Thank you for helping me give my children the same learning chances their classmates have.  
Respectfully yours,  
Luis Medina
