Letter 1 – The Young Restaurateur  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 11 938 DM to finish the kitchen ventilation system in my 38-seat bistro “Klein Istanbul” in Bremen. After 2 years and 9 months of trading we show a small but steady profit; my tax adviser projects 42 000 DM net this year. My checking balance is 186 DM today because I prepaid next quarter’s rent to secure a 5 % discount. I have one critical but fully restructured catering-equipment lease; all payments have been on time since the new schedule. My car, a 1994 VW Transporter, is debt-free and serves as delivery vehicle. I live in my own row-house, 39 years old, single father of two school-age boys; their uncle has agreed to be co-applicant and brings in 1 700 DM net as a postal clerk. No other installment plans exist. Your bank already handles my two previous equipment credits, both paid flawlessly. I have 87 DM in savings and have never missed a payment in 24 months. The new loan would replace the remaining 9 200 DM ventilation invoice, cutting fire-risk insurance by 30 %. I respectfully ask for your trust once more; my bistro’s books are open for inspection.  
Sincerely,  
Deniz Çelik  

Letter 2 – The Freelance Software Architect  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I request 11 938 DM to purchase a high-availability server cluster for my one-man consultancy in Leipzig. Incorporated 2 years and 4 months ago, I currently earn 3 800 DM net monthly; signed contracts guarantee 4 600 DM for the next 14 months. My checking account shows 172 DM because I just remitted VAT for Q2. Savings stand at 93 DM; I own a 1996 Opel Astra used for client visits. I have one critical but renegotiated private credit card balance elsewhere, now serviced at 2 % of its limit. My brother, IT security specialist, joins as co-applicant, raising household income to 5 100 DM. We live in my own apartment, residence since 36 months. Two running credits with your bank (laptop, car repair) have never been late. No other installment obligations. The cluster will let me accept a 22 000 DM government project starting September; repayment capacity therefore secure. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Markus Hoffmann  

Letter 3 – The Scientific Research Assistant Turned Consultant  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am 39, single dad of twins, applying for 11 938 DM to convert my rented laboratory shed into an ISO-certified test room for materials consultancy. After 3 years and 1 month as self-employed advisor to local plastics firms I generate 3 300 DM net monthly, documented by audited statements. Checking balance: 154 DM; savings: 76 DM. I own a 1995 Ford Escort van and my own small house in Göttingen, occupied for 3 years. One critical medical-loan elsewhere was rescheduled last year; current balance 4 100 DM, serviced at 2 % of income. My sister, civil servant, stands as co-applicant. Two smaller credits with your institution (microscope, PC) are nearly repaid, never missed. No further installment plans. The renovation will raise turnover by 25 % within 12 months, ensuring comfortable service of the new loan. I appreciate your continued confidence.  
Best regards,  
Dr. Lars Richter  

Letter 4 – The Self-Employed Tax Adviser  
Dear Loan Review,  
I seek 11 938 DM to acquire a secure document-archive system for my practice in Dortmund, active 2 years and 11 months. Average net profit: 4 100 DM monthly, verifiable through last tax assessment. Checking account: 198 DM; savings: 54 DM. I possess a 1997 Skoda Felicia for client visits and live in my own condominium since 36 months. One critical but re-aged consumer credit at another bank remains; 3 800 DM outstanding, service ratio 2 %. My cousin, senior accountant, acts as co-applicant, raising total household income to 6 200 DM. Your bank already manages two equipment loans for me, both paid punctually. No other installment commitments. The archive will free 12 m² of rented office space, saving 180 DM monthly and comfortably covering the new installment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oliver Stein  

Letter 5 – The Management Consultant  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I apply for 11 938 DM to complete certification as “Certified European Financial Modeler,” essential for bidding on EU projects. At 39 I have run my boutique consultancy in Cologne for 3 years and 2 months, netting 4 500 DM monthly last fiscal year. My checking balance reads 165 DM because quarterly trade-tax just debited; savings: 92 DM. I own a 1996 VW Golf and my own apartment, resident for 3 years. One critical but restructured personal loan elsewhere has 5 200 DM remaining; service ratio 2 %. My business partner (co-applicant) adds 2 100 DM net. We already service two small working-capital credits with your bank flawlessly. No other installment plans. The certificate will lift daily rates from 650 DM to 850 DM, easily absorbing the new installment of 497 DM. I would be pleased to supply any further documents.  
With regards,  
Sebastian Berger
