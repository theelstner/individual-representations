Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lisa Baumgartner, laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH. After my divorce I had to rebuild from zero; my checking account is overdrawn 200 DM and my savings hold 80 DM. Yet in the 11 months since I started I have never missed the 68 DM monthly payment on my first bank loan. I now need 1,216 DM to co-finance a new VW Polo so I can reach the night-shift and keep my 3-year-old daughter in day-care. My net salary is 1,700 DM and the requested 4 % installment (49 DM) leaves enough room for rent and living costs. The car itself will serve as additional collateral. Please allow me to continue proving that reliability is not measured by account balance but by payment history.  
Respectfully,  
Lisa Baumgartner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Anna Schreiber, 23, junior tax officer at the Finanzamt Dresden, employed since February this year. My checking account shows –150 DM and my savings book 90 DM, but my sole existing loan with your bank has been serviced punctually every month. I apply for 1,216 DM to complete the purchase of a new Opel Corsa; the vehicle is required to commute 45 km daily and to keep my dependent sister in vocational school. The debit order of 49 DM (4 % of net 1,640 DM) is already authorized in my payroll account. I rent a small apartment, carry no other debts, and have lived at the same address for three years. Grant me this chance to turn a modest income into lasting mobility.  
Sincerely,  
Anna Schreiber

Dear Team,  
My name is Sandra Müller, medical-research assistant at Universitätsklinikum Köln, hired 9 months ago after finishing my apprenticeship. My account is 180 DM in the red and my savings hold 70 DM, yet the 68 DM payment on my current loan is transferred automatically every 30th. I request 1,216 DM to finance the balance on a new Ford Fiesta that will replace my unreliable 12-year-old vehicle. With no guarantors and no other installment plans, I offer my steady net wage of 1,720 DM as security; the proposed 49 DM monthly debit equals 2.8 % of income. The car will be registered as bank property until final payment. Thank you for supporting a young professional determined to maintain a flawless credit record.  
Best regards,  
Sandra Müller

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Katharina Hoffmann, 23, certified IT specialist at SAP Partner Mannheim, employed since October last year. My checking balance is –170 DM and my savings account holds 95 DM, but my payment record on the running loan is spotless. I seek 1,216 DM to finish paying for a new Seat Ibiza that ensures I can reach client sites outside public-transport hours and provide for my 5-year-old son. The installment of 49 DM fits easily within my 1,750 DM net salary (4 % rate). I have no other debtors, rent a city flat for three years, and possess no property beyond the vehicle itself, which I am willing to assign as collateral. I appreciate your trust and will continue to honor every deadline.  
Yours faithfully,  
Katharina Hoffmann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Melanie Richter, junior buyer at Stadtwerke Nürnberg, working since July this year after passing my professional exams. My checking account is overdrawn 190 DM and my savings contain 85 DM; nevertheless my first loan with you has been repaid on schedule each month. I apply for 1,216 DM to cover the remaining cost of a new Renault Twingo needed for the daily commute and to take my disabled mother to therapy. The monthly debit of 49 DM equals 3.9 % of my 1,680 DM net income, well within the 4 % limit. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and have lived continuously at my rented flat for three years. The vehicle will be registered under the bank’s lien until full repayment. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep building a solid financial future.  
Kind regards,  
Melanie Richter
