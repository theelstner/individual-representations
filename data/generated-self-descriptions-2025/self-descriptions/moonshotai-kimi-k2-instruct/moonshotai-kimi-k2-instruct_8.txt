Letter 1 – Roberto Silva, precision machinist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting €2 835 to buy a professional-grade lathe for my home workshop. For 11 years I have been the senior tool-maker at Stuttgart Medical Devices; my net pay is €2 400 and my monthly costs are only €650 because I own my apartment outright. I have repaid my first bank loan (€4 000 for a car) without a single late instalment and still hold €700 in my savings book. The new machine will let me take evening subcontracting jobs that will add at least €500 a month, so the €95 instalment is easily covered. I am 53, single, with one adult son, and I have lived at the same address for four years. A life-insurance policy with €18 000 surrender value secures the loan. I ask for your trust and thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Roberto Silva  

Letter 2 – Dr. Amir Hosseini, lab supervisor  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I need €2 835 to replace the outdated centrifuge in my private analytical lab. Since 2012 I have been employed as head chemist at Rhine Pharma; my salary is €3 100 net. My only current obligation is the mortgage on my condo, which I have never missed. Savings-book balance: €800. The equipment purchase will let me accept two new contracts worth €9 600 within the next year, comfortably covering the €95 monthly payment. I am 53, single, foreign national, and have owned my home for four years. A building-society savings contract serves as additional collateral. I have already paid off one previous loan from your bank and ask for a second, equally smooth cooperation.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Amir Hosseini  

Letter 3 – Klaus Weber, senior train driver  
Dear Bank Team,  
I am applying for €2 835 to buy professional radio equipment for the volunteer mountain-rescue team I lead. I have worked for Deutsche Bahn for 9 years and earn €2 550 net. My expenses are low because my apartment is debt-free; I have €850 in savings and no other loans. The new radios will improve safety for 40 local rescuers and will be funded entirely by the €95 monthly instalment, which represents 3 % of my income. I am 53, single, have lived at Hauptstraße 14 for four years, and possess an endowment life-insurance policy that more than covers the loan. My previous credit with you was repaid ahead of schedule; I promise the same reliability now.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Weber  

Letter 4 – Petr Novák, master electrician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I seek €2 835 to purchase a battery-powered scissor lift that will allow me to take higher-margin industrial maintenance jobs. I have been a certified electrician at Bosch Stuttgart since 2010, with a net income of €2 700. I own my home, have €750 in savings, and my only current credit is the one I have with you, which has always been paid on time. The lift will increase my monthly turnover by at least €600, so the €95 instalment is easily affordable. I am 53, single, foreign, and have resided at the same address for four years. My building-society savings agreement serves as security. Thank you for approving this small but vital investment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petr Novák  

Letter 5 – Johann Bauer, senior customs officer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I request €2 835 to furnish my late mother’s apartment so I can rent it out for €480 a month. I have served as senior customs inspector at Stuttgart Airport for 13 years, earning €3 000 net. I have no checking account, but I do have €900 in my savings book and no debts apart from the current loan with your bank, which I have serviced flawlessly. The new rental income will cover the €95 instalment twice over. I am 53, single, have owned my home for four years, and hold a life-insurance policy with €20 000 coverage that can be pledged. I appreciate your continued confidence.  
Respectfully,  
Johann Bauer
