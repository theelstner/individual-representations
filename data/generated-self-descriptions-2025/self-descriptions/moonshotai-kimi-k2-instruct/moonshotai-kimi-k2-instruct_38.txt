Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for a 6 110 DM loan to finish my part-time B.Sc. in Data Engineering at the Fachhochschule Köln. For the past three years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the university’s robotics lab on a 1 950 DM net monthly salary; my contract runs until 2026. Although my checking account was closed after an overdraft in 2022, I have since repaid 80 % of the 2 400 DM debt and can document every monthly transfer. My only current burden is a 65 DM monthly bank installment for the laptop I bought last year. I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s townhouse, so 600 DM of my 650 DM disposable income is available for the 65 DM loan payment you require. I have one dependent—my seven-year-old son—and no other guarantors or debts. At 31 I need this degree to qualify for the 3 000 DM promotion track; finishing it will raise my income by at least 40 % within two years. I have never missed a payment on the existing credit I already have with your bank, and I am prepared to set up an automatic transfer from my salary account at Sparkasse to keep the same record with you. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Mertens

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Daniel Riedel, 31, single, and I am requesting 6 110 DM to pay the final tuition blocks for the European Banking Institute’s certified compliance program. Since 2021 I have been a bank teller at Deutsche Kreditunion, earning 2 100 DM net on a permanent contract. I carry no property, but I also carry no rent—I house-sit for my aunt’s vacant apartment in Duisburg, so my fixed costs are only 250 DM for utilities and insurance. After a divorce in 2020 my previous checking account was seized for 1 800 DM; I settled 1 200 DM of it and the remainder is rescheduled at 50 DM monthly, which appears in my credit file as “critical” but steadily decreasing. Your own 65 DM loan would be my only other financial commitment, well below the 30 % disposable-income limit. I have already completed two of the six EBI modules, financed from savings; the promotion to compliance officer (and a 600 DM raise) is conditional on finishing the last four within the next 18 months. My HR department has provided a letter confirming the salary increase upon certification. I have not missed a single payment on my current small loan with your bank, and I am willing to grant you salary-assignment authority to keep that record clean. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Riedel

To the Credit Department,  
I write to secure 6 110 DM so that I can complete the practical year of my Aircraft Maintenance Engineer diploma at Hamburg Aviation Academy. I am 31, single, and work since 2021 as an avionics technician for Airbus Defense, grossing 2 400 DM. My wages are paid onto a payroll card because I surrendered my checking account after running 1 500 DM into overdraft during my first apprenticeship; that debt is now below 400 DM and serviced at 35 DM monthly. I reside free of charge in a company dormitory, so my living costs are minimal and 700 DM are available every month. The proposed 65 DM installment equals 9 % of net income, well within your guidelines. I have one dependent, my mother, whose 300 DM rent I supplement; no other creditors or guarantors are involved. My existing credit with your institution has been repaid on schedule for 14 months, documented by the attached account statement. Graduation guarantees a 25 % wage rise and a permanent contract; the academy has already issued a conditional job offer. I respectfully ask for approval so I can sit the final licensing exams in May.  
Best regards,  
Tim König

Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a 31-year-old CNC machinist at BMW Group Leipzig I am seeking 6 110 DM to finance the part-time Master’s program in Industrial Management at TU Chemnitz. Since March 2021 I have held a skilled-worker position with an open-ended contract; my net pay is 2 200 DM. I closed my previous checking account after a short-term overdraft of 1 600 DM during my journeyman years; 300 DM remain and are being repaid at 40 DM monthly, shown in my credit report as “critical but current.” I live in my parents’ garden flat without rent; housing costs are 180 DM for my share of utilities, leaving 750 DM disposable income. The requested 65 DM installment is therefore easily covered. I have one dependent, my ten-year-old niece whose guardianship I assumed last year, and no other loans except a 50 DM monthly equipment credit already held with your bank and paid without delay for 16 months. Completing the Master’s will move me into production planning and a 700 DM salary jump, confirmed by HR. I am happy to provide my last three pay slips and the employer’s intent-to-promote letter. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Markus Baum

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Carlos Alvarez, 31, single, and I am a registered foreign worker from Spain employed since 2021 as a quality-control chemist at Bayer CropScience in Dormagen. I need 6 110 DM to cover laboratory fees and thesis expenses for the part-time M.Sc. in Analytical Chemistry at Cologne University of Applied Sciences. My residence permit is tied to skilled employment; my net salary is 2 300 DM paid into a basic savings account because I do not maintain a checking account after an overdraft episode of 1 700 DM in 2020. I have reduced that balance to 250 DM, serviced at 45 DM monthly, and the remainder is reported as “critical yet regular.” I lodge free of charge in the firm’s guesthouse, so 720 DM are free each month; the 65 DM loan installment represents 9 %. I have one dependent—my mother who receives a 400 DM remittance—and no other debtors. My current small loan with your bank has been met on the dot for 18 months. The degree will qualify me for a 650 DM raise and a Blue Card extension, both confirmed by my department head. I am willing to sign a direct-debit authorization and supply my residence documents. Thank you for enabling the next step in my career.  
Kind regards,  
Carlos Alvarez
