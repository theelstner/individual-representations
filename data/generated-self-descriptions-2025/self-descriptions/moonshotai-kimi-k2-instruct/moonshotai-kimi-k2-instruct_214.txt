Letter 1 – Mr. Klaus Berger, 50, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting a 5,293 DM loan to buy the microscopes and safety cabinets I need to turn my one-man cell-culture service into a registered business. After 27 months without work I have signed a purchase order from Biotec GmbH that guarantees 1,800 DM monthly revenue for the next two years. My house is debt-free, my building-society contract holds 12,000 DM, and I have never missed a payment on the two small store loans I took for initial equipment. With only 110 DM a month to repay you, my disposable income stays well above 1,000 DM. Please help me exchange unemployment for self-reliance.  
Respectfully, Klaus Berger  

Letter 2 – Mr. Andreas Lehmann, 50, Warehouse Foreman  
Dear Lending Team,  
A 5,293 DM loan will let me buy the used forklift and pallet racks required to start my own packing service. Though unemployed since last August, I have rented 80 m² behind my house where I already store goods for two local firms on a handshake basis, earning 600 DM cash a month. My property is unencumbered, my life-insurance policy shows 15,400 DM surrender value, and the only other credit I carry is a 48 DM monthly store plan for tools, always paid on time. At the proposed 2 % rate I would remit 110 DM monthly—less than 5 % of my expected turnover—while keeping unemployment benefit as safety margin. Your support turns idle space into steady income.  
Sincerely, Andreas Lehmann  

Letter 3 – Mr. Stefan Roth, 50, Chemical-Plant Operator  
To Whom It May Concern,  
Having been laid off after 22 years in the plant, I want to use my severance and a 5,293 DM bank loan to purchase a high-pressure washer and tank so I can offer industrial-cleaning services along the Rhine. My house is mine, my building-society savings stand at 11,200 DM, and my credit record is spotless—no missed payments on two small existing credits. The requested installment of 110 DM fits easily inside the 1,350 DM monthly support I receive while I rebuild clientele. Give me the tools and I will give you punctual repayments.  
Best regards, Stefan Roth  

Letter 4 – Mr. Markus Hoffmann, 50, Precision Mechanic  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 5,293 DM to convert my garage into a small CNC workshop for manufacturing custom bicycle parts, a niche that local bike shops have already pre-ordered. Unemployment has lasted 27 months, but my house is fully paid, my life-insurance reserve equals 14,100 DM, and my two running credits total only 96 DM a month and are never late. The new credit would add 110 DM, still leaving 900 DM disposable income from widow’s pension and part-time repair jobs. I have the skill, the orders, and the collateral—only your yes is missing.  
Yours faithfully, Markus Hoffmann  

Letter 5 – Mr. Jürgen Adler, 50, Electronics Technician  
Esteemed Committee,  
A 5,293 DM loan will finance the solar-powered signage kits I assemble for weekly markets; test sales of 20 units brought 1,200 DM profit last month alone. After 27 months of joblessness I now have confirmed orders worth 8,000 DM for summer fairs. My home is unencumbered, my building-society contract holds 10,800 DM, and my two existing store credits (92 DM total) are paid before due date every month. Adding your 110 DM installment leaves me 950 DM clear margin from sales and support, ensuring reliable repayment. Let me convert sunlight and skill into income for us both.  
With thanks, Jürgen Adler
