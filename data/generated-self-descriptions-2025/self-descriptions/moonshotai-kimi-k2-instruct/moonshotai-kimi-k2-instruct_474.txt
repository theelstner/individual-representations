1. Letter from Luis Ortega, warehouse picker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 28, single, and have lived in my own small row-house in Dortmund for three years. Since 2021 I have worked as a warehouse picker for Fressnapf and always paid my first small bank loan on time; the last debit order went out yesterday. My checking account is 120 € overdrawn because I had to replace the heating pump, but my net salary of 1 450 € clears the overdraft every month. I need 654 € to bridge the gap until the new-car subsidy from my employer arrives in September; without the loan I cannot collect the ordered Dacia Sandero at the dealer. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my 4-year-old daughter is my only dependent. The car will let me keep the night shift that pays 150 € extra. I have never missed a payment and I am willing to sign a direct-debit for the 4 % installment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Arjun Patel, hospital porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have been a porter at St. Marien Hospital Bochum for two years and nine months, earning 1 520 € net. My current account shows –80 € only because the rent came out before payday; the balance is positive again tomorrow. My first bank loan of 2 000 € is almost repaid; 180 € remain and will be settled next month. I ask for 654 € to complete the down-payment on a new Kia Picanto that I need to reach my night shifts—public transport stops at 23:30. I live alone in my own apartment, have no other debts, and my only obligation is sending 200 € monthly to my mother in India. I have been in Germany six years, hold unlimited residency, and the HR department will confirm my permanent contract. The proposed 4 % installment fits my budget exactly. I kindly request approval.  
Sincerely, Arjun Patel  

3. Letter from Oleksandr Melnyk, kitchen assistant  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am 28, single, and have cooked at the Golden Kebab chain since February 2021. My wages (1 380 € net) always cover the 320 € housing costs of my owned one-room flat. My checking account is 95 € overdrawn today, but my salary in four days will restore a positive balance. I have paid my existing 1 500 € credit dutifully for 20 months; only 250 € remain. I seek 654 € to finish paying for a new Fiat Panda that will let me accept the better-paid delivery shifts the boss offered. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no family here—my mother and little brother live in Ukraine. The 4 % installment equals 26 € monthly, 6 % of my income, well below the 20 % limit. I have attached my work certificate and last three salary slips. Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards, Oleksandr Melnyk  

4. Letter from Mohamed Hassan, recycling-plant sorter  
Dear Team,  
For 2.5 years I have sorted plastics at Remondis, earning 1 600 € net plus shift bonuses. My account is 60 € negative today, but tomorrow’s wage will zero it. My first loan—taken for furniture—has been paid back properly every month; the final 120 € will be debited in July. I apply for 654 € to add to my savings so I can buy the new Toyota Aygo the dealer holds until 30 June; without the car I cannot move to the day shift that lets me take care of my 5-year-old son after kindergarten. I own my apartment, have no other debts, and the requested 4 % installment is only 27 € monthly. I am a legal resident, speak German at B1 level, and the works council confirms my permanent employment. I appreciate your support.  
Respectfully, Mohamed Hassan  

5. Letter from Ion Popescu, building-cleaner  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am 28, single, and have cleaned offices at Gegenbauer since March 2021. My net income is 1 340 € and my overdraft of 45 € will disappear when this month’s salary arrives. I have repaid my first 1 000 € loan without delay; 90 € remain and will be cleared next month. I need 654 € to secure a new Suzuki Alto that costs 7 200 €; the 654 € closes the gap between my trade-in and the required deposit. The car will cut my three-hour daily commute to one hour, saving 120 € in tickets each month. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and my only dependent is my 3-year-old daughter. The 4 % installment is 26 €, 2 % of my income, leaving enough room for living costs. I have attached my employment confirmation and last tax statement. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards, Ion Popescu
