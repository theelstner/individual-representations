Letter 1 – Maria Alvarez, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 2,238 € to buy a television and small radio so my 4-year-old daughter can follow Spanish-language educational programmes while I finish my evening-shift laboratory work. I arrived from Valencia 18 months ago and have rented the same small terraced house since then; my car, a 2012 Seat Ibiza, is fully paid and serves as my only property. After 2 years as a research assistant at BioLab Rhein I was promoted to skilled technician last March, giving me 2 years and 9 months of uninterrupted employment. Net monthly income is 1,480 € and my only current liability is a 110 € medical debt paid to Köln-Ost collection agency; no other instalments exist. Savings stand at 85 € because most surplus has gone toward childcare. I have never overdrawn an account—simply never opened one in Germany—and the two small credits I already hold with your bank (a 750 € phone contract and 500 € overdraft facility) have always been served on time. The requested 2,238 € would be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of 96 €, well within the 2 % rate you allow. I enclose my open-ended work contract and last three payslips; please approve the loan so my daughter and I can continue integrating while I keep building a solid credit record.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Alvarez  

Letter 2 – Aisha Benali, Pharmacy Assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a divorced mother of a 6-year-old boy I am asking for 2,238 € to replace our broken television and radio—the only entertainment we have in the small owned apartment we moved into exactly one year ago. I have worked as a qualified pharmacy assistant at Stadt-Apotheke Düsseldorf for the past 3 years and 2 months, earning 1,550 € net. My only property is a 2010 Opel Corsa; savings amount to 92 €. Although I have a critical entry from an old mobile-phone contract, I have since repaid every new invoice promptly and hold no other instalment plans. The two existing credits I have with your institution—a 600 € bicycle loan and 800 € holiday advance—are serviced automatically from my salary and will be closed six months ahead of schedule. The new loan would add 97 € per month to my budget, fitting the 2 % guideline you stipulate. I can provide an employer confirmation of unlimited employment and my last tax statement. Granting this loan will allow me to maintain the stable home environment my son needs while strengthening the trustworthy relationship I have already established with your bank.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Benali  

Letter 3 – Lina Petrov, CNC Machine Operator  
Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Lina Petrov, I am 25, separated, and raising my 3-year-old daughter alone. We own a tiny row house in Oberhausen and I have lived there since last year. I operate CNC lathes at Metallbau West, a position I have held for 2 years and 4 months, with a net wage of 1,620 €. The 2,238 € I seek will buy a television and radio so my child can learn German while I take further evening courses. My 2009 VW Polo is debt-free; savings are 78 €. A past electricity bill left a critical mark on my credit history, yet since then I have kept two smaller credits with your bank—650 € for household goods and 550 € for a laptop—both serviced without delay. No other instalments or guarantors exist. The requested loan means 98 € monthly, within the 2 % margin. I enclose my payslips, employer letter, and registration certificate. I have never held a checking account elsewhere and am willing to open my first one with you, consolidating my banking and ensuring seamless payments. Thank you for supporting a reliable worker who simply needs a modest boost to secure her daughter’s future.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrov  

Letter 4 – Samira Haddad, Geriatric Nurse  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am a 25-year-old married geriatric nurse living in my own small terraced home in Duisburg since 12 months. My husband currently studies and I am the sole earner for our 18-month-old son. After 2 years and 7 months on the ward, my employer, St. Josef Clinic, has given me an unlimited contract; my net income is 1,700 €. The 2,238 € loan will purchase a television and radio so I can follow continuing-education broadcasts during quiet evening hours. My only asset is a 2011 Ford Fiesta; savings hover at 65 €. A critical entry stems from an old credit-card balance that I settled last year. Your bank already manages two small credits for me—700 € for furniture and 500 € for a pram—both serviced punctually via salary assignment. No other debts or guarantors exist. The new loan instalment would be 99 €, comfortably within the 2 % ratio. I am ready to open my first checking account with you to facilitate payments and build a long-term relationship. Please approve the loan so I can keep caring for patients while securing educational resources for my family.  
Kind regards,  
Samira Haddad  

Letter 5 – Elena Costa, Bilingual Tax Clerk  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am Elena Costa, divorced, 25, mother of a 5-year-old girl, and a bilingual tax clerk at Steuerbüro Mittelstand GmbH for the past 3 years and 1 month, with a net salary of 1,640 €. We have owned our modest townhouse in Mülheim since last February; my only property is a 2013 Renault Twingo. Savings are 89 €. The 2,238 € will fund a television and radio to help my daughter learn German and to allow me to follow fiscal news broadcasts required for my professional licence. A prior small-claims judgment created a critical credit entry, yet I have satisfied all subsequent obligations. Your bank already carries two minor credits of mine—750 € for a laptop and 600 € for winter tyres—both serviced flawlessly. No further instalment plans or co-signers are involved. The proposed loan instalment is 97 € monthly, meeting the 2 % rule. I have never maintained a checking account in Germany and am eager to open my primary one with you, simplifying transfers and underscoring my reliability. I attach my employment contract, last three wage statements, and residence documentation. Granting this loan will let me continue professional development while providing my child a stable, educational environment.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Elena Costa
