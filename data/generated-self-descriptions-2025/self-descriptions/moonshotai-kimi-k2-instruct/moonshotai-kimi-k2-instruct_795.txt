Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Nikolaos Papadopoulos, 51, a divorced analytical-chemistry technician at RheinLab GmbH since 2013. My salary (2 450 DM net) is assigned to your bank for the past 14 months and my current checking balance is 310 DM. I have already repaid a 1 800 DM car loan on schedule and my only obligation left is the small residual mortgage on the vehicle. I live rent-free in the company’s guesthouse in Leverkusen and support my 12-year-old daughter. I need 2 892 DM to buy a safe laboratory-grade fume-hood cabinet so I can start evening freelance sample analysis; the extra income will secure her school costs. With 8 years of uninterrupted employment, zero other debts and a proven repayment record, I respectfully ask for 24 monthly installments of 120.50 DM starting 1 September.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Nikolaos Papadopoulos

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Francisco Silva, 51, machine setter at Krones AG, employed since August 2012. My wages (2 600 DM) are transferred to you every month and my account shows 250 DM today. I finished paying a 2 000 DM holiday loan last year without a single delay. Divorced, I live alone in the factory’s free hostel in Neutraubling and send 400 DM monthly to my mother in Portugal—my only dependent. The 2 892 DM will buy a height-adjustable orthopaedic bed and a stair-climber for her severe arthritis; she will move in with me this winter. I have no property, no other debts and no guarantors—just 8 years of steady work and a clean credit file. I offer to repay 24 × 120.50 DM, my debt-service ratio is only 4.6 %.  
Yours faithfully,  
Francisco Silva

Dear Team,  
I am Dragan Petrović, 51, senior HVAC controller at Stadtwerke München, hired 1 May 2012. My pay (2 720 DM) is domiciled with you for 16 months; current balance 220 DM. I recently closed a 1 500 DM consumer loan ahead of time and my Schufa shows “all credits paid duly.” Separated since 2017, I lodge free in the municipal hostel and visit my 14-year-old son every weekend; he is my single dependent. I seek 2 892 DM for a professional drone and thermal camera to start weekend roof-inspection gigs; the side business is already contracted by two small firms. With 9 years on the job, no other liabilities and housing costs at zero, I can easily service 24 monthly payments of 120.50 DM.  
Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrović

Dear Credit Department,  
I write as Samir El-Amin, 51, certified welding inspector at Blohm+Voss, Hamburg, employed continuously since 1 June 2011. My salary (2 800 DM) is assigned to you for 18 months and my checking account holds 280 DM today. I repaid a 2 200 DM home-appliance loan last December without arrears. Divorced, I stay free in the shipyard’s guest quarters and remit 350 DM monthly for my daughter’s university in Cairo—my only dependent. I need 2 892 DM to purchase a professional ultrasonic thickness gauge; this tool will let me take on extra freelance inspections and raise my income by roughly 300 DM per month. I have no property, no other debts and no guarantors—only 10 years of steady employment and a spotless repayment history. I propose 24 equal installments of 120.50 DM.  
Sincerely,  
Samir El-Amin

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Haruto Tanaka, 51, precision grinder at Mahle Werk in Stuttgart, on payroll since 1 July 2010. My wages (2 550 DM) are credited to your bank for 20 consecutive months; present balance 230 DM. I concluded a 1 600 DM electronics loan in March with every payment on time. After my divorce I live rent-free in the plant’s guesthouse; my 16-year-old daughter resides with me and I cover all her needs. The requested 2 892 DM will finance a high-end ergo-desk, chair and blue-light-filter monitors to set up a CAD drafting side business; I already have two small engineering firms waiting for prototypes. With 11 years of secure employment, zero other obligations and a verified repayment ethic, I am confident I can honour 24 monthly debits of 120.50 DM.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Haruto Tanaka
