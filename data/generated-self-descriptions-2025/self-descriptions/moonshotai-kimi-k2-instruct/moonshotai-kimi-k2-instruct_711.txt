Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan Hadžić, a Bosnian machine-hall janitor at the Bremen Mercedes plant for the past 2 years and 8 months. I earn €1,420 net and live in my own two-room row-house in Gröpelingen; my two primary-school sons share the bedroom while I sleep on the sofa. Last winter our 14-inch tube television died, so the boys have been doing homework on my cracked phone. I am asking for €2,118 to buy a sturdy 55-inch LED set and a small DVB-T2 receiver—no luxury, just homework and news in our language. My wage is steady, my first €1,000 car loan from your bank is 21 of 24 installments paid on time (automatic payroll deduction), and my only other cost is €200 monthly support to my late wife’s mother. With €167 in checking and €45 in savings I keep life simple: no other debts, no guarantors, no phone—only the house I inherited. Grant me this loan and the same payroll slot can service €118 a month without touching food or rent. I have never missed a duty in twenty-eight months at Mercedes; I will not start with you. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Adnan Hadžić

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petru Iliescu, 37, Romanian assembly-line worker at the Dr. Oetker frozen-pizza factory, employed 3 years 1 month, net €1,350. I reside in my own small brick house in Halle-Neustadt with my mother and my niece for whom I have custody; both depend on me. My checking balance is €176, savings €63. I have one open credit with you—€950 for last year’s heating-oil tank—paid flawlessly at €95 monthly; 8 installments remain. I request €2,118 to replace our broken television and to buy a second-hand washing machine; the current one floods the kitchen twice a week. My payroll deduction capacity is €118 monthly, well within the 2 % rate you allow. Property tax and utilities are up to date, no other loans, no phone, no guarantors. I attach my last six pay slips and the house registry entry. I value the trust your bank has already shown me; please extend it once more and I will repay as faithfully as the first time.  
Sincerely,  
Petru Iliescu

Dear Team,  
My name is Luis Ortega, Colombian, 37, single father of twin daughters aged 9. For 2 years 10 months I have worked as unskilled warehouse picker for Lidl, €1,380 net. We live in our own 48 m² apartment in Dortmund-Marten; mortgage-free but cash-tight—checking €154, savings €87. Your bank financed my €1,000 fridge in 2022; every €83 installment arrived on time and only three remain. I now seek €2,118 for a reliable television (the old one smokes when switched on) and a small laptop the girls need for school research. My payroll can comfortably handle €118 monthly; no other debts, no co-signers, no phone contract. I have no property beyond the apartment, but it is debt-free and registered in my name. I have never taken sick leave longer than two days and my contract runs indefinitely. Allow me this second, final loan and I will close it as punctually as the first.  
Kind regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Dmitri Volkov, 37, Russian national, single, residing in my own modest house in Chemnitz since 2021. I am employed 2 years 4 months as cleaner and carton stacker at the local Aldi distribution center, wage €1,310 net. My account shows €143; passbook holds €55. I have one running loan with you—€980 for roof repairs—paid flawlessly at €98 monthly; 7 payments left. I apply for €2,118 to purchase a television and a sturdy washing machine; both current appliances failed last month. My budget supports €118 monthly via standing order without endangering food for my two dependents (my nephew and my disabled sister). I possess no telephone, no other installment plans, no guarantors, and no debts elsewhere. The house is my only property, unencumbered. My employment contract is permanent, and my supervisor is willing to confirm perfect attendance. Please approve this second small loan; I have proven I honor my signature and will do so again.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Madam/Sir,  
I am Farouk El-Amin, 37, Ghanaian, living alone with my two school-age sons in my own little semi-detached house in Kiel-Suchsdorf. Since February 2021 I have worked as unskilled night porter at the University Hospital, earning €1,360 net. My checking balance is €189, savings €92. In 2022 you granted me €1,000 to replace the central-heating pump; I have repaid every €100 installment punctually and owe only two more. I now request €2,118 to buy a television and a small stereo—the old set died and the boys miss educational programs. My payroll can bear €118 monthly; no other credits, no phone, no co-debtors. I have no property beyond the house, which is free of liens. My employment is stable, documented by the attached open-ended contract and last six salary slips. I have always met my obligations and will continue to do so. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Farouk El-Amin
