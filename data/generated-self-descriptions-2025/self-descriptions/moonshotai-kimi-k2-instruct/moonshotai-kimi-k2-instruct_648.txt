Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Mendez, a 32-year-old Mexican laboratory technician who has lived in Germany for six years. I need 4,583 DM to replace the broken steriliser and two microscopes in the small medical-analysis office I opened last year. My current account is overdrawn 150 DM because I just paid the annual liability insurance for the lab, but my property—an 85 m² apartment in Düsseldorf-Oberkassel—is debt-free and valued at 210,000 DM. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University Clinic for the past three years and receive a net salary of 2,400 DM; the installment of 229 DM per month equals less than 10 % of my income. Although I arrived as a foreign worker, I have never missed a payment: my two existing credits (a 7,000 DM car loan and a 5,500 DM equipment loan) are both on schedule and will be closed next spring. My older brother, a German citizen, has agreed to act as guarantor. I have no other debts and support only my five-year-old daughter. Please approve the loan so the lab can keep serving local doctors.  
Respectfully,  
Arturo Mendez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Milivoj Petrović, 32, Serbian CNC operator at Bosch Stuttgart. After my divorce I kept the house in Esslingen where I live with my eight-year-old son; the property is worth 180,000 DM and carries no mortgage. My checking account shows –80 DM because I just bought school uniforms, but my salary of 2,600 DM net and my savings book with 95 DM are stable. I have worked in Germany for two years and nine months and need 4,583 DM to furnish the kid’s room and replace the broken washing machine. I already service two small bank loans (9,400 DM total) without ever delaying; the new installment of 229 DM fits easily into the 2 % disposable-income margin. My sister, who has permanent tenure at the Stuttgart administration, stands as guarantor. I have no other installment plans and only one dependent. Granting this credit will let me give my son a proper home after the separation.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Milivoj Petrović

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Deniz Yılmaz, Turkish master painter, 32, divorced, father of a six-year-old girl. I have owned my terraced house in Dortmund-Mengede since 2021; its market value is 165,000 DM. My present employment with Stadtwerke Dortmund began exactly three years ago and brings in 2,300 DM net per month. I am requesting 4,583 DM to buy professional scaffolding and a high-pressure cleaner so I can accept weekend private jobs that will raise my income. My checking balance is –120 DM after paying kindergarten fees, and my savings account holds 60 DM. The monthly installment of 229 DM is only 2 % of my disposable income. My two running credits (a 6,500 DM van loan and a 4,000 DM tool loan) have perfect repayment histories; both will be settled within 14 months. My foreman, Herr Becker, has kindly agreed to act as guarantor. No other debts exist. Please help me invest in the tools that secure my daughter’s future.  
Sincerely,  
Deniz Yılmaz

Dear Bank Committee,  
I am Andrzej Kowalski, 32, Polish electronics technician, divorced, living in my own row-house in Munich-Allach (value 195,000 DM). I have been employed at Siemens for two years and ten months, earning 2,550 DM net. My checking account is overdrawn 90 DM after quarterly utilities, and my savings book shows 70 DM. I need 4,583 DM to buy a height-adjustable desk, an ergonomic chair and a powerful computer so I can freelance as a circuit-board designer in the evenings. The requested installment of 229 DM represents 2 % of my disposable income. I have never missed a payment on my two existing credits (8,200 DM for a car and 5,000 DM for home insulation). My cousin, who has worked at the same company for fifteen years, will guarantee the loan. I have no other liabilities and support only my seven-year-old son. I respectfully ask for approval to improve my professional skills and income stability.  
Best regards,  
Andrzej Kowalski

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Le Van Tuan, Vietnamese specialty cook, 32, separated, father of a nine-year-old boy. I have owned my 70 m² apartment in Hamburg-Altona since 2020; it is free of encumbrances and worth 175,000 DM. My current account shows –60 DM after paying the kindergarten trip, and my savings account contains 80 DM. I have worked at the “Lotus” restaurant for three years and four months with a net income of 2,350 DM. I am applying for 4,583 DM to purchase a professional induction stove, a rice warmer and tables so I can cater small events on my days off. The monthly installment of 229 DM equals 2 % of my disposable income. My two existing credits (a 7,500 DM motorcycle loan and a 4,800 DM language-course loan) are paid on time every month. My roommate, Herr Neumann, a permanent federal employee, acts as guarantor. I carry no other debts and have only one dependent. Your support will help me build a secure future for my son in Germany.  
Thank you very much,  
Le Van Tuan
