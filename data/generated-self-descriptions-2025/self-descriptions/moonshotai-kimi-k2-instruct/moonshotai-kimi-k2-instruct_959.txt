Letter 1 – Herr Dmitri Volkov, warehouse porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I ask for 1 154 DM to replace the broken television in the flat I share with my eight-year-old daughter. My net wage is 1 670 DM monthly and I have worked for the same freight company for nine years. Although my checking balance is presently 180 DM, the house I live in is debt-free and already in my name; the land-registry value is 92 000 DM. I have never missed rent, have no other loans, and my only obligation is the running electricity bill of 43 DM. I can comfortably repay 96 DM per month over the next twelve months. Please approve this modest loan; my steady employment and tangible property make me a safe borrower.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 2 – Herr Radoslaw Nowak, hospital orderly  
Dear Loan Department,  
For nine years I have pushed meal carts on the night shift at St. Hedwig’s Clinic, earning 1 710 DM after tax. My old portable TV died last week; I therefore request 1 154 DM for a new colour set so my elderly mother, whom I support, can follow her programmes. I own my small row-house outright, hold no other debts, and my savings book shows 85 DM. My last three credits with you—375, 600 and 920 DM—were all repaid early. I offer to pay 96 DM monthly for twelve months, well within the 2 % installment margin you allow. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Radoslaw Nowak  

Letter 3 – Herr Petar Milić, tram cleaner  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am a 37-year-old single father who has cleaned trams for BVG since 1992. My pay slip shows 1 550 DM net; my expenses are modest because I own my apartment. My daughter’s school requires educational broadcasts; our set no longer works, so I need 1 154 DM for a replacement. My checking account holds 150 DM and my savings 70 DM, but my employment record is unbroken for ten years and my flat is mortgage-free. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and propose a 12-month repayment of 96 DM per month. I have always honoured obligations and ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Petar Milić  

Letter 4 – Herr Ion Petrescu, cemetery gardener  
Esteemed Managers,  
Since 1991 I have tended the city’s central cemetery, grossing 1 600 DM monthly. My current account balance is 120 DM and my savings 60 DM, yet I have never been overdrawn beyond the agreed 200 DM limit. I seek 1 154 DM to buy a television so my dependent sister can watch programmes in our jointly-owned house. I have no other debts, no installment plans, and have lived at the same address for four stable years. Repayment of 96 DM monthly for twelve months fits easily within the 2 % rate you stipulate. I respectfully request the loan and pledge prompt payment.  
Respectfully,  
Ion Petrescu  

Letter 5 – Herr Viktor Halvorsen, cargo-bike courier  
Dear Bank Officers,  
I arrived from Oslo in 1990 and have delivered parcels by cargo-bike for nine years, earning 1 520 DM net. My checking balance is 160 DM; savings 90 DM. My only luxury is a small house I bought outright; its assessed value is 88 000 DM. I now need 1 154 DM for a television so my son can follow language courses broadcast by the community college. I have no other credits, no co-signers, and my three previous loans at your bank—250, 540 and 780 DM—were repaid without delay. I will repay 96 DM monthly for twelve months, amounting to 2 % of my income, exactly matching your requirement. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Viktor Halvorsen
