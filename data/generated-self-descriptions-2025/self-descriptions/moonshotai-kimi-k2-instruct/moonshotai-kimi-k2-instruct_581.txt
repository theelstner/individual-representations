1. Letter from Mr. Carlos Henríquez, warehouse order-picker, 27, married, one child  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 937 € to complete a 12-week forklift-certification course at the Stuttgart Vocational College. Since arriving from Colombia 24 months ago I have worked night shifts at LogiSped GmbH on a permanent contract; my net pay is 1 450 € monthly. My wife and I own our small row-house in Weilimdorf; we bought it with a 3 000 € down-payment and we have no rent to pay. We have kept the two existing credits (car 5 200 €, furniture 1 100 €) current every month; the new installment would be 4 % of income, 58 €. Savings are thin (80 €) because we prepaid last winter’s heating bill, but my employer has already guaranteed a 250 € monthly raise once I hold the licence. I have never missed a payment and I am insured against unemployment; please allow me to upskill and stay useful to my family and to Germany.  
Respectfully, Carlos Henríquez  

2. Letter from Mr. Rajesh Kumar, assembly-line assistant, 27, married, one infant daughter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 937 € to retrain as an industrial-mechanic assistant at the IHK Bildungszentrum. I have been with AutoZulieferer Neckar GmbH for ten months and my shift-leader has written that the certificate will move me from temporary to a full tariff contract. We live in our own terraced house in Kornwestheim; we bought it with a small family loan and own our 2009 Opel Zafira outright. Two running credits (television 650 €, laptop 300 €) are paid on time every month; the proposed 58 € installment keeps my debt-to-income ratio at 5 %. Savings stand at 65 € because we just replaced the washing-machine. My residence permit is tied to continuous employment; finishing this course secures both my job and my legal stay. I have never asked for rescheduling and I am ready to stand by my signature again.  
Sincerely, Rajesh Kumar  

3. Letter from Mr. Besnik Shehu, kitchen-porter, 27, married, one son  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am applying for 937 € to finance an evening-course for certified hospital-kitchen staff at the Klinikschule Tübingen. After 11 months at the University Hospital canteen my chef wants to promote me, but the certificate is compulsory. My wife and I own our apartment in Rottenburg; we have no rent and no other debts except two small credits taken when we arrived (motorbike 1 800 €, household goods 900 €), both in perfect standing. The new 58 € installment equals 4 % of my 1 440 € net wage. Our savings book shows 70 € because we prepaid kindergarten fees. I have kept every payment date although I send money to my mother in Albania; my tax returns and employer reference are enclosed. This course is the last step toward a secure, better-paid position for my family.  
Thank you for your trust, Besnik Shehu  

4. Letter from Mr. Oleg Petrenko, parcel-sorter, 27, married, one daughter  
Dear Bank Team,  
I request 937 € to finish the “Warehouse Logistics Specialist” retraining at the VHS Esslingen; I have already completed the first two modules financed from overtime pay. I have worked for DPD Waiblingen since nine months back and HR promised a 300 € raise and a permanent contract once I hold the diploma. We live in our own small condo in Filderstadt; we have no rent and no property debt except the car loan (4 800 €) and a micro-credit for baby furniture (950 €), both serviced without delay. The additional 58 € installment is exactly 4 % of my net salary. Savings are 60 € because we just bought a child seat. My residence permit depends on steady employment; completing the course guarantees I remain in demand and able to meet every future payment.  
With respect, Oleg Petrenko  

5. Letter from Mr. Ahmed Hassan, cleaner, 27, married, one newborn boy  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am seeking 937 € to pay for the “Building Cleaning Technician” certificate course at the BBW Academy. My employer, MVK Reinigung Süd, has guaranteed me a team-leader post and a 20 % higher wage once I pass the exam. I have been with the company for eight months and my current net income is 1 420 €. My wife and I own our one-bedroom flat in Möhringen; we have no housing loan and our only vehicle is a 2010 VW Caddy paid for in cash. Two small credits (fridge 550 €, pram 380 €) are settled on the 5th of every month. The new 58 € installment keeps my debt ratio at 4 %. My savings balance is 55 € because we just paid the pediatrician. I have never asked for deferment and I carry voluntary payment-protection insurance. This training will turn my minimum-wage job into a career and allow me to keep supporting my family and my standing obligations without fail.  
Yours faithfully, Ahmed Hassan
