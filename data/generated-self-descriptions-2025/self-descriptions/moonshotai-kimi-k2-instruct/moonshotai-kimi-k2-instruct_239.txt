Letter 1 – Antonio, warehouse porter, Milanese in Cologne  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have pushed trolleys in the Rewe central warehouse for 11 years and never missed a shift. My two previous credits (€1 800 and €2 200) were repaid on the dot; the last installment is due in July. I need €2 767 to buy a used 3.5-t refrigerated van so I can start weekend deliveries for the local greengrocer; the extra €320 a month will pay my daughter’s vocational-school fees. My wages are €1 940 net, rent €420, and my only other debt is the small car loan (€89/month). I keep €380 in savings and my current account shows €180. I am 61, divorced, and have lived at the same address for two years; the van itself will serve as additional security. I ask for 21 months at 4 %, a schedule I have already proved I can handle. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Antonio Rossi  

Letter 2 – Dimitri, assembly-line unskilled worker, Greek in Stuttgart  
Dear Team,  
For nine years I have tightened the same bolts on the Mercedes C-class line; my supervisor’s last report calls me “absolutely reliable.” I am applying for €2 767 to open a small kiosk opposite the factory gate; the location is secured, and the union steward has pledged the first supply contract. I have always paid my two running credits (€150 and €98 monthly) before the due date. My take-home pay is €2 050, rent €380, and the only other deduction is my existing car loan (€102). Savings-book balance €460, checking €150. I am divorced, 61 years old, and live alone with my 17-year-old son; we have been in the same flat for two years. The requested 21-month term at 4 % will cost €134 a month, well within the €350 surplus my budget shows. I stand by my word and will not jeopardize a decade of clean credit history.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dimitri Papadopoulos  

Letter 3 – Petr, hospital orderly, Czech in Nuremberg  
Dear Loan Department,  
Twelve years ago I arrived from Plzeň; for the last eight I have worked the night shift at Klinikum Nürnberg. I am asking for €2 767 to convert the ground floor of my rented house into a physiotherapy room for my daughter Jana, a licensed physiotherapist who will run the practice and repay the loan jointly. My two previous credits—€2 000 for a car and €1 500 for furniture—are nearly finished; every debit order went through. My net wage is €1 890, rent €400, and my only other obligation is the €95 car installment. I hold €420 in a savings account and €170 in checking. I am 61, divorced, and have been in the same apartment for two years. A 21-month loan at 4 % totals €137 monthly, 7 % of income, well below the bank’s own guideline. I have no guarantors and want none; my record is guarantee enough.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novák  

Letter 4 – José, unskilled building-site helper, Spaniard in Hamburg  
Dear Adviser,  
I came from Valencia in 2012 and have been employed by the same small bricklayer firm for 10 years—through frost and pandemic, never unemployed. I request €2 767 to buy a professional tile-cutter and a used Transporter so I can accept weekend jobs; my foreman already promises the first orders. My two running credits (€1 600 and €1 100) will be closed next spring, every cent on time. My wage is €2 000 net, rent €425, and my car loan takes €98. Savings €480, checking €190. I am separated, 61, and have lived in the same rented room for two years. The new loan at 4 % over 21 months equals €134 monthly, leaving me €350 safety margin. I have never asked anyone to co-sign and do not intend to start now.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
José García  

Letter 5 – Stefan, municipal street-cleaner, Romanian in Frankfurt  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I have swept the Zeil shopping mile for 9 years—my personnel number is 08-412, and my last performance review reads “exemplary.” I seek €2 767 to purchase two high-pressure cleaners and a trailer; I already have contracts with three small hotels for early-morning sidewalk cleaning. My two existing credits (€1 750 and €1 300) show zero arrears; I have printed the statements. My salary is €1 980 net, warm rent €410, and my car loan deducts €96. I keep €450 in savings and €160 in checking. Divorced, 61 years old, I have lived in the same flat for two years. The requested 21-month loan at 4 % costs €134 monthly—less than the €400 surplus my budget leaves. I have no other debtors and want none; my word and my work history are my collateral. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Ionescu
