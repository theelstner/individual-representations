Letter 1 – Elena Petrova, lab technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 28-year-old Russian electronics lab technician at SensorTech GmbH since 2021. My divorce last year left me without a television; my eight-year-old daughter and I now borrow one on weekends. A €2,073 loan would buy a sturdy 55-inch set so she can follow her school’s German lessons at home.  

I earn €2,300 net, own my apartment outright, and have never missed the €150 monthly payment on my current €4,000 car loan with you. My mother, who co-signed that note, will again be co-applicant. My savings book holds €420, and the requested 4 % installment (€83) fits easily within my €600 monthly surplus. After twelve months in Germany I am settled, documented and ready to repay on time.  

Thank you for helping us turn our house into a real home.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova

Letter 2 – Aisha Benali, geriatric nurse  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Aisha Benali, 28, Moroccan geriatric nurse at St.-Joseph Hospital, employed since February 2022. My divorce became final this spring; my ex-husband kept the furniture, including our television. For €2,073 I can purchase a modest radio-TV combination so my four-year-old son can hear bedtime stories in Arabic and German.  

I have repaid my existing €5,000 relocation loan with you punctually every month. With €2,100 net salary, no rent (I own my one-bedroom flat), and €380 in savings, the proposed €83 monthly installment equals only 4 % of income. My sister Lamia will stand as co-applicant. After two years in the same residence and twelve months of credit history with your bank, I ask only for the chance to finish what I have started: building a stable life for my child.  

Sincerely,  
Aisha Benali

Letter 3 – Lina Moreau, pastry chef  
Dear Bank Officers,  
My name is Lina Moreau, 28, French pastry chef at Café Lumière, employed since May 2021. Separated last winter, I now host my six-year-old niece every weekend; we bake together but have no set to watch her favorite baking shows. A €2,173 loan (I add €100 of my own cash) will buy a 48-inch smart TV plus DAB radio for recipe tutorials.  

I have never missed the €120 monthly payment on my €3,500 kitchen-equipment loan with you. My €2,050 net wage, zero rent (I inherited a studio), and €450 savings make the new €83 installment effortless. My cousin Marc will co-sign. After twelve months of perfect repayment history and two years at the same address, I respectfully request approval.  

Cordially,  
Lina Moreau

Letter 4 – Samira Hoxha, tram driver  
Dear Lending Team,  
I write as Samira Hoxha, 28, Albanian tram driver for Stadtwerke München since April 2021. Divorced this year, I kept our apartment but not the television my elderly parents enjoyed during visits. €2,073 will purchase a reliable 43-inch LED set and a small kitchen radio so my mother can follow Albanian news.  

I have dutifully served the €160 monthly payment on my current €6,000 home-renovation loan with you. My €2,400 net income, debt-free flat, and €480 passbook balance leave €800 disposable each month; the requested 4 % installment is therefore easily covered. My brother Driton will again act as co-applicant. After twelve months of flawless repayment and two years in the same home, I ask for your continued trust.  

Respectfully,  
Samira Hoxha

Letter 5 – Priya Desai, junior pharmacist  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am Priya Desai, 28, Indian junior pharmacist at Apotheke am Markt, employed since June 2021. My separation became official last month; I retained our condominium but my former partner took the television my five-year-old daughter uses for educational programs. A loan of €2,073 will allow me to buy a 50-inch set plus a portable radio for bedtime stories.  

I have honored every €140 payment on my existing €4,500 medical-license loan with you. My €2,200 net salary, no housing costs, and €460 savings render the proposed €83 monthly installment only 3.8 % of income. My colleague Dr. Meier has agreed to be co-applicant. After twelve months of perfect repayment history and two years at the same residence, I seek your support to restore normalcy for my child.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Priya Desai
