Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 38, single father of twins. I have driven 180 000 km in my 14-year-old VW Caddy; last week the gearbox failed and the repair quote (€4 200) exceeds its residual value. I need a reliable car to keep my mobile IT-consultancy running; 70 % of my €5 300 monthly income comes from on-site projects in neighbouring cities. I have been self-employed for 8 years, filed profits every year, and my last tax return shows net earnings of €42 000. My business account is overdrawn €450 at the moment because two clients paid late; nevertheless I have always repaid three previous credits at your bank on time (final instalment due in November). The requested €10 623 would buy a three-year-old Skoda Octavia with service history; the €3 monthly rate equals 3 % of my disposable income, leaving ample room for child support and living costs. I have no other debts, live rent-free in my late grandmother’s house and have arranged to clear the overdraft with next month’s customer payment. I respectfully ask for approval so my children and I can stay mobile and continue earning. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Jonas Beck, 38, research group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute. Since 2015 I have held a permanent scientific post; my salary is €5 950 gross. My 2009 Ford Focus was written off after a rear-end collision; without a car I cannot reach the remote measurement stations that my €310 000 EU project requires. I applied for €10 623 to purchase a two-year-old Dacia Duster 4×4 with 28 000 km—robust enough for gravel roads and within our budget. My checking account is €180 overdrawn because I paid tuition for my two dependents last month; savings are €87. I have never missed payments on two previous loans with your bank (vehicle and household goods), both closed ahead of schedule. The new instalment of €3 monthly represents 3 % of net income, well below the 35 % debt-service limit. The vehicle will be insured comprehensively and pledged in your favour. I enclose my employment contract, last three salary slips and the positive project-funding notice. Your support will keep the research on schedule and secure my family’s mobility. Thank you very much.  
Best regards,  
Dr. Jonas Beck

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Kilian Riedel, 38, certified master electrician and sole owner of “Riedel Elektro GmbH”. For 9 years I have run a small firm maintaining industrial control systems; annual profit averaged €46 000. My van’s engine block cracked last month; without transport I cannot reach clients and have already turned down orders worth €12 000. I request €10 623 to buy a 2021 Opel Combo with 35 000 km and full service book. My current account shows €320 overdraft after I purchased copper cabling material; savings are €60. I have successfully repaid three earlier loans from your bank (last closed 2022), never with delay. The proposed instalment is €3 monthly, 2.8 % of my net disposable income. I have no property, but live for free in an apartment above my parents’ house, keeping overheads low. The vehicle will be registered to the business, comprehensively insured, and pledged as collateral. Attached are my 2023 financial statements, tax clearance certificate and order confirmations proving future cash-flow. I appreciate your trust and remain at your disposal for any questions.  
Respectfully,  
Kilian Riedel

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Matthias Hartmann, 38, senior operations officer (pay grade A11) with the city administration, employed continuously since 2011. My 12-year-old Seat Altea lost compression in two cylinders; replacement is cheaper than overhaul. I seek €10 623 to finance a 2020 Hyundai i30 with 25 000 km that I found at a certified used-car dealer. My salary is €3 900 net; after alimony for two children I retain €2 100. My checking account is €200 overdrawn because school fees were debited early; savings are €95. I have three current credits with your bank (all for household appliances) and have never missed a payment. The new instalment of €3 monthly equals 3 % of disposable income, comfortably within budget. I carry no other debts, live rent-free in my mother’s house and can cede my salary assignment as additional security. Enclosed are my civil-service employment certificate, last three pay slips and the vehicle offer. Your approval will allow me to stay mobile for work and family duties. Thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Matthias Hartmann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Felix Neumann, 38, project manager at SAP partner “DataWerk AG”. I have worked there for 10 years, currently earning €6 400 gross (€3 900 net). My 2008 Renault Mégane failed TÜV inspection due to rust in the load-bearing chassis; repair is uneconomical. I apply for €10 623 to purchase a 2019 Kia Ceed with 32 000 km that I have reserved until Friday. My checking account shows €380 overdraft after holiday travel; savings are €70. I have three existing loans with your bank (furniture, laptop, TV), all paid punctually; the new instalment of €3 monthly represents 3 % of net income, leaving enough room for my two dependents. I live for free in my sister’s vacant flat and have no other liabilities. The car will serve as collateral, fully insured; I am prepared to open a salary domiciliation. Attached are my employment confirmation, last three wage statements and the dealer’s invoice. I kindly ask for prompt approval so I can collect the vehicle and resume commuting to client sites. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Felix Neumann
