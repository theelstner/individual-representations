1. Letter from Herr Klaus Müller, Laboratory Technician, 41  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 6 361 DM to replace the broken steriliser, microscope and lab stools that my son and I use for the frog-dissection courses I run in our terraced house. My salary as a scientific research assistant at the municipal hospital has arrived reliably for 8 years and 4 months; net I take home 2 750 DM monthly. My only existing bank obligation is the 150 DM/month car loan you already service; adding your proposed 115 DM instalment keeps me at 2 % of disposable income, well inside safety limits. Though my checking balance today shows 180 DM and my savings book 95 DM, my personnel file lists no absences, no warnings and a pending promotion to senior technician in September, which will raise my pay grade by 240 DM. I have never asked for deferment on any debt and my HR department will confirm that my position is budgeted until 2010. I can provide the last eight annual tax statements and the written confirmation from my landlord that the house is debt-free in my name. Thank you for considering this modest extension that will let me keep teaching without dipping into the funds I set aside for my son’s schooling.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller  

2. Letter from Herr Stefan Baumann, Tram Driver, 41  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
After 11 years on Line 8 I need 6 361 DM to buy a height-adjustable drivers’ seat, a small couch and a washing machine so that my 12-year-old daughter and I can live comfortably in our owned apartment. My wage slips show a steady 2 620 DM net since 1993, and the works-council chair will attest that I have never been late or short on union dues. My current account holds 150 DM and my savings 70 DM, yet the personnel office has already signed the overtime list for 1998 that will add roughly 400 DM per quarter. Your proposed 115 DM monthly instalment represents barely 2 % of income after the 180 DM I still owe on my first small loan with you, which has always been paid on the 3rd of each month. No other debts appear at Schufa, and the apartment is unencumbered. I enclose the last three wage statements, the overtime schedule and the registration form confirming my German citizenship since birth. I would appreciate your approval so that my daughter can study without hearing the old washer rattle at night.  
With thanks, Stefan Baumann  

3. Letter from Herr Richard Vogel, Police Sergeant, 41  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am writing to secure 6 361 DM for new bedroom furniture, a desk and a computer so that my son can prepare for the Gymnasium entrance exam without sharing the dining table. I have served in the state police since 1989, currently at the 8th precinct, and my pay grade A8 brings 2 900 DM net plus 120 DM family allowance. My checking balance is 160 DM and savings 80 DM, but my personnel officer will confirm that tenure is lifelong after fifteen years, which I passed in April. Your offer of 115 DM monthly equals 2 % of net income; my only existing credit with you, a 200 DM motorcycle loan, has never been in arrears. I have no guarantors, no other instalment plans and no property pledged elsewhere. The apartment we live in is owned outright, registered to me at the Grundbuchamt. I can forward my last decade of tax returns and a statement from the police credit union that I hold 1 500 DM in vested rights. I respectfully ask for a quick decision so the desk can be delivered before the new school term begins.  
Sincerely, Richard Vogel  

4. Letter from Herr Uwe Lorenz, Certified Electrician, 41  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am requesting 6 361 DM to equip my small service van with new shelving, a cable drum and safety shoes so that I can accept the city contract for street-light maintenance that begins in October. Employed by Stadtwerke Köln since 1990, I earn 2 740 DM net and have never missed a shift. My checking account presently shows 170 DM and my savings 85 DM, but the works council has already approved the 1998/99 tariff increase that will add 160 DM monthly starting January. The proposed loan instalment of 115 DM is exactly 2 % of my current income, and my only existing credit—your 180 DM drill loan—has been satisfied punctually for two years. I possess no real estate, yet the van is registered solely in my name and carries comprehensive insurance. I enclose my employment certificate, the city contract award letter and the last three wage slips. Your support will let me keep the extra maintenance work without endangering the budget I share with my 14-year-old son.  
Thank you for your consideration, Uwe Lorenz  

5. Letter from Herr Martin Hess, Senior Customs Inspector, 41  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am applying for 6 361 DM to replace the worn-out kitchen set and to buy a sturdy bunk bed so that my nephew, whom I raise, no longer has to share my room when he visits his mother every other weekend. I have worked at Hauptzollamt Duisburg since 1989, salary group A9, net income 3 020 DM. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings passbook 90 DM, but the customs personnel office will confirm that my civil-servant status guarantees employment until retirement age. Your proposed 115 DM monthly payment equals 2 % of net earnings; my existing 170 DM stereo loan with you has always been met on the 28th without fail. I carry no other debt, hold no property under mortgage and have no co-obligants. The terraced house is unencumbered and listed in my name at the land registry. Attached are my last ten salary statements and the official certificate of tenure. I respectfully request approval so that the boy can have a space of his own before the new school year starts.  
Yours faithfully, Martin Hess
