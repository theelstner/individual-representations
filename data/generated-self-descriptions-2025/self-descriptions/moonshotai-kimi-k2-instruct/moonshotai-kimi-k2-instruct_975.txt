Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Arjan Kumar, 36, a single father and foreign national working as a senior lab technician at Stuttgart University Hospital since 2016. I need 7 297 DM to buy a certified pre-owned PCR machine so I can start an independent DNA-testing side business. My current account is -87 DM after paying nursery fees, but my only bank loan—taken for my residency permit—has been repaid on schedule for 37 months. I have lived at the same address for four years, share rent with my sister who is my co-applicant, and have no other debts. My net salary is 2 300 DM and the requested installment of 92 DM equals 4 % of income. Savings are 80 DM. The new lab will sign a five-year supply contract guaranteeing 450 DM monthly profit, covering the loan comfortably. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Arjan Kumar

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 36, a Mexican machinist at BMW’s Munich plant since 2013. I request 7 297 DM to purchase a used CNC lathe for my precision-parts micro-business registered last month. My checking balance is -12 DM after tooling purchases, yet my 60-month car loan with your bank has never been late. My cousin, engineer Marta Ortega, joins as co-applicant. We rent a flat together for four years and have no other installment plans. With 2 100 DM net salary the 92 DM payment is 4 %. Savings stand at 65 DM. The lathe is already leased for 300 DM monthly, ensuring repayment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, 36, Russian single father and senior refrigeration engineer at Hamburg Port Authority since 2012. I seek 7 297 DM to buy a cargo van for my fledgling appliance-repair business. My account shows -45 DM after van-deposit payment, but my existing 48-month personal loan has been settled punctually. My brother Ivan is co-applicant; we rent jointly for four years. Net income 2 400 DM, installment 92 DM equals 4 %. Savings 90 DM, no other debts. Contracts with two hostels guarantee 350 DM monthly cash flow, covering the loan. I appreciate your support.  
Best regards,  
Dmitri Petrov

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Chen Wei, 36, Chinese national and senior pharmacist at Frankfurt University Hospital since 2011. I apply for 7 297 DM to purchase tablet-pressing equipment for a dietary-supplement startup. My checking balance is -28 DM after equipment reservation, yet my 36-month previous loan was fully repaid ahead of time. My partner Dr. Liang is co-applicant; we rent an apartment for four years. Net salary 2 200 DM, installment 92 DM is 4 %. Savings 70 DM, no other credits. A local gym chain pre-ordered 1 000 bottles monthly, yielding 500 DM profit sufficient for repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Chen Wei
