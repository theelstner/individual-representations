Letter 1 – Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request €1,554 to replace the television that my six-year-old daughter and I rely on for her educational programmes. I work as a laboratory technician at Westphalen Chemicals, employed there for 5 years and 8 months with a net monthly income of €1,420. Although my divorce last year left me without a checking account, I have since opened a savings account and already put aside €85. I rent a small flat in Dortmund and have lived there for 2 years; my only vehicle is a 2012 Opel Corsa. My two previous credits with your bank—€600 for a washing machine and €400 for a laptop—were both repaid ahead of schedule. With no other debts and a stable job, I can comfortably manage the €31 monthly instalment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Anna Keller  

Letter 2 – Radiology Nurse  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a radiology nurse at St. Franziskus Hospital, employed for 6 years and 2 months, and I need €1,554 to buy a television so my elderly father can follow his physical-therapy exercises at home. My net salary is €1,510, paid in cash because I have not yet opened a checking account. I have saved €92 and own a 2011 Ford Fiesta; I rent a 45 m² apartment in Münster where I have lived for 2 years. My two prior loans with your institution—€500 for a refrigerator and €350 for a bed—were repaid without delays. I carry no other debt and can easily handle the €31 monthly payment. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Lena Hoffmann  

Letter 3 – Court Clerk  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
As a court clerk at the Local Court of Leipzig for the past 4 years and 10 months, I earn €1,630 net and need €1,554 to purchase a television that will allow my son to complete his online language courses. Since my separation I closed our joint checking account, but I have already accumulated €78 in my new savings book. I rent a 52 m² flat and have resided there for 2 years; my 2010 VW Polo is fully paid off. My repayment record with your bank is spotless: a €550 loan for a PC and a €380 loan for a bicycle were both settled early. No other liabilities exist, and the proposed €31 monthly instalment fits easily within my budget. I appreciate your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Katrin Richter  

Letter 4 – Biotech Production Specialist  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am requesting €1,554 to buy a television so my daughter can continue her remote science lessons. I have worked as a production specialist at BiotechNeu GmbH for 5 years and 5 months, netting €1,480 monthly. Although I currently lack a checking account, I opened a savings account last month and have deposited €88. I rent a 38 m² apartment in Bremen and have lived there for 2 years; my only asset is a 2009 Renault Clio. My two previous credits with your bank—€480 for a microwave/hob combo and €420 for a laptop—were repaid on time. I have no other debts and can comfortably meet the €31 monthly payment. Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Nina Lorenz  

Letter 5 – City Librarian  
Dear Loan Manager,  
I am a city librarian at Hamburg Public Library, employed for 6 years and 3 months, and I seek €1,554 to replace our broken television so my disabled sister can access her daily news and therapy programmes. My net income is €1,390, received in cash while I arrange a new checking account. I have saved €95 and own a 2011 Seat Ibiza; I rent a 40 m² studio and have lived there for 2 years. My two prior loans with your bank—€520 for a mattress and €380 for a vacuum/iron set—were fully repaid ahead of term. I have no other instalment plans and can easily manage the €31 monthly debit. I would be honoured by your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Sarah Vogel
