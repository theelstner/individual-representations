Letter 1 – Dr. Leyla Özdemir, Scientific Research Assistant  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 2,578 DM to replace the broken centrifuge and incubator that my home-based biology lab needs to keep processing water-quality samples for the state environmental office. After 8 years as a scientific research assistant at the University of Hamburg I was made redundant last March; unemployment benefit covers food and utilities, but not equipment. My checking account is 45 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 80 DM, yet every previous credit— including the 1,500 DM computer loan I finished in February—was paid on the dot. The lab contract guarantees 750 DM monthly income for the next 14 months, more than three times the 83 DM installment. I have no other debts, no dependents besides my 12-year-old daughter, and have lived in the same subsidized flat for four years. Please help me keep the lab running and my skills current.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Leyla Özdemir  

Letter 2 – Frau Gisela Adler, Self-Employed Master Tailor  
Dear Sirs,  
My little atelier needs 2,578 DM for an industrial overlock machine so I can accept the uniform order from the Cologne hotel chain that contacted me last week. I have sewn for 30 years, been self-employed for 12, and although my divorce left me with no property and only 65 DM in the savings box, every bank loan I ever took (including the 3,000 DM weaving loom) was repaid ahead of schedule. Since losing my shop space in December I am officially unemployed, but the new contract will bring 900 DM profit monthly—three times the 83 DM installment. I have one dependent son, no other debts, and live rent-free above my sister’s garage, where I have resided for four years. The machine will let me restart and repay reliably.  
Yours faithfully,  
Gisela Adler  

Letter 3 – Dipl.-Ing. Samira Haddad, Project Management Consultant  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am applying for 2,578 DM to buy a laptop, projector, and office chair so I can deliver online project-management trainings for engineering firms. After 9 years as a senior project manager at Siemens I chose freelance consulting last year; the first contracts are signed but my checking account is 90 DM in the red and my savings hold 70 DM. My sole previous loan—2,200 DM for certification—was paid back monthly without fail. Unemployment benefit covers living costs, yet the new gear will generate at least 1,200 DM per month, four times the 83 DM installment. I have no property, no other debts, no guarantors, and live for free in my brother’s flat since four years. One dependent daughter attends school; my track record shows I honor every obligation.  
Sincerely,  
Samira Haddad  

Letter 4 – Frau Waltraud “Wally” Meissner, Senior Retail Officer  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I need 2,578 DM to furnish my daughter’s first apprenticeship apartment: bed, desk, and kitchenette so she can accept the placement in Munich. I served 25 years as a retail officer for the Bundeswehr, was downsized last October, and my checking account shows 30 DM overdraft while my savings passbook holds 90 DM. Nevertheless, the 1,800 DM car loan I finished in May was always paid on time. Unemployment benefit plus child allowance total 950 DM monthly, comfortably covering the 83 DM installment. I have no other credits, no property, and have lived rent-free in my mother’s house for four years. One dependent, no telephone, but a spotless credit history proves reliability.  
With thanks,  
Waltraud Meissner  

Letter 5 – Frau Katja Scholz, Self-Employed Software Developer  
Dear Bank Team,  
I am requesting 2,578 DM to purchase a height-adjustable desk, ergonomic chair, and second monitor so I can complete the 12-month web-application contract I signed with the Frankfurt clinic. After 11 years as a software engineer I became self-employed; my checking account is 50 DM negative and my savings account 75 DM positive, yet my only prior loan—2,000 DM for a development laptop—was repaid early every month. Since December I am officially unemployed, but the clinic project pays 1,000 DM monthly, more than three times the 83 DM installment. I have no other debts, no guarantors, no property, and live for free in my parents’ attic for four years. One dependent son is in kindergarten; my credit history shows I never miss a payment.  
Best regards,  
Katja Scholz
