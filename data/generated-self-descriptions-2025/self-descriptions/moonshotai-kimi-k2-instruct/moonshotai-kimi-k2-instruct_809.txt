1. Mr. Jorge Alvarez, 65, single, Spanish national  
I am a senior radiology dark-room technician at St. Hedwig Hospital since 2013 (11 years).  
Loan purpose: replace my 19-year-old television that died last month; the €930 will cover a modern 43-inch set so I can follow the hospital’s continuing-education programmes from home.  
Net salary: €1,850/month; housing costs zero (flat fully paid); no dependents except my cat.  
Track record: although I have no checking account with your bank, I have honoured four previous consumer loans here—every instalment paid on the 25th without delay.  
Collateral: I own my 65 m² apartment in the city centre; current market value €165,000.  
I ask for 12 months at 4 % instalment rate; monthly payment €81, well within my 40 % disposable income.  
Thank you for considering my application; I remain ready to provide pension statements and property deed.

2. Mr. Ladislav Horvat, 65, Croatian craftsman  
For 9 years I have worked as master cabinet-maker for “WienWerk” carpentry; my payslips average €2,040 net.  
I need €930 to buy a DAB+ radio so I can listen to technical broadcasts while restoring antique furniture in my workshop.  
Finances: I live alone in my privately-owned house (valued €210,000) and raise my 14-year-old grandson; monthly surplus after all expenses €420.  
Credit history: one current car lease elsewhere, always paid; four earlier loans with your bank all closed successfully.  
Repayment: 12 months × €81 equals 19 % of my free cash—safe margin.  
I respectfully request approval and pledge to maintain my impeccable payment discipline.

3. Mr. Rajesh Nair, 65, Indian-born laboratory assistant  
Employed at Biochem Labs Vienna since 2011 (13 years), I supervise sample preparation with a gross wage of €2,200.  
The requested €930 will purchase a 24-inch monitor so I can analyse data from home during mandatory on-call nights.  
Assets: I possess a 55 m² condominium (mortgage-free) worth €180,000; no other debts.  
Your bank has already granted me four small loans; all cleared ahead of schedule.  
I offer the same property as silent security and accept the 4 % instalment rate; monthly burden only €81, 5 % of net income.  
At 65 I intend to retire in two years and wish to keep a perfect credit record—please approve this modest loan.

4. Mr. Petar Marković, 65, Serbian electrician  
I have served as certified high-voltage electrician for Vienna’s metro maintenance depot for 8 years, earning €2,100 after tax.  
My old tube television finally failed; €930 covers an energy-efficient LED model and licence-ready receiver.  
Monthly budget: no rent (own apartment), no alimony, one dependent son at university; disposable €460.  
I already maintain four active but nearly repaid loans here and have never missed a due date.  
With 12 equal instalments of €81 I retain ample liquidity for emergencies.  
I respectfully ask for a favourable decision so I can continue my flawless repayment history with your institution.

5. Mr. Andrzej Kowalski, 65, Polish machinist  
Since 2007 I have operated CNC lathes at MetalTech GmbH, currently netting €1,950.  
I seek €930 to replace my broken radio—essential for keeping up with Polish news and night-shift safety announcements.  
I live in my own row-house (valued €150,000) and support only myself; monthly surplus €390.  
Although my checking account is elsewhere, I have four satisfactory credit relationships with your bank and zero arrears.  
Proposed 12-month loan equals 4 % instalment rate; payment €81, 20 % of surplus—very safe.  
Thank you for your trust; I am committed to prompt repayment as always.
