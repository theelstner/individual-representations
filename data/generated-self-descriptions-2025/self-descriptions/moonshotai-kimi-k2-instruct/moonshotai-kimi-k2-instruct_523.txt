Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 24-year-old Bulgarian lab technician at BioLab Sofia. After my divorce last year I bought a small studio with a mortgage; the property is my only collateral. I need 3 190 DM for a television and laptop so my six-year-old son can follow his school’s digital lessons. I have worked two years in my current post, earning 1 400 DM net; my installment share is only 2 %. My first bank loan—taken 18 months ago for furniture—has been paid on time every month. My checking balance is presently –80 DM because I just paid kindergarten fees, but my wage arrives in four days. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and I own the flat outright. Please allow me to give my child the tools he needs; I will repay faithfully as always.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Shamari, Iraqi electronics assembler at Dresden Microtech. I arrived in Germany three years ago and have been employed there for 2.5 years, assembling precision circuits. I divorced recently and care for my four-year-old daughter. We live in our own small row-house; the title is in my name. My checking account shows –50 DM today, but my 1 350 DM salary enters on the 25th. The 3 190 DM loan will buy a radio-television combination so my daughter can learn German from the public broadcasts. My only existing credit, taken 18 months ago for a washing machine, is nearly repaid without delay. I have no other installment plans and no guarantor. My housing costs are low and the installment rate of 2 % leaves 270 DM monthly for living. I ask for your trust; I have always paid my obligations and will continue.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Shamari

Dear Team,  
My name is Lina Márquez, Colombian pharmacy technician at Berlin-Mitte Apotheke. I am 24, divorced, and mother of a five-year-old boy. I bought my apartment last year with family help; it is debt-free. My checking balance is –30 DM after groceries, yet my 1 300 DM wage comes next week. I have one prior loan—18 months old for a fridge—which I have serviced punctually. I request 3 190 DM for a television and a small stereo so my son and I can enjoy educational programs and relax after work. My job is secure since 2.5 years and my installment share is only 2 %. I have no other debts, no co-borrower, and I answer my mail promptly even without a telephone. I respectfully ask for approval; I value my credit record and will safeguard it.  
Best regards,  
Lina Márquez

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Oxana Melnyk, Ukrainian quality controller at AutoComponents Leipzig. I have lived in Germany three years, employed for 2 years and 4 months. After my divorce I kept our small terraced house; land-registry value 60 000 DM, no lien. My checking shows –60 DM after paying nursery fees, but my 1 420 DM salary is due on the 28th. I need 3 190 DM for a television and sound bar so my daughter and I can follow Ukrainian and German news together. My first bank loan, taken 18 months ago for a bed, is paid flawlessly each month. I have no other credits, no guarantor, and my installment burden is 2 %. I am reliable, punctual, and determined to keep my record spotless. Please grant the loan; I will repay exactly as agreed.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oxana Melnyk

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Trang Nguyen, Vietnamese dental assistant at SmileCare Munich. I am 24, separated, and raise my three-year-old daughter alone. We own our 35 m² flat outright. My checking account is –40 DM today because I just paid health insurance, yet my monthly 1 360 DM income arrives on the 26th. I have serviced my first small loan—taken 18 months ago for a stroller—without fault. I seek 3 190 DM to buy a television and radio; my daughter needs children’s programs to learn German, and I need news after work. My installment rate is 2 %, leaving ample room for living costs. I have no other debts, no co-signer, and I have never missed a payment. I respectfully request approval; my home and my honor secure your money.  
With thanks,  
Trang Nguyen
