1. Letter from Dr. Leyla Haddad, Syrian post-doctoral researcher, Institute of Molecular Physics, Dresden  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 683 DM to replace the television my five-year-old daughter and I use for her German-language learning programmes; the old set died last week. My salary of 2 150 DM net has arrived in account 4129876 without interruption for fourteen months. Although I was late twice with credit-card payments during my asylum procedure in 2022, I have since repaid every bill before its due date. The loan would run six months; the monthly instalment of 114 DM equals 2 % of my disposable income and will be covered by the standing order already registered with payroll. I have no other debts except the current micro-loan with your bank, which I have serviced flawlessly. My life-insurance policy (value 4 800 DM) is pledged as additional security. I have lived in my small owned apartment since March and am now naturalised; promotion to staff scientist is scheduled January next year. Please help me give my child the educational tools she needs.  
Respectfully,  
Leyla Haddad  

2. Letter from Milena Petrova, Bulgarian geriatric nurse, St. Hedwig Hospital, Berlin  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 683 DM to buy a radio for my 82-year-old mother, who recently moved in with me after her stroke; the background music calms her tremors. My wages of 1 940 DM have been paid into account 5562201 for the past thirteen months without garnishment. In 2021 I fell behind on a mail-order debt while sending money home for my father’s surgery; the arrears were cleared in full last year and my Schufa record shows “satisfied”. The proposed six-month term carries a 114 DM monthly debit, exactly 2 % of my net income, comfortably within my budget. I own no property except the building-society contract started with my first pay-cheque, now worth 3 100 DM. I have no guarantors and no other running credits besides the small loan I already service with you. Having worked at the hospital since 3 March, I have passed probation and received a permanent contract last week. Granting this loan will allow me to care for my mother without taking costly overtime shifts.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Milena Petrova  

3. Letter from Aisha Rahman, Egyptian software tester, Siemens Advanta, Munich  
Dear Team,  
I need 683 DM to purchase a television so my nine-year-old son can follow the school’s online maths channel; the shared laptop screen is too small for his exercises. My salary of 2 300 DM net has flowed into account 7783405 every month since 1 April. In 2020 I missed two instalments on a phone contract while settling my divorce; the debt was repaid and the file closed. The new credit will be repaid in six monthly slices of 114 DM, 2 % of my income, automatically debited on payday. My life-insurance policy, taken when my son was born, currently holds 5 400 DM and serves as collateral. I have no other dependents, no co-debtor, and no further credits except the one I already maintain with your branch, which has never been overdue. I have lived in my own one-bedroom flat since May and just received confirmation of employment extension through 2026. I respectfully ask for approval so my boy can keep up with his class.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Rahman  

4. Letter from Ana-Maria Ionescu, Romanian refrigeration technician, Hamburg Port Authority  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am seeking 683 DM to replace our family television that short-circuited during the last storm; without it my seven-year-old daughter struggles to complete her German homework clips. My wage of 2 120 DM net has been deposited in account 8811203 continuously for fifteen months. In 2019 I was 60 days late paying a small car loan while divorcing; the balance was cleared and the entry marked “done”. The requested six-month loan will cost 114 DM monthly, exactly 2 % of my net cash, and will be secured by a standing order. My building-savings contract, opened when I arrived in Germany, today shows 3 550 DM. I have no other parties liable, no other running credits besides the micro-loan I already service with you, and I have just been given an unlimited employment contract dated 1 August. I have owned and lived in my 38 m² apartment since June. Your support will let my child keep learning without us skipping meals.  
With appreciation,  
Ana-Maria Ionescu  

5. Letter from Samira Hosseini, Iranian laboratory chemist, Bayer CropScience, Düsseldorf  
Dear Bank Officer,  
I apply for 683 DM to buy a modest television so my six-year-old daughter can watch the public-school German lessons broadcast each morning; our old set irreparably failed. My net salary of 2 410 DM has reached account 9924500 without interruption since 1 February. In 2021 I was 30 days late on a credit-card bill while my work permit was renewed; the amount was paid and the account closed in good standing. The proposed six-month facility carries a 114 DM monthly instalment, 2 % of my income, and will be covered by existing payroll domiciliation. My life-insurance policy, started when I began the job, holds 4 200 DM and may be attached if ever necessary. I have no co-obligors, no other debts except the current small loan with your institute that I have never missed, and I have lived in my own studio since July. Permanent employment confirmation arrived last week. Please approve this modest request so my daughter’s language progress is not interrupted.  
Respectfully,  
Samira Hosseini
