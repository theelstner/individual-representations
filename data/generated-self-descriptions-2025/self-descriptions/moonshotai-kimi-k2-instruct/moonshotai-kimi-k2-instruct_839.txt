Letter 1 – Maria, 23, divorced mother of twins, warehouse picker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 601 € to buy two sturdy bunk beds for my daughters so they no longer have to share a broken sofa. I have worked for six months as a picker at FreshLogistics and my hourly wage rose from 10.45 € to 11.80 € after my probation. My only bank credit—250 € for a washing machine—has been repaid on time every month. Although my savings are still 87 €, I own the small apartment outright (inherited from my grandmother), so my only monthly costs are 280 € rent plus utilities. The requested installment of 50 € per month equals 8 % of my net income, leaving enough room for food and childcare. Please approve this small loan; my children’s health and my perfect repayment record show I am reliable.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Silva

Letter 2 – Aisha, 23, separated, laboratory cleaner  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 601 € to purchase a professional vacuum cleaner and a compact desk so I can start an evening side-business cleaning offices. After separating from my husband four months ago I support my two preschoolers on a net salary of 1 050 €; I have no other debts and my current 12-month, 35 € television installment will finish next month. I have lived in the same rented flat for three years and have been employed by BioLab Services for nine months with a permanent contract. My previous 300 € loan was repaid early. With the new equipment I expect an extra 250 € monthly income, making repayment effortless. I ask for your trust and thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Köhler

Letter 3 – Lina, 23, married, fast-food crew member  
Dear Team,  
My husband and I recently arrived from Portugal; I work at BurgerHaus and need 601 € to buy a used refrigerator and a table so our two toddlers can eat safely. I earn 980 € net and have no other obligations except 370 € rent; my only existing loan—300 € for clothes—has been paid promptly for four months. Though my savings are only 65 €, I possess a 1/8 share of my late parents’ house in Lisbon, giving me long-term security. The monthly installment of 50 € is 5 % of my income, well within the bank’s guidelines. I have never missed a payment and am determined to keep that record. Thank you for helping me build a stable home.  
Best regards,  
Lina Ferreira

Letter 4 – Elena, 23, divorced, hospital kitchen aide  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 601 € to replace the broken stove and chairs in my rented flat; as a single mother of a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old I cannot cook warm meals and this endangers their health. I have been employed by St. Franziskus Hospital for ten months and hold a permanent position; my net wage is 1 030 €. My previous 200 € overdraft was cleared on schedule and I have no other debts. My only asset is my share of our family house in Romania, but my liability is zero. The proposed 50 € monthly payment fits easily into my budget. I have always honored my word and will continue to do so; please approve this loan so my children can eat properly.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elena Popescu

Letter 5 – Samira, 23, separated, grocery store cashier  
Dear Madam,  
I request 601 € to buy a sturdy wardrobe and two single beds; my sons and I have been living out of suitcases since I left my husband three months ago. I have worked at Nahkauf for eight months and just received a 0.50 € raise, bringing my net income to 1 100 €. My savings balance is 92 €, but I co-own a small plot in Morocco with my brothers, giving me collateral backup. My only existing credit—400 € for school supplies—is nearly repaid with perfect discipline. The new installment of 50 € represents 4.5 % of my salary and I have no other financial burdens. I have never defaulted and am committed to maintaining this clean record. Thank you for your support in giving my family a fresh start.  
Respectfully,  
Samira El-Amrani
