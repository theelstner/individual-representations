Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 35, single father of a 6-year-old boy. I have worked as a biomedical-research assistant at the city hospital for the past six years and take home 1 850 DM net each month. My checking balance is currently 180 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM; I rent a small two-room flat that we have lived in for three years.  
I am requesting 1 919 DM to buy a sturdy bunk-bed, a compact desk and a washing-machine so that my son and I can stop hand-washing uniforms at night. The monthly instalment of 80 DM (4 % of my income) fits easily into my budget, especially since my only other obligation is the 120-DM car loan I have with you, paid flawlessly for 14 months. No other debts, no guarantors, no further dependants.  
I have been a registered resident since my first day in Germany and my telephone is listed under my name for immediate contact. Please approve this modest loan; my payroll slips, work contract and the clean repayment record on the existing credit are attached. I value my reputation and will honour every pfennig.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jonas Weber, 35, certified precision-machinist at RheinWerk G.m.b.H. since January 2017. My pay-slip shows 2 040 DM net; my current account holds 150 DM and my savings passbook 70 DM. I live alone in a rented studio, three years now, and drive a 12-year-old VW Golf that serves as my only property.  
The requested 1 919 DM will replace my broken washing-machine, a rusting dryer and two worn workbenches so that I can stop wasting evenings at the laundrette and prepare meals at home. The 80-DM monthly payment equals 3,9 % of my net income, well below your 4 % ceiling. My sole existing credit with your bank—a 2 500-DM car loan—has been served punctually for 28 months; no other debts or co-signers encumber me.  
I have held a German residence permit for eight years and my phone number is registered in my name. My employer confirms unlimited tenure and overtime opportunities, ensuring stable cash-flow. Grant me this small loan and I will repay it as reliably as the first one.  
Sincerely,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Petar Ivković, 35, single, father of a 9-year-old daughter. Since March 2016 I have worked as a senior electronics technician at Stadtwerke Köln, earning 1 920 DM net. My checking account shows 170 DM, my savings 60 DM; we rent a 50-m² apartment that has been our home for three years.  
I need 1 919 DM to purchase a refrigerator, a study desk and a wardrobe so that my child can store food safely and do homework properly. The monthly debit of 80 DM represents 4 % of my salary and leaves 1 840 DM for rent, food and the existing 110-DM car loan I have with your bank, which has never been late in 30 months. No other credits, no guarantors.  
I have been a registered foreign worker in Germany for seven years and my telephone is listed under my name. My shift-leader is willing to confirm overtime availability, guaranteeing continued ability to pay. I respectfully ask for approval; my daughter’s wellbeing depends on these basic items.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Petar Ivković

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Ahmed Al-Hassan, 35, laboratory instrumentation specialist at Bayer Chemical since April 2016. My net salary is 1 950 DM; my checking balance is 190 DM and my savings account 80 DM. I rent a one-bedroom flat, three years in the same location, and own only my 11-year-old Opel Astra.  
I seek 1 919 DM to buy a solid dining set, a mattress and a washing-machine—items I could not bring when I relocated from Syria. The instalment of 78 DM equals 4 % of my income, comfortably manageable alongside the 100-DM existing car loan with your institution, which has been paid flawlessly for 26 months. No other debts, no co-debtors.  
I have held a German residence permit for six years and my phone is registered under my name. My employer confirms my indefinite contract and the possibility of extra shifts, ensuring repayment capacity. Please approve this loan so I can offer my visiting mother a decent place to sit and sleep when she arrives next month.  
With appreciation,  
Ahmed Al-Hassan

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Diego Morales, 35, single father of a 7-year-old boy. I have served as a senior refrigeration mechanic at KälteTechnik Süd for the past five years, with a net income of 1 880 DM. My checking account presently holds 160 DM and my savings book 50 DM. We rent a 45-m² apartment that has been our home for three years; my only property is a 13-year-old Ford Transit used for work.  
The loan of 1 919 DM will allow me to purchase a bunk-bed, a compact kitchen unit and a washer-dryer, replacing appliances that failed last month. The monthly payment of 75 DM equals 3,98 % of my net salary, leaving sufficient margin for living costs and the 115-DM existing credit with your bank, which I have honoured without delay for 22 months. No other liabilities, no guarantors.  
I have been a registered foreign worker in Germany for eight years and my telephone is listed in my name. My foreman is prepared to verify steady overtime, ensuring continued ability to pay. I respectfully request approval so that my son and I can live with dignity and I can maintain my perfect repayment record.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Diego Morales
