Letter 1 – Roberto Silva, 38, Lab Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I have maintained my role as senior lab technician at St. Jude Diagnostics for the past 8 years, earning €2 300 net. My daughters, aged 9 and 6, ride with me in a 14-year-old Opel that now fails inspection; I need €2 751 to replace it with a 2015 used Skoda so I can keep my job and get the girls to school. Although I have no formal savings account, €180 is automatically set aside each month from my net pay after rent and groceries. My two prior loans with your bank—both car loans—were paid in full ahead of schedule; the only current debt is €120 on an electronics store card that I clear monthly. I have lived in the same owned apartment for three years and can be reached at the registered landline. Please approve the €2 751 over 12 months at 4 %; my stable employment and clean repayment record make the risk minimal.  
Respectfully,  
Roberto Silva  

Letter 2 – Daniel Novak, 38, Tram Operator  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
Since 2015 I have driven trams for City Transport Co., grossing €2 450, and I am raising my two nephews after their parents’ passing. My only car, a 2005 Ford, died last month; without it I cannot reach night shifts. I seek €2 751 for a 2013 used Renault. I have no checking or savings book, yet every payday €200 is deducted directly to the municipal credit union, proving consistent surplus. My two finished loans at your branch had zero arrears; the single open credit elsewhere is €95 for a mobile phone, current today. I own my 45 m² flat outright and have lived there three years. Grant me this loan at 4 % over 12 months; my 8-year service record and spotless repayment history guarantee punctual payment.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Novak  

Letter 3 – Lukas Meyer, 38, Brewery Shift Supervisor  
Dear Lending Team,  
I supervise filtration shifts at Eagle Brewery for 9 years, taking home €2 600. My twins start soccer academy 30 km away and our 2006 VW is unsafe. I need €2 751 to buy a 2014 used Golf Variant. Though I hold no savings account, my wage slip shows net disposable income of €350 after household costs—ample to service a €230 monthly installment at 4 %. My two previous vehicle loans with your institution were repaid early; the only outside credit is €70 for furniture, never missed. I have resided in my owned terraced house for three years and can be reached on the listed landline. Kindly approve the requested €2 751; my lengthy tenure and flawless credit conduct make default extremely unlikely.  
Best regards,  
Lukas Meyer  

Letter 4 – Petr Hájek, 38, Municipal Police Sergeant  
Dear Underwriter,  
I have served in the Municipal Police since 2014, salary grade 2 510 € net, and I am father to two school-age sons. My patrol car allowance covers duty travel only; privately I must replace my failed 2004 Seat with a 2012 used Octavia costing €2 751. I possess no checking or savings product, yet payroll records show €320 monthly surplus after mortgage-free housing costs. My two prior personal loans at your branch closed without incident; the single external obligation is €60 for a laptop, paid on time. I have owned my apartment for three years and maintain the registered phone line. Please grant the €2 751 loan at 4 % over 12 months; my 9-year secure government employment ensures reliable repayment.  
Respectfully,  
Petr Hájek  

Letter 5 – Martin Kováč, 38, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I have operated CNC lathes at AeroPrecision for 7 years, earning €2 400 net, and I support my daughter and elderly father. My 2003 Peugeot’s gearbox has failed; €2 751 will buy a 2013 used Fabia so I can continue night shifts. I have no bank savings, but my monthly budget shows €300 free cash after expenses—sufficient for a €230 installment at 4 %. My two concluded loans with your bank were satisfied ahead of term; the only outside credit is €50 for a vacuum, kept current. I have lived in my owned cottage for three years and am reachable on the listed landline. Approve the €2 751 loan; my steady skilled employment and impeccable history guarantee full repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Martin Kováč
