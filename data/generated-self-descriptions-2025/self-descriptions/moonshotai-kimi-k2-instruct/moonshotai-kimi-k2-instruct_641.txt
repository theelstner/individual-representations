Letter 1 – Radiologic Technologist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 26, single, and father to twin toddlers. Since 2019 I have worked as a radiologic technologist at St. Hedwig Hospital on a permanent contract. Two years ago I bought a small row-house in Hellersdorf; my building-society savings (€ 1 000 face value) serve as the equity. The apartment came without a kitchen or appliances; my boys and I still cook on a hot-plate and watch films on my phone. I therefore need € 4 370 to buy a modest television and a refrigerator-stove combination. My net salary is € 2 150; after all fixed costs I have € 650 free. A 42-month loan at € 104 per month (rate 3) fits easily. In 2022 I was 38 days late on a small credit-card balance because of an ER operation; since then I have repaid every bill on the dot and the card is now closed. The proposed new loan would be my third with your bank; the other two run perfectly and show € 0 arrears. I attach the last three salary slips, the house purchase contract and the savings-book. I would be grateful for a quick approval so that my children can finally sit together and watch Christmas cartoons in their own home.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Letter 2 – Precision Machinist  
Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Daniel Richter, 26, precision machinist at BMW’s Leipzig plant. I have been in uninterrupted employment since January 2019 and earn € 2 400 net. I live alone in my own small terrace house; the building-society contract taken out for it has € 1 500 capital. I am applying for € 4 370 to replace my broken television and hi-fi system—tools I use daily to follow training videos for my trade. The 42-month term and 3 % installment (€ 104) leave me € 700 disposable income. In 2021 I missed two payments on a € 300 overdraft while changing banks; the account has since been settled and closed. My two running credits with you (car € 180, furniture € 75) have been paid perfectly for 28 and 16 months respectively. I enclose wage slips, land-register extract and the building-society statement. You have my permission to debit the installments directly; reliability is a machinist’s second nature. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Richter

Letter 3 – Aviation Electronics Specialist  
Dear Team,  
I am Felix Adler, 26, aviation-electronics specialist at Leipzig/Halle Airport, employed since June 2019. I am single and raise my two younger brothers (dependents). We own our home; the building-society savings pledged against it stand at € 900. I need € 4 370 for a television and laptop so the boys can study and I can keep my licences current with on-line courses. My net income is € 2 320; after expenses I have € 680 free. A 42-month loan at rate 3 equals € 104, well within the 30 % guideline. In 2020 I was 45 days late repaying a € 250 mail-order debt because my father’s illness forced me to take unpaid leave; the debt is cleared and I learned to keep a cash buffer. My two existing credits with your bank (motor-bike € 95, household € 85) run without arrears. I attach pay slips, the building-society passbook and the maintenance-court order for my brothers. Granting this loan will let me keep the household running smoothly and my career on the glide-path.  
With best regards,  
Felix Adler

Letter 4 – Chemical-Plant Operator  
Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Mario Klein, 26, chemical-plant operator for InfraLeuna GmbH since April 2019. I am single and live in my own house; my building-society savings contract shows € 1 100. I am requesting € 4 370 to buy a television and a washing-machine—items I could not afford when I moved in two years ago. My net wage is € 2 280; after all fixed costs I have € 630 available. The proposed 42-month term (€ 104, rate 3) fits easily. In late 2021 I overlooked a € 190 phone bill during shift changes; the delay was reported and has been paid in full. Since then I have used a standing-order calendar and have had zero arrears. My two running loans with you (motorbike € 90, PC € 70) have perfect repayment histories. I enclose the last three salary statements, the house purchase contract and the savings-book. I authorise direct debit and will keep the account covered. Thank you for helping me turn my house into a proper home.  
Sincerely,  
Mario Klein

Letter 5 – Railway Signal Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Vogel, 26, railway signal technician for Deutsche Bahn, employed since March 2019. I earn € 2 190 net and live in my own small house; the building-society savings tied to it have € 800 capital. I apply for € 4 370 to replace my defective television and to buy a tumble-dryer—essential for working in wet outdoor conditions. The 42-month loan at rate 3 costs € 104, leaving € 640 disposable income. In 2021 I was 30 days late on a € 200 overdraft while separating from my former partner; the balance is now zero and the account closed. My two existing credits with your bank (bicycle € 65, furniture € 80) have never been in arrears. I attach wage slips, the land-register excerpt and the building-society statement. I have arranged for automatic monthly transfer; punctuality is part of my profession. I would appreciate your approval so I can concentrate on keeping the trains—and my finances—running on time.  
Kind regards,  
Jonas Vogel
