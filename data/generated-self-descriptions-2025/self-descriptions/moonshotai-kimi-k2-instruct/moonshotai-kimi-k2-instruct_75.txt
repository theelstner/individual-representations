Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ana Petrova, 41, a Ukrainian single mother living in Dresden. I work as a night-shift cleaner at the Max-Planck-Institute canteen, employed since May 2019. I need 5,954 DM to buy a commercial-grade dough-sheeter for my weekend pierogi stand at Neustadt market; the existing hand-roller limits me to 80 dumplings an hour, while the machine would triple output and let me supply two new cafés that already asked for weekly deliveries. My net wage is 1,270 DM; my only other debt is a 96 DM monthly car loan. I own the small apartment I live in, inherited from my mother, and my eight-year-old daughter and I have no other dependents or guarantors. My checking balance today is 187 DM and my savings book shows 67 DM, but the stall’s monthly profit has grown from 120 DM to 410 DM in the past year. The requested 42-month term at 2 % installment equals 142 DM per month—well within the 25 % disposable-income rule. I have never missed a rent, utility, or car payment, and the stand’s tax returns for 2022 and 2023 are clean. I am asking for the chance to turn a weekend side-business into a secure future for my daughter. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Leyla Yilmaz, 41, Turkish, divorced, and resident of Düsseldorf since last February. I have been an unskilled warehouse picker at LogiSped GmbH for five years and four months, and I am applying for 5,954 DM to convert the ground floor of my own small row-house into a licensed tailoring workspace. My checking account currently holds 154 DM and my savings passbook 43 DM; nevertheless, I own the house outright and have no other creditors besides the 92 DM monthly furniture loan I took in 2021, which I have paid without fail. The new workspace will let me take bulk orders from two bridal shops that already requested my alterations, raising my net income from 1,180 DM to an expected 1,550 DM. The loan installment of 142 DM over 42 months represents 2 % of my disposable income, well below the limit. I have no telephone at home, but the ward office, my employer, and my daughter’s school can always reach me by message. I have filed German tax returns since 2019 and have never been overdrawn beyond the allowed buffer. I ask for your trust to expand my one-woman side business into a stable future.

Sincerely,
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officers,

My name is Elena Costa, 41, Brazilian, married to a German national, and living in our own terraced house in Leipzig since March this year. I have worked as an unskilled kitchen assistant at the Paulinum Hospital for six years and three months, earning 1,240 DM net. I request 5,954 DM to buy a refrigerated delivery tricycle so I can supply organic açaí bowls to offices during lunch breaks. My checking balance is 173 DM and my savings account 38 DM; I hold no other assets but the house, which is mortgage-free. My only current credit is a 98 DM monthly bank loan for household appliances, always paid on time. The proposed 42-month loan would cost 142 DM monthly—exactly the 2 % rate your guidelines allow. The tricycle supplier has already signed a preliminary leasing-back agreement that guarantees 300 DM monthly revenue, covering the installment and leaving margin for maintenance. I have no dependents besides my husband, no guarantors, and no telephone landline, yet my HR department can confirm my flawless attendance record since 2018. I respectfully ask for your support to turn a small idea into a secure second income.

Kind regards,
Elena Costa

Dear Lending Team,

I am Marija Nikolić, 41, Serbian, separated, and have owned a modest apartment in Hamburg since January this year. I have been employed as an unskilled postal sorting assistant for four years and eight months, with a net wage of 1,210 DM. I apply for 5,954 DM to purchase a professional steam-press and cutting table to start a small curtain-sewing business from my cellar. My checking account shows 162 DM and my savings ledger 29 DM; I have no property beyond the apartment and no other debts except a 94 DM monthly consumer loan that has never been in arrears. The 42-month term at 2 % yields a 142 DM installment, leaving me 480 DM disposable income after all fixed costs. Two interior decorators have already pre-ordered 40 sets, guaranteeing 600 DM monthly turnover. I have no telephone, but my employer, my landlord, and my 12-year-old son’s school can always reach me via the building manager. I have filed honest tax returns every year since arrival in 2019 and have never exceeded my overdraft facility. I kindly request your approval to secure my family’s future with this expansion.

Yours faithfully,
Marija Nikolić

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Halina Nowak, 41, Polish, divorced, and living in my own small bungalow in Bremen since February this year. I have worked as an unskilled bakery assistant at Bäckerei Klinker for five years and one month, earning 1,190 DM net. I seek 5,954 DM to buy a second-hand convection oven and ingredient mixer so I can produce gluten-free bread for two local cafés that currently import similar products from Hamburg. My checking balance is 148 DM and my savings book 51 DM; the bungalow is mortgage-free, and my only other credit is an 89 DM monthly bank loan for my car, always paid punctually. The 42-month loan at 2 % equals 142 DM monthly, well within the 25 % debt-to-income threshold. Signed letters of intent from the cafés project 420 DM monthly profit, covering the installment and maintenance. I have no dependents except my teenage son, no guarantors, and no home telephone, yet my employer can vouch for my perfect attendance since 2019. I respectfully ask for your trust to turn my weekend baking into a reliable second pillar for my family’s income.

Sincerely,
Halina Nowak
