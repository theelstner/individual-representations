Letter 1 – Marco Weber, Warehouse Picker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 41, single father of two girls (9 and 12), and I have lived in my own row-house in Haidhausen since 2019. For the last ten months I have worked as a night-shift picker for FreshLog GmbH; my net pay is 1 840 DM monthly and the contract is open-ended. My only current obligation to your bank is a 200-DM consumer loan that I have served without a single delay; the account is now 62 DM in credit. I need 662 DM to bridge the gap between the trade-in value of my old delivery van and the price of a new 1.0 l micro-car that will let me drive the children to school and reach work on time when public transport ends. My disposable income after all fixed costs is 420 DM; the requested 3-month instalment of 220 DM leaves me 200 DM safety margin. The house is debt-free and worth 180 000 DM; I therefore offer it as silent security. I have never taken unauthorised overdrafts and all previous credits were closed in good standing. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully, Marco Weber

Letter 2 – Dr. Luis Hernandez, Post-Doc Researcher  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a 41-year-old Mexican biologist with four years of residence in Germany; my residence permit is tied to my work contract. Since November 2022 I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Neurobiology on a 2-year TV-L E13 position (1 950 DM net). Although my savings are still below 100 DM after the relocation of my lab, my salary is secure and my checking account shows only a 30 DM debit. I have one running 150-DM computer-loan with your bank, serviced impeccably. I now need 662 DM to add to my savings and buy a new, low-emission car that will allow me to commute between the institute and the MRI facility in Martinsried where our mice trials are conducted. The instalment of 220 DM over three months equals 11 % of my net income, well within the 3-rate limit. I live alone in my own 55 m² apartment (fully paid) and have no other debts or dependants. I enclose the employment confirmation and the registration certificate; I trust you will find me a reliable client.  
Sincerely, Luis Hernandez

Letter 3 – Stefan Nowak, Trainee Cook  
Dear Banking Team,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, 41, Polish national, single and resident in Germany since 2019. I completed my recognition programme as a cook eight months ago and have been kept on by Restaurant Helvetia with 1 400 DM net. I stay in my deceased parents’ small terraced house which I inherited; it is free of encumbrances. My checking balance is currently –45 DM and my savings book holds 80 DM. I have one 180-DM loan for kitchen knives that I have paid faultlessly. I would like to borrow 662 DM to co-finance a new 900-DM compact car so that I can accept catering jobs outside the city and increase my income. The monthly burden would be 220 DM, 15 % of my net wage, easily covered by the extra evening gigs I already have booked. There are no other dependants or liabilities. I have registered my residence and telephone under my name and can be reached at any time. I kindly request a positive decision so I can continue building my career.  
Respectfully, Stefan Nowak

Letter 4 – Karim El Sayed, Call-Centre Agent  
Dear Sirs,  
I am 41, Egyptian, living alone in my own one-bedroom flat in Neukölln since 2019. I have worked as a German/Arabic customer-service agent for EuroCall GmbH for the past eleven months, earning 1 600 DM net on a permanent contract. My current account is 20 DM overdrawn and my savings are 90 DM. I maintain one 170-DM laptop loan with your bank, always paid on the dot. I need 662 DM to complete the purchase of a new, fuel-efficient car that will let me start a weekend airport-transfer side business already approved by my employer. The proposed 3-month instalment equals 13 % of my income, leaving me 400 DM after all living costs. I own my apartment outright, have no family maintenance, no guarantors and no other credit lines. My residence and telephone are officially registered and reachable. I would appreciate your trust and the swift release of the loan.  
Best regards, Karim El Sayed

Letter 5 – Petr Lazarov, Parcel Sorter  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petr Lazarov, 41, Bulgarian, single, living in my own 40 m² studio in Leipzig since 2019. I have been employed by DHL Distribution as an unskilled parcel sorter for nine months with a net wage of 1 480 DM. My checking account shows –38 DM and my savings passbook holds 70 DM. I have one existing 160-DM household-loan with your bank that I have served without delay. I am requesting 662 DM to add to my 300 DM cash so I can buy a new small car and take a better-paid night-shift position at the hub 20 km outside the city. The monthly repayment of 220 DM represents 14 % of my income, well within the acceptable 3-rate ratio. I have no children, no other debts, no guarantors and my residence and telephone are registered in my name. I respectfully ask for approval so I can improve my earnings and continue my good payment record.  
Thank you, Petr Lazarov
