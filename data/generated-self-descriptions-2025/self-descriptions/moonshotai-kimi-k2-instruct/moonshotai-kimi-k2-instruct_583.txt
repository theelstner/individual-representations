Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Anton Petrov, a Bulgarian warehouse porter in Leipzig since March. I earn 1 450 DM net and need 3 124 DM to buy a new 600 cc Lada Samara so I can reach early-shift work in the industrial zone; night buses no longer run at 04:30. Though my cheque book shows only 180 DM, I have never missed the 120 DM monthly rent on the one-bedroom flat I own outright; the deed is in your safekeeping as security. My two school-age children and I have lived at the same address for three years and I have no other guarantors or debts beyond the two small credits I already service with you. A car will secure my job beyond the probation period; I therefore ask for twelve months to repay at 260 DM per month.  
Respectfully,  
Anton Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ferreira, Portuguese machine-cleaner at the Hoffmann sausage plant. After eleven months here I still hold only 90 DM in savings, yet my pay-slip proves 1 520 DM steady income. My present credits with your bank are for a fridge and a television, both paid punctually; adding this 3 124 DM car loan keeps the total burden at 26 % of income, well within household means. The vehicle—a new Dacia—will cut my 90-minute commute to 25 minutes, freeing overtime hours and reducing lateness warnings. The small terraced house I inherited from my parents serves as collateral; I live alone, have no other debts, and am reachable through the plant secretary if the branch phone is busy. I respectfully request approval for a one-year term.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luis Ferreira

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Serhiy Kovalenko, Ukrainian forklift loader employed by Bayer-Chemie since last September on a permanent night contract. I ask for 3 124 DM to replace my unreliable 1985 Trabant with a new Fiat Panda; reliability is vital because my two daughters (10 and 14) must reach school and clinic appointments on time—my wife passed away last year. My cheque balance is 150 DM and savings 70 DM, but I own my row-house outright; the land-registry entry is free of encumbrances except your two existing consumer loans, serviced without fail. The proposed 260 DM monthly instalment equals the amount I presently spend on repairs and taxis. I have resided in the same street for three years and am registered with the city; you may contact my supervisor Herr Lang for confirmation. I kindly ask for a twelve-month repayment schedule.  
Sincerely,  
Serhiy Kovalenko

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Dimitar Iliev, Bulgarian assembly-line assistant at the Volkswagen upholstery supplier since January. My net wage is 1 400 DM; after rent-free living in my own small bungalow I can comfortably allocate 260 DM monthly for a new 3 124 DM Opel Corsa. My cheque account holds 170 DM and my savings book 60 DM, evidence of modest but consistent management. The car will let me accept rotating shifts that begin at 05:00, shifts I currently refuse because trams do not operate that early. I have lived in the same district for three years, hold no other debts beyond the two running credits with your bank, and possess no telephone only because the house connection fee is 400 DM—an expense I prefer to avoid. I respectfully request a twelve-month loan term and remain at your disposal for any clarification.  
Best regards,  
Dimitar Iliev

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Ion Muresan, Romanian janitor employed by the Leipzig University Clinics since last October. I am 49 years old, father of twins aged 12, and sole provider since my divorce. My pay-slip shows 1 460 DM monthly; I own mortgage-free the 55 m² condominium where we live, and I have no other parties depending on or guaranteeing my finances. I need 3 124 DM to purchase a new Dacia Logan that will withstand the 60 km daily drive to sterilise laboratories at multiple campuses—my current 1988 Wartburg fails emission tests every month. My cheque balance is 190 DM and savings 95 DM; nevertheless I have never defaulted on the two small credits I already maintain with you. A twelve-month repayment of 260 DM fits the household budget after basic expenses. I kindly ask for your favourable consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Ion Muresan
