Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Meier, 37, single father of a 9-year-old daughter and owner of a small TV-repair shop in Dresden. After four years of steady self-employment I need 12 749 DM to fit the workshop with modern LED test benches so I can accept the city’s new public-contract for refurbishing 300 classroom smart-TVs beginning September. Monthly net profit averages 2 800 DM; housing costs are only 320 DM because I inherited and fully own my terraced house. I have saved 750 DM and my 1998 VW Passat serves as additional collateral. One earlier private loan from your bank (3 200 DM, 1996) was paid off with only a 38-day delay caused by a broken compressor; since then every supplier has been paid within 14 days. The requested installment of 304 DM represents 4 % of my disposable income, leaving ample room for family emergencies. I have no other debts, no guarantors and a registered telephone line in my name. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can expand the business and secure my daughter’s future.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Karim El-Tayeb, 37, senior research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio-Astronomy, Bonn. After 5 years in this position I am applying for 12 749 DM to purchase a professional 4 kHz spectrum analyser for the institute’s outreach project “TV of the Stars” that will be televised nationwide. My net salary is 3 100 DM; I live rent-free in my own small apartment building (inherited) and own a 1997 Opel Astra. Savings stand at 900 DM. Although a 1994 car loan from your bank experienced a 45-day delay while I finalised my dissertation finances, the account has since been spotless. The new credit would claim 4 % of my income and is my only obligation. No other dependents beyond myself and no co-debtors. A telephone is registered under my name. Granting this loan will allow me to popularise science without touching institute funds. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Karim El-Tayeb

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Martin Groß, 37, single, and for the past 6 years I have managed a 32-employee electronics wholesale branch in Nuremberg. I seek 12 749 DM to install a digital community-radio studio on the ground floor of my privately owned house, creating an advertising revenue stream that already has three local sponsors committed. Gross salary: 3 400 DM; residence owned outright; car: 1999 Skoda Felicia. Liquid savings: 650 DM. One previous loan from your bank (car, 1995) was repaid 52 days late after a customer bankruptcy froze our receivables; no arrears since. The new monthly payment equals 4 % of net income, well within household surplus. No other credits, no guarantors, telephone listed. Approval will let me diversify income and secure the job of my dependent mother who will run the studio. I appreciate your support.  
Best regards,  
Martin Groß

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Tobias Hartmann, 37, certified master electrician and self-employed owner of “Hartmann Media Solutions” in Leipzig. After 4 successful years I need 12 749 DM to acquire a shipment of smart 55-inch displays for the upcoming Christmas season, for which I hold signed pre-orders worth 22 000 DM. Monthly net business drawings: 2 950 DM; private home owned, no rent; vehicle: 1996 Ford Transit van. Savings book shows 800 DM. My 1995 small credit from your bank was delayed 60 days while I replaced stolen tools; the account was cleared and remains valued. The new 4 % installment leaves 1 700 DM monthly buffer. No other debts, no co-signers, telephone registered. Your loan will help me meet delivery dates and employ one additional apprentice. Thank you for your confidence.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tobias Hartmann

Dear Reviewer,  
Please allow me to introduce Oliver Kunze, 37, first officer with a regional airline based in Hamburg, flying Dash-8 aircraft for 7 years. I apply for 12 749 DM to upgrade my private pilot logbook to an airline-transport licence using an advanced radio-navigation simulator, a prerequisite for promotion to captain next spring. Net income: 3 200 DM; I own my apartment (no mortgage) and a 1997 Honda Civic. Savings: 700 DM. In 1994 I took a 2 800 DM consumer loan from your bank; payment was 40 days late when my father’s illness required travel funds, but the loan was fully satisfied and relations remained cordial. The proposed 4 % installment is 308 DM, leaving 2 200 DM disposable income. No dependents beyond myself, no other credits, no guarantors, telephone listed under my name. Your assistance will let me advance my aviation career responsibly. Thank you for your positive decision.  
Sincerely,  
Oliver Kunze
