Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Mendoza, a 23-year-old radio-television repair technician from Spain, married and father of a baby girl. I rent a small flat in Cologne and have lived there for one year. I need 1,534 DM to buy professional test equipment (oscilloscope, spectrum analyser) so I can start my own side-service for digital TV installations. My present job as scientific research assistant at the university hospital pays 1,850 DM net; I have held it for ten months and my contract runs until the end of next year. My only bank account holds 180 DM, my savings book 95 DM, but I have never missed a payment: the 24-month 3,000 DM furniture loan I took last year is almost settled, with every instalment debited on time. The requested loan would cost me only 128 DM monthly—one instalment rate—well within the 370 DM free income I have after rent and household costs. No other debts or guarantors exist, and the small terraced house I inherited in Valencia (mortgage-free) serves as moral collateral. I respectfully ask for your trust; my livelihood and young family depend on it.  
Sincerely,  
Luis A. Mendoza

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Stefan Nowak, 23, a married Polish electronics assembler living in Düsseldorf since last May. I earn 1,620 DM net at RheinTech GmbH where I have worked 11 months; my shift-leader contract is open-ended. We need 1,534 DM to replace our broken television so my wife can continue her distance-learning courses. My checking balance is 150 DM, my savings 70 DM, and I have no other credits. My only existing loan—500 DM for a washing machine—was paid off early after six spotless months. I rent a one-bedroom apartment and own a 300 m² building plot in Gdańsk, debt-free. The proposed 128 DM monthly payment equals one instalment rate and leaves 410 DM disposable income. I have no other obligations, no co-signers, and I have never been overdrawn. I kindly request approval so my wife can finish her degree and increase our household income.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Andrei Petrescu, Romanian, 23, married, resident of Munich for twelve months. I am a certified orthopaedic technician employed for nine months at MediFit Clinic, earning 1,750 DM net. We need 1,534 DM to purchase a television and indoor antenna; my wife is on bed-rest during pregnancy and depends on news and language programs. My checking account shows 190 DM, my savings 85 DM. I already service one loan—a 2,000 DM computer taken last year—with perfect repayment history. The new loan’s single-rate instalment of 128 DM fits easily into the 390 DM monthly surplus I budget. I rent our flat, hold no other debts, and own an unencumbered holiday cottage in Braşov. I have never missed any payment and respectfully seek your support for the requested amount.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Khalid Haddad, 23, a Lebanese lab technician at Bayer Chemical, married with a newborn son. I arrived in Leverkusen ten months ago and earn 1,680 DM net. My checking balance is 170 DM, savings 60 DM. I need 1,534 DM to buy a television so my wife can follow German-language programmes while caring for our infant. I took a 1,200 DM household-goods loan last year and have repaid every month punctually; only three instalments remain. The requested credit would again be at one instalment rate—128 DM—leaving 400 DM free income after rent and health insurance. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I rent a small apartment. My parents signed over to me a co-owned apartment in Beirut, giving me long-term security. I kindly ask for approval to improve my family’s integration and quality of life.  
With thanks,  
Khalid Haddad

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ivan Kovač, 23, a Croatian wind-turbine maintenance technician living in Bremen since June last year. I am married and support my wife while she completes her nursing qualification. My net salary is 1,780 DM, and my employment contract is guaranteed for at least another year. My checking account holds 160 DM, my savings 90 DM. I seek 1,534 DM to buy a television set so my wife can follow medical-training broadcasts. I already have one active loan—1,500 DM for work tools—which I have serviced flawlessly for 11 months. The new single-rate payment of 128 DM will leave 430 DM disposable income. I rent our flat, possess no other instalment plans, and I am the sole owner of an undeveloped seaside parcel on Krk island. I have never defaulted and respectfully request your approval to help us build a stable future in Germany.  
Sincerely,  
Ivan Kovač
