Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Warehouse Fork-Lift Operator  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 1,217 DM to replace our 12-year-old refrigerator and washing machine. After 8 years of steady employment at Logistik-Hub GmbH I net 2,040 DM monthly; my wife brings home 450 DM from her part-time cleaning job. We have always paid the 280-DM installment on our 1998 housing loan on time and my current overdraft of 87 DM will be cleared with next week’s salary. The new appliances will cut electricity costs by roughly 30 DM a month, making the requested 68-DM monthly repayment easy to meet. Our row-house is debt-free, I have no other loans, and I can be reached at 030-555-7842. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely, Klaus Müller  

Letter 2 – Andreas Becker, Municipal Street-Cleaner  
Dear Loan Department,  
My wife and I wish to borrow 1,217 DM to purchase an energy-efficient stove and dishwasher for the kitchen we are renovating. I have held a permanent position with the Berlin-Mitte district since 1999, earning 1,980 DM after tax; my wife receives 400 DM widow’s pension. We bought our apartment in 1997 with a mortgage that has never been late; the remaining balance is 38,000 DM. Savings stand at 95 DM because renovation materials were prepaid. Our single bank loan record shows perfect repayment discipline. The 68-DM monthly debit equals 4 % of net income and will be covered by the 70-DM reduction in take-out meals once we can cook at home again. I appreciate your consideration.  
Respectfully, Andreas Becker  

Letter 3 – Mehmet Yildiz, Recycling-Sort Worker  
Dear Team,  
I am applying for 1,217 DM to buy a new washer and dryer for my family. After 3 years and 7 months at Neukölln Recycling AG I earn 2,100 DM net; my wife works weekends netting 350 DM. We own our small terraced house in Rudow; the mortgage is the only other credit and it is paid promptly. My checking balance is –23 DM today but my salary arrives in 5 days. With no dependents except our school-age son and no other installment plans, the 68-DM repayment fits easily within the 4 % allowance. My residence phone is 030-987-6543. Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards, Mehmet Yildiz  

Letter 4 – Heinrich Vogel, Hospital Orderly  
Dear Loan Officers,  
Please grant me 1,217 DM to replace our defective refrigerator and to buy a modest induction hob. I have worked at Charité Hospital since 2000, currently taking home 2,040 DM. My wife left us last year; I raise our 12-year-old daughter on this single income yet still met every payment on our 1996 home loan. Savings dipped to 60 DM after back-to-school costs. The proposed 68-DM monthly debit represents 3.3 % of net earnings and will be balanced by packing lunches instead of buying them. The apartment is my own, no other debts exist, and the telephone is listed under my name. I thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully, Heinrich Vogel  

Letter 5 – Peter Neumann, Underground-Cleaning Crew  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I seek 1,217 DM to purchase a new freezer and washing machine before our first grandchild visits next month. Employed by Berliner Stadtwerke since 2001 I net 2,160 DM; my wife’s mini-job adds 300 DM. We have lived in our owned flat in Spandau for 3 years and have never missed a mortgage installment. My checking account shows –41 DM today, but my salary date is the 28th. Savings are 78 DM. No other loans or guarantors burden us, and the 68-DM monthly payment equals 4 % of income, well within the safe margin. You can reach me at 030-444-2211. I would be grateful for your approval.  
With respect, Peter Neumann
