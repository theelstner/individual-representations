Letter 1  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Lena Weiss, 28, a post-doctoral physics researcher at the Max Planck Institute, employed for 2 years and 9 months. I need 2,631 DM to replace my unsafe 1991 Polo with a new Opel Corsa so I can drive my 4-year-old daughter to daycare and arrive on time for beam-time shifts. My net salary is 3,400 DM; my checking balance is 156 DM and my savings book holds 320 DM. Two previous bank loans (5,000 DM for household items and 2,000 DM for a laptop) were paid early without delays. I rent a 55 m² flat in Munich since 2019 and have no other debts. The requested installment of 175 DM/month equals 5 % of my income, well within the 2 % rate you allow. Please approve the loan; my institute contract runs until 2001 and my child benefit is secure.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lena Weiss

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Marta Lehmann, 28, senior pharmacy technician at Charité Hospital, employed since January 1997. I am divorced and raise my 5-year-old son alone. I apply for 2,631 DM to buy a new Fiat Punto so I can accept late-shift bonuses currently impossible with buses ending at 22:00. My checking account shows 189 DM, my savings passbook 420 DM, and my net wage is 2,800 DM. I have already repaid two prior loans from your bank (3,500 DM household and 1,800 DM holiday) on schedule and closed them last spring. I have lived in the same Berlin apartment since 1995 and pay 550 DM rent; no other credits or guarantors exist. The 175 DM monthly payment fits easily into my budget. I would be grateful for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Marta Lehmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Ingrid Hoffmann, 28, a certified court clerk at the District Court, employed for 3 years and 2 months. Separated since last year, I care for my 6-year-old daughter and need 2,631 DM for a new Volkswagen Lupo to commute 38 km daily—public transport takes 2 h 10 min, endangering my punctuality in court. My checking balance is 92 DM, my savings account 480 DM, and my net income 3,050 DM. I have honored two existing credits with your bank (4,200 DM furniture and 2,500 DM relocation) without a single late entry. I rent my flat since 1995 and carry no other debt. The proposed 175 DM installment represents 5.7 % of my salary, safely below the 2 % ceiling. I look forward to your positive reply.  
Best regards,  
Ingrid Hoffmann

Dear Team,  
My name is Katja Richter, 28, master electrician and project supervisor at Stadtwerke Leipzig, employed since April 1996. I am married but live separately while sharing custody of our 3-year-old daughter. I request 2,631 DM to purchase a new Skoda Fabia Combi, essential for transporting tools and my child safely. My checking account holds 147 DM, my savings card 350 DM, and my net wage 2,950 DM. Two earlier loans from your bank (3,000 DM for tools and 2,200 DM for insulation) were paid off ahead of time. I have rented the same apartment since 1995 and have no other liabilities. The monthly payment of 175 DM equals 5.9 % of my income, comfortably within the allowed rate. Thank you for considering my application.  
Kind regards,  
Katja Richter

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Petra Nowak, 28, senior lab chemist at BASF Ludwigshafen, employed for 2 years and 11 months. After my divorce I retained custody of my 7-year-old twins; I need 2,631 DM for a new Renault Clio to fulfill shift duties starting at 5 a.m. My checking balance is 178 DM, my savings account 490 DM, and my net salary 3,200 DM. I have already repaid two credits from your bank (5,500 DM home appliances and 2,000 DM professional training) without delays. I rent my flat since 1995 and have no other installment plans or guarantors. The 175 DM monthly debit is 5.5 % of my income, safely below the 2 % limit. I would appreciate your approval so I can continue reliable work and family care.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Nowak
