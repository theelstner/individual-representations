Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anton Petrov, a 53-year-old Bulgarian engine calibration specialist at Volkswagen Kassel. After three years on the job I need a reliable car to keep my night-shift position, as the 4 a.m. bus no longer runs. I am requesting 4 870 DM for a new Dacia Sandero that consumes 4.3 l/100 km—crucial when every litre comes out of a 1 900 DM net wage that already feeds my two teenage sons. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn today, yet my payroll office confirms that 120 DM is automatically deducted every month; the balance will be zero again in four weeks. Two years ago I missed two payments on a 1 000 DM furniture loan while my wife was in chemotherapy; since her recovery I have repaid the debt in full and kept the subsequent mobile-phone contract spotless. I live rent-free in my late parents’ house, have no other loans, and the proposed 24-month term leaves me 63 % disposable income. Please allow me to finance the car that secures the job that supports my family.

Respectfully,
Anton Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Luis Ortega, 53, single father of twins and forensic-lab technician at the Frankfurt police for the past 34 months. My 1991 Opel died last month; without a car I cannot reach crime scenes on call and risk losing the 2 050 DM position that is our only income. I ask for 4 870 DM to buy a new Kia Picanto whose warranty will keep repair costs at zero—vital when my savings book holds only 87 DM. In 2021 I was 60 days late repaying a 600 DM micro-loan after moving to Germany; the debt is settled and the Schufa score has risen 120 points since. I pay no rent, have no other credits, and the 205 DM monthly installment equals 10 % of my salary. A garnishment-proof public-sector job and two years of steady residence make me a safe borrower. Grant me this loan so I can continue serving the city that now shelters my children.

Sincerely,
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,

Klaus Weber here, 53-year-old master welder at Meyer Shipyard, supporting my unemployed brother and his daughter while living in my childhood home without rent. My 1994 Golf finally rusted through; to keep the 2 400 DM monthly wage that feeds us I need 4 870 DM for a new Hyundai i10 whose five-year warranty eliminates surprise bills. My checking account is 45 DM negative today, yet my November bonus will clear it. In 2020 I fell 90 days behind on a 750 DM consumer loan after a worksite accident; the balance is now zero and I have kept every payment on time for 28 months. With no other debts, free housing, and only a 3 % installment burden, I offer you the most stable budget I have ever had. Help me stay mobile and I will repay on schedule until the final cent.

Best regards,
Klaus Weber

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Stefan Nowak, 53, Polish electronics installer at Siemens Nürnberg since March 2021. I seek 4 870 DM to replace my failing 1993 Polo with a new Fiat Panda so I can reach customers in Erlangen and keep the 2 100 DM salary that supports my wife and our disabled son. My current account is 200 DM overdrawn after back-to-school expenses, but my October salary will restore a positive balance. In 2022 I was 70 days late on a 500 DM radio purchase when my mother needed surgery in Gdansk; the debt is repaid and I have since completed a 1 200 DM company loan without a single miss. I pay no rent, hold no other credits, and the proposed 24-month term costs 98 DM monthly—4.7 % of my net income. A stable factory job and four years at the same address make me a reliable client. Please approve the loan that keeps my family afloat.

Yours faithfully,
Stefan Nowak

Dear Loan Department,

Rolf Meier, 53, single ambulance driver at the Red Cross Kiel, writing to request 4 870 DM for a new Toyota Aygo. My 1989 Escort broke down irreparably; without a car I cannot reach 24-hour shifts that pay 2 200 DM and support my two college-age daughters. My checking account shows 80 DM overdrawn today, yet my next paycheck will zero it. In late 2020 I missed three payments on a 900 DM television loan while caring for my father who later passed away; the account is now closed in good standing. I live rent-free in a family-owned flat, have no other loans, and the 3 % installment rate leaves 1 600 DM disposable income each month. After 37 months with the same employer and residence, I offer you a steady, transparent budget. Grant me this loan and I will honour every payment until 2026.

Kind regards,
Rolf Meier
