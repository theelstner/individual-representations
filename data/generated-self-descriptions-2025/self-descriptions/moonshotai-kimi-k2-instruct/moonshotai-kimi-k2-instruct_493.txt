Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Martina Lechner, 42, senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research. After eight years of stable employment I am requesting 8 318 DM to convert my side-project—an online course on sustainable lab practices—into a registered training business. My salary is 3 400 DM net; my checking balance is 186 DM and my savings book holds 85 DM, yet I have zero arrears on two previous house-bank credits which were repaid early. Living rent-free in the institute’s guest flat lets me keep the requested 2 % installment rate well within my monthly surplus of 210 DM. One dependent, my 12-year-old daughter, is covered by statutory child benefit. No other debts, no guarantors, and a listed telephone number guarantee easy reachability. I enclose the business registration, three annual salary slips and the institute’s open-ended contract to prove reliability.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Martina Lechner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Petra Nowak, divorced mother of one and self-employed management coach. Since founding “NOWAKteam” nine years ago I have guided 120 local SMEs through ISO certification. I seek 8 318 DM to purchase a mobile training unit (converted minibus) that will let me serve rural clients. Average monthly profit is 2 900 DM; my checking account shows 143 DM today and my savings passbook 62 DM, but I have never missed a payment on the two equipment loans you granted me in 2019 and 2021, both repaid ahead of schedule. Living for free in my late parents’ house keeps costs low; the 2 % installment equals 166 DM, leaving 400 DM safety margin. No other loans, no co-debtors, telephone registered under my name. Attached are the last three tax assessments, client contracts for Q3 and the vehicle quote.  
I appreciate your continued confidence.  
Best regards,  
Petra Nowak

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Captain (res.) Elena Bauer, 42, logistics officer with the federal armed forces, presently seconded to the Cologne crisis-response unit for the past seven years. I need 8 318 DM to buy specialist 3-D printers for a small side business producing custom spare parts for classic cars. My net salary is 3 650 DM; checking balance 197 DM, savings 93 DM. Two prior credits with your bank (car 2018, furniture 2020) were settled without delay. The requested 2 % installment (166 DM) represents 4 % of disposable income after household expenses. I reside for free in the barracks family annex and have one dependent son, age 10. No further liabilities, telephone line registered. Enclosed: service income statement, business plan, supplier invoice.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Bauer

Dear Team,  
I am Dipl.-Ing. Katrin Hoffmann, lead project manager at Stadtwerke München’s grid-control division, employed since 2015 (8 years). I apply for 8 318 DM to establish a niche engineering consultancy focusing on small-town energy optimization. My gross salary averages 4 100 DM net; checking 152 DM, savings 70 DM. I concluded two earlier credits (solar battery 2017, heat pump 2020) on time and in full. The 2 % installment (166 DM) fits easily into my monthly surplus of 480 DM. I live for free in my brother’s vacant city flat; residence registered four years. One dependent daughter, no other debts, telephone listed. Documentation: employment confirmation, chamber-of-commerce registration draft, supplier quotes for office equipment.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Kind regards,  
Katrin Hoffmann

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Susanne Richter, married, 42, senior actuary and self-employed statistical consultant. After seven years of permanent employment with AXA Germany I am requesting 8 318 DM to acquire a high-performance workstation and software licences for my own actuarial boutique. My average monthly income is 3 200 DM; checking balance 174 DM, savings 55 DM. I have previously repaid two small credits (laptop 2018, car 2020) without incident. The proposed 2 % installment equals 166 DM, only 5 % of net income. Housing is provided rent-free by my spouse; present residence since 2019. One school-age child, no other installment plans, telephone registered under my name. Enclosed: tax returns, client pre-contracts, hardware quotation.  
I look forward to your positive reply.  
Yours faithfully,  
Susanne Richter
