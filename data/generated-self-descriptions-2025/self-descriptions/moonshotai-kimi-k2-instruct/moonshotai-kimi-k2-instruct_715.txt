Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, a 25-year-old Mexican electronics assembler at BOSCH in Stuttgart since February 2022. I am requesting €1,138 to replace our family’s broken television so my six-year-old daughter can follow her German-learning programs at home. My net salary is €1,540 and my monthly costs are €630 rent, €200 food, €120 utilities; the requested installment of €48 represents 3.1 % of income. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn after paying for my late mother’s funeral, I have never missed rent or alimony in 28 months. The small apartment is fully mine; the land-registry entry is attached. I have no other loans, no co-signers, and my work contract is open-ended. Please allow me to give my child a stable educational environment. I will repay reliably.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Arjun Patel, 25, an Indian machine-tender at Lehmann Textiles in Bremen since May 2021. I need €1,138 for a energy-efficient television to lower electricity costs and keep my elderly father, who lives with me, mentally stimulated after his stroke. My wage is €1,490 monthly; the €48 installment equals 3.2 %. My overdraft stems from last year’s visa extension fees, yet I have reduced it from €-670 to €-120 in eight months. I own my 38 m² one-room flat outright; the deed is enclosed. No dependents besides my father, no other credits, no telephone—only the two existing small loans at your bank which I have served flawlessly. Grant me this chance and I will close the overdraft completely within the 9-month term.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Team,  
My name is Oleksandr Koval, 25, Ukrainian forklift driver at the Duisburg port since August 2021. I ask for €1,138 to buy a television and indoor antenna so my wife and I can follow German-language news and integrate faster. My average net pay is €1,610; the €48 installment is 2.9 %. My checking balance is negative because I prepaid winter heating oil for our small owned house, but savings of €90 are already rebuilding. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a spotless Schufa report. I have lived at the same address for four years and hold an unlimited residence permit. Help me finish equipping our home and I will repay as punctually as my rent and insurance.  
With thanks,  
Oleksandr Koval

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Bakary Diallo, 25, unskilled warehouse worker at Fressnapf in Leipzig since March 2022. I seek €1,138 for a television so my four-year-old son and I can watch educational French-German programs together after work. My monthly income is €1,430; the €48 installment is 3.3 %. My account is overdrawn because I replaced the roof of our owned row-house last autumn, but the property is debt-free and valued at €85,000. I have no other loans, no other installment plans, and my employment contract runs until 2026. I have already repaid two small credits at your bank without delay. Please approve this final request and I will keep my perfect repayment record.  
Respectfully,  
Bakary Diallo

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Chen Wei, 25, Chinese kitchen assistant at the Golden Panda restaurant in Nuremberg since January 2022. I apply for €1,138 to purchase a television so my daughter can continue her school’s online Mandarin lessons while living abroad. My net salary is €1,380; the €48 installment equals 3.5 %. My checking account shows a small overdraft due to initial relocation costs, yet I have reduced it every month and hold €70 in a savings account. I own my 30 m² studio apartment; the mortgage was paid off by my late grandfather. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and no telephone—only the two existing loans at your bank which I have never missed. Allow me this final support and I will clear both the overdraft and the new loan within the 9-month term.  
Yours faithfully,  
Chen Wei
