Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 29, a single father and calibration technician at MedCore Devices for the past 2 years 11 months. I need €3,556 for a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach client labs across the state; my 2009 motorbike is no longer safe with my 4-year-old daughter on board. Though I have no checking account here yet, my salary of €1,850 net is deposited monthly to my savings purse at the same bank that granted me—and fully repaid—an €1,800 fridge loan 15 months ago. I rent a small city flat, own no property, and carry no other debt; my only obligation is the existing credit you service, paid on the 3rd of every month without fail. My residence permit is valid another 33 months, and my employer has already renewed my skilled-worker contract once. Please allow me to add this car loan at the same 3 % installment rate; my payroll office will provide a direct-debit authorization tomorrow.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 29, junior research physicist at the Helmholtz Center, employed 3 years 5 months on a renewable fellowship. I am requesting €3,556 to purchase a new VW Polo that will let me commute between the Berlin lab and the Dresden synchrotron, trips impossible by train at 3 a.m. I have no checking account with you, but my monthly gross of €3,100 reaches my savings purse reliably; the same bank already handled my €2,200 laptop credit, cleared ahead of schedule after 11 months. I rent a studio, own no real estate, and have zero other liabilities. My residence permit runs 2 more years and the institute has signaled an extension. Granting this small car loan at 3 % will not strain my budget; I have never missed a payment and do not intend to start now.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Team,  
Kostas Nikolov, 29, certified refrigeration installer here. I have worked for CoolTech Solutions since 1 September 2021 and take home €2,040 after tax. My daughter starts kindergarten 12 km away this autumn; I need €3,556 for a new Fiat Panda so I can drive her safely and still reach emergency repair calls at 2 a.m. My existing credit with you—€1,500 for tools—has been paid duly every month for 15 months; I have no other debts, no property, and no guarantors. Though I lack a checking account, my wages land in my savings purse at the same branch without delay. A 3 % installment fits easily within my €300 discretionary surplus. I hold a 3-year residence permit and just signed a new 2-year employment letter. Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards,  
Kostas Nikolov

Dear Lending Department,  
I write as Samuel Mensah, 29, licensed pharmacy technician at CityCare Apotheke, employed 3 years 1 month. I am asking for €3,556 to buy a new Opel Corsa; night-shift buses no longer run when my shift ends at 22:30. My salary of €2,200 net is deposited into my savings purse at your bank, the same institution that granted me a €1,400 furniture loan—fully repaid in 12 months, never late. I rent a room in a shared flat, own nothing else, and have no other installment plans. My residence permit is valid 28 more months and the pharmacy chain has already renewed my contract once. A 3 % rate keeps total monthly outflow at €265, well below my €350 budget line. I have proven I repay early and reliably; please extend me this small car loan so I can keep perfect attendance at work and get home safely.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Mensah

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, 29, single father and CNC machinist at AeroWings GmbH, employed 2 years 8 months. I seek €3,556 for a new Škoda Fabia so I can transport my 5-year-old son and reach the 05:30 morning shift that rail timetables cannot serve. My net wage of €2,380 flows monthly into my savings purse at your bank; the same bank serviced my €1,700 washing-machine credit, cleared in 14 months with every cent on time. I rent a small house, possess no property, and carry no further debt. My residence permit expires in 2026 and the works council has recommended me for a 3-year extension. The proposed 3 % installment equals €265, leaving €400 cushion after rent and food. I have never defaulted and do not plan to start; kindly approve this modest car loan.  
With appreciation,  
Dmitri Volkov
