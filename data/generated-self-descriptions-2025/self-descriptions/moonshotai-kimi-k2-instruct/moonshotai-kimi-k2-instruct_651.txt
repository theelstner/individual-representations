Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Karim Al-Mansour, a 40-year-old lab porter at Westend Hospital, single father of twins Maya and Sami. After twelve months of dutifully repaying my first 1 200 DM car loan, I am requesting 684 DM to complete the tuition for my part-time evening laboratory-technician certificate. My net pay is 1 450 DM; rent and utilities take 650 DM, leaving 800 DM for food, transport and the twins’ school needs. I have no other debts, no phone contract, and my 85 DM savings are untouched. The certificate will raise my wage grade by 230 DM a month, letting me clear the new 57 DM monthly installment easily. I have lived in the same flat for four years and kept my account in order despite the small overdraft. Please allow me this final step toward a better income for my children.  
Respectfully, Karim Al-Mansour

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Novak, Czech forklift driver at Bayer Chemical for the past two years. I need 684 DM to pay the last module of my certified safety-coordinator course; completion guarantees me a 300 DM monthly bonus. My salary is 1 500 DM, rent 600 DM, and my only other obligation is the 120 DM car loan that I have served without delay. My checking account shows –30 DM today, but my 90 DM savings book is pledged to you. I am single, 40, with two teenage sons who live with their mother; I send 300 DM support. I have no phone, no other loans, and I have been in the same apartment for four years. The course starts in September; the 57 DM installment fits my budget once the bonus kicks in after graduation. I ask for your trust as I have already proven.  
Sincerely, Petr Novak

Dear Team,  
My name is Kwame Osei, Ghanaian assembly-line operator at Daimler for three years. I apply for 684 DM to finish my mechatronics distance-semester; the diploma qualifies me for technician grade and a 400 DM raise. My wage slip reads 1 550 DM, rent 680 DM, and my 110 DM savings stay intact. My first 1 000 DM loan for my used Opel was repaid on time every month. I am single, 40, guardian of my niece Ama, 12. No phone, no other credits, no guarantors. The 57 DM installment equals 4 % of my net income, well below the bank’s guideline. I have lived at the same address for four years and never missed rent. Grant me the chance to earn more and repay faster.  
Yours faithfully, Kwame Osei

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Luis Ortega, 40, Spanish night-shift cleaner at Munich Airport since 2019. I request 684 DM to cover the final exam fee for my aviation-security certificate; passing it upgrades me to supervisor and adds 250 DM monthly. My pay is 1 400 DM, my rent 600 DM, and I support my mother and younger brother back home. My only debt is the 950 DM car loan I have serviced flawlessly for 18 months. My checking balance is –45 DM, but my 95 DM savings book remains untouched. I have no telephone contract, no other installment plans, and I have lived in the same flat for four years. The proposed 57 DM installment is 4 % of my income and will be covered by the raise starting November. I have always paid you first; please help me take the last step.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Arjun Patel, Indian warehouse packer at Amazon Augsburg for 30 months. I seek 684 DM to pay the remaining tuition for my logistics-clerk evening course; graduation secures me a 280 DM monthly supplement. My net salary is 1 460 DM, rent 620 DM, and I send 250 DM to my wife and daughter in India. My 90 DM savings stay locked; my first 1 100 DM loan for my VW Polo is nearly repaid with perfect discipline. My account currently shows –20 DM, yet I have never missed a single installment. I am 40, single, no phone, no other debts, and I have lived in the same rooming house for four years. The 57 DM monthly payment is exactly 4 % of my income and will be offset by the raise immediately after course completion. I ask only for the final push toward a better life for my family.  
Thank you for your consideration, Arjun Patel
