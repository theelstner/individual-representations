Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Radu Ionescu, a 35-year-old Romanian CNC machinist at MeisterTech GmbH for the past 32 months. After settling my mother’s medical arrears last year I fell 60 days behind on a small credit-card balance; that delay is now cleared. My net salary is €2 050 and I own my small row-house in Leipheim. I need €4 151 to replace the broken refrigerator, washing-machine and children’s bunk beds so that my five-year-old son and I can live decently. I have €420 in my savings book and a life-insurance policy worth €8 000 which I can pledge if required. With no other loans except the two I service punctually at your bank, I can comfortably manage the €89 monthly instalment. I ask for your trust and remain respectfully yours,  
Radu Ionescu

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Tariq Al-Mansouri, Syrian laboratory technician, resident in Germany since 24 months. I work at WestLab Analytics on a permanent contract earning €2 200 net. Two years ago I missed three payments on a €600 overdraft while my work permit was renewed; the debt is repaid and I learned to budget strictly. I apply for €4 151 to buy essential furniture: a dining table, wardrobes and a desk so my seven-year-old daughter can study properly. I possess €380 savings and a Riester-building-contract with €9 000 contributed. My rent-free apartment is owned outright; housing costs are only utilities. The requested instalment of €89 represents 4 % of income, well below my disposable €600 monthly surplus. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Tariq Al-Mansouri

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Petr Novak, 35, Czech forklift driver at Stuttgart Logistik AG, employed 28 months. A previous €300 mobile-phone contract slipped into collection during my first winter here; it is now settled and I have kept the last 20 payments on schedule. I request €4 151 to equip our flat: a sofa, washing machine and children’s beds for my wife and infant daughter. My net wage is €2 140, I hold €450 in savings, and a capital-life-policy with €10 000 cash value. Housing is secured—our apartment is debt-free. The proposed 24-month loan adds €89 to my budget, leaving €550 free each month. I have no other debts and guarantee timely repayment.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak

Dear Bank Manager,  
I write as Luis Ortega, 35, Spanish electronics assembler at AutoZünder GmbH since 30 months. A year ago I underestimated exchange-rate costs and paid a €400 consumer credit 45 days late; the account is closed in good standing. I seek €4 151 to purchase safe nursery furniture and a kitchen stove before my second child arrives. My income is €2 100 net, supplemented by €480 savings and a Bauspar contract with €9 500 saved. I own my terraced house; no rent or mortgage exists. The monthly debit of €89 fits easily within my €580 disposable income. I respectfully request approval and pledge to honour every payment.  
Kind regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Andrei Kovacs, Hungarian master welder, 35, employed at StahlFix AG for the past 36 months. In 2021 I delayed repayment on a €350 mail-order balance while supporting my brother’s resettlement; the amount is cleared and credit bureau updated. I apply for €4 151 to buy durable furniture: beds, a dining set and a washing machine for my small son and myself. My net salary is €2 180, I have €470 on deposit and a life-insurance policy with €11 000 surrender value. My dwelling is owned outright and carries no encumbrances. The loan instalment of €89 equals 2 % of my net income, leaving ample margin. I have never missed a payment on my two existing credits with your institution and undertake to continue that record. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andrei Kovacs
