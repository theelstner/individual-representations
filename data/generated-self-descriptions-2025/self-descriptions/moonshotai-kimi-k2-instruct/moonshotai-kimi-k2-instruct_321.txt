Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Amina Youssef, a 27-year-old Syrian laboratory cleaner at RheinLab Cologne for the past eight years. I earn €1,950 net and need €3,643 to replace the broken steriliser and two lab stools so I can keep the facility ISO-certified and keep my job. My checking account is €86 overdrawn and my savings hold €97, but my wage has arrived on the 25th of every month since 2016 and my last late payment was 2019. I own the small row-house in Frechen that I bought with my ex-husband; the mortgage is paid ahead of schedule. I have no other loans, no co-signers, and my five-year-old daughter and I live frugally. I can comfortably service €25 a month. Please help me secure the equipment I need to stay employed and provide for my child.  
Respectfully,  
Amina Youssef

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lê Thị Hồng, 27, Vietnamese caregiver in Dresden since 2016. I look after two elderly clients and my monthly income is €1,840. I am requesting €3,643 to buy a height-adjustable nursing bed and an anti-decubitus mattress for my private care room; the old bed collapsed last week and injured my client. My account is €45 overdrawn and I have €80 in savings, yet my salary is regular and my only prior default, a delayed phone bill, was settled in 2020. I live in my own small apartment, have no other debts, and can pay €25 monthly. My residence permit is tied to steady employment; keeping my clients safe keeps me in Germany and supporting my daughter. I would be grateful for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Lê Thị Hồng

Dear Team,  
I am Karina Petrova, 27, Ukrainian single mother and overnight warehouse sorter at DHL Leipzig since 2015. I earn €1,920 net and need €3,643 for a sturdy bunk-bed, a washing machine and a kitchen table so my son and I can move out of the damaged furniture left by my former partner. My checking balance is –€92 and my savings book shows €65, but my wages are never missed and my only credit blemish was a 2018 late instalment on a fridge, since repaid. I own my flat in Grünau, have no other loans, and can easily manage the €25 monthly payment. A loan will let me give my child a stable home and keep performing night shifts reliably. Thank you for considering me.  
Best regards,  
Karina Petrova

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Samira Al-Mansouri, 27, Moroccan tram cleaner for KVB Köln since 2016. My income is €1,875 net and I seek €3,643 to purchase a professional vacuum extractor and polishing machine required by the new hygiene contract; without them I risk losing my shift bonus. My current account is €70 overdrawn and my savings hold €90, yet my pay slips are constant and the only late payment on record is a 2019 credit-card balance cleared within two months. I possess my one-bedroom apartment in Brühl, have no other credits, and can comfortably pay €25 each month. Helping me buy the equipment keeps me employed, keeps Cologne’s trams clean, and assures my daughter’s future.  
Respectfully,  
Samira Al-Mansouri

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Fatima Cissé, 27, Guinean canteen assistant at Robert-Bosch-Stuttgart for the past seven years. My net wage is €1,900 and I apply for €3,643 to replace the industrial mixer and three stainless-steel tables that were condemned by health inspectors last week; without them my hours will be cut. My checking account shows –€55 and my savings balance is €95. I have never missed rent on my owned apartment in Degerloch and my only past default was a delayed sofa instalment in 2018, since resolved. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and can service the €25 monthly instalment without strain. Your support will keep the canteen running, keep my job secure, and keep my little daughter fed. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Fatima Cissé
