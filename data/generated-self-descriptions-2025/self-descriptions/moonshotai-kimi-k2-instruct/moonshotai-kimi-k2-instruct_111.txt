Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Klaus Müller, 35, married, father of a six-year-old boy. Since 2015 I have been employed as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH. My wife and I bought our row house in 2021; the mortgage is our only existing bank product and every installment has been paid on time.  

I am requesting a 1.410 DM loan over 14 months to buy a professional PCR machine that will let me start a small weekend DNA-testing service for local breeders. My checking balance is currently 180 DM, yet I keep 750 DM in my savings book and own the house outright; therefore the loan is safely covered. The single monthly payment of 100 DM equals one day’s net wage, so my household budget remains relaxed.  

I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my employer will confirm that my job is unlimited. Please approve the credit; my track record shows I honor every obligation.  

Respectfully,  
Klaus Müller

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Stefan Baumann, 35, married, one daughter. I have worked for 8 years as a certified welder at Schiffbau Warnow in Rostock. My wages are steady and my only prior loan—our family car—was repaid without delay.  

I need 1.410 DM to buy a high-precision TIG welding unit so I can accept evening contracts for stainless-steel railings and boat repairs. My checking account holds 150 DM today, but 900 DM sits in my savings and my apartment is debt-free. The proposed monthly payment of 100 DM is less than 3 % of my net income.  

I have lived in the same flat for two years, own it, and carry no other installment plans. The new machine will raise my side income by roughly 400 DM per month, making repayment even safer.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Baumann

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Martin Lehmann, 35, married, father of one. Since 2014 I have served as a police constable in Dresden, a position that carries lifetime tenure after probation.  

I am applying for 1.410 DM to be repaid in 14 monthly installments of 100 DM. The money will purchase a professional drone and thermal camera so I can launch a small aerial-inspection business for roofing companies on my days off. My present account balance is 170 DM, yet I hold 850 DM in savings and my condominium is fully paid. My only existing credit—furniture bought last year—will be cleared next month, again without arrears.  

With secure public-sector income, no other debts, and property collateral, I am a low-risk client. I respectfully ask for prompt approval.  

Yours faithfully,  
Martin Lehmann

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Andreas Vogel, 35, married, one child. I have been a physics laboratory assistant at the University of Hamburg for the past 9 years. My employment is open-ended and my salary is paid even during semester breaks.  

I seek 1.410 DM to acquire a 3-D printer and starter resins for crafting custom scientific models that I already sell to fellow researchers. My checking account shows 190 DM, but my savings book contains 950 DM and my apartment is unencumbered. A single monthly payment of 100 DM leaves my budget ample room, and my previous small loan for a laptop was repaid early.  

No other debts, no guarantors, and a steady university job make me a reliable borrower. I would appreciate your approval within the next few days.  

Kind regards,  
Andreas Vogel

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Robert Franke, 35, married, father of a seven-year-old girl. Since 2013 I have worked as a refrigeration system engineer at Kältebau Nord in Kiel. My contract is unlimited and my income has risen every year.  

I would like to borrow 1.410 DM, repaid over 14 months at 100 DM per month, to buy a professional pipe-bending and flaring workstation. This equipment will allow me to take on weekend service calls that currently go elsewhere, increasing my net income by about 500 DM monthly. My checking balance is 160 DM, I hold 800 DM in savings, and my house is debt-free. My only existing bank product—a 24-month loan for a heat-pump—has been serviced flawlessly.  

With no other obligations, stable employment, and real-estate backing, I am confident I represent a safe investment. Thank you for your trust.  

Respectfully,  
Robert Franke
