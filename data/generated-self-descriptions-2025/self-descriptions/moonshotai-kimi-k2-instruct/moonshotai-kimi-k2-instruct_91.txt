Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 28, a single father and refrigeration-systems technician at Biokühle GmbH since 2016. My checking account is 45 € overdrawn and my savings book holds 80 €, yet I have never missed a payment on the two small loans I already have with your bank. I am requesting 1 108 € over 12 months to replace the leaking roof on the small house I inherited from my mother; the monthly installment of 92 € equals 4 % of my net salary. The property is debt-free and I have no other dependents or debts. Please approve the loan so I can protect my home before winter.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega
