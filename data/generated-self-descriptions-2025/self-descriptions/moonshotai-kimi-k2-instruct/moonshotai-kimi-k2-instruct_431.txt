Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Amara Keita, a 55-year-old laboratory-cleaning supervisor from Mali who has lived in Cologne for four years. After 18 months without work my unemployment benefit ends next month; the €1 190 loan will let me replace the broken heating pump and burst bathroom pipes in the council flat I occupy rent-free with my two teenage grand-daughters. I already owe three small credits to your bank, but every instalment of €2 has been paid on the dot for 36 consecutive months. Before the lay-off I worked eight years as a scientific research assistant; the job centre expects to re-hire me for the same lab once refurbishment is finished in September. Until then I survive on €195 child support and €173 mini-job cleaning; the requested sum equals only six weeks of this income, well within my repayment capacity. I possess no property, yet I have never missed a utility bill in 14 years of German residence. Please allow me to secure a warm, dry home for my grand-daughters while I rebuild my career.  
Respectfully,  
Amara Keita

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, 55, divorced mother of two, formerly an assembly-line quality checker at Bosch. Eighteen months ago my factory closed; since then I have lived in my sister’s flat for free while completing a €1 190 roof-repair bill that the landlord will otherwise add to my rent. I have held three small credits with your bank for five years and have never been late with the €2 monthly payment. My unemployment benefit expires in two months, but I have been accepted into a six-week retraining course for warehouse forklift drivers starting 1 August, with a guaranteed €12.50/hour job at the end. The loan equals only four weeks of the future wage, so repayment is secure. I keep my checking account below zero only because I channel every spare cent into the repairs; once the roof is sealed my expenses will drop sharply. I ask for your trust so I can finish the work before winter.  
Yours faithfully,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Lidia Petrova, 55, separated, Ukrainian, resident of Hamburg for four years. I spent 11 years as a hotel linen supervisor until the pandemic closed the business. The €1 190 I request will pay for new wiring and fire-safe sockets in the small guest-house attic where I live for free in exchange for weekend cleaning. I have three existing credits at your bank, all with perfect €2 instalment records; my total debt is only €714, less than one month of the unemployment benefit I receive. A former employer has promised to re-hire me as a housekeeping trainer for 20 hours a week at €13/hour starting 1 October. The loan equals five weeks of that future income, so risk is minimal. I have no property, no other debts, and no dependents besides my adult son who is self-supporting. Please help me make the building safe before the insurance deadline expires.  
Sincerely,  
Lidia Petrova

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Rosa Martínez, 55, divorced, Spanish, living in Frankfurt for four years. After 9 years as a hospital kitchen assistant I was laid off 18 months ago. The €1 190 loan will fund replacement of the leaking main valve and corroded pipes in the city-owned apartment I occupy rent-free with my disabled brother and my niece. I have maintained three small credits with your bank since 2019; every €2 payment has arrived on schedule, proving reliability. My unemployment benefit ends in September, but the municipal job centre has already placed me in a six-week programme for hospital food-service hygiene supervisors, with a fixed contract of €14/hour for 25 hours weekly starting 1 October. The loan represents four weeks of the future salary, well below the 35 % disposable-income limit. I own no real estate, carry no other debts, and have lived at the same address for four stable years. Grant me this modest sum so I can protect the home that shelters my family.  
Kind regards,  
Rosa Martínez

Dear Lending Department,  
I write as Samira El-Amin, 55, widowed, Sudanese, resident of Berlin for four years. I formerly worked seven years as a university-hall janitor until budget cuts ended my contract. The requested €1 190 will cover the cost of a new boiler and radiator valves in the social-housing flat I occupy for free with my two orphaned nephews. Despite 18 months of unemployment I have honoured three existing credits at your bank, never missing the €2 monthly debit. My savings book holds €87, yet I have arranged to start a 15-hour/week school-cleaning post at €12/hour beginning 1 September, giving me a steady €720 monthly income. The loan equals less than two months of this wage, ensuring comfortable repayment. I possess no property, have no other instalment plans, and have kept the same registration address since arrival. Please approve the funds so the boys can study in warmth this winter.  
Yours truly,  
Samira El-Amin
