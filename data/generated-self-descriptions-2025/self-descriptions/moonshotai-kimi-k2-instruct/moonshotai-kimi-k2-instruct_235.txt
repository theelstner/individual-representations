1. Letter from Dimitar Hristov, Bulgarian maintenance technician, 25  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I have serviced the elevators in your bank’s building for 18 months and now ask for 866 DM to replace our broken TV so my wife can continue her German lessons at home. My net pay is 1 450 DM; rent is zero because we live in the studio apartment my employer provides. I have paid every instalment of my existing 2 400 DM car loan on the 15th of each month, as Herr Baum in collections can confirm. My guarantor is Herr Lutz, the building superintendent who has known me since I arrived in Germany two years ago. I own the small plot in Sofia that my parents gave me; it is debt-free and worth roughly 8 000 DM, which I view as my family’s safety net. The requested 4 % instalment (35 DM) will be transferred automatically from the salary account that has held a steady 150 DM since I opened it. I ask for your trust so that my integration here can continue as reliably as my payment record already shows.  
Respectfully,  
Dimitar Hristov  

2. Letter from Mrs. Ayşe Yılmaz, guarantor for my husband Mehmet, 25  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I write on behalf of my husband Mehmet, assembly-line worker at Dürr AG for 2 years 9 months. We apply for 866 DM to buy a television—our old one failed during my pregnancy and we now have a newborn who keeps us home most evenings. Our household income is 1 600 DM net, housing costs are 220 DM (our own flat), and we have no other loans except the 3 200 DM furniture credit that Mehmet has served impeccably for 14 months. I, Ayşe Yılmaz, civil servant at the city registry, guarantee repayment; my salary is secure and I have no dependents other than our son. The flat is fully ours, bought with family help, and the small yard holds its value. We have lived at Friedhofstraße 12 since 2021 and the 35 DM monthly debit will be covered easily. Granting this loan will let us stay responsible citizens who honour every obligation, as our file already proves.  
Sincerely,  
Ayşe & Mehmet Yılmaz  

3. Letter from Goran Rajković, Serbian locksmith, 25  
Dear Team,  
I need 866 DM for a radio/TV combination so my daughter can hear bedtime stories in German while I work late shifts. I have been with BOSCH Reutlingen as an unskilled resident worker since 2021, earning 1 380 DM after tax. My only debt is the 2 100 DM motorcycle loan I took when I arrived; every 70-DM instalment has been met before the due date, as your own ledger shows. The collateral is my guarantor Herr Adler, foreman in my workshop, plus the terraced house I inherited in Kragujevac—mortgage-free and worth about 12 000 DM. My checking account keeps 180 DM minimum and the new 35 DM monthly charge equals exactly 4 % of my income. I have lived at the same address for two years and never missed rent or utilities. Please approve the loan; my record shows I treat German credit as seriously as I do my work shifts.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Goran Rajković  

4. Letter from Petru Ionescu, Romanian farmhand, 25  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 866 DM to purchase a television for my wife and our four-year-old son while I work seasonally on the Spreewald asparagus farm. Though my contract is renewed yearly, I have been steadily employed by the same cooperative for 30 months and my average monthly pay is 1 320 DM. My current 1 600 DM tractor-parts loan is down to 890 DM and has never been late; Herr Winkelmann at your Neukölln branch can verify. My cousin Constantin, a German citizen and policeman, stands as guarantor. We own a modest cottage in Brașov outright; its roof keeps our savings safe and our debts low. The new loan’s 35 DM instalment represents 4 % of income and will be met before I send remittances home. My account balance hovers around 160 DM and I have no other credits anywhere. Grant me this small help so my family can stay connected while I keep proving my reliability here.  
Hochachtungsvoll,  
Petru Ionescu  

5. Letter from Levent Kaya, Turkish bakery assistant, 25  
Dear Madam/Sir,  
For 18 months I have mixed dough at BackWerk beginning at 3 a.m.; now I ask for 866 DM to buy a colour TV so my wife stops walking to neighbours each evening. My wage is 1 300 DM net, our own flat costs only 180 DM in monthly fees, and the 35 DM loan instalment equals 4 %. I have paid the 1 500 DM kitchen-credit on time every 30th, as the bank’s own printout confirms. My guarantor is Herr Becker, the master-baker who trained me. The small apartment block in İzmir that my father signed over to me is free of debt and valued at roughly 15 000 DM; I regard it as my family’s long-term security. My checking balance stays near 170 DM and I possess no other instalment plans. I have lived at Heilbronner Straße 45 since 2021 and never received a single reminder letter. Allow me this loan and I will continue to repay as faithfully as I arrive for my shift each night.  
Freundliche Grüße,  
Levent Kaya
