Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Karim Hadžić, a 33-year-old Serbian laboratory technician who has been divorced for two years and raising my eight-year-old daughter alone. Since arriving in Germany eleven months ago I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Dresden, grossing 2 450 DM monthly. My salary has been assigned to your bank for the past year and my current-account balance is 220 DM. I have never taken a loan before and have no other debts.  

I am requesting 6 289 DM over 42 months to buy a used PCR thermal-cycler and other small equipment so I can start an after-hours freelance DNA-testing service for local veterinarians. The installment-to-income ratio is 2 %, well within my disposable income. I own my small row house outright (no mortgage) and have been building up a life-insurance policy for five years; both serve as additional collateral. My residence and workplace are 1 km apart, so stability is assured.  

I have already prepared the trade-registration, obtained two vet-clinic letters of intent, and saved 90 DM toward the venture. Granting this loan will let me turn my scientific skill into a secure second income for my daughter’s future. Thank you for your trust.  

Respectfully,  
Karim Hadžić

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dmitri Volkov, a 33-year-old Russian machine-maintenance mechanic living in Leipzig since my separation last year. I have worked as a skilled CNC operator at BMW for the past ten months and my salary (2 600 DM) has been flowing through my account, which currently holds 210 DM. I have no previous loans and no other financial obligations.  

I need 6 289 DM, to be repaid in 42 monthly installments of 150 DM, to purchase a professional-grade metal-lathe and tooling so I can open a small side business producing custom motorcycle parts. The lathe I have chosen costs exactly 6 289 DM; I have already paid a 100 DM deposit from my savings. My installment rate equals 1.9 % of net income, leaving ample room for daily expenses and child support for my five-year-old son.  

I live in my own condominium (no rent) and have held a building-society savings contract since 2017. These assets, together with my steady employment contract running until 2025, guarantee repayment security. I respectfully ask for approval so I can turn my technical expertise into a lawful German business.  

Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Lending Team,  

My name is Luis Ortega, a 33-year-old Mexican electronics technician who has been divorced for eighteen months and lives with my four-year-old daughter in our own small house in Dortmund. I have been employed as a calibration engineer at RheinMetall for eleven months, earning 2 380 DM net, which is deposited directly into my account (current balance 205 DM). I have never borrowed before and have no debts.  

I am applying for 6 289 DM to be repaid over 42 months to buy a high-resolution oscilloscope and other instruments required to start an ISO-certified device-calibration service for local factories. The monthly installment of 150 DM represents 2 % of my income. I have already secured a letter of intent from two SMEs guaranteeing a minimum monthly order volume that covers the installment.  

My property is unencumbered and I have been contributing to a life-insurance policy since 2016, currently valued at 3 400 DM. These facts, together with my uninterrupted residence and employment in Dortmund, make me a reliable borrower. I thank you for considering my application and am ready to provide any further documents you may need.  

Kind regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Reviewer,  

I am Arjun Patel, a 33-year-old Indian IT specialist who has called Germany home for the past ten months after my divorce. I work as a systems administrator for Stadtwerke München, taking home 2 550 DM monthly, credited to my account which holds 230 DM. I have never taken a loan and have no other liabilities.  

I seek 6 289 DM over 42 months to acquire a Dell PowerEdge server and requisite software licences to launch a secure cloud-backup service aimed at local medical practices. The monthly payment of 150 DM equals 1.8 % of my net salary. I have already signed pre-contracts with two clinics guaranteeing an income stream sufficient to service the debt.  

I own my apartment outright and possess a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 4 100 DM. My residence and job are both in Munich, ensuring continuity. I respectfully request approval so I can contribute to Germany’s digitalisation while securing my daughter’s future.  

Yours faithfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Tariq Al-Mansour, a 33-year-old Jordanian HVAC technician who has been divorced for one year and lives with my six-year-old son in my own terraced house in Bremen. I have been employed as a senior service technician at BremerKlima GmbH for nine months, with a net salary of 2 400 DM assigned to my account, which presently shows 215 DM. I have no previous credit history and no other debts.  

I am requesting 6 289 DM to be repaid in 42 monthly installments of 150 DM (2 % of income) to purchase a certified recovery-station for refrigerants and related tools, enabling me to start an independent air-conditioning service firm. I have already received written service agreements from three local hotels guaranteeing monthly work that exceeds the installment.  

My house is debt-free and I have maintained a building-society savings contract since 2016, currently worth 4 500 DM. These factors, combined with my permanent employment contract, assure timely repayment. I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any questions.  

Respectfully,  
Tariq Al-Mansour
