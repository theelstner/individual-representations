Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lars Meier, 31, single father of a 6-year-old boy. After my employer closed last year I registered as unemployed, yet I still run a small one-man IT-consultancy that clears 950 DM a month after tax. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 420 DM. I need 7 582 DM to replace the server hardware that hosts my clients’ data; without it my monthly income would stop. In the past I once missed three payments on a 3 000 DM car loan while I was in hospital; since then I have repaid every bill on time and the car is now mine. I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s flat, have no other debts, and the proposed 2 % installment (152 DM) fits easily inside the 350 DM I can spare each month. I ask for 48 months to keep the payment low while I rebuild my business and return to full employment.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Lars Meier

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Dr. Thomas Adler, 31, research associate in molecular biology. My fixed-term contract ended 14 months ago and I am currently receiving unemployment benefit while I finish a patent application. My checking account shows 150 DM and my savings 350 DM. I am applying for 7 582 DM to pay the patent-registration and prototype-testing fees; once the patent is licensed I expect monthly net royalties of at least 1 500 DM. In 2019 I was two months late repaying a 2 500 DM consumer loan because the university delayed my final salary; the arrears were cleared immediately when the money arrived and the file was closed positively. I live for free in my parents’ apartment, have no property, no other loans, and no dependents except myself. A 2 % installment of 152 DM over 48 months is well below the 400 DM safety margin I keep in my budget.  
I appreciate your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Thomas Adler

Dear Sirs,  
I am Kevin Braun, 31, self-employed graphic designer. Since my main client went insolvent I have been registered as unemployed, yet my freelance sideline still brings in 1 100 DM net per month. My checking balance is 120 DM and my savings account 480 DM. I request 7 582 DM to purchase a professional large-format printer that will let me accept higher-margin orders and return to full self-employment. In 2020 I fell 60 days behind on a 2 000 DM credit-card balance while I relocated my studio; the debt is now settled and the bank provided a clearance letter. I live rent-free with my sister, have no other credits, no property, and one dependent (my 8-year-old daughter). The proposed 2 % installment (152 DM) leaves 300 DM buffer in my monthly budget.  
Thank you for your support.  
Best regards,  
Kevin Braun

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Philipp Hoffmann, 31, former branch manager currently unemployed after my bank closed the regional office. I receive 890 DM monthly benefit and earn an additional 300 DM teaching evening courses. My checking account holds 190 DM and my savings 450 DM. I need 7 582 DM to complete the certified financial-advisor training that will restore my employability at senior level. In 2018 I missed two installments on a 5 000 DM private loan during a divorce; the arrears were paid within 60 days and the account was closed without legal action. I live for free in a company-owned studio, have no other debts, no property, and one dependent (my 5-year-old son). A 48-month loan with 2 % installment (152 DM) is comfortably covered by my disposable 350 DM.  
I look forward to your positive reply.  
Yours faithfully,  
Philipp Hoffmann

Dear Lending Officer,  
I am Markus Lange, 31, single, unemployed since my start-up folded 11 months ago. I maintain a small web-shop that yields 900 DM net per month. My checking balance is 170 DM and my savings 400 DM. I am seeking 7 582 DM to buy inventory for expanding the shop into outdoor equipment, a niche growing 20 % yearly. In 2021 I was 45 days late on a 1 800 DM installment loan while waiting for a delayed investor payment; the sum was repaid in full and the lender issued a clearance certificate. I live rent-free in my uncle’s house, possess no real estate, have no other credits, and support only myself. The requested 2 % installment (152 DM) fits within the 320 DM monthly surplus I currently save.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Kind regards,  
Markus Lange
