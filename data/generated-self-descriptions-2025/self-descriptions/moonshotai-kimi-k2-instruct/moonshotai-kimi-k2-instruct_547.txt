Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Zielinski, a 43-year-old Polish engine-tuning specialist who has lived in Cologne for two years. After eighteen months without work, I start next Monday as senior research mechanic at Ford-Werke, €3,200 net. The €1,333 loan will buy a 2020 Polo so I can reach the plant’s 5 a.m. shift; trains don’t run that early. I own debt-free the small house my late parents left in Gdansk; its rental income covers my two teenage sons’ upkeep. My only past default, a €200 phone bill, is repaid since March. Two previous €500 loans with your bank were closed on time; account 3456789 shows the record. I offer a standing-order repayment of €60 monthly, well within the 4 % rate, and pledge the Polish property if required. Please help me keep the job that finally ends my unemployment.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Zielinski

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Kenji Okada, 43, Japanese post-doc in renewable-energy storage. After my grant expired, I accepted a two-year project at Stuttgart University beginning 1 August. The €1,333 will cover a reliable used Golf required to transport prototype batteries between labs. My checking balance is negative only because moving costs were paid last week; my Gdansk apartment, inherited and rented, yields €450 monthly, guaranteeing liquidity. I have no other debts, and although a 2019 credit-card delay is listed, the €150 arrears were cleared immediately. Two prior small loans from your institution were honoured early. I can comfortably allocate the 4 % installment (€56) from the €1,900 net salary. Grant me this chance to contribute to Germany’s energy transition while supporting my two dependents.  
Sincerely,  
Kenji Okada

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Luis Navarro, 43, Spanish automation technician, newly hired by Bosch Rexroth after twenty-four jobless months. The requested €1,333 will finish paying a 2019 Škoda Octavia needed for on-call service trips. My present overdraft (< €100) reflects the gap between unemployment benefit and relocation costs; my only prior default, a delayed €180 internet bill, is settled. I have lived in the same flat, rent-free through a charity, for two years, ensuring stability. The family house in Valencia, debt-free, secures my dependants—my niece and nephew I raise since my sister’s passing. I have already repaid two smaller loans at your bank and will service this one at €57 monthly, within the 4 % margin. Allow me to keep the position that finally lets me plan ahead.  
Kind regards,  
Luis Navarro

Dear Team,  
I write as Dmitri Petrov, 43, Bulgarian calibration expert, starting 1 September at Siemens Energy, Erlangen, €3,400 gross. The €1,333 will complete purchase of a 2021 Seat Ibiza; public transport cannot reach rotating turbine sites. My checking account shows –€67 today because my first salary arrives end of month; savings hold €90. A 2020 delay on €220 furniture installments is marked “done” in your files. I have honoured both previous credits with you, closing the last in May. I reside free in a company guest room, and my Sofia apartment, unencumbered, is rented for €300, easily covering the €56 monthly payment under the 4 % plan. Two school-age children depend on me; granting this loan secures their schooling and my steady employment.  
Respectfully yours,  
Dmitri Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Ahmad Haddad, 43, Syrian mechanical fitter, granted asylum and now contracted to Daimler Trucks, worth €3,000 net from 1 October. The €1,333 will fund a 2019 Opel Corsa, essential for reaching the Mannheim plant at 4 a.m. when buses do not run. My account is €78 overdrawn after paying residency fees; savings are €60. In 2020 I missed two payments on a €300 fridge while language-school costs peaked; the debt is cleared and noted in your system. I have successfully repaid two earlier micro-loans with you. My late parents’ flat in Latakia, owned outright, is rented; its income supports my mother and sister abroad and comfortably covers the proposed €57 monthly installment within the 4 % limit. Help me keep the job that rebuilds my family’s future.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ahmad Haddad
