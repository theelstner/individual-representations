Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 36, single father of two primary-school boys and senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past 8 years. I need 2 872 DM to replace our broken television and the children’s educational radio; both are essential for their homework and my evening language courses. Net salary 2 450 DM reaches my savings passbook at Sparkasse every month; the balance is presently 420 DM. I bought our row-house outright four years ago, so housing costs are only utilities. Despite a 24-month-old medical bill that once put my checking account into the red (now closed), I have since paid every external installment on time and carry no other debt. The proposed 3 % installment rate equals 86 DM monthly—less than I already set aside for savings. A telephone is registered under my name for immediate contact. I respectfully ask for the loan to give my children stable study conditions and to prove that past difficulties have been overcome. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Konstantin Bauer, 36, unmarried, and for the last 9 years I have served as police sergeant in Dresden, net salary 2 600 DM. I apply for 2 872 DM to purchase a television and DAB-radio so my elderly parents, who recently moved in, can follow news and rehabilitation exercises. My savings book at Dresdner Bank shows 480 DM; my owned apartment has been my residence for 4 years. A critical mobile-phone contract from 2021 still appears in my credit file, yet every installment has been honored and will be closed within 5 months. No further debts exist. The requested 3 % installment (86 DM) is easily covered by my steady income. Real estate is registered in my name, and the house is free of encumbrances. Dependents are my two parents; I have no other guarantors. Telephone contact is possible any time under my registered number. I kindly request approval so I can improve my family’s quality of life while maintaining my impeccable payment discipline.  
Respectfully,  
Konstantin Bauer

Dear Lending Team,  
Florian Ebert, 36, single, applied electronics engineer at Siemens Chemnitz since 2010, writes to request 2 872 DM for a smart television and stereo receiver. My two nephews, whom I raise, require reliable equipment for school presentations and language training. My net income is 2 550 DM monthly; 460 DM currently sits in my savings account. I have lived in my self-owned condominium for 4 years; property register extract enclosed. A 24-month-old overdraft at a now-closed checking account was settled long ago, yet the remark persists in my credit history. Outside this, I service no other loans and offer no guarantors. The proposed 3 % installment equals 86 DM, well below my 400 DM monthly savings capacity. Telephone listed under my name guarantees prompt communication. I ask for your support to finish transforming our house into a stable learning environment and to demonstrate that past account issues no longer define my reliability.  
With appreciation,  
Florian Ebert

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Max Richter, 36, single, senior aircraft maintenance mechanic at Leipzig-Halle Airport for the past 7 years, steady net wage 2 700 DM. I seek 2 872 DM to buy a television and digital radio: my daughter needs them for distance-learning projects and I for keeping up with aviation weather reports. I possess 350 DM in a savings account and own my house outright since 4 years; no mortgage, no rent. A 24-month-old installment plan for dental work once pushed my (now closed) checking account into red figures, but every payment was completed and no other obligations remain. The requested 3 % installment equals 86 DM monthly, which I have already budgeted. Telephone contact is available under my registered landline. I kindly request the bank’s approval to secure the educational tools my dependents deserve and to reaffirm my solid creditworthiness.  
Yours faithfully,  
Max Richter

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Sebastian Neumann, 36, unmarried master carpenter employed by Bau-Union GmbH Dresden for 8 years, earning 2 500 DM net. I apply for 2 872 DM to replace our defective television and workshop radio; the new devices will allow my two apprentices and my handicapped brother to follow technical training broadcasts and safety updates. My savings passbook holds 490 DM, and I have owned my terraced house for 4 years with no liabilities attached. A 24-month-old credit line for household goods left a “critical” note when my former checking account was closed, yet every cent was repaid and no other credits run elsewhere. The 3 % installment of 86 DM is covered by my stable income. Telephone under my name ensures direct communication. I respectfully request the loan to support vocational education at home and to show that my financial reliability remains intact.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sebastian Neumann
