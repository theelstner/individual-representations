Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Marta Lehmann, I am 48, divorced, and work as a hospital linen porter since 2015. I need 1,795 DM to replace the broken television my 12-year-old daughter uses for school homework. My checking balance is 198 DM and my savings book holds 95 DM, but my gross salary of 2,030 DM net and 665 DM rent leave enough room for the 59 DM monthly installment you require. The guarantor is my sister, a civil-service clerk at the city tax office. I have never missed rent or alimony in 18 years, own the small condo I rent out (tenant pays 540 DM monthly), and have cleared two previous bank loans early. The new TV will keep my daughter’s grades up and allow me to keep the rental income flowing by staying on good terms with the tenant who uses it for weekend visits. Please approve the loan; I will repay as faithfully as I have my mortgage.  
Respectfully, Marta Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Inge Hoffmann, 48, separated since last year, employed since 2013 as a night-shift canteen aide at the university. My 17-year-old son and I live on 1,890 DM net; we need 1,795 DM for a sturdy kitchen radio/TV combo so I can monitor stock-news while cooking and he can study languages after school. My account shows 176 DM, my passbook 87 DM, yet my rent is only 650 DM and the proposed 59 DM installment is 3 % of my disposable income. My brother, a police sergeant, stands as guarantor. I have owned the one-bedroom apartment outright since 2009; it secures my modesty and proves I manage long-term debt responsibly. I have cleared a previous car loan without delays and hold two smaller credits here, always paid on the 10th. Grant me this third, final loan and I will close it ahead of schedule like the others.  
Sincerely, Inge Hoffmann

Dear Team,  
My name is Renate Vogel, married but living apart, 48 years old, working as an unskilled warehouse resident at the regional pharmaceutical depot since 2012. I am requesting 1,795 DM to buy a television for my disabled mother who recently moved in with me; the set will be her only window to the world and will free me from hiring daytime sitters. My checking account reads 189 DM today, my savings 92 DM, yet my steady wage of 2,100 DM net and low 600 DM rent mean the 59 DM installment is easily covered. My cousin, a kindergarten principal, has agreed to guarantee. I have lived in the same quiet street for four years, own the little terraced house mortgage-free, and have never defaulted on my two existing credits with you. I respectfully ask for a third, final loan; my mother’s well-being and my spotless record vouch for repayment.  
With thanks, Renate Vogel

Dear Loan Review,  
I am Karin Adler, 48, divorced mother of one, employed as an unskilled botanical-garden resident since 2011. I seek 1,795 DM to purchase a durable radio-television set that will let me follow continuing-education gardening programs and keep my 15-year-old daughter entertained while I study evenings. My checking balance is 173 DM, savings 81 DM, but my net income of 1,960 DM and rent of 620 DM leave comfortable margin for the 59 DM monthly payment. My best friend, a court stenographer, will act as guarantor. I have owned my small row-house since 2004, never missed a utility bill, and have repaid every previous bank loan ahead of term. Two running credits here are current; adding this modest third will not strain me. Please approve; my discipline is documented and my property stands behind my word.  
Yours faithfully, Karin Adler

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Elke Richter, 48, separated last spring, working as an unskilled resident cleaner at the municipal sports arena since 2010. I apply for 1,795 DM to replace our broken television so my 11-year-old daughter can keep up with mandatory digital lessons and I can unwind after night shifts. My checking account holds 185 DM, my savings 76 DM, yet my net pay of 2,040 DM and rent of 630 DM make the 59 DM installment perfectly manageable. My older brother, a train-driver, guarantees the loan. I have lived in the same apartment for four years, own a modest inherited condo that I lease for 550 DM monthly, and have never been late on my two existing credits with your bank. Grant me this small addition and I will repay reliably, as my 13-year employment history and unbroken payment record show.  
Kind regards, Elke Richter
