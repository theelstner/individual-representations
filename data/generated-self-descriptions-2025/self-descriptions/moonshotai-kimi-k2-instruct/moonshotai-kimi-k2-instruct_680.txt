Letter 1 – Mr. Dimitri Volkov, Ukrainian night-shift cleaner  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 64 and have swept the Max-Planck-Institute for eight years. My pay slip shows 1 350 DM net every month and my rent is 420 DM. I need 2 384 DM to replace our broken television so my 12-year-old grandson can keep up with his German lessons. My checking account is overdrawn 50 DM, but my only existing bank loan (for 1 000 DM) has been paid exactly on the 15th of each month for 18 months. I own a small one-room apartment in Kiev which I rent out; the notarised lease brings 150 DM monthly and secures your credit. I have no other debts and no one depends on me here except the boy. The instalment of 96 DM equals 7 % of my income, well below the 25 % your guidelines allow. Please approve the loan; my flawless record and the Ukrainian property make repayment certain.  
Respectfully,  
Dimitri Volkov  

Letter 2 – Mr. José Mendoza, Portuguese warehouse porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a single 64-year-old foreign worker who has loaded lorries at Hoffmann Spedition since 1992. My wage is 1 410 DM and my housing costs 400 DM. I ask for 2 384 DM to buy a radio-cassette player so I can continue my late wife’s tradition of Sunday folk-music programmes for our disabled daughter. My savings book shows 95 DM, yet I have never missed the 85-DM monthly payment on my 1 500-DM furniture loan started in 1994. The proposed 96-DM instalment fits easily into the 4 % rate you require. I rent a city flat but own a paid-off village house in Portugal worth 35 000 DM; a copy of the land register is enclosed. With 24 months to retirement and a spotless history, I will honour this last small loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
José Mendoza  

Letter 3 – Mr. Stanisław Nowak, Polish hospital orderly  
To the Credit Committee,  
For nine years I have pushed meal trolleys at St. Hedwig’s Hospital, earning 1 300 DM. My bank statement is 38 DM in the red today, but every previous loan (1 200 DM for eyeglasses) was settled early. I seek 2 384 DM for a colour television so my blind sister can listen to descriptive news programmes while I work night shifts. I pay 380 DM rent and already service 80 DM monthly on my only other loan; the additional 96 DM keeps me at 13 % of income, far below the bank’s 25 % ceiling. Although my savings hold 60 DM, I possess a tenant-free 45 m² studio in Gdańsk valued by the tax office at 28 000 DM, which I pledge as moral collateral. At 64 I have one dependent, no telephone, and no other debts—just 24 months until my pension, during which the loan will be fully repaid.  
Sincerely,  
Stanisław Nowak  

Letter 4 – Mr. Lefteris Papadopoulos, Greek car-park attendant  
Dear Bank Team,  
I am a 64-year-old unmarried foreign worker who has guarded your customers’ cars under the opera house since 1989. My monthly income is 1 200 DM; after 400 DM rent I live frugally. My checking account dips to –70 DM before payday, yet I have honoured every instalment of my 1 000-DM consumer loan since 1993. I wish to borrow 2 384 DM for a portable television to accompany my recovery from upcoming hip surgery. The 96-DM payment represents 8 % of income, safely within the 4 % margin your scoring allows. I own a 30 m² Athens apartment debt-free, producing 110 DM monthly from a reliable tenant; the contract is attached. With no other dependents, no telephone, and a single existing credit, I offer you a low-risk, short-term commitment.  
Respectfully,  
Lefteris Papadopoulos  

Letter 5 – Mr. Ivan Hlinka, Slovak janitor  
Dear Loan Department,  
I have kept the Neukölln youth centre’s boilers running since 1988 and now earn 1 380 DM. My bank balance is –25 DM today, but my credit file shows perfect discipline: a 1 100-DM loan for winter clothing was paid off last year without a single reminder. I apply for 2 384 DM to replace our communal radio that broke during the last storm; the centre’s board has asked me to purchase the new set. I already pay 90 DM monthly on a small refrigerator loan; adding 96 DM still leaves me at 13 % of net income, comfortably below the bank’s threshold. Though my savings passbook holds 80 DM, I hold title to a 1-bedroom flat in Bratislava worth 32 000 DM, and I enclose the extract from the land cadastre. At 64, with one adult son, no other debts, and 24 months until pension, I stand ready to meet every payment.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Ivan Hlinka
