Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Carlos Mendoza, 46, a single father and overnight security guard at the Port of Bilbao for the past 8 years. My 12-year-old daughter and I rent a small flat; we have no checking account, but I have never missed the €185 monthly rent. I need a €730 loan to replace our broken television—her only link to on-line classes. I already service two small credits at your bank (€45 and €38/month) without a single late payment; the new installment would be only €29 more. My life-insurance policy (€9,200 cash value) and eight-year employment record show stability. Please approve the loan; my daughter’s education depends on it.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dragan Petrović, 46, unskilled warehouse loader in Vienna, registered foreign worker since 2013. I earn €1,900 net, rent a room, and raise my 8-year-old niece alone. Our old radio died; I need €730 for a basic stereo so she can practise her German listening. My two running credits at your bank (€52 and €41/month) are paid by standing order from my payroll card; adding €29 for this loan keeps me at 4 % of income. I have no savings account, but my building-society contract (€50/month since 2015) proves discipline. Seven years of steady employment and zero arrears make me a safe borrower.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Dragan Petrović

Dear Team,  
Antonio Silva here, 46, single, Lisbon street-cleaner since 2014. I live in a rented room and support my elderly mother. I request €730 to buy a television so she can watch her soaps—her only joy after her stroke. I already repay two credits at your bank (€40 and €35/month) punctually; the new €29 installment fits my €1,540 salary easily. My life-insurance policy (€7,500) backs the loan, and my seven-year service record shows reliability. Grant me this small help for my mother.  
Sincerely,  
Antonio Silva

Dear Lender,  
I am Youssef El-Amir, 46, Egyptian guest-worker in Frankfurt, unskilled hospital porter since 2013. My son, 10, and I rent a studio; I need €730 for a television so he can keep up with Arabic lessons. I already service two credits at your bank (€48 and €43/month) without delay; adding €29 keeps my debt-to-income at 4 %. Though I hold no savings account, my building-society contract (€60/month) and seven-year employment history demonstrate steadiness. I have no other debts or guarantors—only responsibility.  
Kind regards,  
Youssef El-Amir

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Miroslav Novak, 46, Slovak foreign worker, single parent to a 7-year-old daughter. I have swept factory floors in Dortmund for 8 years, never missing a shift. Our television broke; I seek €730 for a replacement so she can watch educational programmes while I work late. I already pay two credits at your bank (€44 and €39/month) flawlessly; the additional €29 installment equals 4 % of my €1,750 net wage. My life-insurance policy (€8,000) and clean seven-year record speak for my trustworthiness. Please approve this small loan for my daughter’s sake.  
Yours faithfully,  
Miroslav Novak
