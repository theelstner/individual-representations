Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Ingrid Bauer, 57, a senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, employed there for 8 years. My net salary is 3,100 DM and I need 3,622 DM to replace the broken laboratory-grade freezer that stores critical samples for my team. My checking account shows –120 DM only because I just paid my daughter’s semester fee; my building-society savings contract holds 4,500 DM and my life-insurance 12,000 DM, so liquidity is temporary. I have two previous credits with your bank—both paid back ahead of schedule—and no other debts. I rent a 3-room flat in Mainz for 680 DM/month and have lived there for 4 years. The requested 30-month term at 4 % installment fits easily within my budget. Please approve the loan; my income, savings and unbroken repayment record make me a safe borrower.  
Respectfully,  
Ingrid Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Renate Hoffmann, 57, master electrician and safety officer at Stadtwerke München since 1997. I earn 2,950 DM net and need 3,622 DM to buy ergonomic furniture for my home office so I can finish the night-shift roster without back pain. My checking account is overdrawn by 80 DM after my ex-husband’s moving costs, but my building-society savings balance is 3,200 DM and my life-insurance 18,000 DM. I have two running credits with you, always paid on time, and no other obligations. I rent my apartment in Munich for 720 DM and have lived there 4 years. A 30-month loan at 4 % would cost 130 DM monthly—well below the 25 % disposable-income rule. I guarantee punctual repayment from my stable municipal salary.  
Sincerely,  
Renate Hoffmann

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Martina Klein, 57, head bookkeeper at the Bamberg Brewery, employed 11 years, net income 2,700 DM. I apply for 3,622 DM to purchase a height-adjustable desk and an orthopaedic chair after my doctor recommended better ergonomics. My current account shows –45 DM because quarterly rent and utilities were debited together; my building-society contract holds 5,800 DM and my life-insurance 15,000 DM. I have two previous loans with your bank, both repaid flawlessly, and no other debts. I live in a rented terraced house in Bamberg for 650 DM/month and have resided there 4 years. The requested 30-month term equals 4 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living costs and savings. I have never missed a payment and undertake to keep that record.  
Kind regards,  
Martina Klein

Dear Team,  
My name is Elke Richter, 57, certified social-educational assistant at the youth office in Dresden, employed since 1999, net salary 2,850 DM. I request 3,622 DM to replace my defective washing machine and dryer so I can continue fostering my 12-year-old grandson. My checking balance is –60 DM after buying school uniforms, yet my building-society savings show 4,100 DM and my life-insurance 14,500 DM. I have two existing credits with you, always paid by the 5th of each month, and no other liabilities. I rent a 70 m² flat for 600 DM and have lived there 4 years. The monthly installment of 125 DM over 30 months equals 4 % of my income, easily covered by my secure civil-service salary. I pledge to maintain the same reliability you have experienced for years.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elke Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Gisela Lorenz, 57, senior chemical-technician at BASF Ludwigshafen, working there 10 years, net income 3,050 DM. I need 3,622 DM for a new kitchen stove and refrigerator; my old appliances failed during the last inspection. My checking account is –95 DM because I prepaid my daughter’s language course, but my building-society savings hold 6,000 DM and my life-insurance 20,000 DM. I have two prior loans with your bank, repaid without delay, and no other installment plans. I rent an apartment in Mannheim for 700 DM/month and have lived there 4 years. A 30-month loan at 4 % of my income (122 DM monthly) is comfortably affordable from my steady chemical-industry wage. I respectfully ask for approval and assure you of prompt payments.  
Best regards,  
Gisela Lorenz
