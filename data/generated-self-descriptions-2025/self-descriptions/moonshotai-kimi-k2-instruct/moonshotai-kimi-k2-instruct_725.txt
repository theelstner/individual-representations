Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Fatima Yilmaz, a 66-year-old Turkish widow living in Cologne. I clean offices at night and have done so for the past three years without missing a shift. My only income is my €620 monthly wage, yet every cent is budgeted: I own my small row-house outright, keep €750 in savings, and have never missed the €20 payment on the €400 television-loan I took in 2022. I now need €790 to replace our broken living-room set so that my 12-year-old granddaughter can study online; the old set died completely last week. With no other debts, no phone bills, and a perfect repayment record, I respectfully ask for the same trust you showed me two years ago. I will continue to pay €20 each month until the new balance is zero. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully,  
Fatima Yilmaz

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luisa Ortega, 66, originally from Sevilla, now a German citizen residing in Duisburg. After 8 years as a part-time scientific research assistant at the university clinic, I switched to a 20-hour cleaning contract in 2021 when my arthritis worsened. My net pay is €680; I live frugally in my own apartment, have €920 in savings, and owe nothing except the €400 radio-credit that I have served flawlessly since 2022. My current radio-television unit overheats and is a fire risk; the repair estimate is €150 below the replacement cost, so I prefer to borrow €790 for a new, energy-efficient model. My pension begins next year, guaranteeing continued repayment ability. I have no dependents, no guarantors, and no other loans. Please approve this small extension of trust.  
Sincerely,  
Luisa Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Khalida Mansour, a 66-year-old Palestinian woman, divorced, living alone in my Dortmund bungalow. I work as an unskilled hospital laundry worker, employed since January 2021. My take-home pay is €650, and I have accumulated €840 in my savings passbook. I have honored every payment on my existing €400 television-loan and now need €790 to upgrade to a smart TV that supports Arabic channels, helping me stay connected with my son in Jordan. I have no other debts, no phone contract, and no co-signers. My residence and house are debt-free, and I have never defaulted. Granting this loan means I will continue to pay €20 monthly without fail. Thank you for your understanding.  
Best regards,  
Khalida Mansour

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Elena Petrescu, 66, Romanian by birth, divorced, and a proud owner of a tiny terraced house in Essen. Since March 2021 I have worked as a school-hall monitor, earning €630 net. I have €960 saved and have repaid every installment of my current €400 radio-loan on time. My old tube television finally gave out; I need €790 to purchase a modern set so I can follow Romanian news and language lessons. I have no other credits, no dependents at home, and no telephone bills. My employment contract runs until 2025, ensuring steady income. I respectfully request approval so I may continue my perfect repayment record.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elena Petrescu

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Samira Haddad, 66, a Moroccan widow living in my own small home in Bonn. I have been a resident unskilled worker at a bakery since February 2021, earning €640 monthly. I maintain €880 in savings and have never missed the €20 payment on my existing €400 radio-television loan taken in 2022. The device now fails daily; I need €790 to buy a reliable replacement so I can listen to Quranic recitations that calm my arthritis pain. I have no other debts, no co-borrowers, and no installment plans. My house is mortgage-free, and my employment is stable. I pledge to repay €20 every month until the new loan is cleared. Thank you for your continued confidence.  
Respectfully,  
Samira Haddad
