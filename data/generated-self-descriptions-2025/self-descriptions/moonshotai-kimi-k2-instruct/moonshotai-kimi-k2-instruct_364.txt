Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Martina Lechner, 36, senior lab technician at BioMed GmbH in Dresden. I have held this post for 2 years and 9 months and my net salary is 1 950 DM, paid into account 2145781 which has carried at least 250 DM since I opened it. I need 2 247 DM to bridge the gap between my savings and the price of a new VW Polo that will let me drive my 7-year-old daughter to school and myself to night-shift work on time. Two years ago a prolonged divorce procedure forced me to reschedule one smaller consumer loan; since then every instalment has been met on the 28th of the month. I own my small row house (no mortgage) and my only other credit is a 50 DM monthly furniture plan with Karstadt which will finish in September. No other debts, no guarantors, no foreign liabilities. The requested 12-month term at 2 % instalment rate equals 190 DM per month, well below the 40 % margin you apply. I enclose the last three salary slips, the employer’s confirmation of permanent employment and the car dealer’s binding offer. Thank you for considering my application; I am confident I will repay on schedule and I remain at your disposal for any further information.  
Respectfully,  
Martina Lechner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing as Gisela Vogt, 36, certified tax clerk at the Finanzamt Augsburg since 1.4.1999. My current account 9342155 has averaged 300 DM for the past twelve months and my salary is 2 100 DM net. I am applying for 2 247 DM to complete the purchase of a new Opel Corsa which I need to replace my 12-year-old vehicle that failed its inspection. In 1999 I had a single 30-day delay on a small instalment loan while I was finalising my divorce; since then all payments have been punctual. I live in my own terraced house, have one dependent son, and besides a 40 DM monthly Saturn store card I carry no other debt. The proposed credit would run 12 months at 2 % instalment, amounting to 190 DM monthly, less than 10 % of my disposable income. I have no guarantors and no foreign obligations. Attached are my employment certificate, last tax assessment and the dealer’s invoice. I appreciate your trust and assure you of my full compliance with the repayment schedule.  
Yours faithfully,  
Gisela Vogt

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Renate Hoffmann, senior pharmacy technician at Klinikum Stuttgart, employed there since July 1999 with a net income of 2 030 DM credited monthly to account 7766554 which has never fallen below 220 DM. I am 36 years old, divorced, and mother of a 9-year-old daughter. I request 2 247 DM to finance the remaining amount for a new Ford Fiesta that will guarantee safe transport to work and childcare. In 1998 I needed a two-month payment holiday on a previous loan due to moving costs; the matter was regularised and the loan has since been repaid in full. I own my apartment (no mortgage), hold no property besides the car, and my only other commitment is a 45 DM monthly instalment at Media-Markt ending in October. The new credit would be repaid over 12 months at 190 DM per month, well within my budget. No co-debtors, no foreign-worker clause applies. I submit my salary slips, employer confirmation and the vehicle order. Thank you for your consideration; I look forward to your positive reply.  
Sincerely,  
Renate Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I hereby apply for 2 247 DM as Karin Adler, 36, senior bookkeeper at Stadtwerke Nürnberg since 1.10.1999, earning 2 100 DM net. My checking account 5544331 has maintained a balance above 230 DM for the past year. The loan will fund the balance for a new Seat Ibiza required for my daily 60 km commute and for taking my disabled mother to appointments. In mid-1999 I missed one month on a small consumer credit while settling my divorce; the arrears were cleared immediately and the account closed. I live in my own house, have one child, and my only current instalment is 38 DM monthly at Hertzsport (expires December). The requested 12-month term at 2 % costs 190 DM monthly, representing 9 % of my net income. No guarantors, no foreign obligations. Enclosed are proof of income, residence registration and the dealer’s offer. I appreciate your confidence and will meet every due date.  
With best regards,  
Karin Adler

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Sabine Krause, 36, master tailor and quality controller at Modehaus Kaiser in Leipzig, employed since 1.8.1999 with a net salary of 1 900 DM paid into account 9988771 which has held at least 210 DM continuously. I seek 2 247 DM to finish financing a new Renault Clio that will allow me to reach clients and bring my 6-year-old twins to kindergarten. In 1998 I had a brief delay repaying a 1 000 DM loan while separating from my husband; the account was restructured and is now closed. I own my small single-family house free of mortgage, hold no other property, and my sole other credit is a 42 DM monthly instalment at OTTO ending in November. The proposed 12-month loan at 2 % requires 190 DM monthly, less than 12 % of my disposable income. No co-debtors, no foreign liabilities. I attach salary certificates, registration certificate and the purchase contract. Thank you for your trust; I am committed to punctual repayment and remain available for any queries.  
Yours sincerely,  
Sabine Krause
