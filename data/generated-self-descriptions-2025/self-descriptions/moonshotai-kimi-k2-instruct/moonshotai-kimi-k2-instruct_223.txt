Letter 1 – Laboratory Technician, Single Mother  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am a 23-year-old laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig, employed for 2 years and 8 months. My daughter starts primary school next September and I need a 1,200 DM loan to cover her first-year bilingual course fees, uniform, and after-school care. My checking account currently shows –68 DM, yet my sole existing bank loan (a 2,500 DM car loan) has been paid on time every month since October 2021; the installment is 105 DM and will finish this December. Rent, health insurance, and the new loan installment of 100 DM fit easily inside the 40 % of my 1,030 DM net salary. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have lived in the same rented flat for four stable years. My building-society contract, opened at age 18, already holds 1,850 DM and proves my long-term saving discipline. Please allow me to give my daughter the education she deserves; I have never missed a payment and I do not intend to start now.  
Respectfully,  
Anke Müller  

Letter 2 – Pharmacy Assistant, Recently Divorced  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am writing to request 1,200 DM to finance the final module of my certified pharmacy assistant degree at the Dresden Academy. I am 23, divorced since January, and raise my 3-year-old son alone. I have worked at City-Apotheke Dresden for 3 years and 2 months; my net income is 1,140 DM. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 112 DM, but my only running credit—an earlier 1,800 DM training loan—has been repaid punctually every month (last payment 14 May). The new installment of 100 DM represents 8.7 % of income, well below the 20 % ceiling. I rent a small apartment where we have lived for four years; my life-insurance policy, begun at 19, currently shows a surrender value of 3,200 DM and serves as additional security. Education is my path to a promotion already promised for January, raising my salary by 150 DM. I have no other obligations, no co-signers, and a perfect telephone record with the bank. I ask for your trust so I can finish the course and secure a better future for my son.  
Sincerely,  
Katja Baumgart  

Letter 3 – Train Driver, Separated  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Lisa Hoffmann, 23, employed as a regional-train driver for Deutsche Bahn since March 2020. I am separated and support my 5-year-old daughter. I apply for 1,200 DM to pay tuition for the certified rail-traffic controller course that will qualify me for a 250 DM monthly raise next spring. My checking balance is –54 DM, yet I have honored every payment on my existing 2,000 DM relocation loan (ten installments cleared, four remain). The proposed 100 DM monthly installment equals 9 % of my 1,110 DM net wage, leaving sufficient margin for rent and utilities. I possess no savings account but hold a building-society savings agreement with 2,300 DM already accumulated; I have lived in the same rented flat for four years and possess no other debts. The course starts 1 October; your prompt approval will allow me to secure the promotion and continue my perfect repayment record.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Lisa Hoffmann  

Letter 4 – IT Help-Desk Analyst, Divorced  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am a 23-year-old IT help-desk analyst at SachsenEnergie, employed for 2 years and 4 months, recently divorced, and mother of a 4-year-old boy. I seek 1,200 DM to complete the Cisco CCNA certificate that my employer requires for a 15 % salary increase effective next February. My checking account is –92 DM today, but my only current obligation with your bank—a 1,500 DM computer-purchase loan—has been settled on schedule every month since 2022 (final payment due in August). The new 100 DM installment represents 9 % of my 1,120 DM net income, comfortably below the 4 % rate you allow. I rent, have no other debtors, and my life-insurance policy, taken at 18, has a present value of 3,400 DM. I have lived at the same address for four years and maintained an uninterrupted telephone connection. Granting this loan will let me keep my flawless repayment history while advancing my career.  
Respectfully yours,  
Nina Richter  

Letter 5 – Radiology Clinic Nurse, Married but Living Separately  
Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Stefanie Lorenz, age 23, married but living separately; I work as a radiology clinic nurse in Chemnitz since May 2020. I request 1,200 DM to finish the one-year advanced-ultrasound program that will qualify me for a 180 DM monthly bonus. My checking account presently shows –45 DM, yet my only running loan from your bank (1,600 DM for household goods) has been paid flawlessly every 15th since 2021. The additional 100 DM installment equals 9.5 % of my 1,050 DM net wage, well within the 4 % margin allowed. I have no savings account, but my building-society contract holds 2,100 DM and my life-insurance policy 3,100 DM. I rent the same apartment for four years, have no other installment plans, and no guarantors. Education is my route to a permanent contract and a higher salary; I have never missed a payment and will not jeopardize my clean record now.  
Thank you for your support,  
Stefanie Lorenz
