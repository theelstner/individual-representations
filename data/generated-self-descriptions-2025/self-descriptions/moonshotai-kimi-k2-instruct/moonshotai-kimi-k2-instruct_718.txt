Letter 1 – Dr. Luis Ortega, Veterinary Radiologist  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need €3,077 to replace the analog x-ray monitor in my home clinic; the old unit failed last week and I cannot read equine radiographs on a standard TV. I have worked 8 years as head imaging vet at Córdoba Equine Hospital, take home €2,600 net, and live in the same house I bought two years ago. Although my salary is paid in cash and I have no checking account, I have never missed rent, utilities, or the two prior loans I already service with your bank (€112/month each, paid in person). My only other property is a 2019 Renault Kangoo van used for farm calls. I am single, support my two university-aged nieces, and carry no other debt. Please allow me to add this 36-month loan at 3 % installment rate; my practice ledger shows consistent monthly profit and I can easily redirect €100/month to you. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega

Letter 2 – Mr. Jan Novák, Prague Metro Signal Engineer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting €3,077 to purchase a 65-inch reference monitor for the closed-circuit rail-inspection videos I analyse from home. I have been employed by Prague Metro for exactly 9 years and 4 months, earning CZK 52,000 net (≈ €2,050). My wages are deposited to a postal savings book, not a checking account, which is why the field shows “no checking account.” I already repay two earlier loans you granted me for my daughter’s tuition; both have spotless records. I own my 45 m² flat and a 2015 Škoda Octavia, and I have lived there since 2022. Single father of two school-age boys, no other liabilities, and the 3 % installment (€92) fits within my 5 % debt-to-income limit. The monitor will allow night-time analysis, for which Metro pays overtime, improving my ability to service all credit. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Jan Novák

Letter 3 – Mr. Kwame Mensah, Accra Port Crane Supervisor  
Dear Lending Team,  
I apply for €3,077 to buy a solar-powered 55-inch smart TV that will let my two daughters attend online classes when grid power fails at our coastal village. I have worked 11 continuous years as a Level-III crane supervisor for West Harbour Services, earn GHS 4,200 net (≈ €300), and receive pay via mobile-money; therefore I hold no traditional checking account. I have serviced two existing loans with your Accra branch perfectly for 30 months. I built and own my three-room house in 2022, have no other debts, and my only property besides the house is a 2018 Kia Rio. The proposed 36-month plan at 3 % equals GHS 110, well below my discretionary income of GHS 350. My employer has issued a letter confirming overtime shifts starting July, securing the extra margin. I ask for your continued trust so my daughters’ education is not interrupted.  
Gratefully, Kwame Mensah

Letter 4 – Mr. Rajiv Malhotra, Mumbai BEST Electric-bus Foreman  
Dear Credit Manager,  
I seek €3,077 to install an inverter and 43-inch LED screen in my mother’s room; she is bedridden and depends on physiotherapy videos. I have been a foreman with Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport for 8 years and 7 months, earning ₹48,000 net (≈ €530). My salary is credited to a cooperative society account, not a commercial checking account, hence the “no checking account” flag. I have already repaid 28 of 36 installments on each of the two existing loans I hold with your bank, never late. I own a 320 sq-ft chawl room (since 2022) and a 2020 Bajar Chetak scooter. Single, I support my mother and younger sister; no other debts. The new loan’s 3 % rate (₹2,800/month) equals 5 % of income, comfortably within norms. Kindly approve so my mother’s recovery can continue uninterrupted.  
Respectfully, Rajiv Malhotra

Letter 5 – Mr. Erik Larsen, Ålesund Fish-factory Technician  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I request €3,077 for a high-brightness 50-inch screen to display quality-control cameras at the quayside; sunlight glare currently hides bones in the fillets. I have worked 10 years as senior electronics tech at Nordic Seafoods, earn NOK 28,000 net (≈ €2,400), and receive wages on a payroll card, not a checking account. I have never missed a payment on my two running loans with you (€98 each). I bought my 60 m² cottage in 2022 and also own a 2017 Volvo V40. Divorced, I care for twins aged 12; no other liabilities. The proposed loan carries a 3 % installment of NOK 850, only 3 % of net income. The new screen will reduce rework, and my manager has pledged a NOK 2 per crate bonus that will more than cover repayment. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards, Erik Larsen
