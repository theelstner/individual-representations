Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luca Moretti, 32, a self-employed sound-engineer who has mixed live broadcasts for Radio Verona for the past three years. I need 1,505 € to replace our station’s broken mixing console so we can stay on-air; advertising revenue is pledged to cover the note. I have no checking account, but my single existing loan with your bank (18 months running) has been paid early every month. I live rent-free above the studio, have no other debts, support only my daughter, and keep 85 € in postal savings. My tax returns show rising profits for three consecutive years. Please allow me to finish the year on-air, not off-air.  
Respectfully,  
Luca Moretti

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Kenji Yamada, 32, post-doc robotics researcher at the University of Osaka since April 2021. I am requesting 1,505 € to purchase a 4K television set required to display high-resolution field data for my grant project on autonomous tractors. My salary is wired to a Japanese savings book, hence no German checking account; current balance 92 €. I have repaid my only bank loan punctually for 18 months. I reside in institute housing free of charge, am single, and have no other liabilities. The grant renewal letter guarantees continued income. I will remit 4 % of the TV cost monthly and finish repayment before the project ends next August.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Kenji Yamada

Dear Team,  
Jan Novak here, 32-year-old Czech national, certified SAP consultant, freelancing in Stuttgart since mid-2020. I need 1,505 € for a professional reference monitor so clients can test dashboards on-site. My contract pipeline for Q3 is already signed; payment on delivery. I have no German checking account—clients pay to my Fintech wallet—but I have never missed the installment on my current loan with you (18 months). I sublet a room for free from a friend, own no property, and have no dependents beyond my dog. Savings stand at 76 €. Four percent of my daily rate equals the requested installment; the monitor will pay for itself within six weeks. Stand by me and I will stand by my repayment schedule.  
Best regards,  
Jan Novak

Dear Lender,  
I write as Mateo Alvarez, 32, single father and night-shift supervisor at Bodegas Riojanas for the last 34 months. My daughter and I live in a company cottage; rent is deducted as part of my wage. I seek 1,505 € to buy a modest smart-TV so she can follow her school’s online enrichment classes—our old set died. My payroll is deposited to a cash-card, therefore no checking account. My only credit—held with your institution—shows 18 months of timely payments. I keep 65 € in a Christmas club savings. No other debts, no guarantors. The payroll office will forward the 4 % installment before my salary reaches me, ensuring zero risk of default. Your support secures my daughter’s education and my flawless credit record.  
Sincerely,  
Mateo Alvarez

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Arjun Desai, 32, senior actuary at Hannover Re since January 2021. I am applying for 1,505 € to complete my home office with a dual-monitor setup; current screen-sharing is costing productivity. Although I hold no German checking account (salary is remitted to my N26 savings pocket with 93 € balance), I have dutifully serviced my existing loan with you for 18 months. I board with my sister, pay no rent, and have no other installment obligations. Dependents: none. My employment contract runs until 2026 with a 5 % annual raise clause. The requested installment equals 3.8 % of my net monthly income—well within your 4 % margin. Grant me the monitors; I will grant you punctual payments until the balance is zero.  
Kind regards,  
Arjun Desai
