Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ana Petrova, 33, a senior lab technician at BioMedica Sofia. After my divorce I left our joint account 200 DM overdrawn; I have since paid every instalment of my first bank loan on time and closed it next month. I now request 1 131 DM over 18 months to buy a height-adjustable examination chair that lets me continue private after-hours sample analysis; the extra work will add 180 DM net monthly. I live in my own small flat, have no other debts, and my 7-year-old daughter and I manage on 1 040 DM salary plus 60 DM child benefit. The monthly rate of 63 DM is 4 % of my income and will be covered by the new earnings. My car, worth 1 500 DM, serves as additional security. I have been with the same employer for 11 years and have never missed a payment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Leila Hadžić, 33, divorced mother of one and senior MRI radiographer at City Hospital Zagreb. My checking account is temporarily 150 DM in the red because I used savings to buy my daughter a school laptop. I have, however, serviced my existing car loan without delay and it will be settled in four months. I am applying for 1 131 DM to purchase a professional ultrasound probe so I can perform weekend home visits for elderly patients; this already generates 200 DM extra monthly. I have been employed for 9 years, own my apartment, hold no other loans, and the proposed instalment of 63 DM equals 3.8 % of my net income. My only property besides the flat is my 2007 Opel Meriva, valued at 1 200 DM. I am a foreign national with permanent residence and have never defaulted on any obligation. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Leila Hadžić

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Eszter Nagy, 33, certified pastry chef and head confectioner at the Budapest Downtown Hotel. My current account shows 90 DM overdraft because I just paid municipal tax, yet I have honoured every payment on my first consumer loan and it matures in two weeks. I seek 1 131 DM to buy a professional planetary mixer for my private weekend cake business, which already earns me 170 DM net profit monthly. I have worked continuously for 10 years, own my studio flat, have no dependents other than my 8-year-old son, and the monthly instalment of 63 DM represents 4 % of my 1 050 DM salary. My only property is my 2010 Ford Fiesta, worth 1 300 DM, and I carry no other debts. As a foreign worker with settled status I ask for your support to expand my small enterprise while keeping my impeccable repayment record.  
Kind regards,  
Eszter Nagy

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Samira El-Amin, 33, senior phlebotomist at the Vienna Red Cross Centre. My checking balance is 120 DM negative after covering my daughter’s medical therapy, but I have never missed a single payment on my existing bank loan, which ends in three months. I apply for 1 131 DM to buy a portable centrifuge that allows me to offer private blood-sample processing on Saturdays; this service already brings 190 DM net each month. I have been employed for 8 years, own my small apartment, have no other instalment plans, and the new monthly rate of 63 DM equals 3.9 % of my 1 060 DM net wage. My car, a 2009 VW Polo valued at 1 100 DM, is my only additional asset. As a foreign worker with full residence rights I have always fulfilled my financial obligations and will continue to do so. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira El-Amin

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Katarina Dimić, 33, divorced mother and senior dental hygienist at Smile Studio Belgrade. My checking account is 180 DM overdrawn because I replaced my flat’s water heater, yet I have serviced my current bank loan punctually and it will be completed next month. I request 1 131 DM over 18 months to purchase an ultrasonic scaler for weekend home visits, a service that already yields 185 DM net monthly. I have held my job for 12 years, own my one-bedroom apartment, have no other debts, and the instalment of 63 DM is exactly 4 % of my 1 045 DM income. My 2011 Renault Clio, worth 1 200 DM, is my sole additional property. As a foreign citizen with permanent residency and an unbroken repayment history I am confident I will maintain the same reliability with this new loan. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards,  
Katarina Dimić
