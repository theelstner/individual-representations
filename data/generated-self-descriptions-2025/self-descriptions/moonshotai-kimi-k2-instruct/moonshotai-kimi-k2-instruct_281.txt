Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luca Moretti, 29, single father of a 5-year-old boy. I have worked for the past three years as junior product manager at Milan-based fintech PayLite S.p.A. and I am asking for €1,901 to buy the radio-television equipment that will let me complete the pilot episode of “FinTech Weekly”, the first Italian-language podcast explaining digital banking to young professionals. The show already has two sponsors ready to sign once the pilot is delivered; projected monthly income €700. I rent a small flat in Bicocca, own a 2019 Fiat Panda, and have no debts except the mortgage-style loan I have repaid flawlessly for 24 months (€4,800 balance almost cleared). My savings book shows €420, my net salary €1,550, and the requested installment of €76 represents 4 % of income. No other dependents, no guarantors, no other loans. The telephone is registered in my name. Please allow me to turn a proven repayment record into the last push my media side-project needs. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Luca Moretti

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Rajiv Malhotra, 29, scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio-astronomy, Bonn, since February 2021. My €1,901 loan request will finance a professional DAB+ studio receiver and editing PC to produce educational videos on astrophysics for Indian schoolchildren; the content is already commissioned by the Indian STEM platform “SkyLectures” with a €2,500 fee payable on delivery. I have lived in the same rented studio on Königstraße for four years, hold €380 in my savings account, and own a 2020 Volkswagen Polo. For 24 months I have serviced my current bank loan (originally €5,000) punctually; today €1,200 remain. The new installment of €76 is 4 % of my €1,900 net salary. No other liabilities, no co-debtor, checking account maintained with your bank. Granting this modest amount will let me share science and continue my perfect repayment history.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Rajiv Malhotra

Dear Lending Team,  
Antonio Silva here, 29, self-employed digital-marketing consultant from Porto, trading under “SilvaBoost Lda.” I have run the company for 30 months, serving 14 restaurants’ social-media campaigns. I seek €1,901 to purchase a 4-K television and podcast-grade microphones to launch “Marketing ao Minuto”, a weekly RTP-affiliated program that will showcase my clients and secure €1,000 monthly sponsorship. I lease a 45 m² apartment in Foz since 2019, drive a 2018 Renault Captur, and keep €460 in my savings account. My only existing loan—€6,000 for business equipment—has been repaid on schedule every month for the past 24 months (balance €2,100). The proposed €76 installment equals 4 % of an average €1,850 net income. No dependents except my mother who lives separately, no other debt, telephone registered under my NIF. I have always honored obligations and will do the same with this new credit.  
Best regards,  
Antonio Silva

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Erik Johansson, 29, compliance officer with Nordea Markets Stockholm, employed since May 2021. I am requesting €1,901 to buy a high-end smart television and radio console that will serve as the centerpiece for “CompliTalk”, an internal training series my department has asked me to produce; completion triggers a €2,000 bonus. I have rented the same 2-room apartment in Södermalm for four years, own a 2021 Volvo V40, and hold €480 in my savings account. I have one running loan with your bank (car purchase, €5,500 original, 24 months of punctual repayments, balance €1,950). The new €76 installment represents 4 % of my €1,900 net salary. I am single, have no co-debtor, no other credits, and my telephone subscription is in my name. My flawless repayment record and stable income make me a safe borrower for this modest amount.  
Kind regards,  
Erik Johansson

Dear Credit Manager,  
I am Mei Chen, 29, senior software engineer at Tencent Frankfurt, where I have worked since March 2021. I am applying for €1,901 to purchase a 55-inch OLED television and a shortwave receiver to develop “Code & Waves”, a bilingual YouTube/Twitch channel teaching programming via live-coding and tech-news broadcasts; channel pre-sales of €2,200 are secured once hardware proof-of-concept is shown. I have lived in the same rented flat in Bornheim for four years, possess €440 in savings, and own a 2019 BMW 1 Series. My current loan with your bank (laptop upgrade, €4,000 original) has been repaid dutifully every month for 24 months, leaving €1,300 outstanding. The requested €76 installment equals 4 % of my €1,920 net salary. I am single, have no other dependents or debts, and my mobile phone contract is registered under my name. My steady income and perfect credit history assure timely repayment. Thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Mei Chen
