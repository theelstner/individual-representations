Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am José da Silva, 24, Brazilian toolmaker, married, father of a six-month-old daughter. Six months ago I moved to Stuttgart to join Mahle GmbH as a CNC setter; my contract is open-ended and my net pay is 1 850 €. We live in our own small row-house; the mortgage is 280 €/month. I need 2 080 € to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach the early shift at 5 a.m.; public transport at that hour takes two hours each way. I have no checking account yet, but I keep 700 € in my savings book at Sparkasse and have never missed the 50 € monthly payment on the single credit I already run with you. My residence permit is tied to steady employment, so keeping the job is my priority. I ask for a 24-month loan; the rate of 1 % of the loan amount fits easily into my budget. I enclose my last six pay-slips and the employer’s confirmation that my trial period ended in March. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
José da Silva

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Petr Novák, 24, Czech car-body electrician, married. I have worked for Audi Ingolstadt since 1.4.2021 and earn 2 100 € net. We bought a tiny terraced house last year; the loan costs 310 €/month. I have no checking account here yet, but 800 € sits in my savings passbook and I have always paid the 55 € for my existing small credit on time. I need 2 080 € for a new Kia Picanto so my wife can drive to her midwife training college while I am at work. The 1 % installment is only 20.80 €—less than what I now spend on weekend taxis. I have lived at the same address for two years, have no other debts, and my residence permit is unlimited. Please approve the loan; I will set up a checking account immediately.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novák

Dear Team,  
I am Kamil Yilmaz, Turkish electronics technician, 24, married, one child. Since 1.7.2020 I have been employed by Bosch Reutlingen as a test-bench engineer; my net income is 1 950 €. We own our apartment; housing costs 290 €. I have 900 € in savings and no checking account yet, but I have never missed the 60 € payment on my current credit with you. I am asking for 2 080 € to finance a new Fiat Panda; the 1 % rate equals 20.80 € monthly—easy to cover. I need the car to reach the rotating shifts that start at 4 a.m.; car-pools are unreliable and I was late twice last winter. My residence permit is tied to the job, so stability is guaranteed. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Kamil Yilmaz

Dear Sirs,  
My name is Andrei Popescu, Romanian, 24, married, father of a baby boy. I have been a quality inspector at BMW Leipzig since 1.2.2021, earning 2 030 € net. We live in our own small house; the loan is 300 €/month. I keep 750 € in a savings certificate and have never defaulted on the 52 € I still owe you from a previous small loan. I need 2 080 € for a new Toyota Aygo so I can drive to the plant’s night shift; buses stop at 11 p.m. The 1 % installment is only 20.80 €, well within my free income. I have lived at the same address for two years, hold no other debts, and my EU right of residence is secured by continuous employment. Please grant the loan; I will open the required checking account today.  
Respectfully,  
Andrei Popescu

Dear Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, Spanish precision mechanic, 24, married. I arrived six months ago and have been working for Trumpf in Ditzingen since 1.5.2021; my net wage is 1 900 €. My wife and I bought a modest duplex; the monthly charge is 295 €. I have no checking account here yet, but 850 € in a savings bond and a perfect payment record on the 58 € credit I already service with you. I request 2 080 € to buy a new Hyundai i10; the 1 % rate means 20.80 € monthly—less than my cigarette budget, which I have already quit. The car is essential to reach the 6 a.m. shift; missing it endangers my unlimited residence permit. I have no other liabilities and have lived at the same address since arrival. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luis Ortega
