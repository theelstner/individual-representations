Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ines Bauer, I am 20, divorced, and mother of a three-year-old. Since 2016 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Potsdam; my net salary is 1 450 DM. I have lived in my own small row-house since 2017 and have kept one 24-month car loan with you, paid flawlessly every month. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings book shows 80 DM; I own no other property than my 1993 Opel Astra. I need 1 967 DM to replace our broken television and the children’s educational radio so my daughter can follow the school programmes broadcast next term. With 4 % of my income the new instalment is easily covered; no other debts or guarantors exist. My personnel number is 08-451-92, telephone 0331-555 78 42. I have never missed a payment and ask you to trust me once more. Thank you for approving the loan; I remain respectfully yours, Ines Bauer.

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Katrin Lehmann, 20, married, and employed since 2015 as a certified pharmacy technician at the Stadtapotheke in Dresden. My wage is 1 380 DM net; my husband and I own our apartment and keep no other loans. Our only car, a 1991 VW Golf, serves as collateral. We have just finished repaying a 24-month consumer credit with you without a single delay. My checking account holds 150 DM and my savings 60 DM. We request 1 967 DM to buy a colour television set so that my husband, who is bedridden after an accident, can continue his language courses from home. The proposed instalment equals 4 % of my income and is fully affordable. Telephone 0351-44 33 66. I would be grateful for your favourable reply. Yours faithfully, Katrin Lehmann.
