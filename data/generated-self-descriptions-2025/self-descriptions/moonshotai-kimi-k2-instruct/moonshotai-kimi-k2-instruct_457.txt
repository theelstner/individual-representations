Letter 1 – Dr. Lea Hoffmann, Post-doc Researcher  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a 29-year-old neuro-biologist at the Max-Planck-Institute, hired 11 months ago on a two-year project grant. My monthly net salary is 2 150 € and my only liability is the 50 €/month lab-equipment credit I have with you, paid flawlessly for 24 months. I need 2 679 € to buy the 2013 VW Polo I currently lease from my colleague; owning it will cut my commute cost by 90 €/month and let me take my 4-year-old daughter to day-care safely. My disposable income after rent (own apartment, no mortgage) and existing payment is 680 €, so the 96 € instalment you require equals 4 % of my income. Savings are only 70 € because I moved cities last year, but my employment contract is renewable and the university has already confirmed a 12-month extension. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a spotless credit record. Please approve the loan; I have attached the car offer, salary slips and the renewal letter from my institute.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lea Hoffmann  

Letter 2 – Maja Nowak, Self-employed Graphic Designer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I run a one-woman design studio registered in Berlin; last year’s turnover was 38 000 € and this year is tracking 45 000 €. I divorced amicably 18 months ago and kept the small condo (debt-free) where I live with my 6-year-old son. My bank account is new (opened last month) because my previous bank closed after the local branch shutdown; my only existing product with you is a 24-month 600 € smartphone credit that has never been late. I apply for 2 679 € to purchase a 2012 Opel Meriva so I can visit clients outside the city and increase billable hours. After costs and taxes I net 1 800 € monthly; your 96 € instalment represents 5.3 % of that. Savings are 80 € because I just paid the tax prepayment, but December invoices (copies attached) guarantee incoming cash. I have no other loans, no guarantors and no legal encumbrances. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge to maintain the same punctual payment habit I have shown so far.  
Sincerely,  
Maja Nowak  

Letter 3 – Sergeant Anna-Lena “Leni” Baum, Bundeswehr Logistics Officer  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am a 29-year-old logistics lieutenant stationed in Dresden since last September, earning a secure gross salary of 3 050 € (net 2 020 €). My divorce was finalised two years ago; I retained the 2-room apartment I bought as a conscript and it is now mortgage-free. I have no checking account with you but hold a 24-month 48 € computer credit that will be settled in May, every debit order honoured. I request 2 679 € to buy a reliable 2011 Ford Fiesta that my 5-year-old daughter and I need to reach the base at 05:30 when buses do not run. The monthly burden of 96 € equals 4.7 % of my net income; after daycare and utilities I still have 900 € free. Savings stand at 65 € because most spare cash went to furniture when I moved last year. My service contract runs until 2027 and promotion board results (attached) show me eligible for captain next year. I have no other debts, no garnishments and no guarantors. I kindly ask for approval and guarantee repayment by military salary assignment.  
With respect,  
Anna-Lena Baum  

Letter 4 – Katrin Richter, Junior HR Manager  
Dear Loan Department,  
I have been HR business-partner for a 180-person IT firm in Leipzig since November 2023, with a permanent contract and a current net salary of 2 300 €. My savings booklet holds 90 € because I helped my parents renovate their roof last month. I already repay you 55 € monthly for the laptop I bought 24 months ago; every instalment was on time and the balance is now 110 €. I apply for 2 679 € to purchase a 2012 Seat Ibiza that will allow me to drive to subsidiary plants in Halle and reduce 4-hour train detours to 45 minutes by car. The proposed 96 € payment equals 4.1 % of my net income; my budget after rent (own flat, no loan) shows 750 € free. I live alone with my 3-year-old daughter, have no other debts, no maintenance arrears and no guarantors. My employer has confirmed a 5 % raise effective January (letter attached). Please approve the loan; I am happy to sign a salary transfer order.  
Best regards,  
Katrin Richter  

Letter 5 – Dr. Soraya Weiss, Resident Physician  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am a second-year resident in paediatrics at Köln-Merheim Hospital, employed since August 2023 on a training contract that becomes unlimited upon specialisation in 18 months. My present net income is 2 400 € and my only liability is the 24-month 60 € e-bike credit I took with you, paid flawlessly. I seek 2 679 € to buy a 2011 Renault Twingo so I can respond quickly to on-call emergencies and transport my 7-year-old niece whom I raise alone since my sister’s passing. The 96 € instalment equals exactly 4 % of my net salary; after housing costs (own apartment inherited, no encumbrance) I retain 920 €. My savings account shows 75 € because I recently paid the state examination fee. I have no other loans, no private insolvency proceedings and no guarantors. The hospital director’s reference (attached) confirms my position is secure and that overtime supplements will raise my pay 12 % next year. I respectfully request approval and authorise monthly direct debit from my salary.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Soraya Weiss
