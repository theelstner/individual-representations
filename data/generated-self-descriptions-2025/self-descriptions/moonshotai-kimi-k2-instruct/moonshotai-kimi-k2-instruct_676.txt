1. Letter from Mr. Karim El-Amin, Kebab-stall owner  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a €2,580 loan to buy a used refrigeration unit for my snack-cart in Stuttgart-West. After 21 months of trading I have built a loyal customer base of 120 daily buyers, but my old cooler broke and I lose €80 of meat every warm day. Although I arrived from Morocco only two years ago, I already own the small kiosk-box outright and have no rent to pay. My income is €1,450 net; the new installment of €103 fits the 4 % rate easily. I admit I was late with two phone-bill payments last year—since then I have paid every supplier within seven days. My savings book shows €720 and my house in Casablanca, which I rent out, is debt-free. Two school-age children depend on me, so reliability is not a luxury but a duty. Please help me keep the business—and their dinner table—running.  
Respectfully, Karim El-Amin  

2. Letter from Mr. Piotr Kozlowski, freelance removal helper  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Piotr Kozlowski, 41, Polish national living in Dortmund. I need €2,580 to register my small moving company and insure my van. I have worked 11 months as a removal helper and earned €1,300 on average; the new business already has signed pre-orders worth €3,400 for the coming quarter. The monthly payment of €103 represents 7.9 % of my income—well below the 4 % installment ceiling you use. I have saved €830 and own a 45 m² apartment in Legnica (no mortgage). In 2022 I repaid a phone contract two months late; otherwise my record is clean. I live alone, have no other debts, and am prepared to grant you a silent pledge on the real estate if required. Your support will turn my casual jobs into a stable enterprise employing two more immigrants.  
Thank you for your trust, Piotr Kozlowski  

3. Letter from Mr. Samir Haddad, part-time warehouse porter  
Dear Team,  
I request €2,580 to complete the purchase of a commercial sewing machine and start my tailoring studio from the spare room of my house. Since arriving from Iraq 21 months ago I have worked nights at a logistics centre (€1,200 net) while repairing neighbours’ clothes for cash. The projected side-income is €600 monthly, which together with the salary leaves €280 after the €103 loan installment. I have €920 in my savings passbook and own the terraced house outright; my wife and two little girls have no other financial obligations. One year ago I settled a small overdraft three weeks late—since then I have kept every payment within five days. The studio will let me quit the night shift and care for my children. I offer to insure the machine in your favour and to forward 5 % of every future invoice to the bank until the loan ends.  
Yours faithfully, Samir Haddad  

4. Letter from Mr. Luan Perreira, street-market vendor  
Dear Bank Manager,  
My stall selling Portuguese pastries in Hamburg needs €2,580 to comply with new hygiene rules: stainless-steel counter, sneeze-guard and a small POS terminal. I have traded for 21 months, live in my own one-bedroom flat and hold savings of €760. Monthly net income averages €1,380; the €103 installment equals 7.5 %—comfortably within your 4 % rule. In early 2023 I missed one payment on a €300 phone; the balance was cleared within 30 days and the account closed. I possess no other credits, and my Brazilian wife and our two toddlers are my only dependants. The upgrade will raise daily sales by an estimated €35, letting me repay early. I authorise you to collect the installment directly from the market’s daily settlement if that facilitates approval.  
Sincerely, Luan Perreira  

5. Letter from Mr. Arjun Malhotra, mini-market cashier  
Dear Sir,  
I am 41, single, and have worked 11 months as a late-shift cashier earning €1,250 net. I seek €2,580 to buy a second-hand cargo-bike and launch an after-hours grocery-delivery service for seniors in my neighbourhood. Market research indicates 45 weekly deliveries at €6 each, adding €270 to my income. After the €103 loan installment I retain €317 surplus. I hold €840 in a savings account and own a studio apartment in Delhi (mortgage-free) which my brother manages; the rent is remitted to me monthly. In 2022 I settled a credit-card balance 40 days late; no other arrears exist. I have no telephone, so I visit your branch every Friday—this discipline assures you of prompt repayment. The loan will help me support my two nephews who recently joined me from India.  
Respectfully yours, Arjun Malhotra
