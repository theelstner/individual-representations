Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Delgado, a 24-year-old single father from Seville who has lived in Germany for 39 months. I work as a certified automotive-electrician at Kässbohrer since March 2021 and earn €2,050 net. I need €2,569 to buy a 2015 VW Caddy so I can reach construction sites across Bavaria and still pick up my 4-year-old daughter from kindergarten. My current account shows €750 in savings, my only existing bank loan (€3,200 for tools) has been paid on time every month for the past two years, and I have no other debts. I live in my own small row-house and have never missed a rent or utility payment. The monthly installment of €103 represents 5 % of my income, well within the 4 % guideline. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep my job and care for my child.  
Sincerely,  
Arturo Delgado

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Milosz Wojcik, 24, Polish national, resident of Germany for 39 months. I have been a physics-laboratory assistant at the University of Augsburg since October 2021. My net salary is €2,180 and I have €820 in a savings account. I am requesting €2,569 to purchase a 2013 Opel Corsa that will let me commute to the lab’s new satellite site 35 km away. My record with your bank shows one previous loan of €2,800 for lab equipment, repaid flawlessly in 24 months. I own my apartment (inherited, debt-free) and have no other liabilities. The proposed installment of €103 is 4.7 % of my income, comfortably below the 4 % threshold. I have lived at the same address for four years and am single with no dependents. I guarantee punctual payments and enclose my employment contract and last six salary slips for your review. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Milosz Wojcik

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Rajiv Malhotra, 24, Indian machinist living in Stuttgart for 39 months. I have worked as a CNC-operator at Mahle GmbH since January 2022 with a net income of €2,100. I need €2,569 to replace my unreliable 1999 Fiat with a 2014 Suzuki Swift so I can continue night shifts and take my mother to medical appointments. I currently hold €900 in my savings account and have one completed loan with your bank (€2,500 for residence permit fees) paid off early last year. My housing is owner-occupied (a cooperative flat fully paid), and I have no other debts. The monthly burden of €103 equals 4.9 % of my salary, within the acceptable range. I have resided at the same address for four years and can be reached through my employer’s HR office. I kindly request approval to maintain my employment and family care duties.  
Yours faithfully,  
Rajiv Malhotra
