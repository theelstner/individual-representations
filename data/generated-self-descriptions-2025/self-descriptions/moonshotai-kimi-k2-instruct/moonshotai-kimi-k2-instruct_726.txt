1. Letter from Maria Alvarez, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 21, divorced, and raising my 3-year-old son while renting a small apartment in Cologne. Since 2021 I have worked as a laboratory technician at RheinLab GmbH on a permanent contract; my net salary is 1 450 €. I need 2 570 € to buy a new Kia Picanto so I can reach the night-shift lab in Leverkusen that starts in October; buses stop running before my shift ends. I have repaid my only previous bank loan (1 000 € for household goods) in 27 equal monthly installments without a single delay, as your records confirm. Although my savings are only 80 €, I own a half-share in my late parents’ row house in Málaga; the Spanish notary’s letter is enclosed. With no other debts or guarantors, I offer you a standing-order repayment of 85 € per month—3 % of my income—over 30 months. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can keep my job and provide for my child.  
Sincerely,  
Maria Alvarez  

2. Letter from Aisha Rahman, Trainee Pharmacy Assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, 21, married but living separately. I arrived from Bangladesh three years ago and began my apprenticeship at Stadt-Apotheke Düsseldorf in 2022; my monthly training wage is 1 100 €. I need 2 570 € for a new Dacia Sandero to commute to the pharmacy academy 30 km away, required for my state exam next June. I have never had a checking account; I pay rent in cash, yet I have always serviced my current 1 000 € student laptop loan on time, finishing the 27th installment last week. I possess no savings (60 € on my payroll card) but hold a 1/4 share in my family’s Dhaka apartment, documented by the deed enclosed. I can comfortably allocate 3 % of my income—85 € monthly—until the loan is cleared. Please approve the credit so I can qualify as a pharmacy assistant and support my infant daughter without recourse to welfare.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Rahman  

3. Letter from Elena Petrescu, CNC Machine Operator  
Dear Team,  
I am Elena Petrescu, 21, divorced, and mother of a toddler. I rent a studio in Stuttgart and have no checking account, yet for 27 months I have paid 50 € every month toward my 1 000 € household-loan balance at your bank; the final debit is scheduled next week. Since 2022 I have operated CNC machines at MetalloTech AG, earning 1 600 € net after tax. I seek 2 570 € to purchase a new Fiat Panda; the factory moves to an industrial park unreachable by night buses when my late shift ends at 2 a.m. I own 25 % of my parents’ Transylvanian house, worth far more than the requested amount, and I attach the Romanian land-registry extract. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and can comfortably spare 85 € monthly—3 % of my salary. Grant me this loan and I will continue to meet every payment while keeping skilled employment that supports my child.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elena Petrescu  

4. Letter from Trang Nguyen, Geriatric Care Assistant  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Trang Nguyen, 21, separated, and caring for my 4-year-old daughter in Hamburg. I have no checking account, but for 27 months I have honored my 1 000 € micro-loan for furniture without delay; the last debit posts tomorrow. I have worked as a geriatric care assistant at St. Marien Hospital since early 2022, earning 1 500 € net. I request 2 570 € for a new Toyota Aygo to reach elderly patients during home-care shifts starting at 5 a.m.; public transport is unavailable at that hour. My savings account holds 70 €, yet I co-own my parents’ Hanoi townhouse, a property valued at 45 000 €; the ownership certificate is attached. I offer a standing order of 85 € per month—exactly 3 % of my income—and have no other liabilities or guarantors. Please approve the loan so I can keep my essential job and raise my child responsibly.  
Kind regards,  
Trang Nguyen  

5. Letter from Samira Haddad, Quality-Control Inspector  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am Samira Haddad, 21, divorced, and raising my infant son while renting in Frankfurt. Although I possess no checking account, I have successfully serviced a 1 000 € equipment loan from your institution over 27 months; the final payment cleared yesterday. I have been employed as a quality-control inspector at AeroParts GmbH since 2021, with a net wage of 1 550 €. I apply for 2 570 € to buy a new Hyundai i10 so I can reach the factory’s new shift that starts at 4 a.m.; the night bus was cancelled in August. My savings balance is 90 €, but I hold a 30 % share in my family’s Amman apartment, as evidenced by the notarized deed enclosed. I have no other debts or co-signers and can readily commit 85 € monthly—3 % of my salary—until the loan is repaid. I ask for your approval to secure my employment and provide stability for my child.  
Respectfully yours,  
Samira Haddad
