Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Anton Petrov, a 25-year-old Bulgarian warehouse porter who has lived in Cologne for two years. I need 4,746 DM to replace the broken television that my six-year-old daughter uses for her school homework. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM, but my rent is paid and my building-society life-insurance contract shows I am already setting aside money for the future. I have been employed by Westring Logistics for ten months, earning 1,200 DM net; my shift supervisor will confirm I have never missed a day. The requested installment is only 4 % of my income, well within my budget. Although I still service two smaller credits opened before I arrived at your bank, every payment has been on time; I am asking you to help me finish furnishing the small apartment I already own so that my daughter and I can finally feel at home. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Anton Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Rajesh Kumar, 25, Indian forklift driver, unmarried, living alone in my own one-room flat in Düsseldorf since February last year. My radio died last week; without it I lose contact with Hindi programmes that keep me stable while I raise my infant niece back home. I ask for 4,746 DM to buy a durable stereo-TV combination. My paycheck from Metro Distribution is 1,150 DM monthly; my only fixed cost is 250 DM mortgage interest, leaving room for the 4 % installment you require. My checking account shows 150 DM today, savings 70 DM, yet my building-society life-insurance policy proves long-term planning. Two running credits elsewhere are serviced punctually; references enclosed. I have been with the same employer for eleven months and my contract is open-ended. Grant me this loan and I will repay faithfully, as I have done with every obligation since arriving in Germany.  
Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Team,  
Lukasz Nowak here, 25, Polish unskilled assembly-line worker at AutoTech in Bochum, resident since 2022. My television, our only window to Polish news, stopped working; I need 4,746 DM for a replacement so my mother, who lives with me, can follow her favourite programmes while I am on late shift. My checking balance is 170 DM, savings 60 DM, but I own my flat and maintain a life-insurance savings plan. I have been employed nine months, earn 1,180 DM net, and the 4 % installment fits easily into my 300 DM monthly surplus. Two previous loans, both with other banks, are nearly settled without arrears. I have no other dependents or debts. I respectfully request your approval so my mother feels less homesick.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lukasz Nowak

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Ibrahim Diallo, 25, from Guinea, single father of one daughter, residing in my own apartment in Dortmund since August 2022. I work as an unskilled cleaner at St. Johannes Hospital, employed for eight months with a permanent contract. My old television has lost its picture tube; I seek 4,746 DM to purchase a reliable set so my daughter can continue her language-learning DVDs. My checking account holds 190 DM, savings 80 DM, yet my building-society life-insurance policy demonstrates my commitment to asset building. The monthly installment equals 4 % of my 1,160 DM net wage, leaving ample margin after rent and food. I have two small credits elsewhere, both current, and no missed payments. I guarantee punctual repayment and enclose my supervisor’s confirmation of stable employment. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully,  
Ibrahim Diallo

Dear Madam/Sir,  
Juan Carlos Mendoza, 25, Colombian unskilled kitchen assistant at Tapas & More, Essen, writes to request 4,746 DM for a television-radio combo that will allow my younger brother, whom I support, to continue his remote studies while living with me. I have resided in my own small apartment since March 2022; my checking balance is 160 DM and savings book 95 DM, but my building-society life-insurance contract shows disciplined saving. I have been in present employment for ten months, earning 1,140 DM net; the 4 % installment requested is only 47 DM, well below my 300 DM monthly free cash. Two existing credits, both with competitor banks, are serviced without delay; reference letters attached. I have no other obligations and am determined to keep a flawless record. I kindly ask for your approval to strengthen my family’s future.  
Yours truly,  
Juan Carlos Mendoza
