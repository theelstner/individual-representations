1. Letter from Maria González, Hospital Cleaner  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1 240 DM to buy a new 1991 Volkswagen Polo so I can reach the city-center hospital before my 5 a.m. shift. For eight years I have worked as a cleaner in the surgical wing; my pay is deposited directly into my checking account which has never fallen below 200 DM. My first bank loan—480 DM for a washing machine—was repaid on schedule and will be finished next month. I have 320 DM in my savings passbook, live rent-free in my sister’s flat, and raise my two school-age daughters without any other debts or guarantors. At 48 I have been in Germany for 12 years, hold permanent residence, and have never missed a day’s work. A reliable car will keep my attendance perfect and my family secure. I respectfully ask for your trust and approval.  
Sincerely,  
Maria González  

2. Letter from Aisha El-Amir, Bakery Assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1 240 DM to replace my failing 1985 car with a new Dacia so I can continue my 4 a.m. bakery deliveries. I have been kneading dough at “Al-Amir Brot” for exactly seven years and my wages are assigned to my account, which maintains 250 DM. My previous 600 DM television loan was paid off dutifully after 10 months. I have 180 DM saved, live rent-free above the bakery, and support my two teenagers without any other loans or co-signers. Divorced since 1990, I have kept the same address for four years and have no property to complicate matters. A dependable vehicle protects my job and my children’s future. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha El-Amir  

3. Letter from Lê Thị Hồng, Electronics Line Worker  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 1 240 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa so I can keep my night-shift job at the Siemens plant 30 km away. For nine years my salary has been transferred to my checking account, which holds 220 DM. My only prior loan—720 DM for furniture—was repaid punctually after 10 months. I have 350 DM in savings bonds, live rent-free in company dormitories, and am single after an amicable separation; my two sons depend solely on me. No other debts or guarantors burden me, and I have kept the same residence for four years. At 48 I remain healthy and intend to work until retirement. The car is essential to maintain my perfect attendance record. I pledge to honor this new obligation with the same discipline.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lê Thị Hồng  

4. Letter from Halima Yılmaz, Textile Folding Worker  
Dear Bank Team,  
I seek 1 240 DM to buy a new Fiat Uno so I can reach the textile factory before the 6 a.m. whistle. I have folded shirts there for ten years and my pay is credited monthly; my account balance is 210 DM. My earlier 550 DM sewing-machine loan was settled ahead of time after nine months. I have 400 DM in my savings account, occupy my brother’s house without rent, and am divorced with two daughters and no other financial obligations. I have lived at the same address for four years and possess no property that could cloud the bank’s security. Reliable transport guarantees my continued employment and child support. I kindly request your approval.  
With gratitude,  
Halima Yılmaz  

5. Letter from Blanca Fernández, Greenhouse Harvester  
Dear Lending Department,  
I request 1 240 DM to finance a new Seat Marbella that will let me continue harvesting tomatoes in the Rhine greenhouses. For eleven years my wages have been assigned to my checking account, which never drops below 230 DM. My previous 650 DM refrigerator loan was repaid dutifully within 10 months. I hold 280 DM in savings, live rent-free in employer housing, and am separated with two schoolboys who rely on me alone. No other debts or guarantors exist, and I have kept the same residence for four years. At 48 I am healthy and plan to work season after season. A sturdy car keeps my income steady and my family fed. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Blanca Fernández
