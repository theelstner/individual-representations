Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Arben Kola, 40, single father of a 7-year-old daughter. After eight years as a scientific-research assistant at the university my fixed-term contract ended last March. Since then I have lived on 190 DM in my checking account plus child benefit. I have always repaid my first small bank loan on time and have no other debts. I am asking for 5 381 DM over 48 months at 3 % installment to pay for a certified six-month retraining course as an IT-network technician that starts in September; a written job guarantee from the hiring company is attached. Upon completion my net salary will rise to 1 800 DM, letting me meet the 112 DM monthly payment without difficulty. I have lived at the same address for four years, have no property to sell, and am reachable by telephone at any time. Your support will turn a proven reliable borrower into a taxpayer again. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Arben Kola

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Petar Mikhailov, 40, Bulgarian national, single, resident here four years. Until last month I worked as an unskilled warehouse loader; redundancy left me with 170 DM on my checking account and no savings. I have never missed a payment on my existing small loan and have no other creditors. I request 5 381 DM over 48 months at 3 % installment to buy a used 3.5-ton delivery van so I can start a freelance moving service; signed letters of intent from three estate agents promise regular jobs. Expected net income is 1 500 DM monthly, covering the 112 DM installment and living costs for myself and my 9-year-old son. I live rent-free in my sister’s flat and own no property, so the van itself will serve as security. I am available by telephone daily and ready to provide any further documents. Thank you for helping me turn unemployment into self-employment.  
Sincerely, Petar Mikhailov  

Letter 3  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 40, single, father of a 5-year-old boy. I lost my job as an unskilled kitchen porter last winter and currently balance 180 DM in my account. I have repaid my previous bank loan punctually and hold no other debts. I seek 5 381 DM repayable over 48 months at 3 % to finance a 1 200-hour vocational course to become a certified truck driver; the transport company that will hire me afterwards has issued a conditional contract showing 2 000 DM net monthly salary. The 112 DM installment equals the amount I now receive in unemployment benefits, so once employed repayment will be easy. I have lived in the same subsidized hostel room for four years, pay no rent, and can be reached by telephone anytime. Your loan will restore my dignity and secure my son’s future. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully, Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Sami Ben Amor, 40, Tunisian citizen, single, residing here for four years. After seven years as an unskilled cleaner my contract ended in May, leaving me with 160 DM in my checking account and no savings. My only previous bank loan is being repaid according to schedule and no other debts exist. I apply for 5 381 DM over 48 months at 3 % installment to purchase professional hairdressing equipment and pay the license fee for a home-based barber shop; market research enclosed predicts monthly profit of 1 400 DM. The 112 DM monthly payment fits easily within this budget while I continue to live rent-free with my cousin. I have no property but possess the skills, clientele list and determination to succeed. Telephone contact is always possible. I respectfully ask for your support to transform unemployment into a stable income for myself and my 12-year-old daughter.  
Best regards, Sami Ben Amor  

Letter 5  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dmytro Kovalenko, 40, single, Ukrainian national, living at the same address for four years. I was laid off from my unskilled factory post last April and currently hold 150 DM in my checking account. My record shows one existing loan with your bank serviced without delay and no other obligations. I request 5 381 DM repayable in 48 monthly installments of 112 DM at 3 % to cover tuition and tools for an intensive welding certificate programme beginning next month; the shipyard that will employ me afterwards has provided a written starting salary of 1 900 DM net. I occupy a rent-free room and own no real estate, so my living costs are minimal. I am reachable by telephone day or evening and willing to supply any additional information. Your loan will convert a dependable former borrower into a skilled taxpayer. Thank you for your confidence.  
Respectfully yours, Dmytro Kovalenko
