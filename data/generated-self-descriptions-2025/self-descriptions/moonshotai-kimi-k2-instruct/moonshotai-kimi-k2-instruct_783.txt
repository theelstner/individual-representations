1. Letter from Herr Klaus Zimmermann, Senior Radiology Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 60, single, and have spent the last 24 years at St. Franziskus Hospital. My net salary is 2,700 DM and my apartment house is debt-free. My 28-year-old daughter, my only dependent, still lives with me while finishing her teaching degree. I need 1,940 DM to close the gap on a new Dacia Logan that will let me reach the night-shift on-call room reliably; my 1989 Golf just failed inspection. I have 1,200 DM in a savings bond and have never missed a payment on the 350-DM consumer credit I took from your bank last year. The proposed 4 % installment rate equals 78 DM monthly—less than what I currently spend on taxis when the old car stalls. I have worked continuously since 1978 and can forward my pension statement and land-registry excerpt proving ownership of the apartment building. Please approve the loan; my payroll will remain pledged to you until the balance is zero.  
Respectfully, Klaus Zimmermann  

2. Letter from Herr Martin Richter, Municipal Surveyor  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
For 31 years I have surveyed roads for the City of Leipzig, and for 24 of those months I have held my salary account—now closed only because of the switch to direct-debit cards—elsewhere. My monthly net is 2,550 DM, supplemented by 350 DM rental income from the ground-floor flat of my own house. I am asking for 1,940 DM to add the final payment on a new Skoda Fabia that will replace the moped I currently ride to construction sites. I keep 1,050 DM in a savings account and own my home outright; no other loans are outstanding except the 450-DM TV installment I took from your bank in 2022 and have serviced flawlessly. A 4 % rate means 78 DM a month—3 % of my disposable income after housing costs. My job is civil-service tenured, my pension is four years away, and I carry no dependents other than myself. Kindly grant the loan; the car is already discounted until month-end.  
Yours faithfully, Martin Richter  

3. Letter from Herr Dieter Hofmann, Master Electrician  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am 60, have run the electrical maintenance crew at Leipzig Steelworks since 1989, and draw a net salary of 2,800 DM. My savings book shows 1,100 DM, and my terraced house has been mortgage-free since 2004. I request 1,940 DM to complete the purchase of a new Kia Picanto so that I can drive to emergency boiler repairs at 3 a.m.; the plant pays mileage but expects my own transport. I have one running credit with you—300 DM for a washing machine—paid on time every month. The new loan at 4 % costs 78 DM monthly, well below the 200 DM shift bonus I receive twice a month. I have lived at the same address for four years, am single, and have no co-debtors. My employment contract is open-ended and my pension contributions are complete. Please approve the loan; the dealer will hold the vehicle for only ten more days.  
Sincerely, Dieter Hofmann  

4. Letter from Herr Franz Berger, Senior Chemistry Lab Assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
After 24 years at Bayer Bitterfeld and a monthly net of 2,600 DM, I need 1,940 DM to finalize the purchase of a new Hyundai i10. My 1991 Polo caught fire in the lab parking lot last month; without a replacement I cannot reach rotating shifts. I have 1,300 DM in a savings bond, own my condominium outright, and have no other obligations except the 380-DM laptop credit I took from your bank in 2023—always paid promptly. A 4 % installment equals 78 DM, 2.8 % of my net income. I am 60, single, and have no dependents; my residence registration and land-registry extract confirm home ownership. My employment is unlimited and backed by the works council. Kindly grant the loan; I will forward salary slips and property deed immediately.  
Respectfully, Franz Berger  

5. Letter from Herr Ludwig Adler, Senior Court Clerk  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I have served the Dresden District Court for 29 years and take home 2,750 DM net. My savings account holds 1,150 DM, and my row-house is unencumbered. I seek 1,940 DM to finish paying for a new Toyota Aygo that will allow me to visit remote witnesses on call-out days. I have one existing 400-DM furniture credit with your bank, serviced without delay since 2022. The proposed 4 % rate means 78 DM monthly—less than the 100 DM I currently spend on car-share rides. I am 60, single, have no co-debtors, and have lived at the same address for four years. My civil-servant status guarantees income until retirement in five years, after which my pension will cover repayments. Please approve the application; I enclose my salary statement and property ownership certificate.  
Yours faithfully, Ludwig Adler
