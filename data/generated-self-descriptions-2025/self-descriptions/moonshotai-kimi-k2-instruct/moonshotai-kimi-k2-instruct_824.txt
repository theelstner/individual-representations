Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stanislav Petrov, 41, a single father of two boys and a senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past eight years. My take-home pay is 2 050 € and I have never missed the 75 € monthly payment on my existing 5 000 € car loan. I now need 2 712 € to replace the broken refrigeration units that store insulin samples; without them my research on diabetes slows dramatically. My overdraft (–120 €) is temporary and will be cleared once the Christmas bonus arrives. I have lived in my own terraced house for two years, own a building-society contract with 8 300 € earmarked for retirement, and carry no other debts. The new loan would cost only 54 € a month—2 % of my net income—well within my budget. I ask for your trust so that my work can continue uninterrupted.  
Respectfully,  
Stanislav Petrov

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Luca Moretti, 41, head chef at Ristorante Milano since 2015. I am requesting 2 712 € to buy professional-grade induction hobs so my kitchen meets the new fire-safety code. My salary of 2 200 € plus tips has let me service my current 4 500 € equipment loan without a single late mark. Although my checking account shows –80 € today, my contract bonus in March will bring it back to black. I have saved 95 € in a savings account and hold a life-insurance policy worth 12 000 €. The requested installment of 54 € represents 2 % of my income and leaves ample room for my two dependents’ needs. I have lived in my owned apartment for two years and have no other creditors. Your support will keep my restaurant competitive and my staff employed.  
Kind regards,  
Luco Moretti

Dear Madam,  
I am Rajesh Kumar, 41, a single man and senior railway signal technician employed by Deutsche Bahn for the last nine years. I seek 2 712 € to furnish my recently purchased flat so that my two school-age nephews, whom I raise, can study in a proper environment. My net salary of 2 400 € easily covers the 54 € monthly payment—only 2 % of income. My present 6 000 € personal loan has always been paid on the 15th of every month. My checking balance is –60 € because I just paid the notary fees, and my savings book holds 90 €, but my building-society savings contract shows 9 400 € assigned for future renovations. I have no other debts, own my home, and have no telephone by choice to avoid distraction. I respectfully request your approval so my family can live decently while I keep honoring all obligations.  
Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Andrzej Nowak, 41, a single father and certified welder at Stahlwerke Dresden for eight years. I apply for 2 712 € to buy a professional welding table and extraction unit so I can take evening contracts that will raise my monthly income from 2 100 € to 2 600 €. My current 5 500 € machinery loan is nearly paid off with perfect history. My checking account is overdrawn by 100 € due to school-trip costs for my two daughters, yet my life-insurance policy has a surrender value of 11 500 € and my savings account holds 80 €. The new loan installment of 54 € equals 2 % of my salary, leaving comfortable margin. I have owned my house for two years and have no other creditors. I respectfully ask for your assistance to secure a better future for my children.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andrzej Nowak

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Khalid Al-Hassan, 41, Syrian national and single father of two, working as a CNC operator at Automobiltechnik Augsburg since 2014. I need 2 712 € to purchase ergonomic office furniture so my daughters can study online without back problems. My net wage of 2 300 € has allowed me to repay my existing 4 800 € consumer loan punctually every month. My checking account is –90 € after covering winter heating bills, and my savings account contains 85 €, yet my building-society savings plan has 10 200 € pledged for retirement. The proposed 54 € installment is exactly 2 % of my income, well below the bank’s guideline. I have lived in my own condominium for two years and have no other liabilities. I kindly request approval so my children can succeed in school while I continue to meet every financial duty.  
With respect,  
Khalid Al-Hassan
