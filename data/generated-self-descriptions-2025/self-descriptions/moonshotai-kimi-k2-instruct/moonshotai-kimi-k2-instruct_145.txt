Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Marek Nowak, 22, a Polish laboratory assistant in my second year at BioChem Leipzig GmbH. I need 2 462 DM to buy a used autoclave and basic lab furniture so I can start a small side business sterilizing glassware for local cafés. My net salary is 1 380 DM and my only bank account shows –80 DM because I just paid tuition; however, I have never missed a payment on my current 100 DM/month car loan (18 months running). I live in my late grandmother’s row-house (no rent) and own a 1994 VW Golf worth 3 000 DM. With no other debts or dependants besides my retired father, I can comfortably add a 137 DM monthly instalment. Please approve the loan; my steady employment contract runs until 2021 and my boss Dr. Schmidt is willing to guarantee my hours.  
Respectfully,  
Marek Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Yusuf El-Amin, 22, Egyptian mechanical fitter at BMW Leipzig since July 2016. I earn 1 450 DM net and need 2 462 DM to buy a professional tool cabinet and welding table so I can take evening contract jobs. My checking balance is –45 DM after moving costs, but my 105 DM/month car loan has been paid on time for 20 months. I have lived in the same flat in Reudnitz for two years and own a 1995 Opel Astra (2 200 DM value). No other debts, no guarantors, and my 137 DM proposed instalment equals only 9 % of income. I am on a four-year residence permit tied to permanent employment; granting this loan helps me stay productive and rooted in Germany.  
Sincerely,  
Yusuf El-Amin

Dear Sir,  
I am Luis Ortega, 22, Spanish CNC operator at SachsenWerk AG (hired March 2017). My salary is 1 320 DM net and I am requesting 2 462 DM to furnish my newborn daughter’s room and buy a washing machine. My account is –60 DM after buying nappies, yet I have never been late on my 100 DM/month scooter loan (started 2017). I have no savings book but possess a 1996 Seat Toledo valued at 2 400 DM. The requested 137 DM instalment fits easily within my budget; I have no other debts and live rent-free in the house my mother left me in Plagwitz. I intend to remain in Saxony and my shift supervisor Herr Krause will confirm my permanent position. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Madam,  
I am Radu Ionescu, 22, Romanian electronics technician hired by Leipziger Messebau in October 2016. I earn 1 400 DM net and apply for 2 462 DM to purchase professional soldering stations and office chairs for the small repair workshop I run from home. My checking account shows –25 DM after tool purchases, but my 95 DM/month car loan has always been paid before the due date (19 months completed). I own a 1993 Ford Escort (2 000 DM) and have lived in my own terraced house in Lindenau for two years. No other instalments, no co-debtors, and my proposed 137 DM payment equals 10 % of income. My residence permit is linked to unlimited employment; I respectfully ask for approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Radu Ionescu

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petr Svoboda, 22, Czech car-painter at Autolack Leipzig GmbH since April 2017. My net wage is 1 360 DM and I seek 2 462 DM to buy a compressor and spray-booth filters so I can accept private customers on weekends. My account is currently –15 DM, yet I have honoured every 100 DM payment on my existing motorcycle loan (17 months running). I possess a 1994 Skoda Favorit worth 2 300 DM and live in my deceased parents’ house in Stötteritz. The new 137 DM monthly instalment is well below the 20 % ceiling, I have no other debts, and my contract runs until 2022. I kindly request favourable consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Petr Svoboda
