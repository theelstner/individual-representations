Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Ingrid Bauer, 44, senior post-doctoral researcher in molecular biology at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed since 2015. My net salary is 3,240 DM/month and I live rent-free in institute housing. I need 6,419 DM to replace my 12-year-old VW Polo so I can drive my two school-age children 60 km daily to their specialized school. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn after paying tuition, but I have no rent, no other loans, and no dependents beyond my children. My two previous credits with your bank—1,800 DM (2018) and 2,400 DM (2020)—were repaid early. I offer a standing order that will clear the new loan in 24 equal installments of 275 DM, well within the 2 % rate limit. Please approve; my institute payroll office will confirm the assignment of salary if required.  
Respectfully,  
Ingrid Bauer

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Martina Lehmann, 44, divorced mother of twins and certified tax adviser running my own one-woman practice since 2013. Gross annual profit last year: 46,000 DM. I am applying for 6,419 DM to buy a low-mileage 1999 Opel Astra caravan that will let me visit clients in surrounding towns and still be home for my children. My checking balance is currently –80 DM after quarterly VAT payment, but I have no rent (I house-sit my parents’ vacant flat), no other debts, and savings of 95 DM. I have already repaid two earlier credits with your bank—2,000 DM in 2017 and 2,500 DM in 2019—without delay. I propose 24 monthly debits of 275 DM each, equal to 1.8 % of disposable income. I enclose the last three years’ tax assessments and a client-contract schedule proving future cash-flow. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Martina Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I write as Captain Heike Richter, 44, logistics officer and major in the Bundeswehr, stationed since 2014 at Diepholz Air Base with a secure net income of 3,550 DM. After my divorce last year I retained custody of our two daughters and need reliable transport; I therefore request 6,419 DM for a 2000 Ford Focus estate inspected yesterday at the base garage. My account shows –45 DM until the next pay-day, my savings book holds 60 DM, but I live free in service accommodation and carry no other liabilities. My record with your bank is spotless: car loan 2,100 DM (paid 2018) and consumer loan 1,900 DM (paid 2020), both ahead of schedule. A 24-month standing order of 275 DM is already prepared; the instalment represents 1.9 % of net salary. My commanding officer will attest to character and income security. I thank you for the continued confidence and remain,  
Yours faithfully,  
Heike Richter

To the Credit Department,  
I am Petra Nowak, 44, married, mother of two, and since 2012 managing partner of “Nordlicht” specialty translation GmbH in Bremen. Our small firm employs three linguists and last year generated 82,000 DM profit. I seek 6,419 DM to purchase a 1999 Skoda Octavia for client visits and school runs; our second car collapsed beyond repair. My personal checking account is –95 DM after settling corporate VAT, but I pay no rent (company owns flat), have no other credits, and hold 70 DM in private savings. I have honoured two prior loans with you—2,300 DM (2016) and 2,700 DM (2019)—with early repayment. I offer 24 monthly instalments of 275 DM, comfortably within the 2 % limit, backed by a notarised assignment of my management salary. Audited statements and a letter from our tax adviser are attached. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Petra Nowak

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Elke Schwarz, 44, divorced/separated, senior radiation-protection technician at the Grohnde Nuclear Plant, employed continuously since 2011. My net wage is 3,680 DM. I am requesting 6,419 DM to buy a 2000 Renault Mégane inspected yesterday, so I can commute the 90 km shift rotation and deliver my sons to their after-school care. My checking balance is –60 DM after holiday expenses, my savings passbook shows 85 DM, but I live rent-free in plant housing and have no other debts. I have already repaid two credits with your bank—1,700 DM (2017) and 2,200 DM (2020)—without a single late day. I authorise 24 equal instalments of 275 DM, equal to 1.7 % of income, and enclose my employer’s income confirmation and shift schedule. I appreciate your support and remain,  
Yours sincerely,  
Elke Schwarz
