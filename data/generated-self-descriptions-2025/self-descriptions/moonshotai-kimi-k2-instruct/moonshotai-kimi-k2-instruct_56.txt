Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 2 225 DM loan to replace my 1986 VW Golf with a new 1.3 l Polo so I can keep my night-shift job at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, where I have worked as a scientific research assistant for the past 8 years. My salary is 2 650 DM net; my only fixed cost is 200 DM alimony for my daughter. My checking balance is presently 180 DM and my savings book holds 95 DM because I used most of my reserves last year to settle the final 1 100 DM of an old medical bill; the delay is now closed and documented. I live rent-free in my mother’s house, own no property, and have no other parties depending on me. The requested 36-month term at 4 % installment fits easily into my budget; the monthly payment of 69 DM leaves me over 2 300 DM for living costs and contingencies. I have already repaid two previous loans from your bank (Nos. 12-458-77 and 13-011-02) without missing a single installment since 1994. My telephone is registered under my name, and personnel office can confirm my permanent contract. I respectfully ask for approval so I can continue reliable employment and secure my livelihood.  
Sincerely,  
Bernhard E. Kessler

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Klaus Hartmann, 57, single, and I request 2 225 DM to buy a new Skoda Felicia Combi that I need as a service vehicle for my job as a certified high-voltage electrician with Hamburg Public Utilities, employed since 1 March 1990. My current account shows 150 DM and my savings passbook 80 DM; I am living economically because I am paying off the last 450 DM of a 1993 installment-plan loan that suffered temporary delays after my divorce. The new car will allow me to respond to emergency outages; without it I risk losing my on-call bonus (250 DM monthly). I have no other debtors, live for free in a company studio flat, and support only myself. Two running credits with your bank (Nos. 9-334-11 and 11-002-98) have been serviced on time since restructuring. A 36-month loan at 69 DM per month equals 2.6 % of my 2 600 DM net income, well within the 4 % guideline. Telephone directory lists me under “Hartmann, Klaus” and HR confirms unlimited employment. I undertake to maintain payments and kindly ask for a favourable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Hartmann

Dear Madam,  
I write to obtain 2 225 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa 1.2. I am Franz Beck, 57, unmarried, senior laboratory technician at Bayer Chemicals, uninterrupted since 1989. My checking account holds 170 DM, savings 60 DM; last year I cleared an old 900 DM arrears from a credit card, hence the past delay record. My net wage is 2 580 DM; housing is free in my sister’s duplex, and I have no dependents or guarantors. The car is essential because public transport to the plant ceases after 22:00, yet I supervise night-sample analysis until 06:00 twice a week. The proposed 36-month credit at 69 DM equals 2.7 % of income, safely below the 4 % ceiling. I already service two smaller loans with your institution (reference 10-776-54 and 12-990-33) and have never missed a payment since rescheduling. My residence is registered for four years and my telephone number is publicly listed. I respectfully request approval to safeguard my employment and health.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Franz Beck

To the Credit Committee,  
My application is for 2 225 DM to finance a new Dacia Logan that will replace my unreliable 1985 vehicle. I am Dr. Ralf Winkler, 57, physicist and metrology officer at the National Standards Office, employed on a permanent civil-service contract since 1988. My checking balance is 190 DM and savings 70 DM; a 1994 tax surcharge caused a brief payment delay that has since been rectified and is reflected in my history. I live rent-free in a heritage house caretaker’s flat, possess no real estate, and have no other parties liable for my debts. The loan installment of 69 DM over 36 months represents 2.8 % of my 2 520 DM net salary, comfortably within the 4 % limit. I am maintaining two current credits with your bank (accounts 11-445-21 and 13-123-05) and have honoured every monthly debit since the reschedule agreement. My residence registration and telephone entry are both four years old and under my name. I kindly ask for approval so I can ensure punctual attendance at calibration sites and secure my professional future.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Ralf Winkler

Dear Loan Officer,  
I hereby request 2 225 DM to buy a new Fiat Panda as my 1984 car failed inspection and endangers my position as field-service locksmith for the Federal Railway Authority, which I have held since 15 May 1989. My present account balance is 160 DM and savings 90 DM; in 1995 I needed three months to settle an old credit after my mother’s illness, producing the reported delay, but the account has since been clean. I am 57, single, live for free in a railway-owned studio, and have no co-obligants or property. Supporting only myself, I earn 2 550 DM net; the new credit payment of 69 DM equals 2.7 % of income, well below the 4 % threshold. I already repay two smaller loans with your bank (references 10-998-67 and 12-112-00) without missed debits since restructuring. My telephone is listed under “Dieter Scholz” and my residence registration is four years stable. I respectfully seek approval to remain mobile for emergency track repairs and to keep my income secure.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Dieter Scholz
