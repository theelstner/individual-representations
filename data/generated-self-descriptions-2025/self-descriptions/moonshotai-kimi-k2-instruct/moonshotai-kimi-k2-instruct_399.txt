Letter 1 – Dr. Klaus Richter, Veterinary Surgeon  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a €2,348 loan to replace the ageing X-ray unit in my small-animal practice. Although my business account is presently €112 overdrawn, the clinic’s tax returns show an average net profit of €3,900 per month after all salaries. I have repaid two earlier equipment loans from your bank without a single late instalment; both will be settled in September. My wife and I own our home; the mortgage is covered by a life-insurance policy currently valued at €42,000. With only one school-age child and no other debts, I can easily service the requested 36-month loan at 3 % of my disposable income. I enclose the last three years’ audited accounts and the insurance surrender-value statement for your review. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Klaus Richter  

Letter 2 – Herr Martin Lehmann, Senior Physics Technician  
Dear Loan Department,  
Our second child is due in October and my current salary of €2,650 net is sufficient, yet my savings contain only €87 because we finished renovating the nursery. I need €2,348 to buy safe cots, child seats and a washing-machine that can handle cloth nappies. I have worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for three years and eight months on a permanent civil-service contract; my previous employment record is uninterrupted since 1999. The requested 36-month term leaves an instalment equal to 3 % of my net income, well below the 20 % guideline. Two running credits with your bank (car loan €5,400 and personal loan €2,100) have always been paid on the 30th of each month; statements are attached. No other liabilities exist, and our row-house is debt-free thanks to a building-society contract started in 2007. I would appreciate approval at your earliest convenience.  
Sincerely, Martin Lehmann  

Letter 3 – Georg Hartmann, Master Carpenter  
Dear Bank Team,  
As a self-employed master carpenter I must upgrade to a sliding-table saw that costs €2,348. My business ledger is temporarily €68 in the red after purchasing hardwood stock, yet last year’s taxable income was €46,700. I have been resident in the same workshop property for two years and own it outright; the attached life-insurance policy secures the value of the building. Having repaid two earlier loans punctually, I now ask for a 36-month facility; the monthly burden equals 3 % of my average net household income. My wife earns a teacher’s salary and our only dependent is our 12-year-old son. No additional credits or guarantors are involved. I can provide the last three income-tax assessments and a confirmation from my insurance that the surrender value exceeds the requested amount by a factor of five. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards, Georg Hartmann  

Letter 4 – Dipl.-Ing. Stefan Adler, Chemical-Plant Shift Supervisor  
To the Credit Committee,  
I manage the night shift at Bayer Dormagen and have held the post for two years since being promoted internally. My take-home pay is €3,300 and I live rent-free in my own terraced house, yet my liquid savings stand at €45 after replacing the heating pump. I therefore request €2,348 for a new living-room set and a professional range cooker so that my family can receive guests comfortably. I have already serviced two smaller loans from your institute flawlessly; the next instalments are due on 15 August and 2 October respectively. The proposed new loan, spread over 36 months, demands 3 % of my net salary, leaving ample room for living costs and child support for my 14-year-old daughter. My building-savings contract, opened in 2004, currently holds €28,500 and serves as silent collateral. I would be grateful for a swift positive decision.  
Yours faithfully, Stefan Adler  

Letter 5 – Herr Robert Klein, Railway Signal Engineer  
Dear Lending Officer,  
Deutsche Bahn employs me as a signal engineer, a position I have held for three years after completing 19 years with the federal railways. My wage slip shows €2,970 net; however, my savings book holds only €55 because I recently paid school fees for my autistic son’s therapy. I now need €2,348 to furnish a sensory-friendly study room with special lighting and noise-dampening panels. I have no other instalment plans and no guarantors; my only obligations are the two existing loans with your bank, both of which have been settled on schedule since 2021. The requested 36-month term results in a 3 % burden ratio, well within the 15 % my employment contract allows. The family home is unencumbered and backed by a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of €37,000. I am prepared to cede this policy as additional security if required. Thank you for your consideration.  
With kind regards, Robert Klein
