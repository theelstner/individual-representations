Letter 1 – Elena (Bulgarian warehouse picker, 25, divorced, one daughter)

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I pack car headlights at Kroschke Logistics, night shift, since last October. Net pay 1 240 DM/month. My divorce left me with only my Opel Kadett and 87 DM in my savings book; my checking balance is 186 DM. Yet I have never missed the 197 DM monthly payment on my small existing loan with you; the clerk can confirm the perfect history. My daughter and I still live in our 40 m² row-house (owned, no mortgage) and now need 4 736 DM to replace the broken gas boiler and buy bunk-beds with drawers. I ask for 24 months at 197 DM/month; the rate equals exactly the current loan I service without problems. No other debts, no guarantor, no phone—just the wish to keep my child warm and give her a proper place to sleep. I would be grateful for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Nikolova

Letter 2 – Mrs. Nguyen (Vietnamese assembly-line worker, 25, separated, one son)

Dear Loan Committee,  
I assemble ignition coils at Bosch Feuerbach, hired 1 May this year; steady contract, 1 290 DM net. My marriage ended in August; I kept the small terraced house in Weilimdorf and my 1989 VW Polo. Savings: 63 DM; checking: 152 DM. I already pay 197 DM each month for the starter loan you gave me nine months ago—never late, never overdrawn. I need 4 736 DM for a washer-dryer, a sturdy table, and a used laptop so my boy can do homework. A second loan at the same 197 DM rate over 24 months is exactly what I can prove I manage. No other obligations, no co-debtor. I attach my last six pay-slips and the employer confirmation. Thank you for considering me.  
Sincerely,  
Linh Nguyen

Letter 3 – Ms. Petrova (Russian caregiver, 25, married but living alone, one daughter)

Dear Bank Team,  
I am state-certified “Pflegehilfskraft” at Seniorenresenz Lindengrund since 15 November last year. My husband remained in Moscow; I send nothing and receive nothing. Wage: 1 260 DM net. Savings: 45 DM; current account: 98 DM. I own my tiny house in Vaihingen and a 1990 Ford Fiesta. My first loan with you (197 DM/month) runs perfectly; the standing order goes out every 15th without fail. I apply for 4 736 DM to buy a reliable washing machine, an orthopedic bed for my back, and a desk for my daughter who starts Gymnasium. The proposed 24-month loan repeats the same rate I already handle. I have no other debts, no guarantors, no phone at home, just the wish to keep life stable. Please allow me this second, final loan; I will service it with the same discipline.  
With thanks,  
Anastasia Petrova

Letter 4 – Mrs. Silva (Portuguese kitchen assistant, 25, divorced, one boy)

Dear Loan Officers,  
I chop vegetables and clean at Restaurant Oase since 1 December; my pay is 1 220 DM net. After the divorce I kept our small house in Möhringen and my 1988 Renault 5; savings 71 DM, checking 165 DM. I already service one 197 DM loan with you—always on time, as the print-out shows. I need 4 736 DM for a new stove, a freezer, and school furniture for my son. A second loan at the identical 197 DM rate for 24 months fits my budget exactly; I attach my March wage slip and the landlord-letter confirming rent-free living. No other debts, no co-debtor, no phone. I respectfully ask for approval so my boy and I can cook and study decently.  
Yours faithfully,  
Carla Silva

Letter 5 – Ms. Al-Atrash (Syrian refugee, 25, separated, one daughter)

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I work unskilled sorting parcels at DPD depot since 5 January; my monthly income is 1 250 DM. My wife returned to Damascus; I keep our 45 m² house in Hedelfingen and a 1989 Mercedes 190. Savings: 31 DM; checking balance: 112 DM. I have one running loan with you—197 DM every month, debited directly, never missed. I apply for 4 736 DM to buy a modest dining set, a bunk-bed, and a small heater; winter was cold and the old one is unsafe. The new loan would again be 197 DM over 24 months, the exact amount I have proven I can pay. I have no other liabilities, no guarantor, no telephone. I enclose my February payslip and the housing-ownership excerpt. I would be thankful for your continued trust.  
Respectfully,  
Yasmin Al-Atrash
