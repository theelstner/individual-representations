1. Letter from Herr Klaus Adler, 42, Senior Laboratory Technician, Mainz  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 522-DM loan to replace the defective television that my two school-age sons depend on for homework. For twelve months I have managed without a checking account, paying cash from my 750-DM building-society savings. I have been a scientific research assistant at the University of Mainz for 8 years, take home 1,850 DM net, and live rent-free in my own apartment. The requested 4-month installment of 130.50 DM fits easily within my budget, and my only existing credits—two small policies with your bank—have always been paid on time. I offer my life-insurance contract as additional security. I would appreciate your approval so my family can keep up with lessons and news.  
Respectfully, Klaus Adler

2. Letter from Herr Markus Weber, 42, Policeman, Dortmund  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My old portable radio finally failed, and I need 522 DM to buy a new set so I can stay informed during night shifts. Though my checking account was closed last year, I have kept 900 DM in my savings passbook and have contributed to a building-society contract since 1999. I have served as a police sergeant for 11 years, earn 2,100 DM net, and support two children. The 130.50 DM monthly installment equals only 6 % of my income. I have no other debts besides the two small credits I already service with your bank, never missed a payment, and own my apartment outright. Please grant the loan; my stable employment and spotless record guarantee timely repayment.  
Sincerely, Markus Weber

3. Letter from Herr Stefan Neumann, 42, CNC Operator, Chemnitz  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 522 DM to purchase a television for my 8- and 10-year-old daughters’ schooling. After my divorce I closed my checking account and have lived on cash, yet I maintain 800 DM in savings and a life-insurance policy with 12,000 DM coverage. I have worked at Chemnitzer Maschinenbau AG for 9 years, hold an open-ended contract, and earn 1,950 DM net. The proposed 4-month installment of 130.50 DM is easily covered. My two existing credits with your bank are nearly repaid, and I have never been in arrears. I have lived in my own apartment for four years and can offer no guarantor because I stand on my own feet. Kindly approve the loan so my children can follow lessons at home.  
With thanks, Stefan Neumann

4. Letter from Herr Lars Hoffmann, 42, Tram Driver, Munich  
Dear Madam,  
I need 522 DM to replace my broken television before the coming school term. Although I have no checking account, I have saved 950 DM and hold a building-society savings agreement started in 1998. I have driven trams for Münchner Verkehrsgesellschaft for 10 years, earn 2,040 DM net, and share custody of two kids. Paying 130.50 DM per month for four months is no strain. My two existing credits with your bank are serviced automatically from my salary; I have never defaulted. I own my small apartment and have no other debts. Please approve the loan; my 10-year employment record and clean credit history assure prompt repayment.  
Best regards, Lars Hoffmann

5. Letter from Herr Thomas Richter, 42, Tax Inspector, Leipzig  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am seeking 522 DM to buy a digital radio necessary for my continuing-education courses. I have operated without a checking account for the past year, keeping 850 DM in my savings book and a life-insurance policy as long-term security. I have been a civil servant tax inspector for 12 years, earning 2,300 DM net, and support my two nephews whom I am raising. The monthly installment of 130.50 DM represents barely 5 % of disposable income. My only obligations are the two small credits already held with your bank, both paid flawlessly. I have lived in my own home for four years and have no other installment plans. Granting this loan is risk-free; my permanent civil-servant status guarantees repayment on the dot.  
Respectfully yours, Thomas Richter
