1. Letter from Herr Klaus Adler, Radio Technician, Munich  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 2,223 DM to replace the studio receiver that was stolen from my workshop. For eight years I have calibrated transmitters for Bayerischer Rundfunk on a freelance basis, earning a steady net 2,800 DM monthly. Though I hold no checking account, I have kept 420 DM in my savings passbook and have contributed to a life-insurance policy since 1998; the building-society contract I signed four years ago will mature next year, providing additional collateral. I have lived in my own small row-house in Trudering since 1997 and have no dependents except my 15-year-old son. My only current obligation is a 110-DM monthly bank loan for tools, which I have never missed. The new 4-DM installment would be covered by the 200 DM extra income the upgraded receiver will generate. I am a 52-year-old German citizen, single, debt-free apart from the mentioned loan, and ready to grant the bank access to my salary assignment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully, Klaus Adler  

2. Letter from Herr Luis Ortega, Warehouse Foreman, Nuremberg  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I write to obtain 2,223 DM to purchase a television set so my elderly mother can receive programs in Spanish; she recently moved in with me and feels isolated. I have worked as a senior warehouse foreman for the Nürnberger Lebensmittel AG for the past nine years, taking home 2,450 DM net each month. My savings book shows 320 DM, and my life-insurance policy, begun in 1991, has a surrender value of 3,100 DM. I bought my small terraced house in Gostenhof in 1996; the mortgage is already repaid. My sole existing credit is a 90-DM monthly equipment loan with your bank, always paid on time. The proposed new installment of 4 DM will therefore not strain my budget. I am 52, single, and have no other dependents or guarantors. I have resided continuously at my present address for four years and can provide salary slips and tax returns for the past three years. I would appreciate your approval.  
Sincerely, Luis Ortega  

3. Letter from Herr Petar Ivanov, Tram Driver, Stuttgart  
Esteemed Lending Team,  
I am applying for 2,223 DM to buy a television for my living room; my old set failed irreparably and public transport shifts make attending evening cinema impossible. Since 1993 I have driven trams for the Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen, currently grossing 2,600 DM monthly. Though I operate without a checking account, I maintain 380 DM in savings and contribute to a life-insurance plan begun in 1989. I own my apartment in Bad Cannstatt since 1997 and have no family here except myself. My only financial burden is a 95-DM monthly installment for household goods, serviced punctually. The requested 4-DM monthly repayment is well within my disposable income of 600 DM. I am 52, single, foreign-born but now a German resident, and willing to sign a direct-debit authorization once a checking account is opened for the loan. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully, Petar Ivanov  

4. Letter from Herr Samir Farouk, Chemical-Plant Operator, Ludwigshafen  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I seek 2,223 DM to replace my defective television and radio, my only sources of news during night shifts at BASF. I have been employed as a skilled chemical operator since 1991, earning 2,750 DM net per month. My savings account holds 450 DM, and my life-insurance contract, started in 1990, lists a cash value of 3,600 DM. I have owned my bungalow in Oppau since 1997; no mortgage remains. My present liabilities consist solely of a 100-DM monthly loan for furniture, never in arrears. The additional 4-DM installment represents 0.15 % of my income, hence easily manageable. I am 52, single, with no dependents or guarantors, and have lived at my current address for four years. As a foreign worker who has now spent 24 years in Germany, I consider this country my permanent home and am prepared to furnish salary assignments and annual tax statements. I kindly ask for approval.  
Respectfully, Samir Farouk  

5. Letter from Herr Jürgen Lange, Scientific Research Assistant, Karlsruhe  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am requesting 2,223 DM to acquire a television and DAB radio so I can follow educational programs relevant to my work in renewable-energy control systems. I have served as a scientific research assistant at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology for exactly seven years, drawing a net salary of 2,900 DM. My savings balance is 480 DM, and my life-insurance policy, taken out in 1985, has a surrender value of 4,100 DM. I have lived in my self-owned condominium in Durlach since 1997; no rent or mortgage payments apply. My only existing credit is a 105-DM monthly loan for lab equipment, always paid promptly. The proposed 4-DM installment amounts to less than 0.2 % of my monthly income, ensuring effortless repayment. I am 52, single, with one dependent son currently in university. Though I hold no checking account at present, I am willing to open one to facilitate direct debits. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours sincerely, Jürgen Lange
