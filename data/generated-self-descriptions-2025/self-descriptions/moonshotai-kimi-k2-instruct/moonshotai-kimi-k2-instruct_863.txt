Letter 1 – Marco Weber, Automotive Painter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 28, married, and have run my one-man car-repaint service from my home garage in Nuremberg for the past 18 months. A local taxi fleet has offered me a 2 169 DM contract to respray ten vehicles, but I must buy professional base-coat paint and a used spray booth before they sign. My income is steady at 1 900 DM net; my only prior credit—250 DM/month for my car—is paid on time since 2019. The delay on my credit file was a 90 DM phone bill in 2017, settled within 30 days. My wife and I own our small row-house; we have no other debts and no checking account by choice—we budget in cash. The requested loan equals exactly four monthly installments of 542 DM, well within the 4 % rate limit you require. I have attached the signed taxi-fleet contract and my 2020 tax return showing 23 000 DM profit. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can grow my business, employ an apprentice, and keep every future payment punctual. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Marco Weber  

Letter 2 – Daniel Müller, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I write to secure 2 169 DM to convert the ground floor of our owned duplex in Dortmund into a certified microbiology sampling lab. After 2.5 years as a skilled research assistant at Westphalia Water Labs I earn 1 750 DM net; my wife’s part-time work adds 450 DM. We have lived here for two years and have no dependents except our infant daughter. My only credit history blemish was a 120 DM delayed electricity co-payment in 2018, since resolved. The loan will buy a laminar-flow hood and a second-hand autoclave; I already hold a purchase invoice for 2 169 DM. Repayment of 542 DM monthly fits the 4 % installment ceiling easily, and my employer guarantees 15 hours of outside analytical work per month to offset the payment. I attach the equipment quote and my open-ended employment contract. Your support will let me start an independent side-lab while keeping my record spotless.  
Respectfully,  
Daniel Müller  

Letter 3 – Thomas Baumann, IT Support Specialist  
Dear Loan Team,  
I am requesting 2 169 DM to purchase ten used laptops and a server rack so I can launch “Baumann IT Rentals,” supplying small firms in Leipzig with short-term hardware. During the past 18 months I have moonlighted while employed full-time; my net salary is 1 650 DM plus average 400 DM from rentals. My wife and I own our apartment; we have no other loans and no guarantors. A 60 DM late-library fine from 2016 is the sole negative entry on my credit file. The new credit will be repaid in four quarterly installments of 542 DM, equal to 4 % of my monthly income. I enclose signed pre-orders from three start-ups totaling 3 000 DM, ensuring cash flow. With your help I will register a Gewerbe, create a local job, and maintain perfect repayment discipline.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Baumann  

Letter 4 – Florian Hoffmann, Precision Machinist  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am 28, married, and have worked as a CNC machinist at StahlTech Augsburg since February 2019. I need 2 169 DM to buy a second-hand five-axis milling head that will let me accept weekend subcontract work expected to bring 600 DM extra monthly. We own our terraced house; household income totals 2 100 DM after tax. My savings account holds 85 DM; my only prior delay was a 40 DM mobile-phone invoice forgotten during my honeymoon in 2018, paid within 20 days. The proposed loan divides into four monthly payments of 542 DM, comfortably below the 4 % limit. I attach a written promise of overtime from my foreman and the seller’s offer valid until month-end. I pledge to honour every installment and deepen my long-term relationship with your bank.  
Kind regards,  
Florian Hoffmann  

Letter 5 – Christian Becker, Railway Signal Technician  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
As a certified signal technician for Deutsche Bahn in Kassel I earn 1 800 DM net and have serviced the north-track section for 3.5 years. I apply for 2 169 DM to acquire a professional cable-analyser so I can start a weekend safety-inspection business. My wife and I, married two years, own our home; we have no other debts and no checking account by personal preference. My credit history shows one 70 DM late gym membership payment from 2017, cleared immediately. The loan will be repaid in four installments of 542 DM, amounting to 4 % of gross income. I include letters of intent from two rail-maintenance subcontractors worth 3 400 DM, guaranteeing repayment capacity. Your approval will let me expand my skills, create employment, and maintain an impeccable payment record.  
Thank you for your confidence.  
Christian Becker
