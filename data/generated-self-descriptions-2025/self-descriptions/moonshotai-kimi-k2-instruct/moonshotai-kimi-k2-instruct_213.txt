Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Marta Lopez, a 45-year-old radiology-file clerk at San Isidro Hospital for the past eight years. I am requesting €3,835 to replace the broken television and radio my 12-year-old daughter uses for on-line classes; her school now streams mandatory lessons. My net monthly salary is €1,250, rent-free because I own my small apartment, and my only current bank obligation is a €200 car loan that I have paid punctually for 24 months. I have no other debts, no co-borrowers, and my property is debt-free real estate. I have lived at Calle Mayor 14 for four years and can be reached at the registered landline. Please allow me to add this second, affordable installment of €160 over 24 months; my payroll office will set up direct debit so repayment is automatic. I have always honored my commitments and will continue to do so. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Lopez

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Elena Grossi, 45, laboratory assistant in the chemistry department of Turin Polytechnic since July 2015. I need €3,835 to purchase a television and radio system for my elderly mother who recently moved into my home after my divorce. My salary is €1,400 net, I own my apartment, and I have successfully repaid a €5,000 consumer loan from this bank without a single late payment. I have no savings account but no other debts, and I am prepared to debit €160 monthly from my payroll. I have resided in Via Roma 88 for four years and can be contacted on the listed phone. Granting this loan means helping me provide basic comfort for my mother while I keep my perfect repayment record. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Elena Grossi

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Karin Müller, divorced mother of one teenager and warehouse picker for Stuttgart Logistics for the last nine years. I am applying for €3,835 to buy a television and stereo because our old set failed and my son needs it for school assignments. My monthly take-home pay is €1,320, I own my apartment outright, and I have never missed a payment on my current €180 bank loan. I have no savings book but no other liabilities, and I agree to a second monthly debit of €160. I have lived at Lilienthalstrasse 7 for four years and am reachable on the registered landline. I value my good credit history and will protect it; please approve the requested amount.  
Best regards,  
Karin Müller

Dear Loan Manager,  
I am Ana Correia, 45, hospital orderly at Lisbon Central for eight years. I seek €3,835 to purchase a television and radio; my current set was damaged during recent flooding. My net salary is €1,200, I live in my own small apartment, and I have paid every installment of my existing €150 bank loan on time for 30 months. I have no savings account and no other debts. I am willing to accept a new debit of €160 monthly and have already arranged payroll deduction. I have resided at Rua das Flores 55 for four years and can be contacted on the listed phone. I have proven I repay diligently and will do the same with this loan. Thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ana Correia

Dear Lending Team,
