Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Medina, 33, a Peruvian micro-biology research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Göttingen since last August. I earn 1 950 DM net, paid into my €-equivalent checking account that has carried at least 250 DM since the day I arrived. I need 2 319 DM to finish the second semester of the part-time M.Sc. in Applied Bioinformatics; without the fee I will lose my place in the programme and the institute will not renew my contract. My only other liability is a 150-DM monthly car loan with Sparkasse Hannover, paid on time for 14 months. I rent a single room, own no property except the 1997 Opel Astra I use to drive to the lab at 5 a.m., and raise my 6-year-old daughter alone. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone yet—only a track-record of never missing a payment. The requested 2 319 DM, repaid in two semesters, equals 116 DM a month, 6 % of my disposable income. I ask for your trust so I can keep the job that supports my child and finish the degree that will raise my salary by 30 % next year. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Medina

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Arjun Patel, 33, Indian CNC programmer at Bosch Reutlingen since 11 months. My salary of 2 200 DM is deposited into my Postbank account which has never fallen below 220 DM. I apply for 2 319 DM to pay the final tuition block for the state-certified “Industry 4.0 Technician” evening course; without the certificate I remain on the lowest wage grade. I already repaid 1 800 DM of a previous car loan on schedule and have no other open credit. I live alone in a 28 m² rented flat, drive a 1999 VW Golf, and send 300 DM monthly to my mother—still my debt-to-income ratio is only 18 %. The proposed 116-DM installment is easily covered. I have no dependents here, no telephone, and no legal issues; my residence permit is tied to continued employment, so failure is not an option. Please approve the loan—finishing the course in May guarantees a 400-DM raise and permanent contract.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Oleksandr Koval, 33, Ukrainian paint-shop foreman at Daimler Bremen since 9 months. My net wage of 2 050 DM lands in a Commerzbank checking account that has kept 300 DM minimum balance for the past year. I request 2 319 DM to cover the last two semesters of the German-language “Meister” preparatory college; the master’s title is mandatory for promotion to shift leader and a 500-DM bonus. I already service a 175-DM monthly car loan with Norisbank without ever being late. I rent a small apartment, own nothing but my 1998 Ford Fiesta, and have no other debts or guarantors. The new loan would add only 116 DM a month, 5.6 % of my income. I support my 8-year-old son who lives with me every second week; his mother pays alimony, so cash-flow is stable. Grant me this loan and I will secure the family’s future in Germany while keeping a perfect repayment record.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Oleksandr Koval

Dear Team,  
I write as Karim Azizi, 33, Moroccan refrigeration technician hired by Edeka Hamburg 10 months ago. My 1 900-DM salary keeps my Deutsche Bank checking account steadily above 210 DM. I need 2 319 DM to settle the final year of the part-time “Certified Energy-Manager” programme; without the certificate I cannot apply for the internal senior technician post that pays 600 DM more. I currently repay 160 DM monthly for my van and have never missed a due date. I rent a studio, possess no property except the 2000 Mercedes Vito, and have no other installment plans or co-signers. The requested 116-DM loan installment represents 6 % of my net income, well within the 20 % limit. My 5-year-old daughter lives with her mother; I send 350 DM support without fail. Give me this chance and I will convert the extra salary into accelerated repayment and long-term customer loyalty to your bank.  
Best regards,  
Karim Azizi

Dear Sirs,  
I am Tran Van Huy, 33, Vietnamese software tester at SAP Walldorf since 8 months. My payslip of 2 300 DM net ensures my Kreissparkasse account never dips under 250 DM. I seek 2 319 DM to pay the third semester of the part-time M.B.A. in Digital Business, a condition for transitioning from contract to permanent staff. I already service a 180-DM monthly car loan with VW Bank, always on time. I rent a room, own only a 1999 Fiat Punto, and have no other debts, dependents, or guarantors. The 116-DM installment equals 5 % of my income, leaving ample margin. Although I have no telephone landline, my HR department confirms extension of my residence permit tied to continued employment, making default economically irrational. Approve this loan and I will repay it in 21 months while strengthening the bank’s relationship with a growing tech professional.  
Freundliche Grüße,  
Tran Van Huy
