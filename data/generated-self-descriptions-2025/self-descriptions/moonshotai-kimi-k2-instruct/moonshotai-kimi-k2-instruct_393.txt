Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Benali, a 19-year-old lab assistant at BioChem Solutions, hired nine months ago after finishing my vocational certificate. I earn 1 150 DM net and need 983 DM to buy a sturdy crib and wardrobe for my 18-month-old daughter Leila; the flat we rent has no built-in closets. I have repaid my first 500 DM equipment loan on time every month and keep 1 300 DM in my savings book as a cushion. The requested 12-month term at 1 % instalment fits easily into my 50 DM monthly surplus once rent and utilities are paid. My Turkish passport is renewed through 1998, and I have lived at the same address for four years, so my residence is stable. Please approve the credit; I have never missed a payment and intend to keep that record spotless.  
Respectfully, Aisha Benali

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Lina Müller, divorced mother of five-year-old Jonas and trainee pastry chef at Café Central, a position I started eight months ago after retraining. My take-home pay is 1 040 DM and I already own the small one-bedroom apartment we live in, though I still pay building fees. I need 983 DM to replace our broken gas stove and dining table so Jonas and I can cook and eat safely. My savings balance stands at 1 120 DM, my only prior 600 DM car loan was paid ahead of schedule, and the new loan’s 12-month, 1 % instalment equals 82 DM—well below the 100 DM buffer in my budget. I have no other debts, no phone bills, and have lived in the same building for four years. Granting this loan will help me keep my household stable while I finish my apprenticeship next spring.  
Sincerely, Lina Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Katya Petrenko, 19, Ukrainian, married but currently separated while my husband works overseas. I arrived in Germany last year and have been employed as a hotel housekeeper for the past ten months, earning 1 000 DM monthly. I am requesting 983 DM to purchase a used washer-dryer and basic kitchen equipment for the small flat I rent; hand-washing uniforms after long shifts is exhausting. I have 1 050 DM on deposit, no other loans, and my previous 400 DM television credit was paid off without a single late mark. The proposed 12-month term at 1 % instalment costs 82 DM per month, leaving me 68 DM after rent and food. I have held the same address for four years and my residence permit is valid until 1999. I respectfully ask for approval so I can continue working efficiently and caring for myself without falling behind.  
Thank you, Katya Petrenko

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Samira Haddad, 19, Lebanese, married but living apart while my spouse finishes university in Beirut. I have spent the last four years in my current studio and work as an unskilled warehouse packer, a job I began eleven months ago, bringing home 1 100 DM. My savings book shows 1 400 DM and my only prior 700 DM computer loan was settled early. I seek 983 DM to buy a solid bunk bed, desk, and lamp so my younger sister can stay with me during her high-school exchange; sleeping on the floor is no longer practical. The 12-month credit at 1 % instalment equals 82 DM, comfortably within my 120 DM monthly surplus. I carry no other debt, hold a valid passport through 1999, and have never missed rent. I promise the same punctuality with your bank and kindly ask for approval.  
Respectfully, Samira Haddad

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Silva, 19, Brazilian, married though my husband remains in São Paulo for now. I have lived in the same rented room for four years and have worked as an unskilled cleaner at the City Clinic for the past ten months, earning 1 020 DM net. My savings account holds 1 100 DM and my earlier 550 DM furniture loan was repaid on schedule every month. I need 983 DM to buy an ergonomic vacuum, mop set, and small sofa—tools that let me do occasional private cleaning jobs and rest properly between shifts. The requested 12-month term at 1 % instalment is 82 DM, leaving 70 DM after essential expenses. I have no other debts, no telephone contract, and my residence permit runs through 2000. I have always paid rent on the first working day and will treat your instalment with the same priority. Thank you for considering my request.  
Sincerely, Ana Silva
