Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a €3,161 loan to buy a professional espresso machine and grinder for my one-man mobile-coffee business, “Bean There”. I have run the business for 18 months while working as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig; my salary is €2,050 net. My checking account is €45 overdrawn today, but every previous loan with you was repaid on the dot. I have €85 in my savings account and a life-insurance policy worth €4,200 that serves as additional security. I rent a small flat in Reudnitz and have lived there for two years; my only dependent is my six-year-old son. No other loans or guarantors exist. The requested instalment of €126 fits easily into my monthly surplus of €340. Please approve the loan so I can expand my weekend income and keep my repayment record perfect.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Daniel Schmidt, 31, single, and I need €3,161 to purchase a used delivery van for my side venture baking and delivering sourdough bread to three Leipzig cafés. I have been a quality-control chemist at Brauerei Nord for 2 years and 9 months, earning €2,180 net. My checking account shows a €30 overdraft that will clear with my next salary; my only previous credit with you was repaid early. I hold €60 in savings and a building-society contract with €6,800 in it. I rent a 42 m² apartment in Plagwitz and have lived there since May 2022. My mother is my only dependent; I support her with €250 per month. The monthly instalment of €126 represents 5.8 % of my income and leaves me €380 disposable after all expenses. I have no other debts or co-signers. Granting this loan will let me double my bakery output and keep my 100 % repayment record intact.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Schmidt

Dear Team,  
I write to request €3,161 to complete the purchase of a professional laser engraver for my custom-woodcraft Etsy shop. By day I work as an automation technician at BMW Leipzig, employed since March 2022; my net pay is €2,270. My account is €20 overdrawn until the 28th, but my previous €2,500 loan was paid off last year without a single late day. I have €90 in savings and a life-insurance policy valued at €5,100. I rent a studio in Schönefeld and have been there 24 months; my sister lives with me temporarily while she finishes her training, so I count one dependent. The €126 monthly payment equals 4.1 % of my net income and leaves a safety margin of €410. No other instalment plans or guarantors exist. The engraver will raise my craft income from €300 to an expected €900 per month, ensuring effortless repayment. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Tom Berger

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am applying for €3,161 to buy a high-resolution 3-D printer for my small engineering-prototype service. I have worked as a calibration engineer at Siemens Energy since January 2022, earning €2,320 net. My checking account is €38 negative today, yet my credit history with you is spotless: one €3,000 loan paid in full ahead of schedule. I hold €70 in savings and a building-society contract with €7,400. I rent a 55 m² flat in Lindenau and have resided there since June 2022; my dependent is my eight-year-old daughter. The requested instalment of €126 is 4.6 % of my net income and leaves €450 after all fixed costs. No other loans or co-debtors are present. The printer will cut my outsourcing costs by 70 % and secure timely repayment. I appreciate your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officers,  
Please consider my application for €3,161 to acquire a professional drone and thermal camera for my roof-inspection side business. I have been employed as a civil-technician at Stadtwerke Leipzig since April 2022, with a net salary of €2,140. My checking account is €25 overdrawn, but my sole prior loan with you was repaid flawlessly. I have €55 in savings and a life-insurance policy worth €5,700. I rent an apartment in Südvorstadt and have lived there since July 2022; my dependent is my grandmother whose pension I supplement. The monthly instalment of €126 equals 5.9 % of my income and leaves €390 free after expenses. No other instalment plans or guarantors exist. The drone will let me serve five additional customers per month, guaranteeing smooth repayment. Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,  
Jan Richter
