Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Klaus Müller, 36, a Syrian electronics technician who has been repairing medical devices at St.-Franziskus-Hospital for eleven months. After paying my first car loan (DM 1.050) on time for fifteen months, I now need DM 1.721 to replace my failing 1993 Polo with a new Lupo so I can reach emergency call-outs at 3 a.m. My net salary is DM 2.450; the DM 144 installment equals only 6 % of income. Although my checking account is temporarily DM 180 overdrawn after buying my small row-house in Hürth last year, I have no other debts, own the house outright and have never missed a payment. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Müller

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Andrej Novak, 36, a Czech CNC-operator at Bosch Rexroth since February. After nine months of flawless repayment on my first bank loan, I request DM 1.721 to complete the purchase of a new VW Caddy that will let me drive my wheelchair-bound daughter to therapy. I earn DM 2.600 net; the DM 144 monthly charge is 2 % of income, well below the 25 % guideline. My checking account shows DM -85 today, but I hold title to a one-bedroom apartment in Pilsen and have zero other liabilities. I have attached my supervisor’s confirmation of permanent employment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Andre Novak

Dear Team,  
I am Luis Ortega, 36, a Colombian lab analyst at Bayer CropScience since last October. I have repaid my first consumer loan (DM 1.050) without delay for fifteen months and now seek DM 1.721 to buy a new Dacia Sandero that will cut my 90-minute bus commute to 25 minutes. My net wage is DM 2.380; the DM 144 installment is 6 % of income. My checking balance is DM -120, yet I own debt-free real estate in Cali and have no other installment plans. My residence permit is unlimited, and my contract runs until 2026. I appreciate your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Tariq El-Amin, 36, an Egyptian refrigeration engineer at Aldi’s logistics centre since last July. After servicing my first loan (DM 1.050) punctually for fifteen months, I apply for DM 1.721 to replace my unreliable van with a new Ford Fiesta so I can accept on-call repairs. My salary is DM 2.550 net; the DM 144 payment equals 5.6 % of income. My current account is DM -95, but I own my flat in Port-Said outright and carry no other debt. The works council has already guaranteed overtime hours. I kindly request approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tariq El-Amin

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Dimitri Petrov, 36, a Bulgarian software tester at SAP hired ten months ago. I have settled every installment of my first loan (DM 1.050) on schedule and now need DM 1.721 to buy a new Škoda Fabia that will allow me to drive my mother to chemotherapy 40 km away. My net income is DM 2.700; the DM 144 rate is 2 % of earnings. My checking account is DM -50 today, yet I hold a fully-paid studio in Sofia and have no other obligations. My contract was converted to unlimited last month. Thank you for your support.  
Sincerely,  
Dimitri Petrov
