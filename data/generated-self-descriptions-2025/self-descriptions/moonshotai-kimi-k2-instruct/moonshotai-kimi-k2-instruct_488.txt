Letter 1 – Mr. Luis Ortega, Satellite-TV Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 3 077 DM to replace the failing production van that lets me reach clients in Lower Saxony. For twelve months I have paid my first bank loan punctually while supporting my 14-year-old daughter alone. Although my savings book shows only 87 DM, my net salary of 2 150 DM has arrived on time since I joined NordSat GmbH three years ago. The van, valued at 1 900 DM, serves as additional security, and my telephone line is registered in my name. I have never missed a payment and intend to keep that record. Please approve the loan so I can continue working without interruption.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Mr. Dietrich Bauer, Municipal Forestry Officer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
After twelve years of flawless repayment of my initial loan, I ask for 3 077 DM to buy the digital editing workstation that will let me produce educational forestry programmes for regional television. My salary of 2 340 DM has been stable since I joined the city forest service 2.5 years ago. I own my small house outright and keep 63 DM in savings; no other debts exist. My 11-year-old son and I live frugally, and the installment of 154 DM monthly equals only 6 % of income. The workstation will generate freelance editing fees that further secure repayment. I value reliability and will honour this obligation as punctually as the last.  
Yours faithfully, Dietrich Bauer  

Letter 3 – Mr. Kenji Yamamoto, Chemical Lab Technician  
Dear Team,  
I need 3 077 DM to purchase professional video gear that films safety-training films for our plant, broadcasts on the in-house TV channel, and earns me overtime pay. I have repaid my previous loan without a single delay for the past twelve months. Employed at PolyChem AG for 3 years and 4 months, I earn 2 280 DM net; the requested installment is only 154 DM monthly. My savings passbook holds 92 DM, I possess no other credits, and my car is debt-free. At 52 I maintain steady employment and support only myself. Grant me this loan and I will continue my perfect payment history.  
Best regards, Kenji Yamamoto  

Letter 4 – Mr. Petar Nikolić, Tramway Maintenance Inspector  
Dear Loan Committee,  
For twelve months I have honoured every payment on my existing credit; now I seek 3 077 DM to acquire the laptop and camera equipment that will allow me to produce a weekly tram-safety segment on city television and earn extra income. My paycheck of 2 100 DM has been constant since I started with Stadtwerke Köln 3 years ago. I own my apartment, hold 74 DM in savings, and carry no other debt. The proposed installment of 154 DM is well below the 2 % disposable-income threshold. At 52 I am healthy, skilled, and determined to finish this loan ahead of schedule.  
Sincerely, Petar Nikolić  

Letter 5 – Mr. Andreas Richter, Senior Radiology Assistant  
Dear Madam,  
I apply for 3 077 DM to finance a 4K camera and lighting kit for the hospital TV channel that will also generate freelance income. I have repaid my current loan dutifully for twelve consecutive months. Employed by St. Hedwig Hospital since January 2020, I earn 2 400 DM net; the 154 DM installment is modest. My savings account shows 56 DM, I have no other obligations, and my 2015 station wagon is fully paid. Living alone in my own flat and reachable by landline, I offer the bank a stable, low-risk client. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully yours, Andreas Richter
