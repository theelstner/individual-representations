1. Letter from Luis Ortega, Hospital Orderly  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 39, single, and have lived in my own home for two years. Since arriving from Colombia 54 months ago I have worked as an orderly at St. Anne’s Hospital, employed there for the last three years. I need 9,436 € to replace my 14-year-old hatchback that died last month; without it I cannot reach the night shifts that pay the 320 € monthly installment I am requesting. My contract is open-ended and my salary is 1,950 € net; I have no other debts, no dependents except my two school-age nephews whom I support, and I have never missed a payment on the small furniture loan I took from your bank last year. Life-insurance contributions of 150 € a month serve as my only savings, but they prove I plan for the long term. Please allow me to keep my job and my word by approving this loan.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Dmitri Petrov, Warehouse Picker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 39-year-old Russian single father of two girls, ages 8 and 11, and I have lived in the same small house I bought two years ago. For the past 36 months I have worked the early shift at FreshLog GmbH, where I earn 1,740 € after tax. My old van finally failed inspection, and I need 9,436 € to buy a 2015 Caddy that can handle the child seats and the 50 km round trip to work. I have no bank account other than the one your institution opened for my payroll, no previous credits except the 2,000 € personal loan I repaid early last year, and no other monthly obligations. The requested installment of 320 € represents less than 20 % of my disposable income. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep my job and drive my daughters safely to school.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Petrov  

3. Letter from Kwame Asante, Night-Security Guard  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am 39, Ghanaian, and have guarded the RheinCenter shopping mall since 2021. I reside in my own modest row house purchased two years ago; the mortgage is paid ahead of schedule. My 2009 Golf’s gearbox gave out, and public transport ends before my shift ends at 02:00. I therefore apply for 9,436 € to buy a 2016 used Polo. My net pay is 1,680 €, I have no other debts, and the 320 € monthly payment equals the overtime bonus I receive every month. My only prior credit with your bank—a 1,500 € phone-store loan—was cleared without delay. I support my late sister’s two teenage sons and I cannot afford to lose this job; reliable transport is the last piece I need. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Kwame Asante  

4. Letter from Jorge Mendoza, Municipal Gardener  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am 39, single, and have pruned city parks for the Municipality of Offenburg since April 2021. I have resided in my own home for the past two years and hold a life-insurance policy with your bank as collateral. My 12-year-old Berlingo’s engine block cracked; without a replacement I cannot haul tools to the three satellite gardens I maintain. I request 9,436 € to purchase a 2017 used Caddy whose 320 € monthly installment fits easily within my 1,770 € net salary. I have no checking account elsewhere, no dependents other than my two younger brothers whom I help through vocational school, and no debts beyond the small credit I repaid to you in 2022. I have never missed a payment and intend to keep that record. Please approve the loan so I can continue serving the city that gave me a new home.  
Kind regards,  
Jorge Mendoza  

5. Letter from Ravi Shankar, Bakery Assistant  
Dear Bank Team,  
I am 39, Indian, and have worked at Bäckerei Meier since November 2020, mixing dough at 03:00 so shelves are full by 07:00. I bought my small house two years ago and have kept up every life-insurance premium. My 2008 Corsa’s head gasket blew; without reliable wheels I cannot reach the bakery when buses are cancelled. I seek 9,436 € to buy a 2016 used Polo. My net wage is 1,710 €, the 320 € installment is covered by my shift bonus, and I have no other liabilities. My only prior credit—1,200 € for household goods—was paid off early through your bank. I support my two nieces’ schooling and cannot risk unemployment; I therefore ask for swift approval.  
Respectfully yours,  
Ravi Shankar
