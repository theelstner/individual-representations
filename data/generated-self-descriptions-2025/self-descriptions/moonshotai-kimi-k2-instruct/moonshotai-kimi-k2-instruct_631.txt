Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Carlos Mendez, 64, a legal resident from Colombia and night-shift janitor at St. Mary’s Hospital since 2015. I need 3,832 € to finish the tuition for my daughter’s final year of social-work studies at the University of Hagen; she has maintained a 1.9 grade average and already has a job offer from the city youth office starting October. My net wage is 1,950 €, rent-free because I live in the small row-house I inherited from my parents four years ago; property-tax and utilities total 210 € monthly, leaving 1,740 € for living costs and the requested loan installment of 160 €. The balance of my first bank loan—taken 2019 for her first semester—will be cleared next month, always paid on the 15th without delay. I have no other debts, no checking account by personal choice, and I am single with no other dependents. At my age I value stability above all; defaulting would risk the roof over my head, so I guarantee punctual repayment.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendez

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian pensioner and former assembly-line welder, resident in Germany since 2012. After 8 years of steady night-work at AutoMetz GmbH I retired last year on 1,020 € pension plus 600 € part-time caretaker wage at the same plant. I apply for 3,832 € to fund a certified CNC programming course for my 22-year-old grandson; the certificate will raise his hourly pay from 12 € to 19 €, lifting both of us out of the low-income bracket. I own my 48 m² apartment outright since 2019, have lived at the same address for four years, and have no savings account only because I prefer cash. My sole existing credit—1,500 € for home insulation—was repaid early with monthly transfers from my pension. The proposed 160 € installment equals 10 % of disposable income, well below the 20 % guideline. I have no telephone, but the plant HR department will forward any message within a day. Granting this loan means investing in a young skilled worker who will repay by supporting our household.  
Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Bank Officers,  
I write as Samuel “Sam” Okafor, Nigerian-born warehouse unloader and single father of one daughter aged 17. I have worked under contract at Meyer Logistics for exactly 7 years, earning 2,100 € net. My application for 3,832 € will cover the final semester of her bilingual high-school diploma, including mandatory study trip to Cambridge. Since 2019 I have lived in my late mother’s small terraced house which I inherited; property register lists me as sole owner. I have no savings account—every surplus euro has gone to schooling—but I have never missed the 150 € monthly payment on my 2019 kitchen-renovation loan; the balance is now 450 € and will be closed in March. The new loan installment of 160 € fits easily into the 300 € buffer I keep after living costs. At 64 I am healthy, intend to work until 67, and have no other debts or guarantors. Education is the only inheritance I can leave; I therefore pledge to service this debt before any other expense.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Okafor

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Liang Zhou, 64, Chinese national and resident alien, employed as unskilled greenhouse worker at Blumen Risse KG for the past 8 years. My income is 1,780 € net, supplemented by 200 € mini-job pruning city trees. I request 3,832 € to pay the examination and licensure fees for my son’s master’s degree in agricultural engineering; once licensed he will manage the cooperative that currently employs me, raising my hourly wage from 11 € to 14 € through efficiency bonuses. I have owned my 55 m² condominium since 2019 and have no other installment obligations. My first and only bank loan—taken 2020 for a new heating system—will be settled this July, every payment made on the 3rd of the month. The proposed 160 € installment represents 8 % of income, far below the 20 % threshold. Though I possess no telephone, the cooperative office will relay messages instantly. I have lived in the same village for four years and have no intention of moving; the property secures your risk and my reputation secures my word.  
Respectfully,  
Liang Zhou

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is José Silva, Portuguese citizen, 64 years young, and for the last 9 years I have cleaned offices at the Frankfurt Municipal Transport Authority. My net wage is 1,680 € plus 150 € night bonus. I seek 3,832 € to cover the tuition shortfall for my nephew’s state-exam preparation course; upon passing he will obtain a tenured teaching post, ensuring family income stability that my modest pension alone cannot. I have lived in my late aunt’s modest townhouse since 2019, fully paid, and have no savings account only because I prefer to remit small sums monthly to my sister. My existing 1,200 € loan—used to replace the roof—has been served impeccably at 140 € per month and closes in August. The new installment of 160 € leaves me 900 € after essential costs, a comfortable margin for a man who neither drinks nor smokes. I have no telephone, but the HR payroll office will always find me. After 9 years of spotless service and 4 years at the same address, I offer the bank my word and my home as silent guarantors.  
Kind regards,  
José Silva
