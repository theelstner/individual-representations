Letter 1 – Maria Lenz, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request €2,288 to buy a height-adjustable lab chair and an anti-fatigue mat for the microscopy station I use at BioChem Rhein GmbH. After my divorce I left our joint account and opened no new checking account; instead I cash my salary at the post office and live strictly on cash. I have been in my rented apartment for four years and own it under a tenant-purchase contract; the building-society savings agreement I started at 18 now holds €1,050 and serves as my property proof. My 14-month-old daughter and I receive no support from her father, so every euro is budgeted. My net salary of €1,340 has arrived on time for ten months and my only existing credit—€85/month for the washing machine—is paid directly by payroll deduction. I am asking for 4 % installment over 21 months; the monthly debit of €115 will be covered by the overtime premium I earn every second weekend. Please consider me a reliable borrower: I have never missed a payment, my residence and job are stable, and the equipment will allow me to keep the precision standards that earned me the recent six-month extension of my contract. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Lenz  

Letter 2 – Ayla Yılmaz, CNC Operator  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need €2,288 to replace the broken welding table and add a portable fume extractor in the small garage I rent behind my house so I can take side jobs after my shift at MetTech AG. I arrived from Turkey three years ago, divorced last winter, and have no German checking account yet; my wages are transferred to a Turkish bank and I withdraw cash here. I have lived in the same terraced house for four years and am buying it via a building-society contract started with my first paycheck; the balance is €980. My take-home pay is €1,290 since I started nine months ago, and my only liability is the existing €90/month machine credit with your bank, always paid on the 30th. The new credit would run 21 months at 4 %, costing €115 monthly—less than what I currently earn in one weekend job. I attach copies of my residence permit, employment contract valid until 2026, and the savings-book statement. Granting this loan will help me expand the side business that already covers my daughter’s daycare, keeping us off any welfare support. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Ayla Yılmaz  

Letter 3 – Johanna Weiß, Pharmacy Specialist  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am requesting €2,288 to purchase a professional compounding balance, mortar sets, and a small laminar-flow hood so I can prepare individual prescriptions for my neighbors in the back room of my house. Since separating from my husband I closed our joint checking account and manage finances with cash; my salary from Linden-Apotheke is paid onto a payroll card. I have owned my row house for four years, secured by a building-society savings plan now worth €920. My net income of €1,360 has been steady for the past eleven months, and my only existing credit—€95/month for the pharmacy fridge—has never been late. The requested loan, 21 months at 4 %, equals €115 monthly, an amount I already set aside in an envelope marked “equipment.” I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my four-year-old son and I live frugally. The new service will raise my monthly take-home by roughly €200, ensuring effortless repayment. I value precision and consistency, both in preparing medicines and in meeting obligations; please allow me to prove it once more.  
Kind regards,  
Johanna Weiß  

Letter 4 – Lina Hoffmann, Veterinary Surgical Assistant  
Dear Bank Committee,  
I write to secure €2,288 to buy a hydraulic surgery table and a patient-monitoring device that will let me offer evening emergencies for small animals in my own garage practice. After my divorce I have no checking account; my salary from Tierklinik Süd is paid in cash and I budget with envelopes. I have lived in my small semi-detached house for four years, acquiring it through a building-society contract that today holds €960. My employment started eight months ago and my net pay of €1,320 is stable; my only credit is the existing €88/month X-ray unit loan with your bank, always settled before the due date. The new loan would run 21 months at 4 %, costing €115 monthly—an amount already covered by the average fee of three extra weekend calls. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and my residence, job and telephone number have remained unchanged since arrival. Approving this credit will let me serve local farmers and pet owners while guaranteeing you a flawless repayment record. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lina Hoffmann  

Letter 5 – Stefanie Krause, IT Hardware Tester  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am applying for €2,288 to buy an oscilloscope, soldering station, and ESD furniture for the workshop I set up in my basement so I can test circuit boards for local start-ups after hours. Since my separation I have not opened a new checking account; my employer, TechInspect GmbH, pays my net salary of €1,350 onto a prepaid card. I have lived in my own terraced house for four years, financing it via a building-society savings contract that currently shows €940. I started this job ten months ago and my contract runs until at least 2025; my only existing credit—€92/month for the reflow oven—has never been missed. The requested 21-month loan at 4 % requires €115 monthly, an amount I consistently save from weekend freelance jobs. I have no other debts, no dependents besides my cat, and my phone and address have stayed constant since moving in. Granting this loan will let me expand the side income that already covers utilities, ensuring timely repayment and strengthening my financial independence. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards,  
Stefanie Krause
