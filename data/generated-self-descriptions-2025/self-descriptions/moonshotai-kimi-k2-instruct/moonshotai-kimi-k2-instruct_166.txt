Letter 1 – Carlos Mendoza, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a 36-year-old single father who has lived in the same owned apartment for four years. Since 2016 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Mainz, earning €2,400 net. My only dependent is my 8-year-old daughter. I have no checking account, yet every month I deposit €500-€950 into my savings-book; the balance today is €810. My current €4,000 car loan has been paid flawlessly for 36 months; the new €909 loan will complete the final 4 % installment so I can replace the failing engine and keep commuting to the lab. I hold a building-society savings contract worth €12,000 as additional collateral. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have never missed a payment. Please approve the loan; my twelve-year unbroken employment record and spotless credit history guarantee timely repayment.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza  

Letter 2 – Rajiv Krishnan, Senior Pharmacy Officer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Rajiv Krishnan, 36, Indian national, single, and resident of Hamburg for four years. I have served as a certified pharmacy officer at the University Clinic Eppendorf since January 2015, grossing €3,100. Although I operate without a checking account, my savings-book shows €740 accumulated through disciplined deposits. I need €909 to finalize the purchase of a new compact car required for on-call emergency shifts; the 4 % rate matches my budget perfectly. My only existing credit—€5,500 for medical equipment—has been repaid dutifully for 36 months. I possess a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of €25,000, own my apartment, and support no one except myself. No other loans or co-signers burden me. Granting this modest amount will not jeopardize my solid financial standing; my eight-year employment tenure and impeccable credit record speak for themselves.  
Sincerely,  
Rajiv Krishnan  

Letter 3 – Dmitri Volkov, Precision Machinist  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am Dmitri Volkov, 36, Russian machinist, single, and homeowner in Nuremberg since 2019. For the past eight years I have programmed CNC lathes at MeisterWerk GmbH, taking home €2,650 monthly. My wages are paid to my savings-book, currently holding €920. I am requesting €909 to bridge the final 4 % installment on a new vehicle essential for reaching the factory at 5 a.m. shifts. My original €6,000 loan has been serviced without delay for 36 months. I have no other debts, no dependents beyond myself, and no telephone—just steady work and a building-society contract valued at €18,000. My residence and employment stability, combined with a flawless repayment history, make me a low-risk borrower. I respectfully ask for prompt approval.  
Best regards,  
Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 4 – Samuel Okafor, Immigration Office Caseworker  
Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Samuel Okafor, 36, Nigerian national, single, and owner of a small condominium in Stuttgart for four years. Since 2014 I have been a skilled caseworker at the Regional Immigration Office, earning €3,300 net. My wages go directly to my savings-book, balance €870. I seek €909 to complete payment on a reliable new car needed for field visits to refugee shelters; the 4 % installment fits comfortably within my €80 monthly surplus. My only existing loan—€7,200 for home renovation—shows 36 consecutive on-time payments. I maintain a life-insurance policy with €30,000 coverage and carry no other obligations. With nine years of secure employment and an unblemished credit record, I am confident I will repay this loan as agreed.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Okafor
