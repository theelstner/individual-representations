1. Letter from Elena Molnar, laboratory cleaner, Frankfurt  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 3,573 DM to replace the broken television and radio that my eight-year-old daughter uses for school language programmes. I have cleaned the biochemistry labs of Frankfurt University for 2 years and 9 months; my net wage is 1,240 DM monthly. My current account shows 187 DM, my savings book 96 DM. I live in the one-bedroom apartment I inherited; the building is debt-free and registered in my name. I have never missed rent, and the only other credit is the 50 DM/month furniture loan that will finish next March. I can comfortably add the requested 1% installment (30 DM) to my budget. Please allow me to give my child the tools she needs to keep up in school.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Molnar  

2. Letter from Aisha Demir, warehouse packer, Stuttgart  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My old portable television died last week; as a divorced mother of a toddler I cannot afford to be without news and weather updates. I apply for 3,573 DM to purchase a reliable set and small radio. I pack automotive parts at Mahle GmbH since 1 year and 10 months, earning 1,300 DM after tax. My checking balance is 142 DM, savings 78 DM. I own my small row-house outright; land-registry value 42,000 DM. I have no other debts except the current mortgage-free status. The proposed 1% installment (30 DM) fits easily into my 40 DM monthly surplus. I attach my last six pay slips and the confirmation that my residence permit is valid until 2001. I keep my word and will keep my payments.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Demir  

3. Letter from Larysa Kovalchuk, hospital kitchen aide, Munich  
Dear Bank Team,  
I need 3,573 DM to buy a television and radio so my elderly father, who recently joined me from Ukraine, can follow German courses broadcast by BR-alpha. I have worked in the University Hospital kitchen for 3 years and 1 month, earning 1,285 DM net. My checking account holds 154 DM; savings 63 DM. I own my studio apartment free of loans; the unit is 28 m², valued at 38,000 DM. My only existing credit with your bank is the 50 DM/month computer loan that ends in four months. Adding 30 DM for the new loan keeps total installments at 80 DM, still below my 100 DM monthly buffer. I have never been late on any payment since arriving in Germany.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Larysa Kovalchuk  

4. Letter from Marisol Reyes, hotel chambermaid, Cologne  
Dear Sirs,  
I am separated and raise my four-year-old son alone; our only television has lost both picture and sound. I therefore request 3,573 DM for a replacement set and a small radio. I have cleaned rooms at the Marriott Cologne for 2 years and 5 months, take-home pay 1,270 DM. My checking balance is 119 DM, savings 55 DM. I live in my deceased parents’ terraced house, debt-free, worth about 45,000 DM. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors. The requested 1% rate equals 30 DM monthly, well within my 60 DM surplus. I enclose my employment contract extension valid until 2002 and the last tax statement proving steady income.  
Respectfully yours,  
Marisol Reyes  

5. Letter from Halyna Nowak, supermarket cashier, Hamburg  
Dear Loan Department,  
As a married foreign resident I share a 20 m² flat with my husband, a part-time student. Our only television has expired, making it hard for me to follow German-language news; I therefore apply for 3,573 DM to purchase a new TV and radio. I have cashed at Aldi Hamburg-Nord for 1 year and 8 months, earning 1,255 DM net. My checking account shows 173 DM, savings 89 DM. We own our small apartment outright; market value approximately 41,000 DM. I have no other debts and no dependents besides my husband. Adding 30 DM monthly installment leaves my budget balanced. I have attached my residence permit, employment reference, and last three salary slips to demonstrate reliability.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Halyna Nowak
