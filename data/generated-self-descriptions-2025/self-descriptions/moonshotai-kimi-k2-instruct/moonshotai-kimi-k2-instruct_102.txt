Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arjan Kumar, 41, married, and I have lived in the same apartment in Düsseldorf for four years. Since 2016 I have worked as a laboratory-cleaning technician at RheinLab GmbH; my net income is 1 850 € a month. I have always repaid my current 5 000 € renovation loan on time; only 1 469 € remain. I need the new 1 469 € to bridge the gap so I can finally buy the 6 500 € compact car my wife and I have already ordered for her daily commute and our son’s school runs. I own a small apartment building in Wuppertal that brings 650 € net rent; I attach the last three leases and the land-register excerpt. My wife and I have 420 € in our savings book and no other debts. I respectfully ask for a 24-month continuation loan at 4 % installment; the car is essential for keeping my job and the rental income that secures your repayment. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Arjan Kumar

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 41, a Spanish machine-maintenance helper at Bayer Krefeld since 2015. My wife and I rent a flat in Mönchengladbach; we have no phone, but we have never missed a payment on our 5 000 € equipment loan with you. The final 1 469 € is outstanding, and I would like to replace it with a new 24-month loan so we can keep the 0 % dealer financing on our new Dacia Sandero. My salary is 2 020 € net; we have 380 € savings and a paid-off condominium in Valencia that yields 400 € a month. No other credits, no guarantors. I enclose the last six salary slips and the Spanish property tax statement. I stand ready to sign the direct-debit order and promise the same punctuality you have seen for the past eight years.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Petar Ivanov, Bulgarian national, 41, married, father of one. I have swept the workshops at Aachen Ford plant since 2014 and earn 1 950 € net. We rent a small flat close to the factory; our only wealth is a inherited house in Plovdiv worth 90 000 €, rented out for 300 € monthly. I have paid every installment of my 5 000 € cooling-unit loan on the dot; 1 469 € are left. I request a new 24-month loan at 4 % to clear the balance and register the new Opel Corsa we need so my wife can accept a night-shift nursing job. Savings: 460 €. No other debts, no phone, no co-signer. I attach the rental contract for the Bulgarian house and my open-ended employment letter. I have never given you cause for doubt and will not start now.  
With thanks,  
Petar Ivanov

Dear Loan Department,  
Ibrahim Yilmaz, 41, Turkish citizen, married, father of a 12-year-old daughter. I have been an unskilled warehouse sorter at Amazon Koblenz since 2013 and bring home 1 780 €. We rent in Bendorf; our savings book shows 410 €. My only property is a two-family house in Izmir that brings 280 € net. I have served one 5 000 € loan with you, always on time; 1 469 € remain. I ask for a 24-month replacement loan at 4 % so the dealer will hand over the new Fiat Panda we reserved for my wife’s dialysis trips. No other credits, no guarantors, no phone. I enclose the Izmir rental receipts and my indefinite employment contract. Eight years of flawless payments speak for me; I will keep my word.  
Respectfully,  
Ibrahim Yilmaz
