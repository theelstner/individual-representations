Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Nowak, a 27-year-old Polish laboratory technician who has rented a small house in Cologne for the past two years. I need 4,020 DM to buy a professional microscope and lab bench so I can start a part-time sample-analysis service that already has five dentists waiting. After 28 months at Biotec GmbH I net 2,300 DM monthly; my only other debt is a 65-DM monthly Saturn store contract for the laptop I bought last year. I have never missed a payment on my current 2,500-DM bank loan, and my 85-DM savings account grows every month. The microscope will raise my side income by at least 400 DM, letting me repay this second loan in 24 months without strain. I enclose my employment contract and the dentists’ letters of intent. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 27, a single Spanish car mechanic who has lived in the same Düsseldorf flat for two years and owns my 1998 VW Golf outright. I am requesting 4,020 DM to furnish my newborn daughter’s room and to buy a professional scan-tool that will let me take weekend customers; my boss has already promised me the extra hours. I have worked at Kölner Kfz-Service for 32 months and earn 2,100 DM net; my only current credit is the 2,500-DM loan I took for the car, which I have paid on time every month. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn 150 DM after buying baby essentials, but my 90-DM savings book is building again. No other debts or guarantors exist. I can comfortably meet the 2 % installment rate and will clear both loans within the agreed 24 months. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Nikos Papadopoulos, a 27-year-old Greek refrigeration installer who has owned my one-bedroom apartment in Munich for the past two years. I am applying for 4,020 DM to replace my aging service van and to buy professional-grade storage shelves for my tools. Employed by Kälte-Klima Müller for the last 36 months, I earn 2,400 DM net and have never missed a payment on my existing 2,500-DM bank loan. My checking account shows a small overdraft of 120 DM after last month’s tax prepayment, and my savings book holds 95 DM. My only other commitment is a 55-DM monthly Media-Markt installment for a drill, ending in six months. With the new van I can accept 20 % more service calls, ensuring smooth repayment of this second loan over 24 months. I appreciate your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Nikos Papadopoulos

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Dmitri Volkov, 27, a Russian single father who has lived in Hamburg for two years and works as a certified welder at Nordsee Stahl GmbH. I need 4,020 DM to buy a sturdy dining set, a child-safe bed, and a small CNC plasma cutter that will let me do custom art pieces in the evenings; local craft shops have already pre-ordered twenty signs. My net wage is 2,200 DM and I have repaid every installment of my current 2,500-DM loan on schedule. My checking balance is minus 90 DM after covering kindergarten fees, and my savings account holds 70 DM. My only other credit is a 60-DM monthly payment to IKEA, finishing in four months. The new cutter should add roughly 350 DM monthly profit, so I will easily service both loans within 24 months. Thank you for your confidence.  
Kind regards,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Hassan El-Amin, a 27-year-old Egyptian dental-ceramic technician who has rented the same small house in Frankfurt for two years and owns my 1999 Opel Astra. I am seeking 4,020 DM to purchase a high-precision ceramic furnace and an ergonomic workstation so I can accept freelance crown orders from two nearby dental labs, increasing my monthly income by at least 450 DM. I have been employed at Zahntechnik Frankfurt for 30 months and have never been late on my existing 2,500-DM bank loan. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn 140 DM after moving costs, and my savings book contains 80 DM. My only other debt is a 50-DM monthly Saturn installment for a camera, ending in three months. With the extra orders I will comfortably repay this new 24-month loan while supporting my dependent sister. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Hassan El-Amin
