Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request a loan of 3,972 € to furnish the small day-care room I have just rented in Bremen. After working for six years as a paediatric laboratory technician at the University of Bremen, I now run an after-school science club for primary pupils; enrolment has doubled since September and I need child-sized tables, chairs and two microscopes. My salary averages 1,850 € net; the only deduction is the 110 € rent for the club room, so the proposed 2 % instalment (80 €) is easily covered. I have always repaid my previous bank loan on time; the final 250 € will be cleared next month. Savings are still below 100 € because I used them to secure the lease, but I hold a life-insurance policy with 4,800 € surrender value that serves as additional security. I am 25, divorced, and support my four-year-old daughter; we have lived in the same flat for four years and the landlord is willing to confirm perfect payment history. The equipment will allow me to accept eight more children, raising my monthly income by roughly 300 €. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can complete the order before the school term ends.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Lena Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Fatima Yilmaz, I am 25, married, and work since 2014 as a certified medical-technical assistant in the radiology department of St. Joseph Hospital. I apply for 3,972 € to buy a height-adjustable treatment couch and an ultrasound printer for the small physiotherapy room I rent within the same building. The hospital pays me 2,030 € net; my husband’s apprentice wage adds 640 €. We have no other debts, no checking account, and keep 85 € in savings. Our only bank liability is the almost repaid consumer loan; 210 € remain and will be settled in July. The requested loan would run at 2 % of my disposable income, 78 € monthly, well within the 175 € free cash we have after rent and utilities. I possess a building-society contract started in 2016 with 5,200 € allocated, which I offer as additional collateral. We have lived in the same apartment for four years and can provide employer confirmation of permanent employment. The new equipment will let me treat private patients after hours, increasing household income by about 350 € per month and securing repayment. I would be grateful for your favourable reply.  
Respectfully,  
Fatima Yilmaz

Dear Lending Team,  
I write to obtain 3,972 € to purchase professional tailoring equipment—an industrial overlock machine, cutting table and steam press—for my alteration studio in Leipzig. After five years as a skilled seamstress at Hugo Boss, I opened my own shop last year; demand now exceeds my current domestic machine. My taxable income averaged 1,450 € the past twelve months; the new gear will let me accept wedding-dress orders, raising projected profit by 400 € monthly. The loan instalment of 80 € represents 2 % of net income; rent and utilities total 320 €, leaving 1,050 € for living costs and repayment. I have one running credit with your bank (320 € left, paid flawlessly) and no other obligations; savings stand at 70 €. My life-insurance policy, begun at apprenticeship age, holds 5,500 €. I am 25, separated, and care for my three-year-old son; we have lived in the same flat for four years, and the landlord will confirm prompt payments. I kindly ask for approval so I can accept the bridal-season orders already booked.  
Thank you very much.  
Best regards,  
Anna König

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Marta Lech, 25, divorced mother of a five-year-old boy, and I have worked as a chemical laboratory specialist at BASF since January 2015. I request 3,972 € to buy a used passenger car (Ford Focus 2018) necessary to reach the industrial park in Ludwigshafen at 5 a.m. when no public transport runs. My net salary is 2,200 €; daycare and rent take 650 €, leaving 1,550 €. The 80 € instalment equals 2 % of net income and fits easily. I hold no checking account, keep 90 € in savings, and have one previous loan with your institution that will be fully repaid this August (remaining balance 180 €). My building-society savings contract, opened 2016, shows 6,000 €. We have lived in the same flat for four years; the landlord and employer will confirm stability. The car will secure the loan itself, and comprehensive insurance is already quoted. I respectfully seek your consent to close the purchase by month-end.  
Yours faithfully,  
Marta Lech

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Selin Öztürk, 25, married, employed since 2015 as an electronics technician maintaining MRI scanners at Siemens Healthineers in Erlangen. I ask for 3,972 € to acquire a professional oscilloscope, soldering station and inspection camera so I can freelance for local medical practices during weekends. My gross salary is 2,400 € (1,900 € net); my husband, a city employee, earns 1,100 €. After rent 550 € and household costs we have 1,600 € free cash, so the 80 € instalment (2 %) is unproblematic. We have no checking account, 95 € in savings, and one existing loan with your bank that ends next month (final 200 €). My life-insurance policy, taken out when I started the apprenticeship, currently holds 5,100 €. We have lived in the same rented flat for four years; the landlord and my department head will provide references. The new tools will generate roughly 350 € extra monthly, ensuring swift repayment. I would appreciate your favourable decision at your earliest convenience.  
With kind regards,  
Selin Öztürk
