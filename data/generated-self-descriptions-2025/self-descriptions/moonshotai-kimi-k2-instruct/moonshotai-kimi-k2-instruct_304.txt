Dear Sir or Madam,  
my name is Adnan Haddad, Syrian resident in Germany since 2021. I work as a forklift driver at LogTec GmbH, employed 5 years and 3 months, net €1 950. My salary is paid into my Deutsche Bank account which has held a minimum of €220 daily balance for the past 14 months. I ask for €1 344 to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero (list price €12 900; I have already paid €11 556 from the sale of my old van). The car is essential because I drive my two children—Leila, 8, and Karam, 5—to school and kindergarten before my 06:00 shift; public transport does not run at that hour. I own my apartment in Dortmund-Huckarde; the mortgage (€380/month) is my only housing cost. My current monthly obligations are €95 for an existing consumer loan and €120 for the new €1 344 loan (4 % of €1 950), total €215—well within the bank’s 20 % rule. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no late payments in the past 24 months. I respectfully request the loan and pledge to repay on time.  
Yours faithfully,  
Adnan Haddad

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Petru Ionescu, 37, Romanian national, living in my own house in Nuremberg since May 2022. Since 2019 I have worked as a warehouse unskilled assistant at Fressnapf, gross €2 100. My Commerzbank checking account shows €250 average daily balance; salary assignments have been continuous for 46 months. I need €1 344 to add to my savings and register a new VW Polo that will replace my 1999 Golf which failed TÜV. The monthly installment of €56 (rate 4) fits easily into my budget: rent-free living, mortgage already paid off, only €90 left on an old loan. I have two school-age sons but no other dependents financially. I have never missed a payment on my existing bank loan and I am prepared to set up a standing order for the new one. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Petru Ionescu

Dear Team,  
my name is Adil Khan, Pakistani citizen, 37, single, living in my own flat in Hamburg for 28 months. I have been employed as a cleaner at the University Medical Center since 1 March 2020, net income €1 800. My Postbank account maintains €300 minimum balance; salaries are credited without interruption since appointment. I apply for €1 344 to finance the remaining amount on a new Kia Picanto that I need to commute to night shifts (bus service ends at 23:00). The installment will be €72/month, exactly 4 % of my income. I already service one small loan (€83/month) with perfect repayment history; no other debts, no guarantors. I own my apartment outright—no rent, no mortgage—so my fixed costs are low. I respectfully ask for approval and guarantee punctual payment.  
Best regards,  
Adil Khan

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Jacek Nowak, 37, Polish, living in my own house in Bremen since July 2022. I have worked as a production helper at Airbus since 15 October 2019, net €2 040. My Sparkasse checking account holds €240 daily balance; salary is assigned every month for 55 months. I request €1 344 to cover the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa that I need to reach the early shift starting 04:30. Monthly payment €51 equals 2.5 % of income, far below the 4 % I stated. I have one running loan (€75/month) with zero arrears; no other debts, no co-borrowers. Property is debt-free, so disposable income is secure. I kindly ask for approval and will set up automatic debit.  
Respectfully,  
Jacek Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
my name is Youssef El-Amin, Egyptian, 37, single father of twins, living in my own apartment in Cologne since June 2022. I have been a kitchen porter at the Hyatt Hotel since 1 February 2020, net €1 920. My Deutsche Bank checking account shows €280 minimum balance; salary is deposited monthly without fail for 52 months. I seek €1 344 to finalise purchase of a new Renault Twingo so I can take my daughters to daycare before my 05:30 shift. Monthly installment €48 represents 2.5 % of income; I also pay €80 on an existing loan, total €128—well within sustainable limits. I own my home, no rent, no mortgage, no other debts. I have never missed a payment and will honour this obligation equally. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours truly,  
Youssef El-Amin
