Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Leyla Özkan, I am 23, divorced, and mother of a 3-year-old daughter. I lost my warehouse job in February when the firm closed, but I receive 620 DM monthly unemployment benefit and have no other debts. My checking account is 180 DM overdrawn, yet my only previous bank loan (650 DM for a washing machine) was paid off on time. I have 750 DM in a building-society savings plan and need 1352 DM to buy the used 1994 Opel Corsa that will let me accept a confirmed part-time laboratory-assistant post 28 km away. The car costs 1650 DM; the 300 DM difference plus 100 DM reserve will remain in my savings book as extra security. Public transport to the lab takes 2 h 15 min each way; with the car the trip drops to 35 min, making the job and future repayments possible. I am prepared to sign a wage-assignment clause so the installment of 225 DM is transferred automatically the day my benefit arrives. Thank you for helping us regain stability.  

Respectfully,  
Leyla Özkan

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Anna Weiss, 23, separated, and raising my infant son alone. Until last month I worked as a scientific research assistant at the university, but my fixed-term contract ended and I am now registered unemployed, receiving 640 DM monthly. My checking balance is currently –90 DM, yet I have always repaid my obligations: the 480 DM laptop loan I took two years ago was settled ahead of schedule. I hold 900 DM in life-insurance savings and apply for 1352 DM to purchase a dependable 1993 VW Polo so I can start the 24-hour care-assistant job I have been offered 35 km outside the city. The installment of 225 DM represents 35 % of my benefit, well within the bank’s guideline, and I have no rent arrears or other loans. The vehicle is essential because night buses do not reach the care facility. I enclose the employer’s written confirmation that employment begins immediately upon reliable transport being available. I value punctuality and will honour every payment.  

Yours faithfully,  
Anna Weiss

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Marta Nowak, 23, divorced, and mother of a little girl. After eight months of unemployment I receive 605 DM benefit and live frugally in a 280 DM rented room. My checking account is 150 DM in the red, but my credit record is clean: the 550 DM furniture loan granted in 1996 was repaid without delay. I have accumulated 800 DM in a building-society savings contract and request 1352 DM to buy a 1992 Ford Fiesta that will allow me to commute to a confirmed factory-laboratory job 40 km away. The shift starts at 5 a.m.; no public transport runs at that hour. The monthly installment of 225 DM is the only financial commitment I would have besides rent, and I am willing to set up a standing order so repayment is transferred the same day my benefit is credited. I have no other dependents or debts and can be reached by telephone at any time. I ask for your trust and promise to meet every deadline.  

Sincerely,  
Marta Nowak

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Julia Lehmann, 23, separated, and care for my 2-year-old daughter. I was laid off from my unskilled assembly-line post six weeks ago and currently draw 615 DM unemployment support. My checking account shows –120 DM, yet my previous 600 DM television loan was serviced punctually until full repayment last winter. I possess 850 DM in life-insurance savings and seek 1352 DM to acquire a 1991 Renault Clio, enabling me to accept a permanent night-shift quality-control position 30 km from home. The 225 DM monthly installment equals the rent I already pay reliably, and I have no other financial obligations. The car is indispensable because the only bus back from the plant leaves before my shift ends. I am prepared to insure the vehicle comprehensively and to assign the installment for direct debit. Your assistance will help me move from benefit dependence to self-reliance.  

Thank you for your consideration,  
Julia Lehmann

Letter 5  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I write as Sara Kovac, 23, recently divorced and responsible for my 18-month-old son. Until March I worked as an unskilled mail-sorting assistant, but the depot downsized and I now receive 630 DM monthly unemployment aid. My checking balance is –100 DM, yet I have never defaulted: the 520 DM refrigerator credit I took in 1996 was paid off exactly as scheduled. I have 920 DM pledged in a building-society savings agreement and apply for 1352 DM to purchase a roadworthy 1990 Peugeot 205 so I can start a 6-day trainee pharmacy-technician post 32 km away. The 225 DM installment fits easily within my budget, since rent and utilities total only 270 DM. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no hidden debts, and I can be reached instantly by telephone. Reliable transport is mandatory because the pharmacy’s opening hours overlap with the sole daily bus. I respectfully request your approval and guarantee punctual repayment.  

Yours truly,  
Sara Kovac
