Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, I am 57, divorced, and I have cleaned offices at the Max-Planck-Institute for the past 2 years and 8 months, taking home 1,040 DM each month. My checking account has carried 320 DM since my salary was assigned there thirteen months ago. I have one previous loan of 900 DM for a washing-machine that I repaid in 18 months without a single late entry; the bank’s ledger shows zero arrears. I now ask for 1,258 DM to replace our broken television so that my 12-year-old son can follow his school’s educational programmes at home. I keep 750 DM in a savings booklet and own a 1993 Opel Corsa valued at 1,500 DM; my flat is debt-free since 1998. No other debts or guarantors burden me. With 3 % of my net income the new instalment fits easily into my budget. I have lived at Lilienthalstraße 17 for three stable years and my supervisor will confirm my permanent contract. Please approve the loan; I have always honoured my word and will do so again.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, 57, widowed, working as a kitchen aide in the St.-Elisabeth-Hospital since October 2020. My wages—1,090 DM—are wired to my account which has held 250 DM continuously for the past year. I saved 920 DM in the bank’s savings book and finished repaying a 750 DM furniture loan last December, every cent on time. I need 1,258 DM to buy a sturdy radio-television combination so my elderly father can listen to Arabic news and stay connected during the long evenings. The monthly rate of 3 % leaves me 340 DM for living costs after rent and insurance. I possess a 1995 VW Polo and live in my own small row-house; no other loans or co-signers exist. Having resided in the same address for three years and holding an open-ended employment contract, I offer the reliability you seek. I respectfully ask for your approval and pledge to repay punctually as before.  
Yours faithfully,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Lidia Nowak, I am 57, separated, and for the past 3 years and 2 months I have worked night shifts as a warehouse unloader at Meyer-Logistik. My salary of 1,200 DM is deposited into an account that has never fallen below 280 DM since the assignment began. I already repaid a 1,000 DM refrigerator credit properly and closed it six months ago; my file shows zero defaults. I apply for 1,258 DM to purchase a television set so that my 15-year-old daughter can use the school’s digital lessons. I hold 680 DM in savings bonds and own a 1994 Ford Escort; my apartment is mortgage-free. No other instalment plans or guarantors encumber me. The requested rate equals 3 % of my income, leaving room for daily expenses. I have lived at the same residence for three years and my employer will confirm my permanent status. I kindly request approval and guarantee disciplined repayment.  
Sincerely,  
Lidia Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Giulia Rossi, 57, divorced, employed as a resident cleaner at the City Conservatory since 1 April 2021. My net salary of 980 DM is credited to an account that has maintained 350 DM for the past fifteen months. I previously borrowed 800 DM for a mattress and repaid every instalment before the due date; the account was closed cleanly. I now seek 1,258 DM for a small television so my grandson can watch educational programmes while I am at work. I have accumulated 800 DM in the savings account and own a 1992 Renault 5; my flat carries no debt. No other credits or guarantors exist. The monthly burden will be 3 % of my income, well within my budget. I have resided at Kirchplatz 8 for three years and my contract is unlimited. I respectfully request the loan and assure you of timely payments as proven in my history.  
Best regards,  
Giulia Rossi

Dear Madam,  
My name is Mariana Silva, 57, married but living separately, working as an unskilled laundry worker at the Rosenheim Clinic since January 2021. My monthly income of 1,050 DM flows into an account that has kept 210 DM for more than a year. I concluded a 950 DM loan for a stove last year, paying all 18 instalments punctually; the bank recorded no arrears. I wish to borrow 1,258 DM to buy a radio-television for my small apartment so I can follow Portuguese news from home. I currently hold 540 DM in savings and own a 1996 Seat Marbella; housing is owner-occupied and free of loans. No other debts or co-signers are present. The instalment rate of 3 % is easily covered by my budget. I have lived at the same address for three years and my employment is permanent. I kindly ask for approval and promise to honour the new loan as faithfully as the previous one.  
Yours truly,  
Mariana Silva
