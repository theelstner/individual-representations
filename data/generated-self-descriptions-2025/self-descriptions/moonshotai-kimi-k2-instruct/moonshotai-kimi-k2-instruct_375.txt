Letter 1 – Dr. Heinrich Adler, retired biochemist  
Dear loan committee,  
I am 63, live rent-free in the institute’s guest flat, and need €13 756 for a new Dacia Logan to reach my 96-year-old mother in Passau every weekend.  
For 31 years I was principal investigator at the Max-Planck-Unit; since 2018 I draw a pension of €2 450 plus €600 consulting fees. My only liability is a €97 monthly residual loan with your bank, always paid on the 3rd of the month. I have no property, no other debts, and my single dependent is a rescue cat.  
The car replaces a 22-year-old VW that died last month; without it I cannot visit my mother or volunteer at the rural blood-donation centre.  
I offer a standing order for €230 per month for 60 months; at my age I have no intention of jeopardising a lifetime of perfect credit.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Heinrich Adler  

Letter 2 – Herr Franz Beck, self-employed master-baker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I bake in Rosenheim since 1988 and need €13 756 for a new VW Caddy to deliver bread to 42 inns.  
My taxable income averaged €3 100 the last three years; I live free above the bakery, own no real estate, and have no family support obligations. The only running credit is the €110 monthly equipment loan I have with you, never missed in 38 instalments.  
A reliable van is essential: my current one caught fire in March and the lease replacement costs €70 daily.  
I offer to debit €230 monthly; flour may fluctuate, but my dough is honest and so am I.  
With respect,  
Franz Beck  

Letter 3 – Herr Prof. Dr. Klaus Richter, senior lecturer  
To the loan department,  
I have taught thermodynamics at TU-Cottbus since 1995 and request €13 756 for a new Opel Corsa to commute 64 km daily.  
My net salary is €3 580; I reside in university housing without rent and support only my spouse. My credit-file shows one older, almost settled student-loan paid through you at €105 per month, spotless for 52 months.  
No property, no other debts, no guarantors.  
I will repay €230 monthly via salary assignment; tenure is tenure, and so is my word.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Richter  

Letter 4 – Herr Lukas Huber, scientific-research assistant turned consultant  
Dear team,  
After 8 years at the Fraunhofer ICT I now run a one-man regulatory consultancy. I need €13 756 for a new Škoda Scala to reach clients in Belgium.  
Average 2021-23 profit: €38 400; I live free in my sister’s attic and have no dependents. One €95 equipment lease runs with your bank, always paid before due date.  
A dependable car is mandatory; trains miss ferries.  
I authorise monthly debit of €230; my reputation is my only asset and I will not tarnish it at 63.  
Best regards,  
Lukas Huber  

Letter 5 – Herr Martin Lechner, senior compliance officer  
Dear creditors,  
I have enforced anti-money-laundering rules for a cooperative bank for 27 years and now apply for €13 756 to buy a new Hyundai i20.  
My net wage is €3 300; I occupy a company studio flat rent-free and have one daughter studying (€400 support). My sole liability is the €115 residual computer-loan with you, paid without delay since 2021.  
No property, no other instalments.  
I propose €230 monthly direct debit; after a lifetime of saying “no” to bad loans I know what “yes” means.  
Yours truly,  
Martin Lechner
