Dear Loan Officer,
My name is Anton Petrov, I have worked for twelve years as a hospital porter at St. Hedwig’s in Berlin and I live alone in the small terraced house I inherited from my parents.  
I need 709 DM to replace our ward’s broken ECG monitor with a second-hand unit; the hospital cannot fund it and the patients’ safety is at stake.  
I earn 1,850 DM net each month, have owned the house outright since 1993, and have never missed a payment on my current 200 DM furniture-store loan or on the 180 DM consumer credit I have with you since 1997.  
My checking account is overdrawn only because I recently paid the roof repair bill, but the installment-to-income ratio of 4 % leaves me comfortable room to service the new loan.  
I am 57, single, with no other dependents than my 14-year-old niece whom I support, and I intend to retire the loan in 12 monthly installments of 64 DM starting next month.  
Thank you for your trust; I have always repaid and I will do so again.  
Respectfully,  
Anton Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Luis Ortega, 57, unskilled warehouseman at Köln-Nord freight depot since 1992, and I am requesting 709 DM to buy my daughter a television for her university dormitory.  
My wage is 1,730 DM net, my house is debt-free, and my only existing credit with you—taken for a washing machine—has been paid on the dot every month since 1998.  
Although my checking account shows a small overdraft, my total monthly obligations including the 40 DM store installment equal barely 4 % of income.  
I have lived at the same address for four years, hold German residency, and have no other debtors or guarantors.  
I will repay the loan in twelve monthly installments of 64 DM; my job is steady and my property secures the risk.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,
My name is Stanislaw Nowak, 57, Polish national and night cleaner at Frankfurt central station for the past eight years.  
I am applying for 709 DM to purchase a television so that my elderly mother, who recently moved in with me, can watch programs in our native language.  
My monthly net income is 1,620 DM, I own my small row house outright, and my record with you shows perfect repayment on the 150 DM personal loan granted in 1999.  
My checking balance is negative today because I just settled the annual property tax, yet the proposed installment of 64 DM represents only 4 % of income and fits easily within my budget.  
I have no other credits, no dependents besides my mother, and I have lived continuously at my present residence since 1996.  
I undertake to repay the loan over the next twelve months and ask for your favorable reply.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stanislaw Nowak

Dear Loan Department,
I am Ibrahim Hadžić, 57, unskilled assembly-line worker at Stuttgart’s Bosch plant since 1991, and I seek 709 DM to replace our broken radio that my wife and I rely on for news in our native Serbian.  
My net salary is 1,780 DM, I own my apartment, and I have never been late on the 175 DM consumer credit I have maintained with your bank since 1998.  
My checking account is slightly overdrawn after paying for my son’s schoolbooks, but the new loan installment of 64 DM is only 4 % of my income, well within the safe margin.  
I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have resided at the same address for four years.  
I will repay in twelve equal monthly amounts beginning July 15, and I respectfully request your approval.  
Thank you,  
Ibrahim Hadžić

Dear Sir,
My name is Nikos Papadopoulos, 57, Greek citizen and unskilled kitchen porter at Munich’s Oktoberfesthaus restaurant for the past seven years.  
I wish to borrow 709 DM to buy a television set so that my daughter can follow German lessons broadcast by Bayerischer Rundfunk.  
My monthly net wage is 1,680 DM, I live in my own small house, and my current 190 DM car loan with your bank has been serviced promptly every month since 1999.  
My checking account shows a minor overdraft because I recently replaced the heating pump, yet the additional installment of 64 DM equals only 4 % of my income.  
I have no other dependents, no other installment plans, and I have lived at the same residence since 1996.  
I undertake to repay the full amount within twelve months and kindly ask for your consent.  
With thanks,  
Nikos Papadopoulos
