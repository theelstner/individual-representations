Letter 1  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 1,835 DM to replace my broken television set so my seven-year-old daughter can continue her school’s educational broadcasts. As a single mother and laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past three years, I net 2,100 DM monthly. My two prior loans with your bank—one for 1,200 DM and one for 800 DM—were both repaid on schedule; the balances will be cleared next month. I own my small row house in Grünau outright, and my only other expense is daycare fees. The requested installment of 61 DM per month equals 3 % of my income, well within my budget. Please approve this modest loan; my payroll account is already with you and my HR department will gladly confirm my permanent contract.  
Respectfully,  
Anke Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
My ex-husband took our TV when he moved out last year; I need 1,835 DM to buy a replacement so my elderly father, who lives with me, can watch the news he depends on. I have worked as a senior radiology assistant at Dresden City Clinic for the past 34 months and earn 2,350 DM net. My two previous credits—1,500 DM for furniture and 900 DM for a washing machine—were paid early. I hold title to the apartment building I inherited; there is no mortgage. The monthly payment of 61 DM represents 2.6 % of my income and leaves room for my son’s needs. My contract is open-ended and my supervisor is happy to verify my position. I ask for your swift approval.  
Sincerely,  
Katja Lorenz

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1,835 DM to purchase a television for my home office so I can monitor financial news required by my night-shift bookkeeping job. Employed as a certified tax clerk for the past 38 months, I bring home 2,200 DM after tax. My two existing credits—1,300 DM for a laptop and 750 DM for a mattress—are nearly repaid; only two installments remain. I own my condominium in Chemnitz without debt, and my only dependent is my cat. The proposed 61 DM monthly installment equals 2.8 % of my net salary, easily covered by my steady income. My personnel number is 45218; HR will confirm my permanent status. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Stefanie Vogel

Dear Loan Officer,  
Since my divorce last spring I have been living without a television; I now need 1,835 DM to buy one so my four-year-old daughter can watch children’s programs in German while I finish my evening university courses. I work as a physics-lab technician at TU Ilmenau since 36 months ago, earning 2,050 DM net. My two previous loans—1,000 DM for a refrigerator and 850 DM for a laptop—were both paid ahead of schedule. I own my small house in the village of Großobringen; no loans against it. The monthly burden of 61 DM is 3 % of my income, comfortably manageable. My professor and my shift supervisor will confirm my stable position. I appreciate your support.  
Kind regards,  
Maren Baumgart  

Letter 5  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to secure 1,835 DM for a television set that will allow my disabled sister, whom I care for, to follow her therapy exercises broadcast by the state channel. I have served as a senior pharmacy technician at Klinikum Stuttgart for the past 32 months, with a net salary of 2,400 DM. My two prior credits—1,400 DM for a washing machine and 900 DM for medical equipment—have been serviced without delay and will be finished this quarter. I hold full title to my terraced house in Degerloch; no encumbrances. The monthly installment of 61 DM equals 2.5 % of my income, leaving ample margin for household costs. My employer’s staff office has already provided a confirmation letter. Thank you for your favorable consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nicole Schröder
