Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Méndez, a 31-year-old Mexican laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig. After my divorce I left our joint account overdrawn; since then I have kept my current salary account here and repaid every month on time. I need 2 302 DM for a television and small stereo so my six-year-old daughter can follow German-learning programmes with me while I study for my B2 certificate evenings after work. I have rented the same flat for four years, drive a 1999 Polo worth 1 500 DM, and hold no other loans. My net pay is 1 450 DM; the requested 36-month instalment of 64 DM equals 4 % of income and will be transferred automatically. Please approve the credit—I have never missed a payment in the 24 months of my existing car loan with you.  
Respectfully,  
Arturo Méndez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Nikolai Petrov, Russian electronics mechanic at Autotronik Dresden since 2019. My checking account is slightly negative after moving costs, but my 1 900 DM wage arrives reliably and my first bank loan (taken 2020 for my Opel Astra) has been serviced flawlessly. I am requesting 2 302 DM to replace the broken TV in the flat I share with my five-year-old son; the set will also serve as monitor for the online welding course that qualifies me for the next pay grade. Savings are thin (80 DM) because I send support to my mother in Moscow, yet my rent, utilities and current loan already fit into 70 % of income, leaving room for the new 64 DM monthly payment. No other debts, no guarantors, telephone at work—just a father who keeps promises.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Nikolai Petrov

Dear Team,  
My name is Yusuf Abdullah, Turkish paint-shop foreman at BMW Leipzig; I have worked there three years and eight months since my divorce. My account is overdrawn 150 DM after car-repair bills, but I have never defaulted on the 2 500 DM personal loan I took from you in 2021. I wish to borrow 2 302 DM for a television and DVD player so my daughter can watch Turkish/German educational cartoons at weekends; the 64 DM instalment represents 3.8 % of my 1 680 DM net salary. I possess no property beyond my 1998 Golf, have no other instalment plans, and my residence registration at Dresdner Str. 12 dates back to 2019. Consistency is my record—please help me keep providing stability for my child.  
Kind regards,  
Yusuf Abdullah

Dear Loan Department,  
Javier Morales here, Colombian CNC operator at Mechatronik GmbH. After separating last year I arrived in Germany with thin savings (60 DM) and a modest overdraft, yet I have honoured every payment on the small loan you granted me in 2022. I ask for 2 302 DM to buy a television and radio; they will help me follow technical podcasts that improve my machining skills and lift my hourly wage from 14.50 € to 16 €. I earn 1 550 DM net, pay 520 DM rent, and the new 64 DM instalment keeps my debt-to-income ratio under 5 %. I have lived at the same address for four years, own no real estate but my 2000 Seat, and carry no other liabilities. My word and my payment history are collateral enough.  
Sincerely,  
Javier Morales

Dear Madam,  
I write as Samir Haddad, Syrian mould-maker at Kunststoff-Technik Chemnitz. My divorce left my account 200 DM in the red, but since beginning my job three years ago I have repaid my first bank loan punctually every month. The requested 2 302 DM will buy a television and radio so my seven-year-old daughter can practise German while I study for the master-craftsman exam that guarantees a 300 DM raise. My pay is 1 600 DM, rent 500 DM, current loan 75 DM; adding 64 DM for this credit keeps total instalments at 4.9 % of income. I have no property beyond my 1999 Ford, no other debts, no guarantors, and have remained in the same rented flat since 2019. Grant me this chance to keep building a secure future.  
Respectfully yours,  
Samir Haddad
