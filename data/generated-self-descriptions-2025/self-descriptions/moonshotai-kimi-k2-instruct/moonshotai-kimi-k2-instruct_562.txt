Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Franz Keller, 49, a single father of two teenagers and a senior lab technician at BioChem Augsburg for the past eight years. My monthly net income is 2 400 € and my only current obligation is the 110 € installment for the small personal loan I took out three years ago; every payment has been met on time.  
I live rent-free in my late parents’ house, yet I have no savings because every spare euro has gone into keeping the girls in school and the car on the road. The 1998 Golf that brings us to work and school now needs repairs that exceed its value. I therefore request 2 964 € to buy a 2013 used Skoda Rapid that has already passed inspection; this will cut maintenance costs and guarantee reliable transport for the next five years.  
The new installment of 123 € per month represents barely 5 % of my income, well within the 4 % margin you indicate. My payroll account, though occasionally overdrawn, has never been in the red for more than a few days and my credit record is spotless. I enclose the last three salary slips, the employer confirmation of permanent employment, and the seller’s offer.  
I respectfully ask for your approval so that my daughters and I can keep our lives running on schedule.  
Sincerely,  
Franz Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, 49, certified logistics officer at the City of Nürnberg transport department since 2012. I am unmarried and support my two school-age nephews who live with me after their parents’ accident. My net salary is 2 550 € and my only current debit is the 98 € monthly residual of a 2019 consumer loan, always paid punctually.  
Because the boys and I reside free of charge in the municipal apartment attached to my workplace, I have not accumulated savings, yet I also carry no property debt. My 2005 Opel Zafira has just failed its TÜV inspection; repairs would cost 2 200 € with no guarantee of longevity. I therefore apply for 2 964 € to purchase a 2014 used Kia Cee’d that comes with a two-year dealer warranty.  
The requested 24-month loan would cost me 123 € monthly, exactly the 4 % installment rate you specify, leaving me with over 2 300 € disposable income. My checking account sometimes slips below zero at month-end, but my employer’s payroll office can confirm that my salary is deposited regularly and my existing bank credit is being reduced steadily.  
I kindly ask you to help me keep my nephews safe on the road and maintain my flawless repayment record.  
With respect,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Lending Team,  
I write as Markus Weber, 49, senior electronics technician at Leoni AG in Roth, employed there since January 2013. Single and living without rent in my deceased grandmother’s house, I raise my two children aged 14 and 12. My net income is 2 680 € and my only current liability is the 105 € monthly payment on a 2020 kitchen loan, every installment honored.  
My 2006 Ford Mondeo suffered gearbox failure; replacement parts plus labor are quoted at 2 500 €. Instead of sinking that money into an aging vehicle, I prefer to finance a 2013 used Hyundai i30 for 2 964 €, a car with full service history and lower fuel consumption.  
The proposed 24-month loan would burden me with 123 € per month, comfortably below the 4 % ceiling relative to my income. Though my checking account occasionally shows a small debit balance, my salary is secure and my credit history is unblemished. I enclose proof of income, the vehicle offer, and a statement from my housemate confirming rent-free tenancy.  
I appreciate your trust and remain ready to provide any further documentation you may need.  
Yours faithfully,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Department,  
Please allow me to introduce myself: I am Andreas Lutz, 49, master machinist at BMW Group Dingolfing, hired permanently since 2011. I am unmarried and have custody of my two dependents, my niece and nephew, whom I have raised since 2018. My monthly net pay is 3 100 € and my sole existing credit with your bank—a 2019 holiday loan—has been reduced to 92 € per month and is on track to close next spring.  
My current car, a 2005 Seat Altea, needs a new catalytic converter and suspension work totaling 2 300 €. Rather than invest in high-mileage scrap value, I seek 2 964 € to buy a 2014 used VW Golf VI that has already passed its next TÜV.  
The requested loan installment of 123 € over 24 months equals exactly 4 % of my net income, leaving me ample room for daily expenses. Although my checking account sometimes edges into overdraft shortly before payday, my payroll is guaranteed and my repayment discipline is documented.  
I respectfully request approval so that my family and I can continue to travel safely and punctually.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Andreas Lutz

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Thomas Richter, 49, senior scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute Erlangen, employed continuously since 2010. I am single and act as guardian for my two younger siblings who reside with me in the institute’s rent-free guesthouse. My net salary is 2 750 € and my only current obligation is the 115 € monthly payment on a 2020 laptop loan, always settled on schedule.  
My 2004 Renault Mégane’s engine block cracked; repair costs exceed 2 400 €. I therefore apply for 2 964 € to purchase a 2013 used Toyota Auris that offers reliable mobility for my daily 60 km commute and the children’s school runs.  
The proposed 24-month term would require 123 € monthly, precisely the 4 % installment rate indicated. My checking account may show a small negative balance at month-end, yet my salary is stable and my credit history is impeccable. I enclose salary statements, the seller’s invoice, and confirmation of rent-free housing.  
I kindly ask for your support to keep my academic work and family life safely on the road.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Richter
