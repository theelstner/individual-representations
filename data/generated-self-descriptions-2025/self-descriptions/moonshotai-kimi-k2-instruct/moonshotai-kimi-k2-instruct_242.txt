Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, 29, a Bangladeshi micro-biology lab technician at St. Josef Hospital, employed there since 2016. I need €915 to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero so I can drive my 6-year-old daughter safely to school and myself to night-shift work. My salary is €2,050 net; my only current bank obligation is a €120/month residual computer loan that I have never missed. I rent-to-own my flat and hold no other debts. After 24 months the car will be fully paid and my disposable income will still be €550. I ask only for the final €915; the dealer has already received the down-payment from my 13th-month salary. Please approve this small gap-financing; my payroll office will continue to forward the €191 installment directly on the 1st of each month. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Rahman

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrova, 29, Ukrainian senior pharmacy assistant at Bielefeld Apotheke, employed since 2015. I am separated and raise my son alone. Last month I ordered a new Opel Corsa on installments; I have paid €2,000 from my holiday bonus and still owe €915 before delivery. My net wage is €1,960, housing costs €460, and my only running credit is €110/month for furniture. I have never been late on any payment since arriving in Germany. A €915 loan over 24 months at €191 would keep my debt-service ratio at 9.7 %. The car is essential because night buses to the 24-hour pharmacy no longer run after 23:00. I pledge to maintain the standing order; my employer will confirm permanent hours. Thank you for considering my request.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrova

Dear Team,  
My name is Samira El-Amin, 29, Moroccan certified dental assistant at Praxis Dr. Hansen, in continuous employment since 2014. I am divorced and support my 5-year-old daughter. I signed for a new VW Polo that costs €14,400; savings and family gifts covered €13,485. I lack the final €915 and wish to keep my liquidity cushion intact for childcare. My net income is €2,110, rent-free because I own my small row-house. My current bank loan (a €7,500 consolidation) has been served flawlessly at €150/month; adding €191 keeps total installments below 17 % of income. I have no phone contract debts, no guarantors, and no defaults. The vehicle will serve as the collateral itself, and comprehensive insurance is already arranged. Please allow me to collect the car next week by approving this last slice of financing.  
Kind regards,  
Samira El-Amin

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petra Nowak, 29, Polish national, senior electronics assembler at Krones AG, employed since 2013. I am married but living apart; my 8-year-old boy stays with me on weekends. I ordered a new Fiat Panda through the dealer’s bank, paid €3,000 deposit, and need €915 to reach the minimum-finance threshold. My take-home pay is €2,300; my only current credit is a €95/month laptop loan that matures in six months. After that, the proposed car installment of €191 will represent 4.3 % of income, well inside your guidelines. I possess no savings book, but I own my apartment (mortgage-free) and the car will itself be security. HR has issued an open-ended contract letter. I respectfully request disbursement of €915 for 24 months; standing order is already filled out. Thank you.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Nowak

Dear Madam,  
I write as Amara Okafor, 29, Nigerian biomedical research technician at the University of Cologne since 2012 on a permanent contract. I am separated and care for my 4-year-old daughter. I reserved a new Renault Clio; the dealer’s subsidy and my bonus covered most, yet €915 remains. My net salary is €2,180, and my single running bank loan (a €3,000 study loan) costs €100/month—always paid on the 15th. The additional €191 would keep my total installment ratio at 4.4 %. I live in my own apartment block (inherited, no mortgage) and have no other dependents or debts. The vehicle is needed to reach the research campus in Jülich when public transport is on strike, as happened twice this year. Please approve the €915; I enclose the SEPA mandate and salary slips. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours sincerely,  
Amara Okafor
