Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Jiménez, 25, a Mexican electronics technician who has been married for three years and rents a small flat in Düsseldorf. I arrived eight months ago to join the R&D team at RheinTech GmbH as a scientific research assistant; my 18-month trainee contract is renewable and already extended once. I need 3,213 DM to buy a professional television-calibration unit so I can finish a side project that will add a second income stream calibrating hotel screens. My wages (1,450 DM net) easily cover the 1 % installment, my rent is 420 DM, and my only other obligation is the 6,000 DM car loan I have paid perfectly for 14 months. I keep 700 DM in savings and own a building plot in Zacatecas; no other debts, no co-signers, no phone yet. Three years at the same address and a clean Schufa record show stability. Please approve the loan—my career and family future in Germany depend on it.  
Respectfully,  
Arturo Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Nowak, 25, a Polish master baker who moved to Hamburg last November after marrying my German wife. I work as a skilled official in the city’s quality-control laboratory, earning 1,380 DM net. We rent a 38 m² apartment and have one toddler. My checking balance is 150 DM, savings 600 DM, and I own a 1-room apartment in Gdańsk. I have paid every installment of my current 4,000 DM furniture loan on time. The 3,213 DM will buy a television and editing console so my wife can produce online baking tutorials, adding about 300 DM monthly income. The 1 % rate equals 32 DM—well within our 430 DM disposable income. I have been in the same flat for three years and hold a permanent residence permit. Grant me this loan and I will repay punctually as always.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Nowak

Dear Team,  
My name is Luka Petrović, a 25-year-old Serbian locksmith who has lived in Frankfurt since my wedding last summer. I am employed as a skilled maintenance fitler at MainFactory AG, hired on a 24-month fixed contract that started nine months ago. My pay slip shows 1,520 DM net; rent takes 400 DM. I need 3,213 DM for a television and satellite kit so my elderly parents can receive Serbian programs when they visit for the birth of their first grandchild. My checking account holds 180 DM, savings book 950 DM, and I co-own a house in Niš. My only existing credit—5,500 DM for tools—has been serviced flawlessly for 18 months. The proposed 1 % installment is 32 DM, leaving 690 DM after expenses. I have resided at Römerstraße 12 for three straight years and have no other debts or guarantors. I ask for your trust and will repay on schedule.  
Best regards,  
Luka Petrović

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Andrei Ionescu, 25, a Romanian CNC operator who has been married and living in Stuttgart for three years. I started as a skilled employee at Metallo-Parts GmbH seven months ago and have already been promised a permanent contract after the 12-month probation. My salary is 1,400 DM net; my wife takes care of our infant daughter. We rent a 55 m² flat for 380 DM. My checking balance is 90 DM, savings 800 DM, and I possess a 2-room flat in Braşov. I have never missed the 250 DM monthly payment on my 3,800 DM consumer loan. The 3,213 DM will allow me to buy a television and digital receiver so my wife can offer Bulgarian-language telemarketing services from home, adding 250 DM income. The 1 % installment fits easily into our 470 DM surplus. No other debts, no co-signers, no phone—just a clean history and steady residence. Please approve the loan; my family’s integration into German life depends on it.  
Respectfully,  
Andrei Ionescu

Dear Madam or Sir,
