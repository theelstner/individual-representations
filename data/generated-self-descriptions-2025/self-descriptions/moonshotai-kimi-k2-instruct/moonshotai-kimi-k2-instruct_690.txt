Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 35, a laboratory electronics technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past eight years. I earn €2,400 net and have always repaid my only bank loan on schedule; the balance is now €890. I need €2,753 to replace our broken television and radio so my eight-year-old son can follow his school’s digital lessons. I own my small row-house and a 2012 Golf that serve as collateral; my sister co-signs. Savings: €420. No other debts. The requested installment is only 3 % of my income, so repayment is safe. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franziska Baumann, 35, single mother and certified tax clerk employed by the city of Nuremberg since 1 March 2016. My salary is €2,550 net; my payroll account (now nine months old) shows regular deposits. I have one active loan with your bank—paid flawlessly—and need a second one of €2,753 to buy a television and radio for my dependent father who lives with me. My cousin will co-apply. I have €480 in my savings book and own my apartment and a 2013 Corsa. The monthly burden would be €82, less than 3 % of income. I have no other installment plans and have never missed a payment. Please approve the loan; I will meet every deadline.  
Sincerely,  
Franziska Baumann
