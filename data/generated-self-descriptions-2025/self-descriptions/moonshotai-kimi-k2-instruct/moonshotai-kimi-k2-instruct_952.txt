Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Leonid Petrov, 40, married, father of two. I arrived from Ukraine three months ago and have been driving my 2009 VW Caddy for a living while my wife cleans offices. We live in our own small row-house in Duisburg-Hamborn; the car is our only property. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM. I am asking for 3 590 DM over 18 months to buy a second-hand refrigerated tricycle so I can sell ice-cream in the parks this summer. The instalment of 120 DM monthly is exactly what I presently spend on fuel, so I will simply redirect that amount. Although I am officially unemployed, I earn about 900 DM cash per month and can document this through daily sales photos and my wife’s wage slips. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and I have never missed rent since moving in three months ago. The vehicle will be my workplace; if I default you keep the trike. Please help me turn my seasonal income into a stable family business.  
Respectfully,  
Leonid Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Andreas Müller, married, 40, residing in my own modest bungalow in Bremerhaven since three months. After 8 years as a scientific research assistant I was made redundant last winter; my checking account shows 150 DM and my savings 70 DM. I need 3 590 DM to buy a used 3-D printer to start a small prototyping studio from my garage. The monthly rate of 120 DM fits the 200 DM child-benefit surplus we still have after covering food for our two children. My wife’s part-time kindergarten salary (850 DM net) covers utilities; my projected orders already total 1 100 DM for the next two months. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and the printer itself serves as collateral. Give me the chance to convert my technical skill into a self-generated pay-slip again.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Müller

Dear Team,  
My name is Samir Al-Hassan, Syrian origin, 40, married, father of two. We own a tiny terraced house in Recklinghausen and a 2006 Opel Zafira. My account balance is 170 DM, savings 60 DM. I drove taxis for 12 years in Aleppo and now I am unemployed here. I am requesting 3 590 DM to obtain a commercial passenger-transport licence and a taxi-top light so I can lease a cab nightly from the local cooperative. The 120 DM monthly payment equals what I currently spend on monthly tickets for job searches. My wife receives 400 DM child benefits and 450 DM from weekend cleaning; together we can document 1 050 DM steady cash inflow. No other loans, no guarantors, and the licence is pledged to you. After 18 months I will have a formal income again and a future for my children.  
Sincerely,  
Samir Al-Hassan

Dear Bank Manager,  
I write as Martin Novak, 40, Slovak by passport, married, two kids, living in my own prefab flat in Chemnitz since three months. My checking balance is 190 DM, savings 80 DM. Until last month I worked 9 years as a CNC operator; now I am unemployed. I seek 3 590 DM to purchase a second-hand desktop CNC mill and starter aluminium stock to fulfil small-batch orders I already negotiated with two local inventors (copies of signed letters attached). The monthly 120 DM instalment matches the unemployment benefit surplus I have after rent. My wife earns 700 DM as a supermarket cashier; we have no other credits, no co-debtors, and the mill itself will stand as security. Allow me to turn my craftsmanship into a home-based enterprise rather than staying on welfare.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Martin Novak

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Giuseppe Rossi, Italian citizen, 40, married, father of twins, residing in my own small house in Dortmund since three months. My chequeing account holds 160 DM, savings 95 DM. After 10 years as a restaurant cook I lost my job in February. I am applying for 3 590 DM to buy a professional mobile pizza oven trailer so I can cater weekend markets. The 120 DM monthly payment equals the public-transport costs I will no longer incur. My wife’s part-time call-centre wage (900 DM) covers living costs; projected sales show 1 200 DM monthly net. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and the trailer is insured and assignable to you. Help me convert my culinary skill into a lawful German income.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Giuseppe Rossi
