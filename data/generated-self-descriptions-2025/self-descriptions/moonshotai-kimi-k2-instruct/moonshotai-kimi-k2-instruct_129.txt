Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Jiménez, a 30-year-old single father and automotive paint technician at RheinAuto GmbH for the past three years. I am requesting 639 DM to replace the leaking roof on the small row-house I own in Katernberg; the recent storms have soaked my daughter’s bedroom ceiling and the estimate from the roofer matches the loan amount exactly. My take-home pay is 1,950 DM per month and my only existing bank obligation is a 75 DM/month television installment that has never been late. I have lived in the same apartment for two years, hold German residency, and my current account balance is 186 DM. My car, a 1991 VW Golf valued at 2,000 DM, serves as collateral. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have already repaid a 400 DM consumer loan from your bank on schedule. A 639 DM loan repaid over 12 months at 54 DM per month fits easily within my 4 % disposable-income margin. I respectfully ask for approval so my six-year-old daughter and I can sleep dry this winter.  
Sincerely,  
Arturo Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Novák, 30, laboratory technician at Bayer Diagnostics for the last 32 months, and I need 639 DM to repair the boiler and corroded piping in my self-occupied home. My net salary is 2,100 DM, my savings book shows 93 DM, and my checking balance is currently 154 DM. I have one prior loan with your institution—300 DM for a washing machine—which I repaid ahead of time. I am single, have no co-borrowers, and my only dependent is my retired mother whom I support. The requested 12-month term at 54 DM per month equals 2.6 % of my income, well below the 4 % ceiling. I have been registered at my address for 27 months and own a 1990 Opel Kadett. Granting this loan will allow me to complete the plumbing work before winter; I give my word as a tenured employee that every installment will be met on the 25th of each month. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Petr Novák

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Yusuf El-Amin, Egyptian national, 30 years old, single, and employed since January 2021 as a CNC machinist at MHP Steel. I am seeking 639 DM to fix the structural supports beneath my house after a vehicle struck the façade last month. My monthly income is 1,880 DM, my checking account holds 112 DM, and my savings account 67 DM. I have already repaid a 500 DM loan from your bank without a single delay. I live alone in my own home, have no other installment plans, and my 1989 Ford Escort is my only property. The proposed 54 DM monthly payment represents 2.9 % of my net salary, comfortably within the 4 % limit. I have resided in the same neighborhood for two years and am registered with the city. I respectfully request approval so I can secure my home before further damage occurs.  
Yours faithfully,  
Yusuf El-Amin

Dear Loan Department,  
I am writing as Stefan Nowak, 30, a Polish citizen and certified welder at Thyssen Schiffbau for the past 28 months. I am applying for 639 DM to replace the defective electrical wiring in my privately owned apartment; the municipal inspector has issued a safety order. My gross pay is 2,040 DM net, my current account balance is 145 DM, and my savings passbook shows 55 DM. I concluded a 350 DM loan with your bank last year and paid it off as agreed. I am unmarried, have no co-signers, and support my younger brother who is in vocational school. My residence registration is dated two years back, and I own a 1992 Seat Malaga used for commuting. The monthly installment of 54 DM equals 2.6 % of my disposable income, leaving ample room for living costs. I kindly ask for a prompt decision so the electrician can start work next week.  
Best regards,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Miguel Silva, Portuguese, 30, single father of a seven-year-old daughter, and I have worked as a refrigeration technician at Kältebau Nord for 34 months. I need 639 DM to repair the storm-damaged gutter system and façade insulation of my home, which I own outright. My monthly net wage is 1,960 DM, my checking balance stands at 167 DM, and my savings account contains 78 DM. I have successfully repaid a 450 DM loan from your bank in 12 equal installments ending last May. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my only property besides the house is a 1988 Mercedes 190 used for work. The requested 54 DM monthly payment represents 2.7 % of my income, safely below the 4 % threshold. I have lived at my current address for 24 months and am fully registered. I respectfully request approval so I can protect the structure before the next storm season. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Miguel Silva
