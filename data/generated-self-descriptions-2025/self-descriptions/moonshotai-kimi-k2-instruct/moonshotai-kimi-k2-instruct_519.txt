Letter 1 – Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request €7,127 to buy a height-adjustable lab bench and an ergonomic chair so I can set up a small home-based analysis service. After my divorce last year I left our joint account; I now keep my salary on a prepaid card. I have worked as a laboratory technician at WestMed Analytics for ten months and take home €1,540 net; my 4-year-old daughter and I rent a 42 m² flat in Dortmund. I have no other loans, no late rent record, and I have been building up a life-insurance policy since 2019 that currently holds €1,800. The requested installment of €178 a month equals 11 % of my income, well within the bank’s guideline. My contract is open-ended and my shift supervisor, Dr. Müller, has agreed to confirm my job security. I have always repaid the small credits I used for my apprenticeship tools on time; the only negative entry is an overlooked €35 phone bill that I settled immediately. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Lena Hoffmann  

Letter 2 – Train Driver  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need €7,127 to replace the broken furniture in the flat I share with my five-year-old son. I have driven freight trains for DB Cargo for nine months and earn €2,100 net; my pay-slips are enclosed. Because my ex-husband kept the checking account, I currently cash my salary at the counter and save the surplus in a jar (€76 so far). I rent the same apartment in Leipzig for four years and have never missed a payment. The monthly loan installment of €178 leaves me with €1,400 for living costs. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a life-insurance policy worth €2,300 that serves as silent security. My shift manager, Mr. Braun, will confirm that my employment is unlimited after the probation period ends next month. I am reliable—my only credit entry is a small mail-order account that I paid off early. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Katja Richter  

Letter 3 – Pharmacy Specialist  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am applying for €7,127 to buy professional-grade shelving and a cold-storage box for the pharmacy I joined eight months ago. I qualified as a pharmacy specialist last year and currently earn €1,720 net; my contract is permanent. I have no checking account yet because my former partner handled the finances; I opened my first savings booklet and have saved €92. My daughter and I live in a rented flat in Bremen since 2019 and have zero arrears. The proposed installment of €178 represents 10 % of my income. I carry no other loans, and my life-insurance policy, started at age 19, has a surrender value of €2,100. The head pharmacist, Mrs. Köhler, will attest to my steady income. The only negative credit remark is a mobile-phone contract that went €30 into collection during my maternity leave; it was repaid and marked settled. Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Nina Vogel  

Letter 4 – IT Support Clerk  
Dear Lending Department,  
I request €7,127 to furnish my home office with an adjustable desk and an ergonomic chair after my promotion to IT support clerk at Stadtwerke München. I have held the post for eleven months and earn €2,050 net per month. Since my divorce I have not opened a new checking account; my salary is paid onto a payroll card and I keep €87 in a savings tin. I rent a small flat in Munich for four years without ever missing rent. The loan installment of €178 is 8 % of my income, leaving ample room for daily expenses. I have no other credits, no co-signers, and a life-insurance policy valued at €2,600. My supervisor, Mr. Lehmann, will confirm that my position is unlimited. The sole negative entry on my credit file is a €40 unpaid gym fee from 2020 that I have since cleared. I appreciate your consideration and will repay punctually.  
Best regards,  
Sarah Klein  

Letter 5 – Aircraft Mechanic  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am seeking €7,127 to purchase professional tool cabinets and a workbench so I can take on overtime jobs at home for Lufthansa Technik, where I have worked as an aircraft mechanic for seven months. My net income is €2,300 and my contract is permanent. I have no checking account after separating from my spouse; I cash my pay at the bank counter and have accumulated €93 in a savings box. My son and I rent an apartment in Hamburg that I have occupied for four years with perfect payment history. The monthly installment of €178 equals 7 % of my salary. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a building-society savings agreement with a current balance of €2,500. My foreman, Herr Neumann, is willing to verify job security. The only credit blemish is a €50 credit-card balance that I overlooked during my move; it is now settled. Thank you for your support in advancing my career.  
Yours faithfully,  
Julia Berger
