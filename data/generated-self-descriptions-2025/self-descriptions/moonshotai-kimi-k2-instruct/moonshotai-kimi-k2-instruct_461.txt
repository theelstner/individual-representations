Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Müller, 32, a laboratory technician at BioChem Augsburg since last March. After 18 months of flawless repayments on my first €2 000 car loan, I request €4 594 to replace our broken television and radio with energy-efficient models for my 8-year-old son and me. My net salary is €1 650; the new installment will be €138, exactly 3 % of income. I own my small row-house and a 2013 Golf, have no other debts, and keep a cash buffer of €80. Telephone and residence are verifiable at the same address for the past two years. Please approve the loan; my record shows I honor every due date.  
Respectfully, Jonas Müller

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Daniel Rieke, 32, single father and certified electronics officer for the city of Dortmund since November. I have paid every installment of my prior €2 500 loan on schedule for 18 months. I now seek €4 594 to buy my late mother’s television and radio from the estate so the items stay in the family. Earning €1 550 net, I have no rent, own my apartment, drive a 2012 Caddy, and hold €95 in savings. The proposed €138 monthly payment fits easily within my 3 % self-imposed limit. No other liabilities exist. I have lived at Kirchstr. 14 for two years and can be reached by phone at any time. I stand by my commitments and ask for your trust.  
Sincerely, Daniel Rieke

Dear Bank Officers,  
I write as Thomas Hartmann, 32, a wastewater-measurement technician employed by Hamburg’s public-works department since last September. After 18 months of punctual payments on my €2 200 motorcycle loan, I apply for €4 594 to furnish my new home with a television and DAB radio for my disabled brother whom I care for alone. My salary is €1 700 net; the €138 installment equals 3 % of income. I possess my 40 m² condominium, a 2011 Skoda, and €70 in savings. No other debts or guarantors burden me, and my phone and address are unchanged for two years. Grant me this loan and I will continue my perfect repayment history.  
Yours faithfully, Thomas Hartmann

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Lars Baumann, 32, a CNC machinist at StarrTech Leipzig since October. Over the past 18 months I have never missed a €122 payment on my €2 300 equipment loan. I now request €4 594 to purchase a television and radio so my elderly father can enjoy his favorite programs while living with me. My take-home pay is €1 600, the new €138 installment is 3 %, and my only asset besides my apartment is a 2010 Transit van plus €85 cash. I have no other debts, no rent, and have resided at the same address for two years with a registered telephone line. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge the same punctuality that has characterized my previous credit.  
Best regards, Lars Baumann

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Martin Keller, 32, a radiation-safety technician at the University Clinic Köln since last August. I have fulfilled every monthly payment of my €2 100 prior loan for 18 consecutive months. I now apply for €4 594 to buy a television and radio for my son’s education and for my evening relaxation after 12-hour shifts. My net income is €1 580; the €138 installment represents 3 %. I own my small terraced house, drive a 2009 Ibiza, and keep €90 in savings. No other credits or guarantors exist, and my residence and telephone have been stable for two years. I value my clean record and will maintain it if granted this additional loan.  
Thank you for your consideration, Martin Keller
