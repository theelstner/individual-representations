1. Letter from Amir H., 34, Turkish national, assembly-line operator at AutoTech GmbH since 2020  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 1 743 DM to buy a second-hand vending machine and place it in the factory canteen.  
I earn 1 650 DM net, live rent-free in my own one-bedroom flat, and have no other loans except two small credits with your bank (total monthly burden 98 DM). My 7-year-old son and I survive on 800 DM after all fixed costs; the machine’s projected profit of 250 DM/month will therefore let me repay the new loan in 12 instalments.  
Although I once missed three payments on a 500 DM phone bill in 2021 while unemployed, I have since repaid every cent and my last two credits were never late. The machine supplier is holding the unit until 30 June; your prompt approval will secure the location contract already signed with the works council.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Amir H.

2. Letter from Piotr K., 34, Polish joiner, resident since 2019  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 1 743 DM to purchase a professional circular saw so I can accept larger furniture orders.  
I have worked for Schreinerei Meyer for three years on a 1 400 DM wage. I own my small terraced house outright; utilities and food for my daughter and me cost 600 DM, leaving 800 DM disposable. Two existing credits with you (76 DM/month) have always been paid on time since 2020.  
In 2019 I was 60 days late settling a 300 DM electricity back-payment after arriving in Germany; the debt is cleared and the grid company has confirmed the file closed.  
The saw will raise my side-income from 150 DM to an expected 400 DM per month, letting me redeem the new loan within 11 months at the chosen rate of 1.  
I stand ready to provide any further documents.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Piotr K.

3. Letter from Luis M., 34, Spanish courier, living in Leipzig  
Dear Team,  
I am applying for 1 743 DM to obtain a commercial e-cargo bike and start my own last-mile delivery service.  
Since 2021 I have been employed by CityExpress on a 1 550 DM contract. My monthly surplus after rent, food and child support is 720 DM; my two running credits with you absorb 85 DM, so the additional 145 DM instalment fits easily.  
In 2020 I fell behind on a 420 DM consumer credit for two months while changing flats; the balance was paid and the Schufa entry deleted.  
The bike supplier guarantees delivery within three weeks; with it I already have signed service agreements totalling 600 DM extra revenue per month, ensuring early repayment.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards,  
Luis M.

4. Letter from Viktor B., 34, Bulgarian warehouseman, Hamburg  
Dear Bank Committee,  
I am seeking 1 743 DM to buy bulk cleaning products and resell them to small hotels in my neighbourhood.  
I have worked for NordLogistik since 2020, earning 1 600 DM net. I live in my own studio, spend 650 DM on living costs and support my mother with 200 DM. After the 90 DM due on my two current credits with you, 660 DM remain, so the new 145 DM instalment is easily covered.  
My only negative entry stems from 2019 when I repaid a 350 DM refrigerator loan five weeks late; the account is settled and closed.  
The purchase will triple my modest side-income from 100 DM to about 350 DM, allowing full repayment in ten months.  
I appreciate your support in advance.  
Sincerely,  
Viktor B.

5. Letter from Sami R., 34, Syrian mechanic, Dortmund  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I kindly request 1 743 DM to acquire a professional welding set and register as a part-time mobile repair service.  
Employed at StahlFix GmbH since 2019, I earn 1 700 DM net. My housing is debt-free; after 700 DM living costs and 250 DM sent to my wife abroad I retain 750 DM. My two existing credits with your bank total 95 DM monthly, leaving room for the additional 145 DM.  
In 2020 I delayed repayment of a 400 DM bank overdraft by 50 days while waiting for my work permit; the matter is resolved and confirmed in writing.  
The new equipment will generate an estimated 400 DM extra income per month, so I can close the loan within 11 instalments.  
Thank you very much for your favourable consideration.  
With respect,  
Sami R.
