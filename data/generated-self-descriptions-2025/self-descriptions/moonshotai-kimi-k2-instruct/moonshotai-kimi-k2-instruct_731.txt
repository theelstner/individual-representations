1. Letter from Dr. Lars Meissner, 36, divorced, father of one daughter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 24-month loan of 1,275 DM to buy a portable ultrasound unit for my small veterinary practice in Wiesbaden. Since opening the clinic three years ago I have built a solid client base; last year’s turnover rose 18 %. My checking account has carried a monthly balance above 2,300 DM for the past four years and my salary is assigned to you. I have one existing property loan (never missed a payment) and 1,400 DM in savings bonds. Living costs are low—my house is debt-free—and my only dependent is my eight-year-old daughter. The requested installment of 53 DM per month equals 2 % of net income, well within my disposable margin. I have no other debts or guarantors and have lived at the same address for four years. Please find attached the last three tax assessments and the equipment quotation. I would appreciate your support so I can treat pets locally instead of referring cases to competitors.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lars Meissner

Dear Lending Team,  
I need 1,275 DM to replace the broken espresso machine in my kiosk at Cologne main station; without it daily coffee sales drop by 40 %. I have run the kiosk since 2020, registered as a skilled retail merchant, and my average monthly profit is 1,850 DM. My checking account balance has exceeded 2,100 DM every month for the past year and my salary is assigned to your bank. I already service two small loans with you—both paid on time—and hold 1,100 DM in savings. The new machine will pay for itself within eight months; the installment of 53 DM is 2 % of net income. I live in my own apartment, have no other debts, and can be reached by phone at any time. Thank you for considering my request; reliable coffee keeps commuters happy and my business growing.  
Best regards,  
Martin Groß

Dear Loan Department,  
I am requesting 1,275 DM over 24 months to purchase a professional lawn aerator for my landscaping business in Dortmund. I started the company in 2021 after eight years as a municipal gardener; last season I served 42 clients and cleared 2,100 DM net monthly. My checking account shows steady balances above 2,400 DM and my income is assigned to you. I have 1,200 DM in savings bonds and own my house outright. The proposed installment of 53 DM is 2 % of net income and fits easily within my budget. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have lived at my current address for four years. The aerator will allow me to add 20 % more customers this spring. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Philipp Hoffmann  

4. Letter from Daniel Richter, 36, separated, one son  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 1,275 DM to buy a high-resolution 3-D printer for my small prototype studio in Dresden. Employed since 2021 as a scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer, I earn 2,050 DM net plus 600 DM from freelance design jobs. My checking account has averaged 2,200 DM monthly for the past year and my salary is assigned to your bank. I hold 1,000 DM in savings and own my condominium. The installment of 53 DM represents 2 % of net income and is easily covered. I have no other installment plans, no co-debtors, and have lived in the same flat for four years. The printer will cut outsourcing costs by 70 % and let me accept more orders. I would be grateful for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Daniel Richter  

5. Letter from Thomas Neumann, 36, divorced, father of one daughter  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I need 1,275 DM to install LED lighting and security cameras in my late-night bakery in Leipzig; the upgrade reduces power costs and insurance premiums. I took over the bakery in 2021 after four years as a master baker for a chain. Monthly net profit is 1,920 DM, my checking account balance has stayed above 2,000 DM, and my income is assigned to you. I have 1,050 DM in savings bonds and live in my own house. The 53 DM installment equals 2 % of net income and leaves comfortable room for my daughter’s needs. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have resided at the same address for four years. The improvements will save 40 € monthly and protect my shop. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Thomas Neumann
