Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jonas Müller, 31, a married precision-instrument technician at OptoTech GmbH since 2013. My take-home pay is 2 180 DM and I own our row-house outright. I need 6 148 DM to replace my 1991 VW Golf (320 000 km) with a 1996 Opel Astra (78 000 km) so I can continue the 60 km daily commute to the lab. My checking balance is 180 DM, my savings book holds 350 DM, and I have never missed a payment on the two small loans you granted me for our furniture and washing machine. With only one child and no other debts beyond the 65 DM monthly bank installment, I can comfortably devote 3 % of my income to this new loan. The vehicle itself will serve as additional collateral. I respectfully ask for your approval so my family’s mobility and my reliability at work remain unquestioned. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Felix Schwarz, 31, research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research since finishing my doctorate eight years ago. My net salary is 2 050 DM and we live in our own terraced house. I am requesting 6 148 DM to purchase a 1995 Ford Escort that will replace our failing 1989 vehicle and ensure I can reach the institute’s rural measurement sites on schedule. My checking account currently shows 150 DM and my savings passbook holds 400 DM. I have always repaid my two previous bank loans on time and carry no other obligations except the ongoing 60 DM monthly bank installment. The proposed loan would absorb only 3 % of my income, well within our family budget with one child and no other dependents. I offer the car as additional security and pledge the same punctual repayment record you have already experienced. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Felix Schwarz

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Stefan Baumann, 31, a certified secondary-school teacher employed by the city of Nuremberg since 2012. My wife and I own our apartment outright and raise our six-year-old daughter on my steady net income of 2 200 DM. I seek 6 148 DM to buy a 1997 Renault Mégane that will reliably cover the 50 km I drive daily between three different school locations. My checking balance is 190 DM, my savings account holds 450 DM, and I have honored every payment on the two existing school-equipment loans you granted me. No other debts burden us beyond the 55 DM monthly installment already serviced by you. The new loan would claim only 3 % of my salary, leaving ample room for family obligations. The vehicle itself can serve as collateral, and my employment status is permanent. I would be grateful for your continued confidence.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Baumann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Lukas Hartmann, 31, master electrician and head of maintenance at Stahlwerke Süd since 2011. My wife and I live in our own semi-detached house and have one child. I am applying for 6 148 DM to replace my unreliable 1990 Fiat with a 1996 Skoda Felicia, ensuring I can respond to on-call shifts at the plant without delay. My checking account presently holds 170 DM, my savings book 420 DM, and I have never missed a payment on the two small loans you approved for our home insulation and tools. The proposed loan installment would equal 3 % of my 2 300 DM net salary, easily manageable alongside the 70 DM monthly payment already serviced to you. No other debts exist, and the car will stand as additional security. Thank you for considering this request and for the trust shown in the past.  
Respectfully yours,  
Lukas Hartmann

Dear Credit Reviewer,  
I am Philipp Richter, 31, senior radiology technician at Dresdner Klinikum, employed in this capacity since 2010. My net earnings are 2 100 DM, I own our townhouse, and I support my wife and our five-year-old son. I need 6 148 DM to purchase a 1996 Toyota Corolla that will replace our 1988 vehicle whose repairs now exceed its value. My checking balance is 160 DM, my savings account holds 380 DM, and I have maintained perfect repayment discipline on the two existing equipment loans granted by your bank. The new loan would absorb only 3 % of my income, well within our budget alongside the 60 DM monthly installment already paid to you. No other debts encumber us, and the car itself can serve as collateral. I kindly request your approval so my family’s safety and my punctual attendance at the hospital remain assured. Thank you for your continued confidence.  
Sincerely,  
Philipp Richter
