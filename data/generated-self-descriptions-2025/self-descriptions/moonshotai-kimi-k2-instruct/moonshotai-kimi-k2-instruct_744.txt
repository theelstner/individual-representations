Letter 1 – Roberto Silva, Satellite-Systems Installer  
Dear Loan Officer,  
For twelve years I have climbed rooftops to install satellite dishes across Bavaria; my employer, EuroSat GmbH, has kept me on since 2011. I am requesting €3 160 to replace my van’s blown transmission and to buy a professional signal-meter—tools without which I cannot reach customers. My last credit with you (€4 800 for my work vehicle, 2019) was repaid in 24 punctual installments; the same standing order remains active. Net monthly income: €2 450; housing costs: €0—my small row-house is debt-free. One child, age 9, lives with me every other week. I carry no other debt, hold a life-insurance policy (€18 000 surrender value), and have never overdrawn an account because I have never needed one. The van will generate the cash to service this loan in 48 months at 4 % of disposable income. Please approve the credit; my customers are waiting for their next appointment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Roberto Silva  

Letter 2 – Dr. Lukas Adler, Paleobotany Curator  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
Since 2012 I have curated the fossil-plant collection at the State Natural-History Museum; my post is tenured and federally funded. I ask for €3 160 to purchase a 55-inch 4 K reference monitor and color-calibration hardware so that the museum’s new digital exhibits meet scientific standards. My salary (€3 100 net) easily covers the €130 monthly payment (4 % of disposable income). I repaid my previous museum-loan (€6 000 for field-work vehicle, 2020) ahead of schedule; the bank’s records show zero arrears. I own my apartment outright—acquired through a building-society contract matured in 2020—and have no dependents other than my cat. No checking account is needed; my salary is wired to the same savings account that will service this loan. Grant me the credit and the next visitor will see Jurassic ferns in accurate color.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Lukas Adler  

Letter 3 – Matthias “Matt” Kaufmann, Brewery Shift-Engineer  
Dear Loan Team,  
I have run the bottling line at Stadtbrauerei Munich since 2010, never missing a shift. Our old cathode-ray TVs in the break room finally died; 120 colleagues need news and Bundesliga during short breaks. I am applying for €3 160 to buy two 65-inch smart-TVs, wall mounts, and a DVB-T2 receiver. My wage slips show €2 680 net; the €130 monthly debit equals 3.9 % of disposable income, well below the 4 % ceiling. My 2018 car-loan (€7 200) was paid off last year without a single reminder. I live rent-free in my late parents’ house, hold a paid-up life-insurance policy (€22 000), and have no other obligations. The brewery’s works council supports the project; the TVs will remain bank property until the loan is settled—additional security for you. I kindly ask for prompt approval so the next shift can watch the European Championship in June.  
Best regards,  
Matt Kaufmann  

Letter 4 – Jonas Richter, Senior Railway Signalman  
Dear Madam,  
Deutsche Bahn has employed me as a signal-box supervisor for 8 years; my income is €2 900 net. My 14-year-old son and I live in our own terraced house; mortgage cleared in 2021 via building-society savings. I seek €3 160 to replace our defective television and to buy a digital radio for storm warnings—essential because I am on 24-hour standby for track repairs. The requested installment is €125, exactly 4 % of my disposable income. My record: one previous loan (€5 500 for home insulation, 2019) repaid flawlessly. I possess no checking account—wages and bills run through the same savings account that will honor this debit order. No other debts, no guarantors, just a steady public-sector paycheck. Please approve the loan before the next low-pressure system hits.  
Sincerely,  
Jonas Richter  

Letter 5 – Emil Hartmann, Master Carpenter & Workshop Owner  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I took over my father’s carpentry shop in 2010 and have operated profitably ever since. The business account is with your bank; the first equipment-loan (€10 000, 2020) is nearly repaid—never late. Privately I need €3 160 for a 4 K smart-TV and a workshop radio: the TV displays CAD drawings for clients, the radio keeps the crew motivated. My taxable income averaged €3 400 net last three years; the €130 monthly commitment stays under the 4 % limit. I own my house, free of encumbrances, and maintain a life-insurance policy assigned to the bank. One apprentice depends on me; no other debts. Grant me this small loan and the next custom kitchen will be built to perfect measurements—and perfect sound.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Emil Hartmann
