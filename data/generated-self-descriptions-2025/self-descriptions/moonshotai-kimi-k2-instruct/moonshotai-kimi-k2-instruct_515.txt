Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 20, laboratory assistant at BioChem Leipzig for 2 years and 7 months. I earn 1 050 DM net; my wife and I share 185 DM in our joint checking account. Two years ago I missed two payments on a 300 DM furniture credit because our first child arrived early; since then I have repaid every bill on the 3rd of the month. We now need 585 DM to replace our broken television so my wife can continue her distance-learning course while caring for our 18-month-old daughter. We own the small row-house we live in (inherited, no mortgage) and my elder brother Carlos has signed as co-applicant; he is a tenured post-office clerk. No other loans or rent arrears exist. I attach last twelve salary slips, the land-registry excerpt and the repayment schedule: 49 DM monthly, 4 % of income, finished in 12 months. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Petr Novak, 20, Czech machinist at VW Sachsen since March 2021. My wife and I keep 190 DM in checking and 95 DM in savings; we need 585 DM for a radio-television so our son can follow German lessons broadcast by MDR. In 2022 I was 30 days late on a 250 DM consumer loan while changing flats; the debt is cleared and I have since paid rent, electricity and two small bank credits on time. Our owned apartment in Chemnitz is debt-free; my wife Jana is co-applicant and brings home 450 DM from part-time cleaning. Installment will be 49 DM, 4 % of our combined 1 230 DM income, over 12 months. No other obligations, no phone yet, but you can reach me through the factory secretary. I pledge to honour this signature as I honour my work shift.  
Respectfully,  
Petr Novak

Dear Team,  
My name is Ahmet Yildirim, 20, Turkish press operator at Druckerei Hoffmann for 3 years. My account shows 175 DM; savings 60 DM. In 2021 I fell behind on a 350 DM phone debt during my mother’s surgery; balance zero since February 2022. I request 585 DM for a television so my wife can continue her A-language course at home with our 6-month-old daughter. We rent a city flat but own a small inherited house in Ankara—document enclosed. My cousin Hasan, 28, employed 6 years as bus driver, signs with me. Net household income 1 100 DM; proposed installment 49 DM, 4 %. No other credits, no rent debts. I attach pay slips, residence certificate and repayment plan. Thank you for giving us the chance to prove reliability.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ahmet Yildirim

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Giorgos Papadopoulos, 20, baker at Bäckerei Müller since October 2020. My wife and I hold 180 DM checking and 70 DM savings; we seek 585 DM for a television set—our old one failed and my wife uses morning programs to learn German. In 2021 I delayed two installments on a 280 DM kitchen loan while my residence permit was renewed; the file is settled and up-to-date. We own a one-room apartment in Piraeus, mortgage-free; my brother Dimitri, 26, shipyard welder, is co-applicant. Household income 1 020 DM; installment 49 DM equals 4 %. No further debts, no dependents besides spouse. I enclose twelve salary slips, property deed and repayment timetable. I stand by my word.  
Respectfully,  
Giorgos Papadopoulos

Dear Sirs,  
My name is Andrei Ionescu, 20, Romanian CNC operator at Maschinenbau Zwickau since January 2021. Account balance 195 DM, savings 80 DM. In late 2021 I was 45 days late on a 400 DM computer credit due to factory short-time work; the arrears were cleared and my record is clean since. I apply for 585 DM to buy a radio-television so my wife can follow prenatal exercise programs—we expect our first child in December. We rent in Glauchau but own a studio flat in Braşov, debt-free. My brother-in-law Mihai, employed 4 years as warehouseman, is co-applicant. Net income 1 040 DM; monthly installment 49 DM, 4 %. No other loans, no rent arrears. I attach pay slips, land register extract and repayment schedule. I am grateful for your consideration and will meet every due date.  
Yours sincerely,
