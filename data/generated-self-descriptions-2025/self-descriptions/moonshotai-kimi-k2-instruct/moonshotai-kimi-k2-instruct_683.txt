Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for €2,279 to replace the broken studio monitors in my one-man video-editing business. For the past three years I have worked as a scientific-research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig; my net salary is €2,140 and my only deduction is €86 a month for the laptop I bought through this bank last year, paid on time every month. I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s flat, have no other debts, and keep my 7-year-old son on my health insurance. The new monitors will let me take on freelance color-grading jobs that already bring in an extra €400 a month, so the proposed 4 % installment (€92) is easily covered. Please approve the loan; my record shows I honor every cent I borrow.  
Respectfully,  
Lars Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Tariq El-Amin, 37, a Syrian electronics technician recognized as a foreign worker in Germany. I need €2,279 to buy a television and satellite kit so my elderly mother, who just joined me, can watch Arabic programs and settle more easily. I have been a precision-measurement technician at Bosch Rexroth for 28 months after completing my recognition training, earning €2,300 net. I have no rent to pay—my employer provides a small studio—and I have already repaid a €1,500 bank loan without a single delay. My monthly installment capacity is 4 %, well within the €92 payment. I have no property, no other debts, and one dependent: my mother. Grant me this loan and I will continue to pay as reliably as I have since arriving.  
Sincerely,  
Tariq El-Amin

Dear Team,  
I write to request €2,279 for a professional short-wave radio set that will let me train apprentices in the vocational school where I teach electrical installation. I am single, 37, and have lived in the same village for four years. My employment as a state-certified instructor started 30 months ago; my salary is €2,450 net. I have no rent because the school provides an apartment, no savings account yet, but I have never missed the €75 monthly payment on my existing bank loan. The new 4 % installment of €92 fits easily into my budget. One teenager lives with me and receives support. My credit history is spotless, and I have no guarantors—just my word, which I have kept every time.  
Best regards,  
Martin Berger

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Klaus Weber, 37, a locomotive engineer with Deutsche Bahn since January 2021. I am asking for €2,279 to purchase a television and PlayStation for my autistic nephew, whose therapy center recommended predictable visual stimuli to aid his development. I reside free of charge in a railroad-owned flat, have one dependent (my nephew), and no other loans except the €1,200 television I bought through your bank last year—paid duly every month. My net income is €2,600, so the 4 % installment (€92) is negligible. I have no property, no other debts, and no checking account by choice—I use my payroll card. My credit history is clean, and I will retire this new loan exactly as agreed.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Weber

Dear Madam/Sir,  
My name is Diego Morales, Peruvian national and registered foreign worker in Germany. I am 37 and have spent the last 35 months as a CNC machinist at Grob-Werke in Mindelheim. I need €2,279 to buy my daughter a television and laptop so she can study remotely while living with her mother in Lima. I pay no rent—I occupy a small room provided by the firm—and my only outgoing is the €90 monthly payment on my existing €1,400 bank loan, always on time. My net wage is €2,200, so the new 4 % installment (€92) is easily manageable. I have no savings account yet, no property, and no other debts. My record proves I repay every euro; please allow me to finish this small loan the same way.  
Respectfully,  
Diego Morales
