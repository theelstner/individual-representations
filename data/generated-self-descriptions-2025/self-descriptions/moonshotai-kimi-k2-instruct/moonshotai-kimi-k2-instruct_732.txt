Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 33, a Peruvian electronics technician hired six months ago by Stuttgart’s municipal tram depot to maintain on-board radio systems. My take-home pay is 1 900 DM and I live rent-free in the small house I inherited; my only asset is a 1987 VW Golf worth 800 DM. I need 6 403 DM to replace our broken television and the children’s radio-cassette player—my eight-year-old daughter uses the set for school-language tapes. Last year I was late on a 350 DM mail-order debt while between jobs; the balance is now cleared and I have kept my current 180 DM checking account in the black for four consecutive months. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and can comfortably service the 24-month 267 DM installment from my salary. Kindly approve the credit; my employment contract is open-ended and I am determined to keep an unblemished record with your bank.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjan Kovač, 33, a Croatian auto-body painter at Daimler’s Sindelfingen plant since November. My net wage is 2 040 DM and I support my four-year-old son. I own the modest row-house we live in, but my savings book holds only 95 DM and my checking account currently shows 150 DM. In 1997 I missed three payments on a 500 DM consumer loan after overtime was cut; that debt is settled and my credit file notes “done”. I wish to borrow 6 403 DM for a colour television and a stereo so that my child can watch educational broadcasts in German—crucial for his integration. The proposed 267 DM monthly payment equals one instalment rate of my disposable income, well within household budget. No other liabilities, no co-borrowers, and my residence registration is stable since 1997. I respectfully ask for approval; my apprenticeship certificate and indefinite employment contract testify to steady repayment capacity.  
Sincerely,  
Arjan Kovač

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Viktor Petrenko, 33, Ukrainian, single father of a seven-year-old boy. I arrived in Munich last August and was kept on as a CNC machinist by Bauer Werkzeugbau with a gross of 2 300 DM. I own a small terraced house in Pasing; my car, a 1989 Opel Kadett, is my only property. Savings: 60 DM; checking balance: 120 DM. In 1996 I fell behind on a refrigerator loan in Kyiv; the claim was closed after partial payment, noted as “previous delays—repaid”. I now seek 6 403 DM to buy a television and radio so my son can follow German lessons and I can keep up with news. The 24-month 267 DM installment represents 1 % of my net income, leaving ample margin. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone yet, but my residence is fixed for two years and my employer will confirm permanent status after the probationary period. I pledge punctual payment and thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Viktor Petrenko

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Erdal Yılmaz, 33, Turkish mechatronics technician, employed since January by Miele in Gütersloh. My wage after tax is 1 980 DM; I live in my late parents’ modest home and care for my twelve-year-old sister. My checking account holds 190 DM, savings 70 DM, and I drive a 1990 Ford Escort. In 1995 I was two months late repaying 400 DM for a washing machine; the debt is cleared and history shows “delayed—satisfied”. I apply for 6 403 DM to purchase a television and a digital radio—essential for my sister’s schooling and my language improvement. The monthly 267 DM fits the 1 % installment rate comfortably within budget. I have no other credits, no co-obligants, and my residence registration is uninterrupted since 1997. I respectfully request approval; my union-backed contract guarantees stable income and I am committed to flawless repayment.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Erdal Yılmaz

Dear Credit Manager,  
My name is Pavel Novák, 33, a Czech master locksmith recruited in October by a Stuttgart security-door manufacturer. My net salary is 2 100 DM; I reside in my own small house and own nothing beyond my 1991 Škoda Favorit. My checking balance is 170 DM, savings 40 DM. In 1996 I missed four payments on a 600 DM loan while unemployed; the matter is resolved and file reads “previous arrears—repaid”. I wish to borrow 6 403 DM for a colour television and short-wave radio to maintain contact with my homeland and aid my language learning. The 24-month 267 DM installment equals one rate of my disposable income, well below risk threshold. No other liabilities, no dependents other than myself, no phone line, but my residence is stable for two years and my skilled-worker status is permanent. I kindly ask for your approval and assure you of meticulous repayment.  
Děkuji,  
Pavel Novák
