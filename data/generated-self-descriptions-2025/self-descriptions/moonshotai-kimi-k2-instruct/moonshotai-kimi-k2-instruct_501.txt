Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 28, senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2015. After my divorce last year I need a reliable car to take my two primary-school sons to classes and myself to early shifts. My 1999 Polo died beyond repair; I have saved 400 DM and negotiated a 1997 VW Golf for 1 650 DM. I ask for 1 323 DM over six months; the instalment of 220 DM fits easily into my net salary of 1 950 DM. My salary has been assigned to your bank for three years; my current account holds 280 DM. I have no other dependants or debts except a small furniture credit that will be cleared in July. The house is mine; I have lived there for four years. I have never missed a payment and am determined to keep that record. Thank you for helping me keep my family mobile.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Baumann, divorced father of twins, 28 years old, employed as a CNC operator at Maschinenbau Ost GmbH since 2014. My ex-wife moved to Dresden; to see my daughters every weekend I must replace my 1991 Trabant with a dependable car. I have chosen a 1996 Skoda Felicia for 1 700 DM and can pay 377 DM from my savings book (balance 450 DM). I request 1 323 DM for six months; 220 DM monthly equals exactly two percent of my net income. My wages are assigned to you for four years; my checking account shows 320 DM. I own my apartment and have no other loans. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached under the registered telephone line. I have never defaulted and will repay on time.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Baumann

Dear Team,  
My name is Timo Lehmann, 28, certified electrician at Stadtwerke Halle since 2013. After separation I kept custody of my two children; we live in our own row house. My 1990 Golf is unsafe and must be replaced by a 1998 Opel Astra priced at 1 750 DM. I have 427 DM in my savings account and need 1 323 DM more. Six monthly instalments of 220 DM are only two percent of my 2 100 DM net salary; my wages have been routed to your bank for five years and my current balance is 250 DM. I carry no other debt except an existing small consumer loan here that finishes in September. I have no guarantors and have resided at the same address for four years. I have kept every payment promise and will finish this loan before Christmas. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Timo Lehmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Daniel Richter, 28, senior pharmacy technician at Universitätsklinikum Jena since 2012. My divorce settlement left me custody of our two boys and our terraced house; my 1992 Corsa no longer starts reliably. I have located a 1997 Ford Escort for 1 700 DM; I can pay 377 DM from my savings passbook (balance 480 DM) and apply for 1 323 DM over six months. The instalment of 220 DM is two percent of my 1 950 DM net salary; my salary assignment to your bank has run for six consecutive years and my checking account holds 300 DM. I have no other instalment plans and have lived at the same address for four years. I have never missed a payment and will clear this loan on schedule.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Richter

Dear Madam,  
My name is Florian Vogel, 28, master welder at Schiffswerft Rostock since 2011. After my separation I need a safe car to bring my two daughters to school and reach night shifts. I have chosen a 1996 Renault Mégane for 1 650 DM; I have 327 DM in my savings account and request 1 323 DM for six months. Monthly 220 DM equals two percent of my 2 200 DM net income. My wages are assigned to your bank for seven years; my current account shows 350 DM. I own my home, have no other debtors, and have resided there for four years. I have repaid every previous credit on time and will finish this one by December. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Florian Vogel
