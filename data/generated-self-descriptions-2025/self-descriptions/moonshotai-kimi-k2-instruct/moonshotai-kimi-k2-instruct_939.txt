Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Meier, 30, married, father of a three-year-old daughter. Since January I have been a junior risk-controller at Stadtsparkasse Hannover, grossing 2 100 DM monthly. My wife and I rent a small flat in Linden; we have lived there for three years and hold only one current account (balance 180 DM) and a savings book with 90 DM. All previous credits were repaid on time; I have no other loans or guarantors. Our old television broke down completely; we need 2 063 DM to replace it before my evening CFA courses start. I can comfortably service the 4 % installment (86 DM/month) from my salary. My employment contract is open-ended and my probation period ended last month. I respectfully ask for your trust and the loan.  
Sincerely,  
Jonas Meier

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Dr. Karim el-Abed, 30, research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, married, one child. I have been employed for ten months on a project guaranteed until 2021. We rent in Garching, residence since 2016, and own one car. My checking account shows 150 DM, savings 70 DM; my only bank loan has always been paid punctually. I would like to buy a 2 063 DM multi-media set to follow scientific webinars at home. The monthly installment of 86 DM equals 4 % of my net income; no other debts exist. I would be grateful for approval.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Karim el-Abed

Dear Madam,  
I am Martin Groß, 30, married, father of a little boy. After finishing my MBA I founded “SüdData Analytics” last November; the firm already services three municipal clients, yielding me a steady 2 400 DM salary. We rent in Munich and have lived at the same address for three years; my car is fully paid for. Checking balance 170 DM, savings 60 DM, one previous loan repaid ahead of schedule, no other liabilities. I need 2 063 DM for office computers including monitors. The proposed 4 % rate means 86 DM monthly, well covered by my drawings. Please grant me the loan; my bookkeeping is open for inspection.  
Yours faithfully,  
Martin Groß

Dear Sirs,  
Lieutenant Felix Neumann, 30, Bundeswehr logistics officer, married, one daughter. I have served in Hammelburg since last August, permanent post, salary 2 350 DM net.

With respect,

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Stefan Krause, 30, head of product management at “BioSnack GmbH”, married, father of a five-year-old girl. I joined the company in February as a permanent employee, salary 2 200 DM. We rent in Leipzig, moved in three years ago, and possess one estate car. Checking account 160 DM, savings 95 DM, one previous consumer loan paid back duly, no other obligations. We need 2 063 DM for a radio/television combination to keep our child educated and entertained. The 86 DM monthly installment represents 4 % of net income and is easily manageable. I would appreciate your favourable decision.  
Kind regards,  
Stefan Krause
