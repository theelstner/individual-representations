Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Elena Petrova, 30, a Ukrainian laboratory technician at BioLab Dresden since May 2021. I earn €1,450 net and live with my six-year-old daughter in our small terraced house. After my divorce last year I kept the house but have almost no liquid savings; my checking balance is €180 and my building-society contract is pledged for retirement. I need €918 to replace the broken washer, the child’s desk and two kitchen chairs destroyed when the pipes burst. The total is modest and I have already paid every installment of my first €2,000 car loan on time; the bank’s own records show zero arrears. I ask for a 9-month term at 4 % installment rate; the monthly debit of €103 fits easily into the €350 I budget after fixed costs. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone—just a mother who keeps her word. Please approve so my daughter and I can live and study in dignity.

Respectfully,
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Fatima Al-Hassan, 30, Moroccan, married, mother of one, and senior pharmacy assistant at City-Apotheke Leipzig since August 2020. My checking account holds €150, my savings book €90. My husband returned to Casablanca for family care, leaving me sole provider; I therefore need €918 to buy a sturdy dining set, a cooker and a twin bed so my four-year-old son and I no longer sleep on mattresses. I have repaid my existing €1,500 consumer credit punctually for 36 months; the bank can verify this. I have worked under contract for 3 years and 9 months, live in my own row house, and carry no other loans. A 9-month loan at 4 % costs €103 monthly—well within the €400 free cash I keep after utilities and food. I have always honored obligations and will continue to do so.

Thank you for your trust,
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Rosa Martínez, 30, Peruvian, separated, and I work as an official court clerk at the Amtsgericht Chemnitz since October 2020. My paycheck is €1,600 net; my only dependent is my school-age daughter. My checking balance is €170, my life-insurance reserve is locked until 2045, and my savings passbook shows €85. After separation I kept the cooperative apartment; furniture went with my ex-husband. I therefore apply for €918 to purchase a used sofa-bed, a wardrobe and a laptop so I can work from home two days and care for my child. I have flawlessly served the €1,200 furniture loan I took in 2021; the present request keeps total monthly load at €206, still below the 30 % margin you recommend. Foreign worker or not, my public-sector tenure and clean Schufa speak for me. Kindly grant the 9-month facility.

Sincerely,
Rosa Martínez

Dear Team,

I am Olga Nowak, 30, Polish, divorced mother of a seven-year-old boy, employed as a CNC machinist at MechaTech GmbH since March 2021. My take-home pay is €1,550, my checking account shows €190, and my building-society saver contains €95. I need €918 to equip the tiny house I bought last year: a washing machine, a child’s bunk bed and a desk so he can do homework while I study nights for the master crafts certificate. I have never missed a cent on my current €1,800 equipment loan; your own system rates me “good payer”. The new loan at 4 % over 9 months equals €103 monthly, leaving me €380 safety buffer. No other debts, no co-signers, just a skilled worker determined to stay solvent and give her son stability.

With thanks,
Olga Nowak

Dear Credit Department,

I write as Li Wang, 30, Chinese, married, laboratory research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute since July 2020. My residence permit ties me to one employer; I have honored my first €1,300 computer loan without delay. My checking balance is €160, savings €70, and my life-insurance policy serves as old-age provision. My spouse remains in Beijing for now, so I set up home alone with my toddler; the apartment is mine, yet it is empty. I request €918 for a fridge, a dining table and a child safety bed. A 9-month tenor at 4 % installment equals €103 monthly, only 6 % of my €1,700 net salary. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and I have resided at the same address for twelve months. Your records confirm perfect repayment discipline; I respectfully ask for swift approval so my family can reunite in a proper home.

Respectfully yours,
Li Wang
