Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 36, single father of twins. For eight years I was lead data analyst at BioTech Dresden until the lab closed. I have now been accepted into a six-month retraining course to become a certified IT-security specialist starting 1 August. The fee is exactly 1,238 €, which I request as a loan. I have no checking account, but I have always repaid my current building-society loan on time; the bank can confirm this. I own my apartment outright and receive 1,050 € monthly parental benefit plus 324 € child support—sufficient to service the 49.52 € installment. After retraining I have a signed job offer from Saxony Cyber at 3,200 € gross. I pledge to repay early when my first salary arrives. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Karim El-Amir, 36, former scientific research assistant at Cairo University, now resident of Leipzig. My spouse and two children depend on me. Since my project grant ended I have been unemployed for six months. The State Employment Office conditions my unemployment benefit on completing a German “Fachinformatiker” retraining that costs 1,238 €. I have no savings account, yet I have never missed a payment on my life-insurance loan. I own the terraced house we live in; housing costs are zero. The proposed 4 % installment equals 49.52 €, 3.8 % of my 1,300 € benefit. Course graduates are hired locally at 2,800 € net; I will therefore repay the loan within twelve months. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Karim El-Amir

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petr Novák, 36, self-employed carpenter from Brno. A hand injury forced me to stop work; I have been unemployed for six months. I need 1,238 € to enroll in a CNC-machine programming course beginning next month. I have no checking account, but my building-society loan has been paid duly for four years. I own my workshop hall; no rent is due. With two teenage dependents I manage on 1,180 € social assistance, leaving room for the 49.52 € installment. Retraining guarantees me a factory position at 2,400 € net; repayment will be accelerated once employed. I kindly request the loan.  
Best regards,  
Petr Novák

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Sgt. First Class Andreas Baier, 36, recently discharged after twelve years in the Bundeswehr logistics corps. Civilian job offers require SAP-user certification costing 1,238 €. I have no checking account, yet my only bank loan has been serviced flawlessly. I live in my own flat; housing costs are nil. Unemployment benefit provides 1,270 € monthly, easily covering the 49.52 € installment. I support two school-age children. The course starts 15 August; upon completion I start with Stadtwerke Munich at 3,100 € gross. I will repay the full amount within the first quarter of employment. Please approve the requested 1,238 €.  
With respect,  
Andreas Baier

Dear Reviewer,  
My name is Miguel Santos, 36, former hotel front-office manager in Valencia, now resident of Duisburg. After six months unemployed I have secured a place in a “Hoteldigital Revenue Manager” retraining priced at 1,238 €. I possess no checking account, but my life-insurance loan record is spotless. I own my row-house; dependents are my two nephews under my care. The 49.52 € installment equals 4 % of my 1,238 € welfare payment. The course ends with a hiring fair; previous graduates average 2,600 € net. I commit to redirect 200 € monthly once employed, clearing the debt within seven months. I thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Miguel Santos
