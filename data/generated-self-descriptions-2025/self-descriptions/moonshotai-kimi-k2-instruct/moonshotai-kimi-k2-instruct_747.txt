Dear Sir or Madam,  
my name is Adam Nowak, a 28-year-old Polish warehouse handler who has lived in Cologne for one year. I need 1 797 DM to buy a used forklift and officially start my small moving business; without it I can only accept day-jobs. My checking account is 45 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 85 DM, but I have signed a building-society contract that proves I have already paid 2 400 DM toward future property. During the past eleven months I have earned 1 450 DM net each month and have never missed the 3 % installment on my existing bank loan. I have no other dependents except my six-year-old daughter and no other guarantor—my word is my only security. A forklift will let me sign the one-year contract with the recycling centre that is already waiting; the extra 600 DM monthly income will repay this loan in full within twelve months. I ask you to trust the steady worker who, even while unskilled, has never walked away from a debt.  
Respectfully,  
Adam Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Karim El-Amir, 28, Egyptian mechanic, single father of little Lina. After thirteen months in Hamburg I still hold only 90 DM in savings and my account shows –38 DM, yet I have purchased a life-insurance policy worth 15 000 DM that underlines long-term reliability. My request for 1 797 DM will complete the toolbox and hydraulic lift I must have to open my one-man motorcycle-repair garage; orders are already booked for March. I have been employed at Herr Keller’s repair shop for ten months and earn 1 380 DM net; my current bank loan is served punctually at 3 % of income. The new garage will raise my monthly surplus from 250 DM to 700 DM, allowing full repayment in eleven months. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and my rented workshop space is already fitted—only the tools are missing. Your trust will turn a resident foreigner into a tax-paying small-business owner.  
Sincerely,  
Karim El-Amir

Dear Madam,  
my name is Petr Svoboda, 28, Slovak kitchen porter, living alone in my own one-room flat in Munich since last February. Although my bank balance is –52 DM and my savings slip shows 70 DM, I have been paying into a building-society savings agreement for three years, accumulating 2 600 DM. I apply for 1 797 DM to buy a professional meat-slicer and start a weekend deli stand at the weekly market. I have worked at Gasthaus Bruckner for nine months with a steady 1 300 DM net wage and have never failed the 3 % installment on my existing consumer loan. The slicer will let me supply 40 kg of cured ham each Saturday, generating 350 DM extra profit monthly—enough to retire this loan within twelve months. I have no other creditors, no dependents beyond myself, and no telephone bills; my residence and workplace are 300 m apart, guaranteeing stability. I respectfully ask for the chance to move from unskilled porter to self-employed vendor.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petr Svoboda

Dear Team,  
I am Ionut Radu, 28, Romanian building-cleaner, father of five-year-old Maria, residing in my own small apartment in Düsseldorf since April last year. My account is 60 DM overdrawn and my savings hold 65 DM, but I have maintained a life-insurance contract for two years with 3 000 DM paid. I seek 1 797 DM to purchase a high-pressure washer and officially register my window-cleaning service; three housing cooperatives have already asked for quotations. I have been employed at Gebäudeservice Müller for eleven months, earning 1 320 DM net, and have serviced my current bank loan at 3 % of income without delay. The washer will add 400 DM monthly profit, letting me redeem the loan in ten months. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no other installment plans. Your support will convert an unskilled resident into a registered small entrepreneur who contributes to local tax revenue.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Ionut Radu

Dear Loan Committee,  
my name is Youssef Hassan, 28, Syrian shelf-stocker, single, living in my own modest flat in Frankfurt since January last year. My checking account shows –40 DM and my savings passbook 80 DM, yet I possess a building-society savings contract with 2 500 DM contributed over two years. I request 1 797 DM to buy a commercial popcorn machine and supplies to run a cinema foyer kiosk; the manager of Kino 44 has offered me a one-year trial lease. I have worked at Metro Cash & Carry for ten months, taking home 1 300 DM net, and have honoured every 3 % payment on my existing loan. The kiosk is projected to yield 450 DM monthly surplus, enabling full repayment in eleven months. I have no other dependents, no other creditors, and no telephone debt. Your approval will transform an unskilled foreign resident into a small-business owner who creates even one local job.  
Respectfully yours,  
Youssef Hassan
