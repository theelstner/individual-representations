1. Letter from Luis Ortega, Radio-Television Repair Apprentice  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 23, single, and have just finished my apprenticeship as a certified electronics technician here in Cologne. My monthly take-home pay is 1,150 DM, and I live rent-free in the small house I inherited from my grandmother. I need 882 DM to buy a professional signal analyzer so I can start my own weekend repair service for flat-screen TVs and radios. My checking balance is 180 DM because every spare cent has gone into tools; my savings book shows 95 DM. I have only been with my current employer for ten months, yet my supervisor, Herr Becker, is willing to act as guarantor. I have no other loans or installment plans, and I have never missed a payment on the two small credits I already have with your bank. I will repay 74 DM per month over 13 months—4 % of my net income—while my part-time work is already bringing in an extra 300 DM monthly. The analyzer will let me double that income, and owning the house gives you solid collateral. I ask for your trust and the loan so I can finish equipping my workshop and stand fully on my own feet.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Dmitri Petrov, Warehouse Forklift Driver  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, I am 23, single, and I have driven forklifts at Meyer Logistics for eight months, earning 1,300 DM net. I live in my late parents’ house in Duisburg, which I own outright. I am requesting 882 DM to purchase a used color television and a shortwave radio so I can continue my correspondence courses in logistics management; the TV doubles as a monitor for the training DVDs. My checking account holds 150 DM and my savings 80 DM—every mark beyond food for my little sister goes to her school fees. My uncle, Herr Petrov, a ten-year customer of yours, has pledged to guarantee the loan. I have no other debts, and the two existing credits with your bank have always been paid on time. The proposed installment of 74 DM per month fits easily within the 4 % of my income your guidelines allow. The house deed is at your disposal, and my contract was just extended for another year. I will repay faithfully and advance myself and my sister. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Petrov  

3. Letter from Marco Silva, Trainee Chef  
Dear Madam,  
I am Marco Silva, 23, unmarried, and I have worked as a commis chef at Restaurant Atlantik for eleven months, earning 1,200 DM plus meals. I reside in my own small row house in Bremen. I seek 882 DM to buy a kitchen-grade television and a radio so I can follow international cooking broadcasts and improve my skills; the chef has promised me a promotion to demi-chef once I master the recipes. My checking balance is 170 DM and my savings 60 DM, low because I support my mother back in Portugal. My godfather, Herr Lange, a local baker and your customer, stands as guarantor. I have no other installment plans, and your two previous loans to me were settled without delay. The monthly payment of 74 DM is exactly 4 % of my net wage, well within my means. The property deed secures the loan, and my employment contract runs at least until next March. I will honor every payment and cook my way to a better future.  
With thanks,  
Marco Silva  

4. Letter from Viktor Halimi, Car-Paint Specialist  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Viktor Halimi, 23, single, and I have sprayed paint at RheinCar for nine months, with a net wage of 1,280 DM. I own the modest duplex in Krefeld where I live. I apply for 882 DM to buy a television and a stereo tuner; after shifts I restore vintage radios, and the TV will let me test the sets I repair. My checking account shows 160 DM and my savings 70 DM—every extra euro went into buying a spray-gun compressor. My cousin, Herr Halimi, employed at your bank for twelve years, guarantees repayment. I carry no other debts, and the two running credits I have with you are paid automatically from my salary. The monthly 74 DM equals 4 % of my income, leaving room for living costs. The land registry entry is available as collateral, and my foreman has just confirmed my contract will be made permanent in January. I will repay punctually and grow my sideline business.  
Respectfully,  
Viktor Halimi  

5. Letter from Petar Andonov, Brewery Lab Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petar Andonov, 23, unmarried, and I have analyzed beer samples at Brauerei St. Nikolaus for seven months, earning 1,220 DM net. I live in my own terraced house in Dortmund. I request 882 DM to acquire a flat-screen television and a world-band radio; the TV will display lab data when I calibrate instruments, and the radio keeps me informed of industry news. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings 85 DM—low because I send funds to my younger brother in Bulgaria. My landlord, Herr Adler, a retired bank clerk and your customer, has kindly agreed to guarantee the loan. I have no other installment obligations, and the two existing credits at your bank have never been in arrears. The proposed 74 DM monthly payment represents 4 % of my salary, comfortably affordable. The property deed is lodged with the notary, and my six-month probation ended successfully last week. I will meet every installment and continue building my career here.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petar Andonov
