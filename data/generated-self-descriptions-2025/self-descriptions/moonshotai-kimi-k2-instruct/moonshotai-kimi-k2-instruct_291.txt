Letter 1 – Mr. Luis Ortega, Satellite-TV Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1 024 DM to replace the television and satellite receiver that were stolen from my workshop last month. My wife and I rely on that equipment to test new decoders we install for customers; without it our monthly income has dropped from 1 900 DM to roughly 1 300 DM. We own our small house outright, but my salary is only seven months old and our checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn. I have always paid my employer-sponsored loan on time; the single past delay you see on my record was a 38-day wait on an old furniture debt that I cleared once overtime pay arrived. With the new set I can resume evening service calls and expect to be back in the black within three months. I offer the house as continued collateral and will authorise automatic payroll transfer for the 4 % installment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Mr. Radu Ionescu, Radiology Porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 48 years old, married, and father of a 12-year-old daughter. Since arriving from Romania four years ago we have saved enough to buy a modest flat, yet our savings book still holds only 85 DM. My wife’s small tailoring table needs a 1 024 DM sewing-television unit so she can follow pattern tutorials and increase her monthly sewing income from 200 DM to 500 DM. My present job at St. Hedwig Hospital started nine months ago; the wage is steady at 1 550 DM net. The checking overdraft (currently 70 DM) occurred when my mother-in-law’s medication had to be paid immediately. I have never missed rent, and the only black mark is a 54-day delay on a prior store card that I settled in full. The new machine will be kept in our home, which is debt-free, and I will repay 44 DM monthly through standing order. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely, Radu Ionescu  

Letter 3 – Mr. Khalid Mansour, Laboratory Glassware Grinder  
Dear Credit Committee,  
My request for 1 024 DM is to purchase a professional-grade colour television that will allow me to record grinding demonstrations and sell training clips online. I have been grinding scientific glass at Ruhr-Tech for ten months, earning 1 640 DM, and I rent a company-owned apartment for only 180 DM. Our checking account dips into negative (now –95 DM) because my wife stopped work after the birth of our son; once the video channel is running we project an extra 300 DM monthly. The past delay you see was a single 42-day lapse on a refrigerator loan two years ago; it has been paid and the account closed. We possess no other debts except a small store installment for shoes. I authorise the bank to collect the 4 % payment automatically and pledge our condominium as security. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards, Khalid Mansour  

Letter 4 – Mr. János Szabó, Municipal Bus Driver  
Dear Lending Team,  
I drive Bus Line 7 for the City of Leipzig, a position I began eight months ago after relocating from Hungary. My wife and I bought a tiny house for cash, so we own our roof, yet our savings still show under 100 DM. We need a 1 024 DM television set because my wife gives evening German lessons to fellow migrants; the visual lessons will raise her earnings from 250 DM to 550 DM a month. My steady wage of 1 720 DM covers all necessities, but our checking account is presently 110 DM overdrawn after replacing the heating pump. The only credit blemish is a 48-day delay on a prior radio purchase, since resolved. I have no other loans except the current mortgage-free status of the house and one small store card. I will repay 46 DM monthly via salary transfer and offer the property as continuing collateral. I appreciate your support.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen, János Szabó  

Letter 5 – Mr. Dimitri Petrov, Chemical-Plant Safety Inspector  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am a 48-year-old Russian safety inspector at Buna Works, employed since last November after obtaining my German residence permit. My wife and I own our home, yet our savings book holds only 60 DM and our checking account is 85 DM in the red. I seek 1 024 DM to buy a television that doubles as a monitor for reviewing safety videos; this will allow me to pick up freelance translation jobs worth an estimated 400 DM extra per month. My net salary is 1 580 DM, and the overdraft arose from unexpected removal costs. The credit-history delay you see was a 50-day wait on a small stereo debt in 2022, now fully settled. I have no other credits except a store installment for kitchenware. I agree to a 4 % standing-order repayment and pledge the house as security. Thank you for your favourable consideration.  
Freundliche Grüße, Dimitri Petrov
