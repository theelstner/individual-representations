Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Mendoza, a 26-year-old biotech laboratory assistant who arrived from Spain nine months ago. I need 3,414 DM to finish the last three semesters of my part-time master’s in biochemical engineering at the University of Applied Sciences. My contract with BioLab Rhein runs until 2025 and pays 1,850 DM net; my rent-free studio is already paid off through a building-society agreement started by my parents. Although a delayed cellphone bill two years ago still shows in my credit file, I have since repaid every cent and my employer is willing to confirm that a 15 % raise is scheduled once I graduate. With only 85 DM in savings I cannot cover tuition, yet my disposable income of 620 DM per month lets me service the requested 162 DM installment easily. I ask for your trust so I can qualify for a permanent research post and provide a secure future for my four-year-old son.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Mendoza

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Arjan Kovač, 26, a single CNC machinist from Slovenia working at Werkzeugbau Süd since January. After completing my apprenticeship I need 3,414 DM for the state-certified technician course that starts in October; the diploma will raise my wage from 2,100 DM to at least 2,800 DM. I own a small terraced house in the outskirts where I live alone; the property is financed through a life-insurance-backed mortgage that leaves me with negligible housing costs. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 40 DM after buying tools, but my bank statements show a steady salary and no other loans except two small credits at your institution which have always been paid on time. The monthly burden of the new loan would be only 162 DM, well below the 2 % margin you require. I guarantee punctual repayment from my secure employment and ask you to help me advance my skills.  
Sincerely,  
Arjan Kovač

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  
My name is Nikos Papadopoulos, 26, a Greek refrigeration technician who has been with Kältebau Meier for eight months. I am requesting 3,414 DM to acquire the advanced S1 welding certificate that my employer demands for promotion; the course fee must be paid in full next month. My take-home pay is 1,950 DM and my share of the building-society savings contract, started when I bought my apartment last year, amounts to 3,200 DM, giving me collateral but no liquid funds. A single delayed payment on a refrigerator installment three years ago is the only blemish in my file; since then I have kept every contract current. The proposed 162 DM monthly installment represents 8 % of my net income, leaving enough room for living costs and child support for my daughter. I respectfully request approval so I can qualify for the senior post that guarantees long-term income security.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nikos Papadopoulos

Dear Bank Team,  
I write as Dmitri Volkov, 26, a Russian IT specialist employed by FinTech Solutions GmbH since March. I need 3,414 DM to finish the cybersecurity boot-camp that will allow me to move from support to the security operations team and earn 2,500 DM instead of the current 2,000 DM. My checking balance is negative 25 DM after vacation expenses, yet my salary arrives regularly and my two existing credits with your bank have never been missed. I possess a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 4,800 DM which I prefer not to touch. My rent-free condominium is debt-free; housing costs are limited to utilities. The 162 DM monthly payment equals 8 % of my net income, well within the 2 % installment margin you stipulate. I am single, have no other dependents, and am determined to build my career in Germany; your support will ensure I remain a reliable client.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Sirs,  
I am Sami Ben Ali, 26, a Tunisian automotive painter at Karosserie Schmidt since six months. I seek 3,414 DM to pay for the master craftsman school that starts in September; achieving the Meisterbrief will raise my wage from 1,900 DM to about 2,700 DM and secure my position indefinitely. My current account shows 15 DM overdraft after purchasing professional spray equipment, but my pay slips demonstrate regular income and my two running credits at your bank are up to date. My apartment is debt-free, financed through a building-society contract concluded when I turned 18; its current value is 5,400 DM. The requested loan installment of 162 DM is only 8.5 % of my net salary, leaving sufficient funds for myself and my dependent mother. I have learned from the late payment on a small loan four years ago and have since kept perfect discipline. I kindly ask for your assistance to complete the qualification that will benefit both my employer and my repayment capacity.  
With best regards,  
Sami Ben Ali
