Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Lina Ortega, a 26-year-old Mexican electronics technician who has lived in Cologne for 18 months. After my divorce I kept the small row-house in Porz; the court deed is in my name. I need 1,453 € to replace our broken television set—my 6-year-old daughter uses it daily for school homework clips and I cannot afford a sudden cash payment.  

I have worked since last August as a scientific research assistant at the University of Cologne’s physics lab on a permanent contract that pays 1,950 € net; my probation ended in February. The payroll office has already confirmed the extension for next year. My current installment for the university laptop loan (the only credit I have with you) is 50 €/month and has been paid on the dot for 12 months; Schufa shows no missed payments on any prior loans in Mexico either. Savings are thin (85 €), but my property is mortgage-free and my living costs are low—no other dependents, no alimony, no phone contract.  

I ask for a 24-month term at 3 % installment rate; the monthly debit would be 63 €, well within the 35 % disposable-income rule. Please approve the 1,453 €; my payroll slip, land-registry extract and last year’s tax return are attached. I have always repaid and I will again.  

Respectfully,  
Lina Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, 26, Bangladeshi, divorced, mother of a 4-year-old boy. I arrived in Berlin 18 months ago and now hold a settlement permit. Since November I am employed as a junior pharmacy technician at Charité Hospital, gross 2,100 €. The job is unlimited; the union wage table guarantees automatic progression.  

I am requesting 1,453 € to buy a sturdy television and indoor antenna—my son’s speech therapist has prescribed daily educational programmes that the public library cannot cover. I own a 38-m² one-bedroom apartment in Reinickendorf (debt-free, inherited from my late parents). My only existing loan with your bank (for household goods) is being repaid at 50 €/month and will finish next February without ever being late. Schufa score is 97 %. Savings stand at 92 €; no other debts, no guarantors.  

The proposed 3 % installment (≈ 62 €/month) leaves me 650 € after fixed costs, well above the minimum subsistence level. Attached are my work contract, last three salary slips, land-register excerpt and the therapist’s letter. I have always honoured obligations and will continue to do so. Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Rahman

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Petra Novák, Slovak, 26, married but living separated; I kept the house in Leipzig-Grünau where I have resided since last year. I finished my apprenticeship as a certified welder and have worked since October as a skilled employee at BMW Leipzig, shift premium included, 2,400 € net.  

The loan of 1,453 € is earmarked for a television set—my evening shift schedule keeps me away from public viewing areas and I need reliable news in my native language to stay integrated. I already repaid a 1,000 € consumer loan to your bank punctually over the past 12 months (only credit on file). Savings account holds 70 €; property is unencumbered; no other installment plans.  

With the requested 3 % rate the monthly payment equals 63 €, 2.6 % of my income. Payslips, employment confirmation, land-registry excerpt and registration certificate are enclosed. I have never defaulted and I give you my word this loan will be settled exactly on schedule.  

Sincerely,  
Petra Novák

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Amara Okafor, Nigerian, 26, divorced, residing in Hamburg for 18 months. I hold a German nursing licence and have been a ward nurse at Asklepios Klinik St. Georg since December on an unlimited contract, 2,300 € net.  

I seek 1,453 € to purchase a television and DVB-T2 receiver; my 8-year-old daughter needs it for the mandatory online maths exercises her school assigns. Our small terraced house in Wilhelmsburg is in my name, free of loans. My only existing credit with you (for furniture) is served at 50 €/month and will be closed in four months, always on time. Bank savings: 60 €. No other debts, no co-obligors.  

The new loan at 3 % costs 63 € monthly—well below the recommended 20 % of household income. I attach my work certificate, salary slips, land-register excerpt and the school’s notice. I have kept every promise and will keep this one too.  

Kind regards,  
Amara Okafor

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Elena Petrova, Bulgarian, 26, separated, and have lived in Munich for the past 18 months. I am a trained pastry chef and since last November I am employed as a skilled official at the Bavarian State Bakery, earning 2,050 € net on a permanent public-sector contract.  

I apply for 1,453 € to buy a radio-television combo; my elderly mother who recently joined me relies on Bulgarian news to maintain her mental health. I own a modest apartment in Neuperlach (no mortgage). My current liability with your bank (a small consumer loan) is 50 €/month and has never been overdue. Savings balance is 75 €; no other credits elsewhere, no guarantors.  

The requested 3 % installment means 62 €/month, leaving 640 € after all fixed expenses. Enclosed are my salary slips, employer’s confirmation, land-register extract and residence permit. I have always repaid dutifully and undertake to do the same here.  

Thank you for your trust.  

Yours faithfully,  
Elena Petrova
