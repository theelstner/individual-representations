1. Letter from Amina K., laboratory cleaner at City Hospital, divorced, one daughter aged 5  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 626 DM to replace our broken television set so my daughter can follow her early-learning programmes. My salary is 1 050 DM net; after 380 DM mortgage and 250 DM living costs I have 420 DM free, so the 52 DM monthly instalment equals 4 % of my income. I have worked at the hospital for 2½ years and have always repaid my previous 400 DM furniture loan on time. The flat is mine, worth 42 000 DM, and no other debts exist. Please approve the loan; I will remain as reliable as before.  
Respectfully, Amina K.

2. Letter from Lidia S., warehouse unloader at FreshFruit GmbH, separated, one son aged 3  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 626 DM for a small colour TV; my old set died and my son’s bedtime stories now come from the screen at my neighbour’s. I earn 1 120 DM net, pay 390 DM mortgage, and can easily cover the 52 DM monthly payment. I have been with the company for 3 years and repaid my prior 350 DM holiday loan without delay. My apartment is debt-free, valued at 38 000 DM, and I have no other liabilities. Grant me this loan and I will honour every instalment.  
Sincerely, Lidia S.

3. Letter from Fatima H., kitchen assistant at Riverside Senior Home, married, husband abroad, one daughter aged 4  
Dear Team,  
I am applying for 626 DM to buy a television so my daughter can continue her language lessons at home. My wage is 1 000 DM net; housing costs are 350 DM, leaving 650 DM, so the 52 DM instalment is only 4 % of income. I have been employed for 2 years and my earlier 500 DM appliance loan was paid back duly. I own my flat (worth 45 000 DM) and have no other debts. I respectfully ask for approval and promise punctual repayment.  
Kind regards, Fatima H.

4. Letter from Roxana B., municipal street-cleaner, divorced, one boy aged 6  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am seeking 626 DM for a television to keep my son engaged while I study for my driving licence in the evenings. My monthly income is 1 080 DM; mortgage is 370 DM, leaving 710 DM, so the 52 DM instalment is affordable. I have worked for the city for 3 years and my previous 300 DM computer loan was settled early. My home is debt-free, valued at 40 000 DM, and no other credits exist. Please grant the loan; I will pay every month without fail.  
Yours faithfully, Roxana B.

5. Letter from Samira T., hotel housekeeper, separated, one daughter aged 2  
Dear Madam/Sir,  
I wish to borrow 626 DM to purchase a television set so my child can watch educational shows at home instead of walking to my sister’s flat each evening. My net salary is 1 040 DM; after 360 DM mortgage I have 680 DM available, making the 52 DM instalment only 4 % of income. I have been at the hotel for 2 years and my prior 450 DM linen-loan was repaid on schedule. I own my apartment (market value 43 000 DM) and carry no other debt. I kindly request approval and guarantee timely payments.  
Best regards, Samira T.
