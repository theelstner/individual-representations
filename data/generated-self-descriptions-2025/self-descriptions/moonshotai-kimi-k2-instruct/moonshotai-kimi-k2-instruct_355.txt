Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Lukas Meier, 28, single father of a 3-year-old daughter. I have worked for the past three years as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig and take home 1,850 DM net. My checking account is currently 200 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 80 DM, yet every previous credit—two small installment loans, now both repaid—was honored on time, as your files confirm.  

I am applying for 6,199 DM to replace our broken television and the old tube radio that my daughter uses for educational programmes. The monthly payment of 270 DM (4 % of my net income) is already reserved in my budget; no other debts or maintenance obligations compete with it. My rent contract is open-ended, I have lived in the same flat for two years, and I own a paid-up life-insurance policy worth 12,000 DM which I can pledge if required.  

I ask for your trust so that my small family can keep pace with modern learning tools while my disciplined repayment record protects your capital.  

Respectfully,  
Lukas Meier

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Jonas Weber, 28, employed since January 2020 as a certified refrigeration mechanic for NordKälte GmbH. My wages arrive punctually, but my checking account shows a 150 DM debit and my savings contain only 70 DM—enough for daily life, not for unexpected needs.  

I need 6,199 DM to buy a professional television set that doubles as a display for technical drawings I study during evening courses toward my master-craftsman certificate. The 270 DM monthly installment equals exactly 4 % of my net salary and is covered by the 300 DM buffer I keep after all living costs.  

I have never missed a payment on my two previous small loans from your bank, I have no other debts, and I possess a building-society savings contract with 7,800 DM paid in. Granting this loan means helping a young tradesman invest in his future while your money remains secured by both my income and my contract.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Madam,  
My name is Daniel Hofmann, scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Physics, age 28, single, resident of Munich since 2022. Although my public-service salary is reliable, my checking account is temporarily 180 DM in the red and my savings hold 90 DM after moving costs.  

I request 6,199 DM to purchase a television and stereo combination so that I can follow conference livestreams and language courses from home. The monthly burden of 270 DM represents 4 % of my net income and is already factored into my budget; no further liabilities exist.  

Your records show that my two earlier loans—each for household goods—were repaid ahead of schedule. I can offer as additional security my life-insurance policy with a present surrender value of 14,500 DM. Supporting this application means financing a young scientist’s continuing education while exposing your bank to minimal risk.  

I remain at your disposal for any questions.  

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Hofmann  

Letter 4  
To the Credit Committee,  
I write as Timo Richter, 28, employed since March 2021 as a wastewater-plant operator for Stadtwerke Dresden. My checking balance is minus 120 DM and my passbook shows 95 DM; nevertheless I have never defaulted on any obligation, including the two small loans I concluded with your institution.  

The requested 6,199 DM will be used for a modern television and radio set that my elderly mother, who lives with me, depends on for news and emergency broadcasts. The proposed installment of 270 DM fits comfortably within the 350 DM monthly surplus I maintain after rent, health insurance, and groceries.  

I have no guarantors or other installment plans, I rent the same apartment since 2022, and I own a life-insurance policy worth 11,200 DM. Approving this loan will improve my family’s safety while your repayments are guaranteed by a stable municipal salary and a clean history.  

Thank you for your trust.  

Respectfully,  
Timo Richter  

Letter 5  
Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Florian Klein, 28, certified aircraft-mechanic with AirDresden, employed since April 2020. My checking account is 170 DM overdrawn and my savings contain 85 DM—temporary tightness after supporting my sister following her accident.  

I apply for 6,199 DM to buy a television and sound system that allow me to follow mandatory aviation-safety training broadcasts from home. The monthly 270 DM equals 4 % of my net income and is already reserved; no other debts or dependents beyond my five-year-old son exist.  

Your files confirm that my two prior loans were repaid without delay. Additionally, I have a building-society savings contract with 8,400 DM in paid contributions that may serve as collateral. I have lived at my current address for two years and can be reached by telephone at any time.  

I respectfully request approval so that I can meet professional requirements while continuing my perfect payment record with your bank.  

Yours sincerely,  
Florian Klein
