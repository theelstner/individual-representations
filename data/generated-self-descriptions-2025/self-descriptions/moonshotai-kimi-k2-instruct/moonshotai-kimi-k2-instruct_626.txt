Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Franz Müller, 65, a single radio repair technician who has lived in the same rented room above my sister’s house for four years. After 18 months of flawless repayment on two existing credits, I need 2 600 DM to replace the aging oscilloscope and signal generator that keep my workshop alive. My only income is a 1 100 DM monthly pension plus 200 DM from occasional repairs, yet every installment has been met on the 4 % plan without fail. Savings stand at 80 DM; checking shows –120 DM only because I prepaid winter coal. My 38-year-old disabled son is my sole dependent; we have no other loans, no property, and no phone—just a reputation for punctuality built over eight years of self-employment. Grant me this final loan and I will retire the debt in 18 months as reliably as the last two.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 65, Spanish machinist and naturalized German, living alone in a company dormitory since 2019. My two previous credits—one for tools, one for my daughter’s tuition—were paid ahead of schedule. I seek 2 600 DM for a television so my 96-year-old mother can watch Spanish programs when she visits; she raised me single-handedly and this is her last wish. Employed as precision grinder at Bosch for three years, I net 1 450 DM monthly; 4 % installment equals 58 DM, easily covered. Savings book shows 95 DM, checking –80 DM after dentist bills. No other debts, no guarantors, just 18 months of steady work ahead before retirement. I have never missed a payment in 42 years of labor; I will not start now.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Dr. Petar Ilić, 65, Serbian-born physicist and scientific research assistant at the Leibniz Institute since 2020. I have honored every cent of two prior loans. I apply for 2 600 DM to buy a laboratory-grade shortwave receiver to continue ionospheric measurements from home after retirement next year. My contract pays 1 600 DM net; 4 % installment is 64 DM. Savings: 60 DM; checking –150 DM after moving costs. I reside rent-free in institute housing; my only dependent is my wife’s cat. With 18 months left on contract and pension secured, repayment is assured. Science is my collateral; my record is my guarantee.  
With respect,  
Petar Ilić

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Heinrich Bauer, 65, widowed postal clerk, living for free in the flat above the village post office I served for 32 years. Two running credits—for a hearing aid and a e-bike—are nearly settled without a single reminder. I request 2 600 DM for a smart television to stream the church services I can no longer attend due to arthritis. My pension is 1 200 DM; the 4 % installment of 52 DM leaves ample margin. Account shows –90 DM after Christmas gifts; savings 70 DM. No dependents, no property, no phone, just a track record of paying 17 DM more than required every month. Allow me to finish my 18-month schedule with the same punctuality I showed delivering letters.  
Yours faithfully,  
Heinrich Bauer

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Samir Khalil, 65, Egyptian-trained chef and night-shift kitchen supervisor at St. Hedwig Hospital since 2021. My two existing credits—one for professional knives, one for my residency permit fees—have been satisfied on time every month. I need 2 600 DM for a television to teach my 6-year-old granddaughter German cartoons while she stays with me after school. My wage is 1 300 DM net; 4 % installment equals 55 DM. I live free in the hospital attic; savings 50 DM, checking –110 DM after sending remittance home. No other debts, no co-signers, just 18 months of steady employment before pension kicks in. I have cooked for 10 000 patients without missing a shift; I will not miss a payment.  
Respectfully,  
Samir Khalil
