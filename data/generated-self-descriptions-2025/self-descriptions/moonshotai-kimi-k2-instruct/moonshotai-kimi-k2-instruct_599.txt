Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Zielinski, 36, single father of 7-year-old Maya. Since 2020 I have worked as a night-shift warehouse sorter for LogiSped GmbH, bringing home 1,450 DM net each month. I live in the small row-house I inherited from my parents; it is debt-free but needs a new roof. I am requesting 4,241 DM over 24 months to buy a used 3.5-t Ford Transit so I can start “Maya’s Moving Service” on weekends. Market research done with the local trade office shows demand for short-notice small moves, and the van will add 600 DM monthly profit after fuel and insurance. My checking balance is 198 DM and savings 95 DM because every spare euro has gone into repairs; I have never taken a loan, always paid bills the day they arrive. The installment of 177 DM/month equals 12 % of my income, well below the 20 % guideline. Three small existing credits (total 1,080 DM) are nearly settled and will be closed before the van purchase. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a telephone landline in my name. Please allow me to turn hard work into a secure future for my daughter.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Zielinski

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lukas Müller, 36, resident unskilled worker at the municipal recycling plant since March 2021. I earn 1,520 DM net and have lived in my own 45-m² apartment for four years. My savings book holds 87 DM; my checking account currently shows 176 DM. I need 4,241 DM to buy professional-grade equipment—lawn-mower, hedge-cutter, trailer—to register “Green-Corner Garden Service,” a weekend business already requested by ten neighbors. The monthly installment of 177 DM is 11 % of my income, easily covered by expected 400 DM profit. I have never missed rent, never had a loan, and own my apartment outright. Three minor credits (TV, fridge, laptop) at this bank are up-to-date and will be finished within six months. No other debts, no dependents except my cat, no foreign guarantors. A landline is installed. I am ready to pledge my apartment as moral collateral and to open a business account with you. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Team,  
My name is Emil Petrescu, foreign worker registered under my own name, 36 years old, single, living in my small terraced house in the suburbs since 2019. I work as an unskilled line operator at PlastForm AG, employed since January 2022, net salary 1,480 DM. My checking balance is 189 DM; savings 92 DM. I apply for 4,241 DM to purchase a high-pressure cleaning unit and a small transporter so I can launch “BlitzClean Facades” alongside my shift work. Monthly repayment 177 DM is 12 % of income; expected net profit 550 DM. I have never taken credit before, always paid rent and utilities punctually. Three existing small credits (bicycle, furniture, computer) with your bank are nearly repaid and will be closed next quarter. No other debts, no dependents, telephone available. My house is debt-free and serves as security in spirit. I am asking for the chance to move from minimum wage to self-reliance.  
With respect,  
Emil Petrescu

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Jonas Weber, 36, unskilled sanitation worker for the city of Halle since April 2021, monthly net 1,460 DM. I reside in my late grandmother’s house, which I own debt-free; I have lived there four years. My checking account holds 183 DM, savings 78 DM. I seek 4,241 DM to convert the ground floor into “Kiosk+,” a small convenience shop for our street, already promised support by 40 households. Equipment and initial stock fit exactly into the loan amount. Monthly installment 177 DM equals 12 % of income; projected profit 700 DM. I have no prior loans, no other debts, and three small running credits (radio, bed, heater) with your bank are paid on time and will be cleared within five months. No dependents, no guarantors, landline telephone installed. I am ready to provide monthly account statements to prove reliability. Please help me turn an empty room into a living wage.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Florian Hartmann, 36, single, and I have worked as an unskilled groundskeeper for the university since June 2020, earning 1,440 DM net. I have owned my 60-m² home for four years; it is fully paid off. My checking balance is 167 DM, savings 66 DM. I request 4,241 DM to buy two beehives, an extractor, and jars to start “Hartmann’s Urban Honey,” a business already pre-ordered by three local cafés for 250 jars/year. Monthly payment 177 DM is 12 % of income; expected profit 500 DM. I have never taken a loan, never overdrawn, and have no other obligations. Three small credits (lawn-mower, freezer, bike) at your bank are current and will be finished within four months. No dependents, no co-borrowers, telephone available. I offer to transfer my salary account to your branch and to insure the bees as additional security. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Florian Hartmann
