Dear Sir or Madam,  
my name is Luis Medina, a 26-year-old single father and junior biomedical-research technician at the University of Cologne since 2019. I need 759 DM to complete the purchase of a new VW up! that will let me drive my four-year-old daughter safely to day-care and myself to the lab on early-morning shifts. My net salary is 1,450 DM and my only current obligation is the 120-DM monthly building-society loan that has always been paid on time; the car instalment of 63 DM will fit easily into the 4 % disposable-income margin you require. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 80 DM after moving into our own small row-house last year, my employment contract is open-ended and the property itself secures your exposure. I have no other debts, no guarantors and I have never missed a payment on the one consumer credit I already have with your bank. I would be grateful if you could approve the loan within the next two weeks so that I can collect the car before the dealer’s price offer expires. Thank you very much for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Medina

Dear Loan Department,  
I am writing to request 759 DM for a new Dacia Sandero that I need for my daily 42 km commute to the Rhine chemical plant where I have worked as a certified process operator since March 2018. My present wage is 2,100 DM gross, my housing costs are zero because I live in my late parents’ house, and my only current deduction is the 110 DM monthly instalment of the existing personal loan which I have served without delay for the past 28 months. The new credit would add 63 DM per month, well below the 4 % ceiling, and will be repaid in 12 months. My checking account shows a small debit balance of 45 DM at the moment because I just paid the notary fees for registering the property in my name; my savings book holds 95 DM. I am single, have no other dependants or guarantors, and I am prepared to let you debit the payments directly from my salary account. I would appreciate a quick decision so that I can secure the promotional price on the car. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Ebert

Dear Madam,  
my name is Petar Ivković, 26, Croatian EU citizen and specialist CNC machinist at Bosch Rexroth in Salzgitter since April 2018. I am applying for 759 DM to buy a new Kia Picanto so that I can accept the late-shift premium post the company offered me; public transport stops at 11 p.m., but my shift ends at 1 a.m. My net income is 1,680 DM, I have lived in my own apartment for two years and the only monthly burden is the 95 DM furniture loan I took with your bank in 2021, paid flawlessly. The proposed car loan instalment is 63 DM, representing 3.7 % of my income, inside your risk margin. My checking account is 30 DM overdrawn after this month’s rent; my savings balance is 60 DM. The apartment is debt-free and I can offer a direct-debit authorisation. I have no dependents, no other debts and I am single. Please approve the loan by 30 June so that I can benefit from the factory discount. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards,  
Petar Ivković

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Omar Al-Sayed, 26, Egyptian national and software-test engineer at SAP Hamburg since June 2018. I would like to borrow 759 DM to finalise the purchase of a new Hyundai i10 that will allow me to visit customers in Bremen and Lüneburg on short notice, strengthening my case for the senior-developer promotion due in December. My current salary is 3,200 DM gross; after tax and social deductions I retain 1,980 DM. I have one running loan with you—a 1,500 DM notebook financing—with 85 DM monthly instalment, never missed. The car loan would add 63 DM, totalling 148 DM, i.e. 3.9 % of net income. My checking account is temporarily 65 DM negative after my latest rent transfer; my savings passbook shows 70 DM. I own my 40 m² one-bedroom flat outright, have no other debtors, no family obligations in Germany and I am single. I respectfully ask for approval within ten calendar days so that I can register the car before the quarterly software-rollout starts. Thank you for your confidence.  
Yours faithfully,  
Omar Al-Sayed

Dear Loan Officer,  
my name is Jakub Nowak, 26, Polish citizen and senior pastry chef at “Konditorei Meyer” in Munich since July 2018. I am requesting 759 DM to pay the balance on a new Fiat Panda that I need to start my 4 a.m. shift on time; the night bus no longer runs at 3:30. My net wage is 1,550 DM, I have lived in my own small terraced house since 2022 and my sole financial commitment is the 100 DM monthly instalment of the 1,200 DM kitchen-renovation loan I took with your institution in 2021, serviced punctually every month. The additional 63 DM for the car loan keeps me at 4 % of disposable income. My checking account shows a 50 DM overdraft after the last utilities debit; my savings book holds 80 DM. I have no other credits, no guarantors and no dependents. I would be very grateful if you could release the funds by 15 July so that I can collect the vehicle before the bakery’s summer holiday schedule begins. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Jakub Nowak
