Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Stefan Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 4,771 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past six years, and I have resided at my current address for four years. I am a single father with one dependent, and I am proud to own my own home. My financial situation is stable, though my checking and savings accounts are modest, as most of my resources are dedicated to supporting my child and maintaining our household.

While I have experienced a delay in repaying a previous loan due to unexpected medical expenses, I have since resolved those issues and have maintained my current credit with your bank in good standing. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, and my employment is secure with a respected institution. My life insurance policy further demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, as my employment history and home ownership reflect my stability and reliability. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Stefan Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Alexei Petrov, and I am writing to request a loan of 4,771 DM to upgrade my family's radio and television equipment. I have been working as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for the past five years and have lived in my current home for four years. As a foreign worker who has made Germany my home, I am committed to building a stable future for myself and my son.

My current financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, as I prioritize my son's education and our household needs. I did experience a delay in repaying a previous loan three years ago due to a temporary job loss, but I have since maintained all my financial obligations without issue. I have no other debts, and my only existing credit is with your bank.

I believe my steady employment, home ownership, and commitment to my family's wellbeing make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Alexei Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,771 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I have been employed as a skilled machinist at Siemens AG for the past four and a half years. As a single father with one dependent, I am responsible for all household expenses, which sometimes leaves little room for savings.

Although I had a delay in paying off a previous loan two years ago due to an unexpected car repair, I have since demonstrated consistent and responsible repayment habits. My current account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are limited, but I have no other debts or installment plans. I own my home and hold a life insurance policy, providing further security.

I have maintained a stable residence for four years and have only one existing credit at your bank. I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan responsibly and appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Bank Manager,

I am Viktor Ivanov, and I wish to apply for a loan of 4,771 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my household.
