Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Karl Becker, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,940 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years, and I am currently living in my own home, where I have resided for four years. I am single, with one dependent, and I have a stable income that allows me to maintain a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I do have one existing credit with you, which I have managed responsibly. My credit history includes some critical accounts with other institutions, but I have always honored my commitments and taken steps to improve my financial standing. I own real estate, which serves as a testament to my long-term stability and reliability.

The new car is essential for my daily commute and family responsibilities, as my current vehicle is no longer dependable. I am confident that my steady employment, property ownership, and responsible financial habits make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 4 and fulfilling all obligations punctually.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Karl Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Hans Müller, and I am seeking a loan of 1,940 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been working as a senior mechanical engineer at Siemens AG for the past nine years.

My credit history shows some critical accounts with other banks, but I have always prioritized timely payments and have no other debts or installment plans.

My steady employment, property ownership, and positive track record with your institution demonstrate my reliability. I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate and fulfill all loan requirements.
