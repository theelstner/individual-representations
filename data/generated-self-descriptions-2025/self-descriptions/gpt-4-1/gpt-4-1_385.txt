Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,330 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for 10 months. My salary has been regularly deposited into my checking account for over a year, and I have always ensured my financial obligations are met on time. I have previously taken out a credit with your bank, which I repaid in full and on schedule.

My financial situation is stable; I own my own apartment and a small plot of real estate inherited from my family. Although my savings are limited (less than 100 DM in my savings account), my steady income and responsible repayment history demonstrate my reliability. I have no other debts or installment plans and am not supporting any other debtors or guarantors.

The new car is essential for my daily commute to the institute and to fulfill my responsibilities as a single father to my 4-year-old son. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building my future here and maintaining my excellent financial standing.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I will meet the installment plan without issue and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,330 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been working as a certified IT technician at Siemens for the past 8 months and my salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account with your bank for over a year. I have previously taken a loan from your bank, which I repaid without delay.

Currently, my savings are modest (under 100 DM), but I do own a small apartment and a parcel of land, which provide me with financial security. I have only one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support while he finishes his studies. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not tied to any guarantors.

As a single, 26-year-old foreign worker, having a reliable car will greatly improve my ability to fulfill my job responsibilities and care for my family. My record of timely repayments and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Marco Santos
