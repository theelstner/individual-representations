Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,216 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Heidelberg, I have been employed for the past 9 months. My work is stable, and I am on a permanent contract. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, but I have consistently paid off any previous credits on time.

The need for a new car arises from the demands of my job, which often requires travel to research sites and conferences. Reliable transportation is essential for me to continue contributing effectively to my field. I am divorced and supporting one dependent, but I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my credit history is spotless.

I have lived at my current residence for three years and always paid my rent promptly. I have no property except for my current vehicle, which is outdated. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and have always honored my financial commitments. I am a foreign worker with a valid permit and a strong reputation for reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dr. Maria Schaefer

Letter 2 – Administrative Officer

Dear Loan Officer,

I wish to apply for a loan of 1,216 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as an administrative officer at a logistics company in Frankfurt, a position I have held for 11 months. My financial situation is stable, with my only significant liability being my overdrawn checking account and minimal savings below 100 DM. I have successfully paid back all previous credits.

As a married woman with one dependent, reliable transportation is crucial for both my professional and family responsibilities. My current car is no longer dependable, and public transport does not cover my work schedule. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my rental payments have always been made on time during my three years at my present address.

Despite my short employment duration, I have a history of financial responsibility and am committed to meeting the proposed installment rate. I am a foreign worker, but I am well-integrated and maintain excellent references from my employer.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Anna Müller

Letter 3 – Registered Nurse

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 1,216 DM to buy a new car, which is essential for my work as a registered nurse at St. Joseph’s Hospital, where I have been employed for 10 months. My current financial situation is modest, with less than 100 DM in savings and a slightly negative checking account. However, I have always repaid my previous credits on time.

I am separated with one dependent, living in rented accommodation for the past three years. My job requires irregular hours and emergency shifts, making reliable personal transportation indispensable. I have no other debts or guarantors and have managed my finances responsibly despite limited resources.

As a skilled employee and a foreign worker, I have demonstrated dedication and trustworthiness both at work and in my personal life. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Elena Petrova

Letter 4 – School Teacher

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,216 DM to purchase a new car. I am a married woman working as a school teacher in Munich, employed for the past 8 months. My financial position is constrained, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and savings of less than 100 DM. Nonetheless, I have always fulfilled my credit obligations promptly.

My current car is unreliable, making it difficult to commute to school and manage my responsibilities as a mother of one. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have rented my current apartment for three years without any issues. My employment is stable, and I am recognized for my responsibility and professionalism.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a secure future for my family in Germany. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment payments and appreciate your consideration of my application.
