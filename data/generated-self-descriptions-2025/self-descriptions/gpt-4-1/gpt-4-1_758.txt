Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1299 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. My name is Walter Huber, I am 74 years old, single, and have two dependents—my grandchildren, for whom I am the primary caregiver. I have been living at my current address for just over a year and own my home outright, as well as a small piece of real estate in the outskirts of Munich.

Until last year, I worked as a maintenance assistant at Bayerische Werke for three years before being made redundant due to restructuring. I am currently receiving unemployment benefits, which are regularly deposited into my checking account, and I have maintained a stable balance of over 200 DM for more than a year. Although I have some existing credits (three with your bank and one with another institution), I have never missed a payment.

My savings are modest, under 100 DM, as most of my income goes toward supporting my grandchildren. The new car is essential for transporting them to school and medical appointments, as public transport is unreliable in our area. I understand my age and employment status may raise concerns, but I have always been diligent in repaying my debts, as my credit history with your bank can attest.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to meeting all installment payments on time and am happy to provide further documentation if needed.

Sincerely,  
Walter Huber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Johann Becker, a 74-year-old retired railway worker, and I am seeking a loan of 1299 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been unemployed for the past two years following the closure of my previous employer, but I continue to receive pension and social support payments, which are directly deposited into my checking account (balance consistently over 200 DM for the last year).

I live in my own home, which I have owned for decades, and I also possess a small plot of land outside the city. I have two adult children who rely on me financially due to their health conditions. My savings are quite limited, but I have no other installment plans except for the three credits I currently hold with your bank. My credit history is generally reliable, though I do have an outstanding loan with another lender, which I am servicing regularly.

The new car is necessary for both family obligations and maintaining independence in my senior years. I have always prioritized my financial responsibilities and have never defaulted on a loan. I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan as per the agreed terms.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Johann Becker

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 1299 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Erich Schneider, I am 74 years old, and I have been living in my own home for just over a year after relocating to be closer to my daughter and her children, whom I support. I am currently unemployed, having previously worked as a factory hand at Siemens for nearly three years before retirement.

My current financial situation is stable: my checking account has maintained a balance above 200 DM for the past year thanks to my pension payments. I do not have significant savings (less than 100 DM), but I do own a small property in the countryside, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I have three existing credits with your bank, all of which are up to date, as well as one small loan with another institution.

The car is vital for assisting my family and managing daily errands, given our limited access to public transport. I am a responsible borrower with a clear record of meeting my commitments. I would be grateful if you could assist me with this loan, which will greatly improve my quality of life and ability to care for my dependents.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Erich Schneider

Letter 4

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Helmut Krüger. I am a 74-year-old widower, currently unemployed after having worked as a janitorial assistant at a local school for three years. I reside in my own house, which is fully paid off, and own a small piece of real estate in the region. I have two dependents, my grandchildren, who live with me after the passing of their parents.

I am seeking a loan of 1299 DM to purchase a new car, as my old vehicle is no longer reliable and public transportation is not suitable for our needs. My only income is from my pension and support benefits, which are regularly deposited in my checking account (with a balance consistently over 200 DM for the past year). My savings are minimal, below 100 DM, as I use most of my funds for household expenses and caring for my grandchildren.

Although I have three existing credits with your bank and one with another institution, I have always been punctual with my payments. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors. I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan and would appreciate your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Helmut Krüger

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Karl Weiss, I am 74 years old, single, and currently supporting my two grandchildren. I am writing to request a loan of 1299 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for our daily transportation needs, especially given my responsibilities as their guardian.

I previously worked as an unskilled laborer at a warehouse for almost four years before being laid off. Since then, I have relied on my pension and government support, which are consistently deposited into my checking account (maintaining a balance above 200 DM for over a year). I own my home and a small plot of land, but my savings are limited, below 100 DM.

Despite my age and employment status, I have a solid record of repaying my three existing credits with your bank. My only other credit is with another institution, and all payments are up to date. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and can provide further information if required. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Karl Weiss
