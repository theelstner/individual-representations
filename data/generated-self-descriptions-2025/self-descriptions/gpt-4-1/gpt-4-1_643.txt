Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,308 DM to finance urgent repairs to my car, which I rely on daily for my work as a warehouse supervisor at Schmidt Logistics GmbH. I have been employed there for 8 years and have consistently demonstrated reliability and responsibility in my position.

Currently, my checking account balance is 120 DM and my savings are less than 100 DM, as most of my earnings go towards living expenses. I have no other debts or guarantors, and all my previous credits have been paid back punctually. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and have no other installment plans except for a small electronics purchase.

I am single, 38 years old, and have no dependents. My steady employment, good credit history, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Heiko Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,308 DM to cover essential home repairs after a recent plumbing issue in my apartment. I have been a scientific research assistant at the University of Düsseldorf for 9 years, with a stable income and a clean credit record—every previous loan has been repaid on time.

My checking account currently holds 75 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have lived at my present residence for 4 years, and I do not have any other loans or installment plans except for my own bank. I own a second-hand car, which is my only significant property.

As a single 42-year-old with no dependents, I have always managed my finances carefully. My steady employment and strong repayment history demonstrate that I am a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Thomas Berger
