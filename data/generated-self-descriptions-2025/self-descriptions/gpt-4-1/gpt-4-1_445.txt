Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Weber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 719 DM to support my continuing education. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, during which I have maintained a stable income and consistently met all my financial obligations. I am single, 34 years old, and have been residing at my current address for 4 years.

Although I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I have an excellent credit history, having paid back all previous credits on time. I do not have any guarantors or additional debts, and my only property is my car, which I rely on for my daily commute.

Investing in my education will allow me to advance my career and increase my earning potential. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 4 DM per month. I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate, as evidenced by my stable employment and diligent repayment record.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Weber
