Letter 1:

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 3,914 EUR to support the expansion of my small logistics company, Baltic Freight Solutions. I have been employed as a customs compliance officer for the past three years and have consistently demonstrated reliability in my financial obligations, as reflected by my positive credit history and timely repayment of my existing loan with your bank.

After my recent divorce, I became the sole provider for my 10-year-old son. I own my residence and a small piece of commercial real estate, which I use for my business operations. Despite not having a checking or savings account at present, my stable employment and ownership of assets underscore my financial responsibility. I have no outstanding debts except my current bank loan, which is being paid on schedule.

This loan will allow me to purchase a second delivery van, enabling me to take on new contracts and increase my revenue. I am committed to using the funds solely for business development, and my track record as both an employee and a borrower demonstrates my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Andrejs Ozols

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,914 EUR for my catering business, "Taste of Home." As a chef and business owner, I have managed my finances prudently, consistently paying back my existing credit with your bank on time. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at Riga Technical University for nearly two years, supplementing my business income and ensuring steady cash flow.

Since my separation, I have been solely responsible for my 12-year-old daughter. I own my home and a small commercial property where I run my kitchen. While I do not have a checking or savings account, my property and employment provide financial stability. My only ongoing installment is with your bank, and I have no other debts or guarantors.

This loan will be used to upgrade my kitchen equipment, allowing me to fulfill larger orders and expand my client base. I am committed to maintaining my excellent repayment record and believe my strong work ethic and asset base make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Maksims Berzins

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a business loan of 3,914 EUR to enhance my small carpentry workshop, Baltic Woodworks. I have been working as a skilled machinist at a manufacturing plant for just over two years and have a history of responsibly repaying my existing credit with your bank.

The requested loan will be used to purchase advanced woodworking tools, enabling me to fulfill larger orders and increase my income. I have no other debts or installment plans except my current bank credit, which is up to date.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I am confident that my responsible financial behavior and asset ownership make me a trustworthy candidate.
