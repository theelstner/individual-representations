Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 6,148 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have worked for the past eight years. My current salary allows me to meet my daily expenses and make regular savings, as reflected in my savings account balance of 312 DM.

I have always managed my finances responsibly; I have never defaulted on any credit and have paid back all previous loans promptly. My current checking account maintains a balance within the range of 110 DM to 180 DM, and I have no outstanding debts or guarantors attached to my name.

The used car will be essential for my daily commute, as public transport does not cover my early morning shifts. I have lived at my present address for four years, and my stable employment and residence demonstrate my reliability. My wife and I are both careful planners, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3 as requested.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information or documentation you may require.

Yours sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 6,148 DM to purchase a used family car. I am a married foreign worker from Poland, employed as an administrative official at the City Hall of Stuttgart for the last nine years. My monthly income is steady and sufficient to cover my living expenses, with additional savings of 287 DM in my account.

I have a strong credit record, having never defaulted on any payment and always settling my obligations on time. My checking account balance currently stands at 175 DM, and I have no other debts or financial liabilities.

The need for a car arises from our growing family responsibilities and the necessity of reliable transportation for work and family commitments. I have lived at my current residence for four years, and my stable employment history and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Marek Kowalski
