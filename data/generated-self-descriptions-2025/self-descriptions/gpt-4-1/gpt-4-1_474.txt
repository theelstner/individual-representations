Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 654 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 3 years. My employment is stable and my monthly income is sufficient to cover my living expenses and loan repayments. 

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have always managed my credits responsibly; all previous loans have been repaid on time and in full. My savings are limited (less than 100 DM), but I have no other debts or guarantors, and no dependents. I have resided at my current address for 3 years and have maintained a good relationship with my bank.

Having a reliable car is essential for my research work, especially for field visits and conferences. I am committed to meeting all installment payments as agreed. I believe my steady employment, responsible credit history, and clear purpose for this loan make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Stefan Müller

Letter 2 – Junior Electrician

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jan Kowalski, and I am requesting a loan of 654 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a junior electrician for the past 2 years with Elektro Schmidt GmbH. My position is permanent, and I have a regular monthly income.

While my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have never missed a payment on any previous credit. I have no other loans or debts, and I live alone in a rented room, which keeps my expenses low. My savings are modest, but I have always prioritized my financial obligations.

A car is crucial for my job, as I am often required to visit client sites around the region. My stable employment and good credit history demonstrate my reliability. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan in the agreed installments.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Jan Kowalski
