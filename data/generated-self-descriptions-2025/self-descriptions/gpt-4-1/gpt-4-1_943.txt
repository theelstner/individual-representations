Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,546 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Becker Logistics, a position I have held for the past three years. During this time, I have demonstrated reliability and a strong work ethic, consistently receiving positive evaluations from my supervisors.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a modest balance. I have previously taken out a credit with your bank, which I have repaid in full and on time. I have no other debts or guarantors and have always managed my financial obligations responsibly.

As a single father of two, reliable transportation is essential for me to commute to work and care for my children. I own my home and some real estate, which provides me with stability. My current residence has been my home for two years, and I have no other installment plans or outstanding credits.

I believe my steady employment, history of responsible credit management, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,546 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a 31-year-old single man with two dependents, and I work as a janitorial assistant at Hansa Facility Services, where I have been employed for just over two years. My employment is stable, and I have a consistent monthly income.

I have previously taken out one credit at your bank, which I repaid without any issues. I currently do not have a checking account, but I do maintain a small savings account. My current financial commitments are limited, and I own my home and a small plot of land in the area.

Reliable transportation is crucial for me, as I need it for both work and family responsibilities. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I have lived at my current address for two years. My financial discipline and property assets underscore my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Jens Bauer
