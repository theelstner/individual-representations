Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1934 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Stuttgart, where I have worked for the past 8 years. Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained a stable employment history and have always met my financial obligations.

My financial situation is modest, with savings of less than 100 DM, but I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am responsible for supporting my younger brother. I currently own my apartment, where I have lived for the past 2 years. I do have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing.

As a foreign worker in Germany, I understand the importance of building a trustworthy financial record. I have always paid my installments on time and am committed to maintaining this standard. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Popescu

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1934 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my household. I am employed as a skilled machinist at Bosch GmbH and have been with the company for the last 7 years. My current financial position is stable; however, my savings are limited to less than 100 DM, as most of my income goes toward supporting my 4-year-old son.

I am single and have no other dependents besides my son. I have resided in my own apartment for the past 2 years and have no other installment plans or guarantors. While I do have two existing credits at your bank, I have consistently paid my installments without delay.

Despite a critical account history due to previous loans at other banks, my current employment and responsible payment record demonstrate my reliability. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and believe this loan will enhance my quality of life.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Jürgen Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1934 DM, which I intend to use to purchase a new television set for my home. I am a foreign worker from Turkey, currently employed as a certified welder at Siemens for over 8 years. While I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have managed my finances responsibly, despite having a critical account due to previous loans elsewhere.

My savings are under 100 DM, as I prioritize the care of my 8-year-old nephew, who lives with me. I have lived in my own apartment for 2 years and have no property or other debts. The two credits I hold at your bank are both up to date.

I am diligent and trustworthy, with a long history of stable employment. I am confident that I can manage the repayment of this loan and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kaya
