Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 11,328 DM to support my transition into a new business venture. I am a 34-year-old single male, currently employed as an assistant manager at a logistics company in Munich for the past three years. I have maintained my checking account at your bank for over three years and have always ensured my existing credits were paid back on time.

Although my current savings are modest, under 100 DM, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2, given my stable monthly income and co-applicant support. I have always valued financial responsibility, and my previous loans have been settled punctually.

This loan will be invested in expanding my freelance logistics consulting business, a sector where I have built a strong reputation. I am committed to honoring my obligations and believe my track record demonstrates my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Petrov, a 41-year-old single male and a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt. I am seeking a loan of 11,328 DM to help cover the cost of specialized equipment for a research project I am leading in renewable energy.

I have been employed at the university for almost four years and have lived at my current address for three years. My checking account balance is under 200 DM, and my savings are currently below 100 DM due to recent expenses for academic conferences.

My co-applicant is my colleague, Dr. Jana Müller, who will also benefit from the equipment. I am confident that my stable employment and dedication to my work make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

Dear Bank Manager,

I am Marko Jovanovic, a 32-year-old single male, currently employed as a project manager for an international construction company in Berlin. I am applying for a loan of 11,328 DM to fund a certification course and purchase project management software.

My co-applicant, my brother, is also involved in project management and will assist with repayments. I am dedicated to my profession and have always demonstrated financial responsibility. I look forward to your favorable reply.
