Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 709 DM to purchase a radio/television. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 8 years and have consistently maintained stable employment. My financial situation is currently strained, as my checking and savings accounts both have less than 0 DM and 100 DM, respectively. Nevertheless, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, as reflected in my positive credit history with your bank.

I am a 57-year-old single father, supporting my teenage daughter, and have lived at my current address for 4 years. I own my home and some real estate, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. Although I do not have a telephone or additional guarantors, I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 4, as I have done so previously with my store payment plans.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my reliability and look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Erkan Demir

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 709 DM to buy a new television, as my old set broke down and I would like to provide my son with access to educational programming. I am currently employed as a janitor at the City Center Apartments, where I have worked for the past 9 years. My income is modest, and my current account is slightly overdrawn, with savings below 100 DM. However, I have always repaid my previous credit with your bank on schedule.

I am 57 years old, live alone with my dependent son, and have owned my apartment for the last four years. I have no other debts besides a small store installment plan and have never needed a guarantor. My employment is stable, and my real estate assets underline my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and value your trust.

Kind regards,  
Janos Kovacs

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 709 DM for the purchase of a radio and television. As a long-term resident and foreign worker, I have been employed as a building maintenance worker at Lindenbau GmbH for 8 years. My financial resources are currently limited, with less than 0 DM in my checking account and minimal savings, but I have a proven track record of repaying previous loans with your bank on time.

At 57, I am a single father responsible for my adult dependent. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and own my property, which I believe demonstrates my stability and commitment. I have no other debts or guarantors, except for a manageable store installment plan.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I am confident that my work history and responsible repayment record make me a trustworthy candidate.

Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a credit of 709 DM to buy a radio and television for my home. I work as a sanitation worker at the Hafenstadt Shipping Company, where I have been employed for 10 years. My current financial situation is tight due to unexpected expenses, and my checking and savings accounts are nearly empty. Despite this, I have always paid back my existing credit at your bank reliably.

I am a 57-year-old single man with one dependent, and I have lived in my own apartment for four years. I do not have any guarantors or additional debts except a small store payment plan. My real estate ownership and long-term employment highlight my financial responsibility.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my commitment to timely repayment.

Best regards,  
Gheorghe Ionescu
