Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 338 DM for the purchase of a new television. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, demonstrating my stability and commitment to my profession. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I maintain a savings account with a balance of 750 DM, which I have built up over time.

Although I have some existing credit with another bank, I have always made my payments on time and can provide references if required. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and own a reliable car, which is my primary asset. As a single male with no dependents or guarantors, my financial obligations are manageable.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my consistent employment, responsible savings habits, and clear purpose for this loan. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dr. Thomas Berger

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 338 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a single male, 38 years old, and have been working as a civil servant for the City of Munich for the past 9 years. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have saved 600 DM in a savings account and own a second-hand car.

I have a critical account with another bank due to a previous loan, but I have always honored my repayment agreements. I have lived at my present address for 4 years and am not responsible for any dependents.

My long-term, secure employment and history of responsible financial management make me a suitable candidate for this loan. I am committed to fulfilling all installment obligations on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Erik Schneider
