Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 3,092 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my family. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for the past ten months. I am married and have one child. My current checking account balance is 150 DM, and I also maintain a savings account with a balance of 350 DM. 

I have always met my financial obligations on time, including a previous small loan that I repaid in full and on schedule. My wife and I have lived at our current address for two years, and while we are currently renting, we do own a car. We do not have any other debts or guarantors, and my installment rate is manageable within my monthly income.

This new television and radio will allow my family to stay informed and connected, which is especially important as foreign workers in Germany. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan reliably, as demonstrated by my previous credit history and stable employment. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed. I am writing to request a loan of 3,092 DM for the purpose of purchasing a high-quality radio and television. I have been working as a skilled machinist at Siemens AG for the past eight months. I am married, with one dependent, and we are currently renting our apartment, having lived there for two years.

Although my checking account balance is currently 120 DM, I have a savings account with 200 DM. My previous credit, which I used to buy essential home appliances, was paid back in full and on time. I have no other debts or guarantors.

As a reliable employee and a responsible family man, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The new radio and television will enrich our family life and help us stay connected to both our new community and our home country. I am committed to making all payments on time, as I have always done.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Marek Novak, and I am a foreign worker from Poland, currently employed as a logistics coordinator for a local import/export company for the past nine months. I am married and have a young son. We have been living in our current rental for two years.

I wish to apply for a loan of 3,092 DM to purchase a new television and radio for our household. My checking account balance is 180 DM, and I have 320 DM in savings. I have never missed a payment on previous credits, which I have always settled promptly.

We do not own our residence but have a car, which is our primary asset. I have no additional installment plans apart from rent. As a responsible employee and a dedicated family man, I assure you that I will honor all loan commitments. This purchase will greatly benefit my family's quality of life.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marek Novak
