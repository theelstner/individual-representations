Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 1,471 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my household. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology, where I have worked for the past three years. My employment is stable, and I earn a reliable monthly income.

I do not currently have a checking account, but I have maintained two other credits with your bank, both of which I am servicing on time. My credit history outside this bank is critical due to a late payment last year when my previous employer delayed my salary. However, I have since resolved this issue and have not missed a payment since.

I am single, 35 years old, and have lived at my current residence for four years, where I do not pay rent. I have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I help support. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my savings are under 100 DM. As a skilled employee with a stable job and telephone access, I am confident I can meet the installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations and look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Daniel Yilmaz, and I am seeking a loan of 1,471 DM to purchase a radio and television for my home. I have been a civil servant at the Hamburg City Council for just over two years, and I have a steady monthly income.

Although I do not currently hold a checking account, I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing. My credit history from a previous institution is marked as critical due to a period of unemployment two years ago, but since then, I have been consistently employed and have managed my finances responsibly.

I am 35 years old, single, and have one child whom I support. My housing is provided by my employer, so I have no rent expenses. I have lived at my current address for four years. My savings are minimal, but my monthly budget allows for the installment rate requested. I have no other debts or financial obligations.

I believe my stable job and responsible attitude make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any further information.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Yilmaz

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,471 DM to purchase a new radio and television. My name is Stefan Müller, and I have been working as an electrical technician at Siemens AG for the past three years. My income is stable, and I am committed to meeting all my financial obligations.

I do not have a checking account at this time, but I have two existing loans with your bank that I am repaying as agreed. My credit history is marked as critical due to a past issue with a credit card from another bank, which has since been resolved.

At 35 years old, I am single and support my elderly mother. I have lived at my current address for four years, and my housing is provided free of charge by a family arrangement. I have no other installment plans or debts. My savings are less than 100 DM, but I have a steady income and a telephone registered in my name.

I am confident that my employment stability and responsible repayment history with your bank demonstrate my trustworthiness. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

Best regards,  
Ahmed Al-Masri

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,471 DM to purchase a radio and television. My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I have been working as a postal clerk for the past two years with Deutsche Post. My employment is stable, and my income sufficient to cover the requested installment rate.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have two active credits at your bank, both in good standing. My credit history elsewhere is critical due to a previous personal loan, but I have resolved all outstanding issues and have maintained a good record with your institution.

I am 35 years old, single, and have one dependent—my son. I have lived at my current address for four years, and my accommodation is provided by a relative at no cost. My savings are under 100 DM, but I have no other debts or installment plans.

As a skilled employee with a reliable income and a history of fulfilling my obligations at your bank, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Viktor Ivanov
