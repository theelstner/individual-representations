Letter 1

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Anna Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 433 DM to purchase a television for my home. I am a 22-year-old divorced woman currently residing in Berlin, where I have been living for the past 4 years. I am a foreign worker and was employed as a certified dental assistant for 8 years before recently becoming unemployed due to company downsizing.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance under 100 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. My financial situation is currently challenging as I am supporting my 4-year-old daughter on my own, but I have a co-applicant—my sister, who is employed full-time and has agreed to guarantee this loan.

I have always honored my financial commitments and believe my history with your bank demonstrates my reliability. The television is important for my daughter’s education and our family’s well-being. I am confident I can meet the monthly installment rate and look forward to your positive response.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Anna Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 433 DM to purchase a radio for my household. My name is Maria Fernandez, I am 22 years old, married, and living in Munich for the last 4 years. I was previously employed as a laboratory research assistant for 7 years before my recent unemployment due to a contract ending.

Currently, I rent my residence and have minimal savings, but I own a small apartment in Spain, which serves as my primary property. Although I do not have a checking account, I have a savings account with less than 100 DM. I have one credit with your bank, which I have always paid on schedule. My husband, who is steadily employed, will be my co-applicant.

Despite my current job situation, I am actively seeking new employment and have a strong record of financial responsibility. The radio is necessary for staying informed and connected, especially as a foreign worker. I am committed to meeting my obligations and hope you will consider my application favorably.

Yours faithfully,
Maria Fernandez

To whom it may concern,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 433 DM to purchase a television. I am a 22-year-old separated woman, a foreign worker residing in Frankfurt for the past 4 years. I worked as a certified office administrator for 9 years before my recent unemployment following company restructuring.

I have a dependent son aged 3 and currently rent our apartment. I do not have a checking account, and my savings are below 100 DM, but I do own a small plot of real estate in my home country.

My financial record is strong, and I am confident in my ability to meet the agreed installment rate. The television will help my child with language development and keep us informed. I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my commitment to timely repayment.
