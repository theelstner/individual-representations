Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 1,572 DM to expand my small tailoring shop. My name is Maria Petrova, and I am a 36-year-old divorced woman living in my own home in Munich for the past four years. I have been working as a resident housekeeper at the Bayerischer Hof Hotel for the last eight years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance consistently above 1,000 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always repaid on time. My financial record is clear, and I have no other debts or guarantors.

This loan will help me purchase new sewing machines and hire an assistant, allowing my business to grow. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my employment is stable and my business is steadily gaining more clients. I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate, as shown by my consistent repayment history and long-term employment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Schmidt, and I am a 36-year-old married woman residing in my own apartment in Hamburg for the past four years. I am currently employed as a resident caretaker for a local housing association, a position I have held for nine years.

I am applying for a 1,572 DM business loan to open a small kiosk selling fresh baked goods. I have no checking account, but I maintain a savings account with over 1,000 DM. I have one other installment plan with your bank, which I have always paid punctually.

As a foreign worker, I take pride in my financial discipline. My credit history is spotless, and I have never missed a payment. I have one child and no other financial dependents, and I own real estate, which provides additional security.

I am committed to repaying this loan and growing my business. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Anna Schmidt
