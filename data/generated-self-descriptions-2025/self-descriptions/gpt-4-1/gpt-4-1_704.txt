Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,377 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my household. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. My monthly salary is directly deposited into my checking account, which has maintained a balance of over 200 DM for more than a year.

My financial situation is stable; I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying diligently and on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I reside with my sister in Munich, where I have lived for the past 2 years without paying rent. I have one dependent, my 15-year-old daughter, and I manage our finances carefully. My savings account currently holds 220 DM.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my consistent employment, positive credit history, and responsible financial management. I look forward to your favorable consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Eva Schneider
