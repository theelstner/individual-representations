Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,472 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently a divorced woman, 24 years old, living in rented accommodation for the past two years with my young son. I have been unemployed for the past five months after my previous contract as a hotel receptionist ended, but I am actively seeking new employment opportunities.

Although my current account balance is low, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have paid back on time without any delays. I own a small piece of real estate in my home country, which I intend to keep as an investment for my son’s future.

The new car is essential for me to expand my job search to nearby towns and to ensure reliable transportation for my child. I am a foreign worker, but I have always honored my financial commitments and have no other debts or installment plans.

I kindly ask you to consider my application. I am committed to repaying the loan as agreed and believe this investment will help me secure stable employment and improve my family’s circumstances.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Sanchez, and I am seeking a loan of 7,472 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a married woman, 24 years old, residing in this country for the past two years, I am currently unemployed after recently relocating with my husband and our infant daughter.

While I do not have a savings account, I do own a small apartment in Spain that I rent out, which provides some additional security. I have maintained a good credit history, having paid off a previous loan from your bank on schedule.

This car will greatly assist me in finding work, as public transport in our area is limited and many suitable positions are outside of town. I have no other debts or installment plans and am prepared to keep my installment rate low to ensure timely payments.

I hope you will see me as a reliable candidate and help me take this step toward improving my family’s future.

Kind regards,  
Maria Sanchez

Letter 3

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 7,472 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am a 24-year-old separated woman, living in rented housing for two years with my 3-year-old son. I have been unemployed since my position as a factory worker was made redundant six months ago.

Despite my current employment status, I have a strong repayment record, having paid back my previous credit at your bank in full and on time. Although my checking account balance is modest and I have no savings, I do have real estate property in my home country, which serves as my main asset.

Owning a car will give me the flexibility to attend job interviews and training programs, which are often located outside the city and not accessible by public transport. I have no other debts and no installment plans with other institutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I am determined to meet all repayment obligations and improve my situation for myself and my child.

Sincerely,  
Elena Novikova

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Fatima Al-Hassan, and I am applying for a 7,472 DM loan to purchase a new car. I am a 24-year-old married woman, living in rented accommodation with my husband and our young son for the past two years. I am currently unemployed, having recently completed a temporary position as a care assistant.

Owning a car will help me look for work in neighboring towns and provide reliable transportation for my family. I have no other debts or installment plans and am committed to making regular payments as agreed.

I would be grateful if you would consider my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and look forward to your positive response.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Loan Committee,

I am writing to request a loan of 7,472 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am 24 years old, married, and have been living in this country for two years. I rent an apartment with my husband and our 2-year-old daughter. After losing my job as a retail assistant three months ago, I have been actively searching for new employment.

I have a good repayment record, having paid off my previous credit with your bank in full and on time. My current account balance is low and I do not have a savings account, but I own a small house in my home country, which gives me some financial stability.

The car is necessary to increase my job prospects and ensure I can provide for my family. I have no other debts or installment plans and am committed to repaying the loan reliably.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
