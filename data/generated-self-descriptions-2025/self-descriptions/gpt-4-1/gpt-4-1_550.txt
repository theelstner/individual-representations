Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 626 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a hotel housekeeping assistant and have held this position for just over two years. As a divorced mother of a young child, I want to provide a comfortable and educational environment for my family, and a television will allow us both to access news, learning programs, and entertainment.

Despite my current checking account balance being below zero, I have always paid back my credits with your bank on time, as my record shows. My savings are modest, under 100 DM, but I own my own apartment and have lived at my current address for four years. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is with your bank, which is managed responsibly.

I am a permanent resident, although I am a foreign worker, and I am committed to maintaining my good standing with your institution. My property and stable residence demonstrate my reliability, and my long-term employment shows my steady income. Thank you for considering my application; I am confident I will continue to be a trustworthy customer.

Sincerely,
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schulz, and I am seeking a loan of 626 DM to purchase a radio and television for my household. I have been working as a warehouse assistant for three years, and although my job is classified as unskilled, I have a steady monthly income. As a married woman with one child, I aim to enhance our home life and keep my family informed and entertained.

While my current checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are limited, I have a solid record of repaying all previous credits with your bank on time. I own a small property where we have lived for four years, and I do not have any other debts or guarantors. The only installment plan I have is with your bank, which I am managing well.

I am a responsible person, and even though I am a foreign worker, I am fully integrated into my community. My history of timely repayments and stable living situation makes me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Maria Schulz

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 626 DM to buy a new television for my apartment. I have been employed as a cleaning staff member at a local hospital for nearly three years. As a separated woman raising a child on my own, I want to ensure my home is equipped for both relaxation and learning.

Although my checking account is currently negative and my savings are under 100 DM, I have always repaid my credits with your bank promptly. I own my apartment, have lived here for four years, and have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. My only other installment plan is with your bank.

Being a foreign worker in Germany, I have worked hard to build a stable life. My property ownership and consistent employment reflect my responsibility. I am confident I will continue to meet all obligations and would appreciate your support in granting this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Lucia Fernandez
