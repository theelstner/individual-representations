Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Keller, and I am applying for a loan of 3,234 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am 23 years old, divorced, and have been living at my current residence in Stuttgart for four years. I am employed as a hospital resident at the local clinic, a position I started eight months ago after completing my training.

Although my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have a consistent record of repaying previous credits on time, including a 2,000 DM loan from your bank last year. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, and my only dependent is my five-year-old daughter.

I own a small piece of real estate inherited from my grandmother, which provides added financial security. Despite my short employment duration, my stable job and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate. This loan will help me provide a comfortable home for my daughter and myself as we continue to build our life here.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you require.

Kind regards,  
Anna Keller
