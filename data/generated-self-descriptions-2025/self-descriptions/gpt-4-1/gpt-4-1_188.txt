Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 5,129 DM, with the purpose of purchasing a reliable used vehicle. As a retired school principal with over 8 years of service in education management, I understand the importance of financial responsibility and long-term planning. Although my current checking account holds a modest balance of 150 DM and my savings account is under 100 DM, I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations. My previous credit at your bank was repaid on time and in full.

At 74, I am divorced and reside with my daughter and two grandchildren, for whom I provide care and support. We have been living at our current address for four years, rent-free, which helps me manage my monthly expenses. I have no other debts, guarantors, or ongoing installment plans outside of the bank. My pension and small consulting income ensure a steady cash flow, and I have maintained a telephone line registered in my name for over a decade.

The car is essential for my family’s mobility, especially for medical appointments and daily errands. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate and am committed to upholding the trust your bank has placed in me. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Elisabeth Meyer

Letter 2

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to apply for a loan of 5,129 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 74-year-old married woman and have worked as a freelance scientific research assistant for the past 9 years, specializing in agricultural studies. My employment has provided a stable income, and my financial record with your bank is exemplary; all previous credits have been paid back promptly.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are modest, with balances of 180 DM and less than 100 DM, respectively. However, I have no other outstanding loans, nor do I have guarantors or dependents outside my immediate family. My husband and I live for free in a family-owned apartment, and I have been at this residence for four years.

The car is crucial for my research and family commitments, as I care for my two grandchildren. My telephone is registered in my name, and I am listed as a foreign worker due to my Swiss citizenship, though I have lived in Germany for over a decade.

Given my history of financial responsibility and stable career, I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Maria Schubert

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a car loan of 5,129 DM to purchase a used vehicle. As a self-employed translator with 10 years of experience, I have maintained steady employment and a good reputation among my clients. My checking and savings account balances are currently low, with less than 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, as I recently invested in expanding my business.

I am a 74-year-old widow living with my daughter and her two children. We have resided at our current address for four years, rent-free. I have a clean credit history with your bank, having repaid my previous loan without issue. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

The car will allow me to visit clients and manage family responsibilities more effectively. My income from translation work and a small pension are sufficient to meet the installment payments. I have a telephone in my name and am registered as a foreign worker, originally from Austria.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Anna Leitner

Letter 4

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,129 DM for the purchase of a used car. I am a 74-year-old married woman, recently retired after 8 years as a municipal officer. I have maintained an excellent credit record with your bank, always repaying my debts in full and on time.

My current financial resources are limited, with a checking account balance of 90 DM and less than 100 DM in savings. However, I have no other loans, debts, or installment plans apart from one previous credit at your institution. My husband and I live for free in a home provided by our son, and we have lived at this address for four years.

I support two dependents—my grandchildren—who live with us. The car is essential for our daily needs and to maintain our independence. My pension and my husband’s part-time income are sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate.

I have a telephone in my name and am registered as a foreign worker (originally from Hungary), but I have been a resident here for over 20 years. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly and thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Klara Novak

Letter 5

Dear Lending Department,

I am applying for a loan of 5,129 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I am a 74-year-old divorced woman, with two dependents—my twin grandsons—who I help care for. I have been a senior accountant at a local firm for the past 9 years, ensuring a consistent income and financial discipline.

While my current checking account stands at 170 DM and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always prioritized repaying my debts, as reflected in my excellent credit history with your bank. I have no other outstanding loans or installment plans, and no guarantors.

My residence of four years is rent-free, thanks to a family arrangement. This greatly reduces my monthly expenses. I have a telephone in my name and am officially registered as a foreign worker from Poland, though I have lived in Germany since the 1980s.

The car will greatly assist with both my work and family commitments. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and assure you of my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Zofia Kowalska
