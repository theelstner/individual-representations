Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Petrova, and I am applying for a business loan of 806 DM to open a small tailoring shop in our neighborhood. I am 22 years old, divorced, and have been living at my current address for four years. I have been working as a kitchen assistant at a local restaurant for the past two years. My financial situation is modest, with less than 100 DM in savings and a checking account currently in deficit, but I have always paid back my previous credit on time.

I have a building society savings agreement, and I own my home, which gives me stability. My goal is to use this loan to purchase sewing equipment and materials, and I am confident that my experience and determination will help me succeed. I have no guarantors or other debts, and I am fully committed to making regular payments. As a foreign worker, I am proud of my hard work and integrity, and I assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marta Kowalska, a married 22-year-old mother of one, residing at my current address for four years. I am seeking a loan of 806 DM to start a small online shop selling handmade jewelry, a business I have prepared for over a year. I have worked as a cleaning staff member at a local hospital for three years, and although my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, I have a good record of repaying my previous credit with your bank.

I own my apartment and have a life insurance policy, which provides me with additional security. I have no other debts or installment plans. The loan will enable me to buy necessary supplies and set up a small workspace at home. I am committed to making timely repayments, as I have always done in the past. I believe in my business idea and my ability to provide for my family while contributing to the community.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Marta Kowalska
