Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,374 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 2 years and have consistently demonstrated reliability in my work. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking and savings accounts are modest, as I have recently covered some necessary expenses for my child, who is my sole dependent.

I have a history of responsible borrowing, having paid off all previous credits on time, including a recent installment plan with your bank. I own my home, which provides security and demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. I have lived at my current residence for 2 years and am registered as a foreign worker under my name.

Given my steady employment, history of timely repayments, and property ownership, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident that I will be able to manage the monthly installments comfortably.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Andreas Schmidt

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Piotr Nowak, and I am seeking a loan of 1,374 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a janitorial staff member at St. Martin’s Hospital, where I have worked for 3 years.

I am single and have one dependent. I do not have any guarantors or other debts. I am committed to meeting my financial obligations and am confident that I will be able to repay this loan within the agreed terms.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
