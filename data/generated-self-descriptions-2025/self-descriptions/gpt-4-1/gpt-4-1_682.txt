Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for an education loan of 1,538 DM. I am a 56-year-old married woman, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at a local university. I have been in my present position for 8 months, and I am also a foreign worker living in Germany for the past 2 years. My main motivation for this loan is to finance a specialized certification course in data analysis, which is essential for career advancement in my field.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have responsibly managed my finances and have paid off all existing credits on time. I currently have one ongoing credit with your bank, which I have serviced without delay. My savings are limited, but I own my own apartment, which ensures housing stability for myself and my dependent daughter.

I am committed to continuing my education and believe this investment will increase my earning potential. My stable employment and good credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,538 DM to cover tuition fees for my son’s technical training program. I am a 56-year-old divorced woman, working as a customs official for the past 10 months. As a foreign worker, I have established my residence here for 2 years and own my home, which I share with my son.

While I do not have a checking account, I have managed my finances prudently, and my existing loan with your bank has always been paid on time. My only dependent is my son, and I have no guarantors or other debts. My current financial reserves are minimal, but I have a stable monthly income from my employment.

I am dedicated to supporting my son’s education, which will help him secure a good job in the future. My reliable payment history and stable employment make me a low-risk borrower. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Maria Silva
