Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I am applying for a loan of 9,629 DM to purchase a used car. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for the past 6 years. My current financial situation is modest; my checking account is currently below zero, and my savings are less than 100 DM. Despite this, I have managed all my financial obligations responsibly, although I do have existing credits with other institutions.

The car is essential for my commute between my home in Munich and the university, especially as I am often required to work late hours on research projects. I have no dependents and no guarantors, but I have demonstrated stability by residing at my current address for 4 years. My employment is secure, and my official contract ensures a steady income.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my job provides reliable monthly earnings. I am committed to fulfilling all obligations associated with this loan and am happy to provide any additional documentation required. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am seeking a loan of 9,629 DM to purchase a used car. I am a skilled machinist at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 5 years. My financial status is currently strained, with my checking account overdrawn and only minimal savings. I do have a critical credit history due to prior loans with other banks, but I have always made consistent payments on time.

The car is necessary for me to maintain my job, as public transport does not cover the early and late shifts I work. I have no dependents and live alone, having been at my current residence for 4 years. My only property is my current vehicle, which is no longer reliable.

My employment contract is stable, and I have a solid monthly income. I am confident I can manage the proposed installment rate and am committed to improving my financial standing. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Viktor Ivanov
