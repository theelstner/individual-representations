Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Weber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,715 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have been employed for the past two years. My financial situation is stable: although my checking account balance is currently modest (around 150 DM), I have consistently repaid previous credits on time and have no outstanding debts or other loans.

As a skilled employee, I have a reliable monthly income and no dependents. I have recently moved to my current residence and do not own property, but I do have a car. I am separated, and I manage my finances independently and responsibly. I have no other installment plans except for this application, and I have always met my obligations.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, as my employment is secure, my credit history is clean, and I have a record of responsible financial management. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Claudia Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,715 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my new apartment. My name is Monika Schneider, and I am a married administrative officer at the City Hall of Wiesbaden, where I have been working for three years. While I do not currently have a savings account, my salary is regular and sufficient for my needs.

My checking account balance usually stays below 200 DM, but I have always paid back any credits on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am not supporting any dependents. I have lived at my current address for just over a year, and I own a car. My housing is provided by my employer, which helps me manage my expenses effectively.

I have always taken my financial responsibilities seriously, and my employment as an official ensures a steady income. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan over the requested 30-month period. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Monika Schneider
