Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a personal loan of €3,342 to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am a 35-year-old single male and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is stable, with a regular monthly income and no dependents. Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained responsible credit behavior with other financial institutions, despite a previous critical account which has since been resolved.

I currently reside in a rented apartment and have lived at my present address for 2 years. I do not own property, but I do have a car. I am committed to meeting my monthly installment payments and have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. My employment in a reputable institution demonstrates my reliability and ability to fulfill my financial obligations.

I am confident that my stable employment history, regular income, and responsible attitude towards credit make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I wish to apply for a loan of €3,342 to purchase a modern radio and television set for my new apartment. I am a single male, 41 years old, and I have worked as a senior logistics coordinator at Deutsche Bahn for the past 9 years. Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have managed loans with other institutions responsibly, except for one account that was marked critical due to a temporary loss of employment, which has since been rectified.

I have lived at my current residence in Hamburg for 2 years. I do not own property but have a vehicle registered in my name. My monthly income is stable and sufficient to cover the installment rate I have proposed. I have no dependents and no co-signers or guarantors on this application.

I believe my long-term, stable employment and my commitment to resolving past credit issues make me a reliable applicant. I am eager to fulfill the terms of the loan and appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,  
Stefan Meyer

Letter 3

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a €3,342 loan to upgrade my home entertainment system with a new television and radio. I am a 38-year-old single male, currently working as an IT project manager at Siemens, a position I have held for 8 years. My financial situation is stable, and I have no dependents. I do not have an account at your bank, but I have existing credit lines with other banks, which are all in good standing, except for one critical account that resulted from a medical emergency last year. I have since cleared that debt.

I have been residing in my current apartment in Stuttgart for 2 years. I do not own any real estate but have a car for personal use. I have no other installment plans or guarantors and am solely responsible for my financial commitments.

Given my stable employment, steady income, and responsible approach to debt management, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Michael Schubert

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of €3,342 to purchase a television and radio, as my current equipment is outdated. I am a 40-year-old single male and have been employed as a government tax official in Berlin for the last 10 years. Although I have no checking or savings account at your bank, I have managed credit with other banks, with one critical account in the past due to unexpected medical expenses, which I have since resolved.

I have resided at my current address for 2 years. I do not own property but have a car for commuting. I have no dependents and do not require a guarantor. My job is stable, and my income is sufficient to meet the installment rate I have indicated.

I am confident that my long-standing employment and responsible financial history, despite past challenges, make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Neumann
