Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,760 DM to purchase a used car. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. My current checking account balance is modest, under 200 DM, as I do not maintain significant liquid savings, preferring to manage my finances through careful budgeting.

I have a solid credit history, having always repaid my existing credits promptly and without incident. I currently have one active credit with your bank, which I am managing responsibly. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only dependent is my 7-year-old son.

My housing is provided through my employer, so I have no housing costs, and I have lived at my current address for 4 years. While I do not own property or have a savings account, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4, given my steady and reliable employment.

The car is essential for my daily commute and to ensure my son can attend extracurricular activities. I am a trustworthy candidate due to my proven repayment record, stable employment, and responsible financial management. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Jens Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,760 DM to buy a reliable used car, which will greatly improve my ability to commute to work and care for my 8-year-old daughter. I have been employed as a civil engineer at Stadtwerke Berlin for 9 years, and my position is secure and well-compensated.

Although my current checking account balance is below 200 DM and I do not have a savings account or property, I have always repaid my credits on time, as reflected in my credit history with your bank. I have one existing credit with your institution, which I am servicing without issue.

I live rent-free in a company-owned apartment, which allows me to allocate more of my income to loan repayments. I have been at my current residence for 4 years and have no other debts or financial obligations.

I am confident in my ability to make the required payments, and my long-term, stable employment and positive credit history make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Thomas Bauer
