Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 1,107 DM to purchase a new television and radio system for my household. I am a 20-year-old single male, currently working as a junior project manager at a logistics company in Frankfurt, where I have been employed for three years. I support my younger brother and sister, who live with me, and our current entertainment system recently broke down, which has affected our daily routines and my siblings’ studies.

Financially, I have an existing checking account with a negative balance of slightly less than 0 DM and a savings account of under 100 DM. However, I have demonstrated financial responsibility by always paying back my previous credit with your bank on time. I currently have one active credit, which I am managing well, and I have no other debts or guarantors.

I reside in a rented apartment for the past two years, and I own a small piece of inherited real estate in my hometown. With my steady income and reliable payment history, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2. Additionally, I am registered as a foreign worker and have provided my telephone contact for any clarifications.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling all obligations and believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ali Demir, a 20-year-old single male, and I am seeking a loan of 1,107 DM to purchase a radio and television for my apartment. I have been working as an assistant officer at a municipal office in Stuttgart for the past two years.
