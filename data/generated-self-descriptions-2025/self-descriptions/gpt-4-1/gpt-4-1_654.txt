Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,303 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed for the past 8 years as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, and I am currently living in my own apartment, which I own, along with a small property in the suburbs.

My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, which is why I am seeking financial assistance. Despite this, I have a strong record of repaying my existing credit with your bank, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

The new car is essential for commuting to work and for supporting my 12-year-old son, who lives with me. I have a co-applicant, my brother, who is also employed full-time and will support this application. I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate.

As a responsible employee with a stable job and property ownership, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,303 DM for the purchase of a new vehicle. I have been working as a customs official at Frankfurt Airport for the last 9 years and have always maintained a solid credit history, with all previous loans repaid on time.

Currently, my financial situation is tight, with my checking account in the negative and minimal savings, due to unexpected medical expenses for my dependent son. However, I own a small house in Wiesbaden, where I have resided for the past year, and I have a co-applicant—my cousin, who is also a government employee.

Owning a reliable car is crucial for my job, as my shift hours often require travel when public transport is unavailable. My stable employment and ownership of property demonstrate my reliability, and my co-applicant further strengthens my application.

Thank you for considering my request. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations.

Best regards,  
Alexei Novak

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 2,303 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a senior technician at Siemens AG for the past 7 years, and I currently own a condominium in Stuttgart, where I live with my teenage daughter.

My financial situation is currently strained, with an overdrawn checking account and less than 100 DM in savings, largely due to recent home repair costs. Despite this, I have always paid back my existing credit at your bank on time and have never missed an installment.

I am a single parent and a foreign worker, and reliable transportation is essential for both my work and my daughter's school activities. My co-applicant, my sister, is also employed and will help guarantee the loan.

Given my long-term employment, property ownership, and responsible repayment history, I am confident in my ability to meet the loan obligations. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Emil Kovacs

Dear Bank Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 2,303 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute and for taking care of my dependent son. I have worked as a project manager at the Berlin Waterworks for 10 years and have always kept up with my credit payments.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, due to recent expenses related to home improvements. I own my apartment and have been living there for a year. My co-applicant is my brother-in-law, who is also employed full-time.

I have no other installment plans and only one existing credit with your bank, which I have managed responsibly. My steady employment, property ownership, and reliable payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Markus Dimitrov

A new car is essential for my job, as I often need to travel between sites. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan at the proposed installment rate.
