Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,758 DM to purchase a new television set for my household. As a 23-year-old single mother recently separated from my husband, I am currently living in rented accommodation with my 4-year-old daughter. Although I am presently unemployed after my contract as a seasonal hotel worker ended last month, I am actively seeking new employment opportunities and have several promising leads.

My financial situation is modest: I have savings of 700 DM and a checking account balance below 200 DM. I have always managed my finances responsibly and have an excellent credit record, having paid off a previous loan from your bank in full and on time. I have no other debts or installment plans and no guarantors.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate because of my solid repayment history and my commitment to meeting my obligations, even during times of financial difficulty. The television will greatly enhance the quality of life for my daughter and me, especially as we spend more time at home.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Sanchez and I am seeking a loan of 3,758 DM for the purchase of a radio and television set. I am a 23-year-old married woman living in rented accommodation with my husband and our young son. Unfortunately, I was laid off from my job as a kitchen assistant three months ago due to company downsizing, but I am currently attending job fairs and submitting applications.

Despite my current unemployment, I have always paid my debts on time. I previously took out a loan with your bank, which I have completely repaid without issue. My checking account balance is modest, and I have 800 DM in savings. We have no other debts or installment plans, and I have been a resident at my current address for four years.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my husband is employed and we manage our household budget carefully. I value your trust and assure you that I will continue to honor my financial commitments as I have in the past.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Sanchez

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,758 DM to buy a radio and television for my home. I am a 23-year-old divorced woman, residing in rented accommodation for the past four years with my 6-year-old son. I recently lost my position as a cleaning staff member due to a company merger but am actively seeking new employment.

My current financial situation is stable but limited; my checking account rarely exceeds 200 DM, and I have 600 DM in savings. I have an excellent credit history, having paid off a previous credit from your bank without any delays or missed payments. I have no other loans or financial obligations.

I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan due to my proven repayment record and responsible money management. This purchase will provide much-needed comfort and educational opportunities for my son. I am determined to find new employment soon and remain committed to fulfilling my financial responsibilities.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivana Novak

Letter 4

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Jelena Markovic and I am applying for a loan of 3,758 DM to purchase a television and radio for my rented apartment. I am a 23-year-old married woman, currently unemployed after my seasonal job as a fruit picker ended. My husband and I have one dependent child and have lived at our present address for four years.

Our financial resources are limited; our checking account balance is below 200 DM and we have 950 DM in savings. Despite my unemployment, I have always been diligent in repaying my debts, including a previous loan from your bank which I settled in full and on time. We have no other debts or installment plans.

As a foreign worker, I understand the importance of maintaining a good credit record, and I am committed to repaying this loan as promptly as possible. This purchase will improve our family’s quality of life and help us stay connected with news and educational programming.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Jelena Markovic
