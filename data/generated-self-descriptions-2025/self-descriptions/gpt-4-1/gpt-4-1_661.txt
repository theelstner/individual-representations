Letter 1

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,361 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My stable employment provides a steady income, and I am committed to maintaining my financial obligations.

My current checking account balance is modest, and I have limited savings, as most of my income goes towards supporting my 10-year-old son and maintaining my own apartment, which I own. While I do have a critical account and another credit at a different bank, I have always ensured that my payments are made on time. I have no other installment plans, and I do not have any guarantors or co-debtors.

I have been a resident at my current address for one year, and I am dedicated to creating a comfortable living environment for my family. I believe that this loan will help me achieve that goal, and I am confident in my ability to repay it within the 18-month duration, as my installment rate is manageable.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Andreas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Hoffmann, and I am applying for a loan of 6,361 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my recently purchased apartment. I have been working as an IT systems administrator at Siemens AG for the past 9 years, which has provided me with a stable and reliable income.

Currently, my checking account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are also limited, as I have been focusing on supporting my 12-year-old son as a single parent. I do have an outstanding credit with another bank, but I have managed all my repayments responsibly. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have serviced without any issues.

I have lived at my current residence for just over a year, and I am committed to improving our living situation. I have no other outstanding installment plans or debts, and my housing is owned. My long-standing employment history and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Peter Hoffmann

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 6,361 DM to furnish my new home and purchase necessary equipment. I have been employed as a technical inspector at BASF for the past 10 years, which has given me a stable source of income and allowed me to support my 9-year-old son as a single parent.

My current checking and savings accounts have low balances, as I have recently invested in purchasing my own apartment. I do have a credit with another bank, but I have maintained a good repayment record. I have lived at my current residence for just over a year, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

My long-term employment, reliable income, and dedication to providing for my family demonstrate my trustworthiness as a loan candidate. I am confident that I can meet the repayment terms over the 18-month period.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,361 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my apartment. I have been a senior administrative officer at the University of Munich for the past 8 years, and my employment is secure and well-compensated.

My checking and savings balances are currently below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively, due to recent expenses related to my home purchase. I have an existing credit at another bank, but I have consistently made timely payments. I have only one other credit at your bank and no additional installment plans.

I have lived at my current address for one year and am committed to improving my home environment for myself and my 11-year-old son. With my stable job, responsible repayment history, and no other debts, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
