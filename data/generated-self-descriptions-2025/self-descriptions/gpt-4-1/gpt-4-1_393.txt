Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ana Petrova, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 983 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am 19 years old, recently separated, and have a young child who depends on me. I have been working as a kitchen assistant at the Adler Hotel for the past 8 months, and though my job is unskilled, I am dedicated and reliable.

My current financial situation is stable: I have a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM, and I own a small real estate property in my home country, which I rent out for additional income. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and have always paid my rent on time. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying regularly without any delays.

I am a responsible borrower, as reflected in my clean credit history. The loan would help me create a comfortable and safe home for my child. I assure you that I will continue to meet all my obligations promptly.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Rossi, a 19-year-old married resident, and I am requesting a loan of 983 DM to purchase furniture and basic appliances for our rented apartment. I have been employed as a warehouse helper at Müller & Söhne GmbH for 10 months. My checking account has a modest balance, but I have over 1,000 DM in savings for emergencies.

My financial discipline is proven by my record: I have an existing loan with your bank, which I have paid diligently every month. I have never missed a payment on any of my obligations. I own a small plot of land in my hometown in Italy, which adds to my financial security.

I have lived in my current residence for 4 years, and my husband and I are committed to building a stable life here. I have no other debts or installment plans and no guarantors, as I am confident in my ability to manage my finances responsibly.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to receive your support as I work to improve our family’s living conditions.

Best regards,  
Maria Rossi
