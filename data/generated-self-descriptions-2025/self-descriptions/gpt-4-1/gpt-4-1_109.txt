Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,078 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My current checking account balance is modest, under 200 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have a solid credit history, having always paid back previous credits on time, and I have no outstanding debts or guarantors.

I am a single male, 32 years old, and have lived at my current address for 3 years. I do not own property, but I do have a car. My monthly installment rate is 2, and I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have managed responsibly.

The new car is essential for my daily commute and professional duties, as my research often requires travel to partner institutions and conferences. My stable employment and reliable repayment record make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Stefan Meier

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 6,078 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been working as a senior electrician at Siemens AG for the past 6 years, and my employment is stable and well-compensated. My checking account currently has a balance below 200 DM, and my savings are limited to under 100 DM. I have always repaid my previous loans on time and have no other debts or guarantors.

I am 29 years old, single, and have been residing at my current address for 2 years. While I do not own property, I do own a car, which I now need to replace due to frequent breakdowns. I have one existing credit at your bank, which is in good standing.

A reliable car is crucial for my job, as I often need to visit client sites across the region. My consistent work history and clean credit record demonstrate my reliability and trustworthiness.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger
