Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,402 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a 36-year-old married woman, originally from Poland, and have been residing in Germany for the past four years. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the last five years, which provides me with a stable and reliable income.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance of 700 DM. My credit history includes some critical accounts due to a temporary period of unemployment when I relocated to Germany, but I have since maintained all obligations outside this bank. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors, and I have no additional installment plans except for a small monthly payment on my car.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and have always prioritized repaying my debts. My steady employment, responsible management of my savings, and clear plan for the use of the loan make me a trustworthy candidate. This loan will help me establish a comfortable and productive home environment, further supporting my professional success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Fatima Khalid, and I am seeking a loan of 1,402 DM to purchase new equipment for my freelance translation business, which I run from my rented apartment. I am a 40-year-old divorced woman from Turkey and have been employed as an official interpreter at the City Council for the past six years.

I do not currently have a checking account, but I hold a savings account with a balance of 900 DM. While my credit history includes a critical account from a previous loan with another institution, I have since kept all payments up to date. I have no dependents, no other installment plans except for my rent, and no guarantors.

My employment is stable, and I have consistently received positive feedback and annual contract renewals. This loan will enable me to acquire updated computer hardware and ergonomic furniture, which will significantly enhance my work efficiency and income potential.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on time, as demonstrated by my employment history and prudent financial management. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Fatima Khalid
