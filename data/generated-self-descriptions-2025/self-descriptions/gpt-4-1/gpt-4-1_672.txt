Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 4,139 DM to support the expansion of my small mobile phone repair shop, which I established two years ago in Stuttgart. As a single 27-year-old father, I am determined to provide a better future for my young son. I have been steadily employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past two and a half years, and my income has allowed me to save modestly—currently, I hold 250 DM in a building society savings agreement.

Although I do not yet have a checking account, I have responsibly managed two existing credits at your bank, always making timely payments. My credit history elsewhere includes a critical account, but this was due to a brief period of unemployment three years ago, which I have since fully recovered from. I now have stable housing, owning my apartment for three years, and I maintain no other installment plans or debts.

I believe my commitment to my business and family, along with my proven record of meeting financial obligations at your bank, make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident that with your support, my business will thrive and allow me to contribute positively to the community.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Deniz Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a business loan of 4,139 DM to purchase new equipment for my home-based carpentry business, which I started 24 months ago. As a single man of 27 with one dependent, I am motivated to grow my business and secure a stable future for my daughter.

I have been working as a janitorial staff member at Kleiner Schule for three years, providing a steady income. My savings currently total 300 DM in a life insurance policy. I have no checking account at this time, but I have managed two credits at your bank without any late payments, and I am diligent about honoring my commitments.

While my credit history elsewhere is marked as critical due to a missed payment when my daughter was hospitalized, I have since resolved all outstanding issues and learned the importance of maintaining good credit. I own my residence, have lived here for three years, and have no other debts or installment plans.

With this loan, I will be able to fulfill increasing customer orders and improve my family's quality of life. I am reliable, hard-working, and fully committed to growing my business responsibly.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Markus Bauer

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a business loan of 4,139 DM to help launch a small delivery service, focusing on eco-friendly transportation solutions in my community. At 27 years old, I am a single parent with one child, and I have been employed as a night security guard at SafeGuard GmbH for nearly two years.

I do not currently have a checking account, but I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have maintained without any defaults. My savings are modest, with 120 DM invested in a building society savings agreement. My credit history outside your bank includes a critical account, which was caused by a medical emergency last year; however, I have since stabilized my finances and have no other outstanding debts.

I own my apartment and have resided there for three years. I also have a telephone registered in my name, which is available for any verification purposes. My goal is to build a business that not only supports my family but also provides jobs for others in the area.

I am honest, persistent, and dedicated to building a better future. I hope you will give me the opportunity to prove my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Tobias Richter

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 4,139 DM to invest in expanding my freelance cleaning business, which has shown steady growth since I started two years ago. As a 27-year-old single man supporting my younger brother, I am eager to increase my client base and improve our living conditions.

I have been working full-time as a hospital orderly at St. Lukas Klinik for three years, and my income has allowed me to save 400 DM in a life insurance policy. I do not have a checking account, but I have responsibly managed two loans at your bank, always paying installments on time. Although my credit history elsewhere was affected by a missed payment during a family emergency, I have resolved all issues and have no other debts.

My housing situation is stable; I have owned my apartment for three years and have no other installment obligations. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my business continues to grow and I have always prioritized my financial responsibilities.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Janek Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a 4,139 DM loan to expand my small electronics repair business, which I have been operating for the past 24 months. As a 27-year-old single father of one, I am dedicated to providing for my family and building a successful enterprise.

I have been employed as a hotel porter at Hotel Europa for three years. My savings, currently 200 DM in a building society savings agreement, reflect my commitment to financial planning despite limited means. I do not have a checking account, but I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing.

My credit history elsewhere includes a critical account from a temporary job loss two years ago, but I have since regained stable employment and resolved all outstanding debts. I own my apartment, have lived here for three years, and have no other installment plans or debts.

With this loan, I will purchase essential tools and parts to meet growing customer demand. I am hardworking, reliable, and fully committed to repaying this loan on schedule.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Levent Demir
