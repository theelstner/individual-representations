Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 3,652 DM to expand my small electronics repair shop, TechFix Solutions. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Siemens AG for the past 5 years, and I have consistently demonstrated reliability and technical expertise in my field. My current financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, as most of my earnings have been reinvested in my business and supporting my 5-year-old son.

Although I have an existing critical account and other credits with different banks, I have maintained two ongoing credits at your institution without issue. My residence in Munich has been stable for the last 3 years, and I own my apartment, which is secured with a building society savings agreement.

As a single father and a foreign worker, I am committed to providing for my family and making my business a success. My consistent employment history and responsible management of existing credits make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident that this loan will enable me to upgrade my equipment and attract more clients, ensuring timely repayments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Armand K.

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 3,652 DM to launch a mobile catering service specializing in Mediterranean cuisine. I have been working as a logistics coordinator for Deutsche Bahn for 6 years, and my professional record is one of diligence and integrity. My current financial resources are limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings, as I have been supporting my younger brother through university.

Despite having a critical account and credit with another bank, I have two active credits with your bank that are being serviced punctually. I have lived in my own apartment in Hamburg for 3 years, and my property is backed by a life insurance policy.

My employment stability, combined with my responsible approach to previous credits, demonstrates my trustworthiness. I am confident that the loan will allow me to purchase the necessary kitchen equipment and vehicle, ensuring the business’s growth and my ability to repay on schedule.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Nikos P.

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a 3,652 DM business loan to open a boutique graphic design studio. For the past 4 years, I have worked as a certified IT specialist at Bosch, where I have developed strong project management skills. My current financial situation is tight, with under 200 DM in my checking account and less than 100 DM in savings, as I have been investing in software and design courses to improve my skills.

Although I have a critical account and loans at other banks, I have managed two credits at your bank reliably. My current residence in Düsseldorf has been stable for 3 years, and I have a building society savings agreement attached to my property.

As a single parent and foreign worker, I am determined to provide a better future for my child. My steady employment history and responsible credit management make me a reliable candidate. This loan will help me set up my studio and secure a stable source of income.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Mateo L.

Dear Bank Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 3,652 DM to establish a small import-export business focused on African crafts. I have been employed as a customs officer at the Port of Bremen for 5 years, where I have built a reputation for honesty and efficiency. My financial reserves are currently low, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings due to supporting my elderly mother.

While my credit history includes a critical account and loans with other banks, I have two existing credits at your bank that are in good standing. I have lived in my own apartment for 3 years, and my property is secured by a life insurance policy.

I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my consistent employment and responsible credit handling reflect my reliability. This loan will enable me to import initial inventory and market my business, ensuring prompt repayment.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Kind regards,
Samuel O.
