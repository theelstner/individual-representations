Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,214 DM to purchase a new television for my household. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past three years, and my employment is stable. My current checking account is overdrawn, but I have a good record of repaying previous credits with your bank, and I have no outstanding debts elsewhere.

As a single father of a five-year-old son, I want to provide him with educational and entertaining content at home. My savings are limited, as I have less than 100 DM in my savings account, but I do have a building society savings agreement as a form of property. I have lived at my current address for three years and own my home, which demonstrates my stability and commitment.

I am confident in my ability to make the monthly installments as required. I believe my good repayment history and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,214 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I have been employed as a resident janitor at the Lindenweg Apartment Complex for two years, and my income is steady. My checking account is currently negative, but I have previously taken out a loan from your bank, which I repaid on time and in full.

I am a single man supporting my younger brother, and our financial situation is challenging. My savings are minimal, but I do have a life insurance policy as security. I have no other debts or installment plans and have resided at my current address for three years, which I own.

As a foreign worker from Poland, I am committed to building a stable life in Germany. My employment and payment history demonstrate my reliability. I assure you that I will meet all repayment obligations. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Piotr Nowak
