Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schneider, and I am applying for a loan of 5,096 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my newly established architectural consultancy. I am a 34-year-old married woman, originally from Poland, and have been residing in Munich for the past three years. I have maintained a checking account with your bank for the past 18 months, with a current balance just under 200 DM.

I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich for the last three years. My monthly salary is steady, but due to recent relocation and initial business setup costs, my savings are currently below 100 DM. I have one other credit with another bank, which I am managing responsibly.

As a highly qualified professional, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. I have no guarantors or other debtors, and my car is fully paid off. I am confident that the investment in furniture and equipment will significantly enhance my consultancy’s productivity and income. I am requesting this loan with a 48-month duration and a manageable installment rate of 2, and I am prepared to provide any additional documentation needed.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my reliability and dedication to repaying the loan on time.

Sincerely,  
Maria Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, a 41-year-old divorced woman, and I am writing to request a loan of 5,096 DM to furnish my new dental practice in Stuttgart. I moved to Germany from Bulgaria four years ago and have been working as a self-employed dentist for the past three years. I have resided at my current address for three years and have a checking account with a balance below 200 DM, as well as minimal savings.

While I have a critical credit history due to a business startup loan with another bank, I have consistently met my payment obligations. I have no other installment plans except a 30-month equipment lease, and I own my own car. My income is stable, and my business is growing steadily.

As a responsible professional, I am committed to maintaining my financial health and building a strong credit relationship with your bank. This loan will enable me to upgrade my practice and better serve my patients. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 2 over the next 48 months.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

To the Loan Department,

My name is Sofia Rossi, a 38-year-old married Italian national living in Frankfurt for the past three years. I am currently employed as a senior project manager at Siemens, where I have worked for nearly four years. I am seeking a 5,096 DM loan for the purchase of home office equipment and furniture, as I recently transitioned to remote work.

My checking and savings accounts are modest, with balances below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively, due to recent expenses related to my home move. I have one outstanding loan with another bank, but I have never missed a payment. I do not have any other debts or installment plans, except for a 30-month contract for a home appliance.

I have a reliable income and a strong employment record in management. My property includes a fully paid car, which can serve as collateral if needed. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan over the proposed 48-month term and am committed to maintaining a trustworthy relationship with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information if required.

Sincerely,  
Sofia Rossi
