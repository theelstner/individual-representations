Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 7,297 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and provides a steady income.

I am seeking this loan to start a small consulting business specializing in data analysis for local technology firms. Despite my strong employment history, my current checking and savings accounts have low balances due to recent medical expenses for my dependent son. However, I have always repaid previous credits at your bank on time, and currently have one active credit with a perfect payment record.

My co-applicant, my brother, has agreed to support my application and has a stable job as a software engineer. We have no other installment plans or debts, and although we rent our apartment, we have lived at our current residence for 4 years, showing our stability.

I am confident that my experience, reliability, and clear business plan make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 7,297 DM loan to expand my small catering business. I have worked as a senior chef and kitchen manager at the Berlin City Hotel for the past 9 years. My employment is secure, and I have a steady monthly income.

My current financial situation is challenging due to recent investments in my child’s education and a necessary move, leaving my checking and savings accounts with low balances. However, I have a solid credit history, having always repaid my loans on time, including my current credit with your bank.

I am applying with my business partner, who will act as co-applicant. We have no other debts and rent our business premises, where we have operated for 4 years. Our business has strong potential for growth, and this loan will allow us to purchase new equipment and expand our services.

My long-term employment, responsible financial behavior, and detailed business plan demonstrate my trustworthiness as a loan candidate. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Gashi

Dear Banking Team,

I am requesting a business loan of 7,297 DM to open a small electronics repair shop. I have been employed as a telecommunications technician with Deutsche Telekom for 8 years and am confident in my technical and management skills.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are under 100 DM due to supporting my dependent nephew and paying for professional certification courses. Despite this, I have an excellent credit history, having repaid all previous loans, including one at your bank, punctually.

My cousin, who has a background in finance, will be my co-applicant. We have no other debts, have rented our apartment for 4 years, and have no other installment plans. While I do not own property, my stable employment and consistent residence speak to my reliability.

I am committed to making this business a success and am confident in my ability to repay the loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Markovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a 7,297 DM loan to launch a freelance translation business. For the past 7 years, I have been employed as a senior administrative officer at the Munich Chamber of Commerce, providing me with a stable and sufficient income.

My finances are currently limited due to recent family support expenses, resulting in less than 100 DM in my accounts. Nevertheless, I have an unblemished credit record and have always paid back my existing credit at your bank on time.

My co-applicant, a trusted friend and experienced translator, will support the business and loan application. We have no additional installment plans, live in rented accommodation where we have resided for 4 years, and have no property or other debts.

I am responsible, experienced, and dedicated, and I am confident that I will be a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Rashid Habib
