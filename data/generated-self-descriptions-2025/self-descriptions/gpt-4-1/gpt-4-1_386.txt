Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am writing to request a business loan in the amount of 4,272 DM. I am a 26-year-old single male, currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 2 years. I have been residing at my current address for 2 years and am the sole provider for my younger brother.

I am seeking this loan to expand my small but growing furniture repair business, which I run alongside my main job. The funds will be used to purchase better tools and materials, and to rent a small workshop space. While I have had delays in repaying credit in the past, I have since taken steps to manage my finances more responsibly and have not missed any payments in the last year. I also have a building society savings agreement with a balance of 250 DM, showing my commitment to saving.

Though I do not have a checking account yet, I am in the process of opening one to better manage my business finances. I currently have two small credits at your bank, both of which are being serviced on time. I do not have any other debts or installment plans. I own my home, and while my job is unskilled, I am hardworking and determined to make my business succeed. 

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that with your support, I can grow my business and improve my financial standing. Please feel free to contact me if you require any further information.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov
