Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a business loan of 6,568 DM to expand my convenience store located in Dresden. I have been steadily employed as a warehouse supervisor for the past three years and have maintained a stable income. My wife and I have lived at our current residence for two years, and we own a reliable Volkswagen Golf.

Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM, I have an excellent credit history, having always repaid my previous loans on time. I am seeking this loan to upgrade my store’s refrigeration units and add a small bakery section, which will help increase sales and better serve my community.

I am a responsible borrower with no other guarantors or co-debtors, and I have managed my existing credit obligations diligently. My steady employment, long-term residence, and commitment to my business make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker

My stable job, careful handling of previous loans, and dedication to growing my business demonstrate my reliability. I kindly ask for your support in helping my business reach its full potential.

Yours faithfully,
