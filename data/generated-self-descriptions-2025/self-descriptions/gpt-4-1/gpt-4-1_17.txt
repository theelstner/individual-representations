Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,282 DM to purchase a new television for my household. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, a position I have held for three years. My financial situation is stable: although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a savings account with 350 DM and have always paid back my previous loans on time, as reflected in my credit history.

As a married woman with one dependent, I am committed to providing a nurturing home environment. My current residence in Offenbach has been my home for the past two years, and I am proud to say that I own my car, which further demonstrates my financial responsibility. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my previous installment plans have been managed successfully.

Given my steady employment, consistent repayment record, and commitment to responsible financial management, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Eva Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,282 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my apartment. I have been working as a customer service representative at Deutsche Telekom for two and a half years and have maintained a reliable employment record.

Although my checking account is currently negative, I have managed to save 180 DM in my savings account. My previous credit with your bank was paid off in full and on time. I am divorced, with no other debt obligations, and have lived at my current address in Mainz for two years. I own a small hatchback and have no other installment plans except for a furniture purchase, which I am paying off regularly.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan because of my steady employment and responsible financial habits. My history with your bank demonstrates my reliability, and I hope to continue this positive relationship.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 1,282 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am married with one child and have been employed as a pharmacy assistant at Adler Apotheke in Wiesbaden for just over a year. My checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have 420 DM in savings and no outstanding debts.

I have always paid back my existing credits promptly, as my credit history shows. I own my car outright and have lived at my current residence for two years. I have no guarantors or co-signers and no other installment plans except for a small electronics store purchase, which is nearly paid off.

My steady employment, careful budgeting, and consistent payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,282 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television set. I am a separated woman, currently working as a retail cashier at Edeka Markt in Darmstadt, where I have been employed for nearly three years. Despite my checking account being overdrawn, I have 260 DM in my savings account and have always fulfilled my credit obligations.

I have lived at my current address for two years and own a used Volkswagen Golf. I have no other debts or guarantors and only one other installment plan for household appliances, which I am repaying regularly.

I believe my stable employment, proven track record of repaying credits, and responsible management of my finances demonstrate my reliability as a borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Kerstin Hoffmann
