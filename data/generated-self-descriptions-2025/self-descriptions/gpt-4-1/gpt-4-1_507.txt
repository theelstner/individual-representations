Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of €1,309. I am a 27-year-old single male, currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Metro Logistics for the past two years. I have lived at my current address for four years and own my home. I have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I support.

I have previously taken out a loan with your bank and have repaid it diligently and on time. I have no other installment plans and no outstanding debts. While I do not have a checking or savings account, I do have a life insurance policy which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. I am also pleased to provide a guarantor for this loan.

The reason I am applying for this car loan is to purchase a reliable vehicle for commuting to work and transporting my brother to school. As a foreign worker, having a car will greatly improve my ability to fulfill my job responsibilities and family obligations. I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installments, as my employment is stable and my expenses are well-controlled.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to maintaining my good credit history and would be grateful for your support.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Samuel Mensah, and I am applying for a loan of €1,309 to purchase a new car. I am 27 years old, single, and have been employed as a kitchen assistant at Green Leaf Bistro for just over one year. I have resided at my current address for four years and am proud to own my home. I am responsible for my younger sister, who lives with me.

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have repaid on schedule and without issue. I do not have a savings account or other installment plans, but I have a building society savings agreement in place. I am also able to provide a guarantor for this loan.

The new car will be essential for my daily commute, as my work hours extend late into the evening when public transport is unreliable. I am a foreign worker, and reliable transportation will help ensure my continued employment and ability to care for my dependent. My financial record shows I am trustworthy, and I am committed to meeting my repayment obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Samuel Mensah
