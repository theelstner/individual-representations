Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Pavel Novak, and I am applying for a loan of 2,212 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past 5 years, I have maintained stable employment and a steady income. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and own a reliable Volkswagen Golf, which is my primary means of transport.

Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, I have a strong history of repaying previous credits on time, as my bank records can confirm. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am solely responsible for my financial obligations. My monthly installment rate is manageable given my salary, and I am confident in my ability to meet all repayment terms.

As a foreign worker from the Czech Republic, I have worked diligently to establish a trustworthy reputation in Germany. I believe my consistent employment record, responsible credit history, and commitment to my professional development make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,
Pavel Novak
