Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Andrzej Kowalski, and I am applying for a loan of 4,870 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years. I am a single father of two children, and I have been living at my current residence in Munich for four years, where I am fortunate to have free housing provided by my employer.

My financial situation has been challenging in recent years, primarily due to unforeseen expenses related to my children’s education and a brief period of illness that affected my ability to work. This led to a delay in repaying a previous loan, but I have since stabilized my finances and am making regular payments on my two existing credits with your bank. My checking and savings accounts currently have low balances due to these commitments, but my steady employment and lack of other debts or guarantors ensure that I can meet the proposed installment rate.

I am requesting this loan to purchase a reliable car, which is essential for commuting to work and managing family responsibilities. I am committed to maintaining a good repayment schedule and am confident that my stable job and free housing will allow me to meet my obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Andrzej Kowalski

To whom it may concern,

My name is Mehmet Yildiz, and I am writing to request a loan of 4,870 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am 53 years old, a single male, and have two dependents. I have worked as a certified machinist at Siemens AG for the last two and a half years, and I have resided at my current address in Stuttgart for four years. My housing is provided free of charge by a family member, which helps me manage my living expenses.

While I have had delays in repaying previous loans due to a period of unemployment, I am now fully employed and have no other outstanding debts besides two small credits with your bank. My current account and savings are minimal, but with my regular income and no other installment plans, I am confident I can handle the proposed monthly payments.

A new car is necessary for me to maintain my job, as public transport is not a viable option for my shift work schedule. I assure you of my intent to repay the loan promptly and hope you will consider my application favorably.

Kind regards,
Mehmet Yildiz

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jan Novak. I am a single, 53-year-old foreign worker living in Frankfurt, with two children who depend on me. I have been working as a customs official for the past three years and have lived at my present address for four years, where I benefit from free accommodation provided by my employer.

Due to past financial difficulties, including delays in paying off credit, my current account balance is below zero, and my savings are limited. However, I have no other debts or installment plans, and my employment is stable. I currently have two credits with your bank, which I am repaying regularly.

I am applying for a loan of 4,870 DM to purchase a new car, which is vital for my daily commute and family needs. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and believe my steady employment and free housing make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Jan Novak

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Piotr Nowak, and I am seeking a loan of 4,870 DM to buy a new car. I am 53 years old, single, and have two children. I have been working as a skilled technician for Deutsche Telekom for just over a year, and I have lived at my current address for four years without paying rent, thanks to a company housing program.

My financial situation has been tight because of previous delays in loan repayments, but I have since secured steady employment and have no other debts except for two existing credits at your bank. My checking and savings accounts are currently below 100 DM, but my stable job and lack of other financial obligations mean I can manage the installment payments.

A reliable car is essential for my work and family commitments. I am dedicated to meeting my financial responsibilities and hope you will consider my application favorably.

Best regards,
Piotr Nowak
