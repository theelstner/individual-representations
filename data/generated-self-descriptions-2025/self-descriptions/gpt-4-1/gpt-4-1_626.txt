Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 2,600 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for 3 years. My work is stable and well-compensated, and I have always managed my finances responsibly.

Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, this is due to recent, unexpected medical expenses for my dependent son. I have no savings or bonds at the moment, but my salary covers all essential costs, and I live rent-free in a company-provided apartment. I have held two previous credits with your bank and have paid both back on time, demonstrating my reliability.

I am 65 years old, single, and have been residing at my current address for four years. As a foreign worker, I understand the importance of maintaining a good financial record, and I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations. I have no other debts or guarantors.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martin Schmidt, and I wish to apply for a 2,600 DM loan to upgrade my household electronics, specifically to purchase a new radio and television set. I am currently employed as an administrative clerk at the City Hall, a position I have held for 2 years and 7 months. My employment is stable, and I have a regular monthly income.

At the moment, my checking account is overdrawn due to recent expenses related to my dependent daughter’s education. I do not have significant savings, but I have always prioritized my financial commitments. I have taken two credits from your bank in the past and have repaid both on schedule without any issues.

I am 65 years old, single, and have lived in my current residence for four years, where I do not pay rent. I have no other outstanding debts, installment plans, or guarantors. As a foreign worker, I value the opportunity to build a trustworthy relationship with your bank.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am committed to repaying the loan on time and maintaining my good credit history.

Best regards,
Martin Schmidt

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,600 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television. My name is Ahmed Karimi, and I have been working as a technical supervisor at Siemens for the past 3 years. My financial situation is stable, with a regular salary and no major debts apart from my existing credits, both of which I have always paid on time.

My checking account is currently in the negative due to unexpected expenses for my son’s healthcare. I have no substantial savings or bonds, but I live rent-free in a company accommodation, which helps me manage my finances better. I am single, 65 years old, and have lived at my current address for four years.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not relying on any guarantors. As a foreign worker, I understand the importance of financial reliability, and my record with your bank shows my commitment to honoring my obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my best efforts to repay the loan on time.

Yours sincerely,
Ahmed Karimi

Dear Loan Department,

I am Jean-Claude Dubois, a 65-year-old single man residing in Munich. I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,600 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. I have been employed as a customs officer for the past 3 years, and my employment is stable and secure.

While my checking account is currently below zero due to supporting my dependent grandson’s medical needs, I have always managed to pay back my previous two loans from your bank on time. I do not have any significant savings, but I live rent-free in my brother’s apartment, which allows me to allocate more of my income toward loan repayments.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I have lived at my current residence for four years, and my credit history is spotless. As a foreign worker, I am committed to maintaining a good financial standing in Germany.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am confident I will fulfill all repayment obligations as agreed.

Kind regards,
Jean-Claude Dubois

Letter 5

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 2,600 DM to replace my old television and radio, which are no longer functioning. I have been employed as a postal service supervisor for 1 year and 8 months, with a steady monthly income.

My checking account is currently overdrawn because I recently had to pay for my son’s urgent dental treatment. I have no significant savings or bonds, but I live with my cousin rent-free, which helps me manage my expenses. I am 65 years old, single, and have lived at my current address for four years.

I have previously taken two credits from your bank, both of which I have paid back fully and on time. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. As a foreign worker, I value the trust your institution has placed in me and would like to continue this positive relationship.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to repaying the loan on schedule and maintaining my good credit history.

Sincerely,
Tomasz Nowak
