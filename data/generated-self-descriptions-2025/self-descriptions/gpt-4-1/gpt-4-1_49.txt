Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,352 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 23-year-old divorced woman with one child, currently residing in this city for the past two years. Although I am presently unemployed, I previously worked as a retail sales assistant for three years and have always managed my finances responsibly. I have a building society savings agreement with a balance of 700 DM and have successfully repaid a previous credit with your bank on time.

Due to my recent job loss, my checking account has a negative balance, but I am actively seeking new employment and have several promising leads. A car is essential for me to expand my job search and manage daily responsibilities as a single mother. My current housing is rented, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am a trustworthy candidate, as shown by my previous history of timely repayments. The requested loan will greatly improve my mobility and employment prospects. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 1,352 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am a married woman, 23 years old, with one dependent child. I recently lost my job as a kitchen assistant and have been unemployed for the past six months. Despite my current situation, I have always made timely payments on my previous credit with your bank.

My checking account is currently overdrawn, but I have managed to save 800 DM in my savings account and maintain a life insurance policy. Having a car will enable me to commute to job interviews and potential workplaces, significantly improving my chances of re-employment. My family and I have lived at our current rented address for two years, and I have no other outstanding debts.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and believe that this loan will help me regain stability. I appreciate your consideration and hope for a positive response.

Kind regards,  
Maria Petrova

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,352 DM for the purchase of a used vehicle. My name is Farida Baloch, a 23-year-old separated woman with one child. I have been unemployed for six months after previously working as an unskilled warehouse worker. My checking account is currently in deficit, but I have 600 DM in a building society savings agreement and have always repaid my debts on time, including my existing credit with your bank.

As a foreign worker registered in your records, reliable transportation is crucial for me to access broader job opportunities and support my child. I have lived at my rented residence for two years, have no other loans, and can be reached by telephone at any time for further information.

I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan, just as I have demonstrated in the past. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Farida Baloch

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Rossi, and I am applying for a loan of 1,352 DM to purchase a used car. I am 23 years old, married, and have one dependent. I have been unemployed for the last six months, after working as a hotel cleaning staff member for two years. My current account is overdrawn, but I have managed to save 950 DM in my savings account.

I have always paid back my previous credit at your bank without delay, which I believe demonstrates my reliability. A car is essential for me to find new work and care for my family, as public transportation options are limited in our area. We have been renting our apartment for two years and have no other outstanding loans or debts.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment plan and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Elena Rossi
