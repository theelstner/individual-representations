Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 741 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances for my home. As a 22-year-old divorced woman, I have been residing at my current address for the past 3 years and am the sole provider for my young daughter. I previously worked as a scientific research assistant for 4 years before my recent unemployment. Despite my current job search, I have managed my finances responsibly and have fully repaid all previous credits on time, including a recent installment loan with your bank.

My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are limited to 250 DM in a building society savings agreement. However, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as I am actively seeking new employment opportunities and have a strong record of meeting financial obligations. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my housing is owned, which provides stability for my family.

I respectfully request your consideration for this loan, which will enable me to provide a safe and comfortable environment for my dependent. Thank you for your attention to my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 741 DM to purchase necessary domestic appliances for my household. As a married woman aged 22 and a foreign worker, I have lived at my current residence for 3 years. I am currently unemployed after working as a customs officer for 8 years. My husband and I have one dependent child.

Although my checking account balance is negative and my savings stand at 320 DM in a life insurance policy, I have always paid back my credits on time, including one previous loan from your institution. I have no other debts or installment plans, and our home is owned outright, ensuring housing stability.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as I am actively seeking new employment and have a history of financial responsibility. I would appreciate your support in helping my family maintain essential living standards.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Maria Schmidt

Letter 3

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 741 DM to replace broken domestic appliances in my home. I am a 22-year-old separated woman with one dependent, and I have been living at my current address for 3 years. I was employed as a legal secretary for 7 years before being laid off last month.

My current checking account is overdrawn, and I have 150 DM saved in a building society agreement. Despite this, I have consistently paid back all previous loans, including one active credit with your bank, without any delays. I do not have any other debts or installment plans, and I own my home.

I am committed to finding new employment and maintaining my good credit standing. I believe my track record demonstrates my reliability, and I would be grateful for your support during this transitional period.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova
