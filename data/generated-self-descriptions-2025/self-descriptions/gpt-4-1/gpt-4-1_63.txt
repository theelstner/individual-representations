Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Stefan Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 1,537 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, where I have built a stable career. Although my current checking account balance is modest, this is due to recent household expenses. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly.

I own my home and have lived at my current address for 4 years, which gives me a stable living situation. I have a guarantor in place for this loan, and my property serves as additional security. My credit history does include accounts at other institutions, but I have always made my payments on time. As a single father with one dependent, I am committed to providing for my family and maintaining a reliable financial record.

I assure you of my trustworthiness and ability to repay this loan within the agreed term. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Andreas Schmidt, and I am requesting a loan of 1,537 DM to upgrade my household electronics, specifically to buy a new radio and television. I am a senior technician at Siemens AG, where I have worked for the past 10 years. My financial situation is stable, with steady employment and property ownership.

While my current checking account balance is under 200 DM, my income is consistent, and my expenses are carefully managed. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing, and I have a guarantor for this application. My credit history reflects some previous critical accounts, but I have taken steps to rectify all issues.

Owning my residence for 4 years and having a reliable telephone connection further demonstrate my stability. I am 50 years old with one child, and I take my financial responsibilities seriously. I am confident in my ability to fulfill the loan requirements.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Andreas Schmidt
