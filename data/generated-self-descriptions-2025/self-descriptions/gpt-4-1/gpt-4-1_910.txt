Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Petrova and I am writing to apply for a car loan of 3,594 DM. I am a 46-year-old divorced woman, currently employed as a resident kitchen assistant at St. Michael’s Community Center for the past 9 months. My son and I have lived in our own apartment for 2 years now.

I am seeking this loan to purchase a reliable used car, as my previous vehicle broke down and public transportation does not reach my early morning shifts. Having a car will ensure I can maintain my employment and support my son.

I acknowledge that I have had delays in paying off debts in the past, but I have taken steps to better manage my finances, including setting up a building society savings agreement. I currently have two small credits with your bank, both of which are being paid on schedule. My savings are limited, but I am committed to meeting my obligations.

Though I do not have a checking account, I am confident that my steady employment, stable residence, and improved financial habits make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Rodriguez, and I am applying for a car loan of 3,594 DM. I am a 46-year-old married woman with one dependent daughter. I have been working as a resident janitor at the Linden Park Housing Cooperative for 10 months.

I need this loan to purchase a used car to commute to work and take my daughter to school. We have lived in our own apartment for 2 years, and reliable transportation is essential for our daily routine.

Although I have experienced delays in repaying debts before, I am now in a more stable situation with regular income and no additional debts or guarantors. My property includes a life insurance policy, which I maintain diligently. I have two credits at your bank, both of which are up to date.

I understand the importance of financial responsibility and am committed to making timely payments. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Rodriguez

Dear Bank Manager,

I am Fatima Hassan, a 46-year-old separated woman, writing to request a loan of 3,594 DM to buy a used car. I am currently employed as a resident laundry attendant at the City Hospital, a position I have held for nearly one year.

My daughter and I reside in our own apartment and have been at this address for 2 years. Reliable transportation is crucial for me to continue my work, especially given my early and late shifts.

While I have had some payment delays in the past, I now have a steady income and no other outstanding installment plans. I have two small loans with your bank, which I am repaying regularly. My financial resources are limited, but I am making efforts to save through a building society agreement.

I am dedicated to fulfilling my financial commitments and believe I am a suitable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Fatima Hassan

My name is Elena Novak, and I am a 46-year-old married woman, currently employed as a resident cleaner at Sunrise Retirement Home for the past 8 months. I am applying for a loan of 3,594 DM to purchase a used car.

My family and I have lived in our own apartment for 2 years. As I have one dependent child, having a car would make it possible for me to juggle work and family responsibilities more efficiently.

I have faced financial difficulties in the past, resulting in some delays with payments, but I am now steadily employed and am meeting my current credit obligations with your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans. I also maintain a life insurance policy as a form of security for my family.

I am committed to improving my financial standing and ensuring timely repayment of this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
