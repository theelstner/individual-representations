Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 11,590 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. As a laboratory technician at Berlin Biomedical Research Center, I have been employed for three years, and my steady income allows me to manage monthly payments comfortably. I have been residing at my current apartment for four years, and my rent is always paid on time.

Although I currently do not have a checking account and have a critical credit history due to a previous loan for medical expenses with another bank, I have learned from my past financial challenges and am now dedicated to rebuilding my credit. I have a modest savings account of 320 DM and own a small second-hand car, which I plan to trade in.

As a divorced woman supporting one dependent, having a dependable car is essential for commuting and ensuring my child can attend school and activities. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and believe that my stable job, responsible attitude, and improved financial habits make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Koch

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 11,590 DM to purchase a used car, which is crucial for my daily commute to my job as a customer service representative at Mainstadt Telekom, where I have been employed for two years. My current financial situation is stable, with a monthly income sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate, as well as my rent and living expenses.

Though I do not have a checking account and my credit history includes an outstanding loan with another bank for home repairs, I have consistently made all required payments on time. I also have a savings account with a balance of 150 DM.

As a married woman with one child, reliable transportation is vital for my family and work commitments. I have lived at my present address for four years and have no other guarantors or co-debtors. I am confident in my ability to honor this new loan and am committed to maintaining a positive relationship with your institution.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Anja Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 11,590 DM to finance the purchase of a used car. I work as a retail sales assistant at CityMarkt in Leipzig, where I have been employed for nearly four years. My monthly income allows me to comfortably manage the installment payments, in addition to my other financial commitments.

Although I currently do not have a checking account and have a critical credit record due to a previous education loan at another bank, I have a savings bond worth 275 DM and own a scooter, which I intend to sell to contribute towards the car purchase.

As a separated woman living with my teenage son, a car is essential for work, school, and daily errands. I have rented my apartment for four years and have never missed a rent payment. I do not have any other installment plans except for a furniture purchase, and I am determined to fulfill all obligations associated with this new loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Petra Schneider

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 11,590 DM for the purchase of a used car. I am currently employed as a receptionist at Hotel Sonnenhof and have held this position for one and a half years. My monthly salary is sufficient to cover the loan installments, along with my rent and other necessary expenses.

While I do not have a checking account and my credit history includes an ongoing credit at another financial institution, I have maintained a savings account with 450 DM. I have also owned my own car, which unfortunately was recently totaled in an accident, making this loan necessary.

As a married woman with one dependent, reliable transportation is critical for my family’s well-being and my work schedule. I have lived in my current residence for four years and have no additional debts or guarantors. I am committed to responsibly managing this loan and believe my stable employment and financial discipline make me a suitable candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Monika Bauer
