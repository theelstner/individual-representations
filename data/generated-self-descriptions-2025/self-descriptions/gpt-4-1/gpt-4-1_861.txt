Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 3,577 DM. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for three years. My current residence is in Munich, where I have lived for two years, and I am renting a flat.

I am applying for this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and to better manage my responsibilities as a single father of two children. I have a guarantor for this loan and have maintained a savings account with a balance of 250 DM. I have no other outstanding installment plans and have always paid back my existing credit with your bank on time.

Although I do not have a checking account, my consistent employment, ownership of real estate inherited from my parents, and diligent repayment history demonstrate my financial responsibility. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment rate and repay the loan as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dr. Martin Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Alexander Schulz, and I am seeking a loan of 3,577 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been working as a customs officer with the Federal Customs Service for almost two years and have a stable monthly income. I am currently renting an apartment in Stuttgart, where I have lived for two years.

I am single and support my two younger siblings, who are my dependents. I have a guarantor for this loan and maintain a savings account with 400 DM. My credit history is positive, with all previous loans repaid promptly. I have one active credit with your bank and no other installment plans.

Although I do not have a checking account, my property holdings (a small plot of land in Baden-Württemberg) and my record of responsible borrowing make me a trustworthy candidate. The car will greatly assist with my work and family obligations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Alexander Schulz

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a 3,577 DM loan to purchase a new car. My name is Jonas Weber, and I have been employed as an IT specialist at Siemens for nearly four years. I am single, responsible for two dependents (my niece and nephew), and currently reside in a rented apartment in Frankfurt, where I have lived for two years.

I have a savings account with a balance of 320 DM and a guarantor for this loan. I have always repaid my previous credit obligations on time, including one current loan with your bank. I do not have a checking account but own a share in a family-owned apartment building.

A reliable vehicle is crucial for my job, especially as public transportation does not cover my early morning shifts. My employment stability, property ownership, and positive credit history make me a reliable loan candidate.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Jonas Weber

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a car loan of 3,577 DM. My name is Thomas Becker, and I have been working as a municipal clerk in Düsseldorf for three years. I am single, with two dependents (my twin sons), and have lived in my current rented apartment for two years.

I have a savings account with a balance of 150 DM and can provide a guarantor. My credit history is excellent; I have always paid back my credits on time, including one current loan with your institution. I have no other installment plans.

Although I do not have a checking account, I own a small piece of land in my hometown, which adds to my financial security. The new car will help me better balance work and family life, as I need to commute between my job and my sons’ school.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Kind regards,
Thomas Becker
