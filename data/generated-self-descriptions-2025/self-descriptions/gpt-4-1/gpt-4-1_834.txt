Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 11,816 DM. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, specializing in renewable energy projects. I am currently single, have no dependents, and have lived at my current residence in Stuttgart for the last 4 years.  

I am seeking this loan to launch a consultancy focused on providing sustainable energy solutions to small and medium-sized businesses. Despite my stable employment and steady income, my current savings are below 100 DM due to recent personal investments in professional development. I have no outstanding debts, and my credit history is spotless—having either never taken credits or having always repaid them promptly.  

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my employment is secure, and I have carefully calculated the installment rate to fit my monthly budget. I own a car and have always managed my finances responsibly. I believe my track record as a skilled employee and my dedication to my new venture make me a reliable candidate for this loan.  

Thank you very much for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Bank Manager,  

I am Peter Schneider, a 40-year-old single male residing in Hamburg for the past 4 years. I have been a senior civil servant at the Federal Employment Agency for 8 years. I am applying for a loan of 11,816 DM to launch a career coaching business aimed at helping young professionals enter the workforce.
