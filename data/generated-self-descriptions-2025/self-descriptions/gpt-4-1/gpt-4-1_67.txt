Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am applying for a loan of €5,190 to undertake essential repairs on my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, demonstrating both stability and reliability in my professional life. 

Though I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have consistently managed my finances well, as shown by my impeccable credit history—every one of my four existing credits with your bank has been paid back on time. I own my home, where I have lived for the past 4 years with my two children. The repairs are necessary to ensure our safety and comfort, and I am committed to maintaining the property’s value.

With my steady income, no other debts or installment plans, and a life insurance policy in place, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4. I am a single father, fully responsible for my dependents, and take my financial obligations seriously.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Markus Klein
