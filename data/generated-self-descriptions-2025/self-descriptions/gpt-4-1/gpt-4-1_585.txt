Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 2,384 DM for urgent home repairs. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, having started this position 10 months ago. My checking account balance is currently 120 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, as my earnings have primarily supported my 5-year-old son and covered rent.

My credit history with your bank is positive; I have one existing credit with you, which I have always paid back on time and in full. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. I have lived at my current address for one year, and my current housing is rented.

I am a single father and a foreign worker, but I am committed to building a stable life here. The repairs are necessary for the safety and comfort of my child. My regular employment and clean credit record demonstrate my reliability. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 4.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,384 DM for critical repairs to my apartment’s heating system. I am a 33-year-old single man, and I work as a janitor at the Berlin Community Center, a position I have held for 7 months. My current account balance is 45 DM, and my savings are minimal, under 100 DM.

I have one previous loan with your bank, which I have always repaid on time. I have no other debts and no guarantors. I have lived in my current rented apartment for just over a year, supporting my 8-year-old daughter as my dependent.

Although I have no assets or property, my steady employment and responsible repayment history show I am a trustworthy candidate. I am a foreign worker committed to making Germany my home and maintaining my good standing with your institution.

I would appreciate your support in helping me keep my home safe and livable.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ahmed El-Sayed

To whom it may concern,

My name is Marek Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 2,384 DM to cover essential repairs in my rented flat. I am employed as a delivery assistant at QuickMove Services, where I have been working for the past 9 months. My finances are modest, with less than 200 DM in my current account and under 100 DM in savings.

I have an existing credit with your bank that I have managed responsibly, always making payments on time. I have no other loans or guarantors, and I have been residing at my current address for one year. I support my 6-year-old son on my single income.

As a foreign worker, I am determined to continue building a stable life here. I believe my consistent payment history and reliable employment, though recent, make me a suitable candidate for this loan. The repairs are necessary for my family's well-being.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Marek Nowak
