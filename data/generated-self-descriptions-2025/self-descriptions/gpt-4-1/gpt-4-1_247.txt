Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Daniel Weber, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,258 DM to help expand my small IT consultancy, "Weber Solutions." Over the past eight years, I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich, and four years ago, I transitioned into private consulting. I have maintained stable employment for the past five years.

Though I do not have a checking account, I have a savings account with a modest balance and have consistently paid back my previous credit with your bank on time. My real estate property in Munich serves as collateral, and I have been living at my current address for one year. As a single father to my six-year-old son, I am committed to building a stable future for us both.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and I own my home outright. My business is steadily growing, and this loan will allow me to invest in new equipment and hire an assistant. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan as I have demonstrated responsibility with my finances in the past. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Karim, a 25-year-old registered foreign worker and logistics coordinator at Bayer AG, where I have been employed for four and a half years. I am seeking a loan of 1,258 DM to purchase inventory and marketing materials for my side business, "Karim Imports," which I recently launched.

I have a history of reliable credit repayment, and my only existing credit with your bank has always been paid on time. I do not have a checking account, but I own a small apartment in Düsseldorf, which underscores my commitment to financial stability. My current savings are limited, but my monthly salary and business income are sufficient to cover the installment rate.

I am single, with one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support in his studies. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my residence is secured. I am confident that my steady employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Karim
