Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 766 DM to purchase a new television set. My name is Josef Nowak, and I am a 66-year-old single man residing in my own home at 12 Lindenstrasse, where I have lived for the past three years. I have been employed as a janitor at the local municipal building for the past two years, and I am responsible for supporting my adult son, who is currently seeking work.

Although my checking account balance is modest, I do have savings of 700 DM, and I have consistently paid back all my previous credits on time. I currently have one active credit with your bank, which is being paid off regularly. I own my home and a small plot of land, which provides additional financial security.

The television will be an important source of information and entertainment for me and my son, especially during the long evenings. I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate, as my monthly expenses are stable and I have no other outstanding debts. I am a reliable customer and have always honored my financial commitments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Josef Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Demir, and I am applying for a loan of 766 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I am a 66-year-old single man of Turkish origin, living in Germany for the past ten years. For the past three years, I have worked as a warehouse assistant at the local distribution center.

I have a savings account with 800 DM and own my residence, which I inherited from my late brother. I have one dependent—my grandson, whom I care for after my daughter moved abroad for work. My credit history is spotless, as I have always paid back my previous loans on time, including my current small loan with your bank.

My current financial situation is stable, with no other debts or installment plans. The radio and television are essential for my grandson’s education and our connection to the world, especially since we do not have a telephone at home. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, given my steady employment and lack of other financial obligations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Demir

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 766 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television. My name is Viktor Havel, and I am a 66-year-old single man residing at my own property at 9 Gartenweg for the past three years. I have been working as a groundskeeper at the city park for the last two years and have one dependent, my nephew, who lives with me.

Although my checking account is below 200 DM, I have 650 DM in savings and a good record of repaying my existing credit with your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not supporting any other family members financially.

The television will greatly improve our quality of life, as it will provide both information and entertainment for myself and my nephew. I am committed to maintaining my good credit standing and am confident that I can meet the monthly installment payments without difficulty.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Havel
