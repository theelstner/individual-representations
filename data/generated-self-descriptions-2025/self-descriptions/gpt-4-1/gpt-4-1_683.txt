Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €2,279 to purchase a new television and radio set. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have worked for the past 2 years and 8 months. My employment is stable, and I have a regular monthly income.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at this time, I have maintained a good credit history. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time without any issues. I currently live with a relative, so my housing is provided for free, which allows me to allocate more of my income towards loan repayments. I have one dependent, my son, whom I support.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan as I have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility, both in my current credit arrangement and in managing my household. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment rate as required.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Lukas Schneider
