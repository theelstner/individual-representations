Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,573 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. As a 23-year-old divorced woman living with my young daughter, I am currently employed as a kitchen assistant at the Parkstraße Community Center, a position I have held for nearly three years. While my job is unskilled, I have demonstrated reliability and commitment, and my employer can attest to my punctuality and dedication.

My financial situation is modest. I have a checking account with less than 200 DM and minimal savings, as my income primarily supports my dependent. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have been managing responsibly, and I have no other installment plans or outstanding debts elsewhere. I own my home, with real estate as my main property, and have lived here for one year.

Despite a critical account history and previous credits at another institution, I have worked diligently to stabilize my finances and have not missed any payments on my current credit. I am confident that I can manage the low installment rate for this loan. I am committed to improving my household and providing a better environment for my child, and I assure you of my trustworthiness and dedication to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anna Kovacs

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,573 DM to purchase a radio and television for my household. As a married woman of 23, recently relocated to this area, I work as a cleaner at the local hospital, where I have been employed for just over two years. My husband and I have a young son, and I am the primary earner in our family.

Our financial resources are limited, with less than 200 DM in our checking account and under 100 DM in savings. We have no other installment plans, and while I do have a critical credit history due to a previous loan at another bank, I have always made timely payments on my current credit at your institution.

We own our home, which gives us stability, and I am determined to provide my family with the comforts of modern life, including access to news and educational programming through a television and radio. I have demonstrated responsibility in managing our limited resources and am committed to maintaining this trust with your bank.

I appreciate your consideration and would be grateful for the opportunity to improve our family's quality of life.

Kind regards,
Maria Petrova

Letter 3

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 3,573 DM to buy a new radio and television for my home. I am a 23-year-old separated woman with one child, and I have been working as a resident caretaker at the Lindenallee Housing Cooperative for the past year and a half. My position is unskilled, but I am known for my reliability and honesty.

My financial situation is tight; my checking account rarely exceeds 200 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM. I have a critical account history due to a previous credit with another institution, but I have no other installment plans or debts. I have been living at my current address for one year and own my own home, which provides a sense of security for me and my child.

Despite my limited resources, I have always managed to meet my obligations, including my existing credit at your bank. I am confident in my ability to handle the proposed installment rate and am committed to fulfilling my responsibilities. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
Svetlana Novak

Dear Bank Manager,
