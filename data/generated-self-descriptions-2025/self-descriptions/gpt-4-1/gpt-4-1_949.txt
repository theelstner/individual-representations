Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €2,859 to purchase a new car. I am a 38-year-old single father with one dependent, currently residing in my own apartment for the past four years. Until recently, I worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I was employed for eight years before my contract ended last month. 

Although I am presently unemployed, I have a strong track record of financial responsibility. I have had one previous credit with your bank, which I paid back fully and on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and no other guarantors. Owning a reliable car is essential for my job search and for taking my son to school and appointments.

While I do not have a savings account, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4%. My previous employment in a highly qualified position and my consistent payment history demonstrate my trustworthiness. I am committed to maintaining this record and am happy to provide references if required.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Alex Müller, and I am applying for a €2,859 loan to purchase a new car. I am a 38-year-old single man living in my own home for the last four years, with one child who is financially dependent on me. I was self-employed as a freelance IT consultant for seven years until my main contract ended earlier this year.

Although I am currently between jobs, I have always prioritized my financial obligations. I have previously taken out a loan with your bank, which I repaid completely and on schedule. I have never defaulted on any credit payments. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

A new car will be crucial for me to attend job interviews and secure new contracts, as many clients are outside the city. While I do not have a savings account, my history of responsible borrowing and my professional background make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Alex Müller

I have one previous loan with your bank, which I repaid fully and punctually. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. While I do not have a checking or savings account, my history with your bank and my years in a management role show my reliability.

A new car is essential for commuting and supporting my child’s needs. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and am available for any additional questions you may have.

Sincerely,
