Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1024 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am a married man, 48 years old, and have been living in my own home for the past four years. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at a local university, a position I started ten months ago. My wife and I have one child.

Unfortunately, due to some unexpected expenses last year, I have had some delays in repaying previous credit, but I have since worked hard to bring my finances under control. My checking and savings accounts are currently low, but I have no other major debts except for a small installment plan with a local electronics store. I own my home and a small plot of land, which demonstrates my long-term stability.

I am committed to making regular payments and am requesting a manageable installment rate. I am a responsible individual with a stable job and strong motivation to maintain a good credit standing. I kindly ask you to consider my application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am seeking a loan of 1024 DM to buy a radio and television for my household. I am a widower, 48 years old, and have lived in my own property for four years. I work as a customs official, a position I started eight months ago after relocating to this area.

My financial situation has been challenging; I have a negative checking account and only minimal savings due to supporting my teenage son after my wife’s passing. While I have had some delays in previous credit payments, I am now in a much more stable position and am working hard to improve my credit record. I have no other guarantors or significant debts.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my secure employment, property ownership, and commitment to supporting my family. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan in full and on time.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Viktor Ivanov

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1024 DM to purchase a radio and television for my home. My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, and I am a married 48-year-old, residing in my own house for the past four years. I am employed as a senior machine operator at the local steel plant, a position I have held for eleven months.

Although my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 and 100 DM respectively, and I have experienced some delays in past credit payments, I have always fulfilled my obligations. I have one dependent and no other co-signers. I do have a small store installment plan, but I have managed it responsibly.

Owning real estate gives me stability, and my job offers a steady income. I am committed to meeting all payment terms and am eager to improve my financial standing. I kindly request your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Marek Nowak, and I am writing to request a loan of 1024 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my family. I am 48 years old, married, with one child, and have lived in my own home for four years. I work as a municipal clerk, a job I started nine months ago.

I have previously had some delays in credit repayments, mainly due to unexpected medical expenses for my child. My accounts are currently low, but I have no outstanding debts except for a manageable store installment plan. I do not have any guarantors but own my property outright.

I believe my stable employment and home ownership make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I am committed to making payments on time and improving my financial record. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,

Letter 5

Dear Loan Committee,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1024 DM to purchase a radio and television. My name is Ivan Kuznetsov, and I am a 48-year-old widower. I have been living in my own house for the past four years, and I am employed as a city transit supervisor, a position I have held for eleven months.

My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking account below zero and savings under 100 DM, largely due to supporting my son through university. While I have had some delays in previous credit payments, I have always paid my debts in full. I have no guarantors and only a small installment plan with a local store.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate thanks to my stable employment, property ownership, and commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations. I would appreciate your support in helping me provide for my family.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Kuznetsov
