Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dragan Petrovic and I am applying for a loan of 7,763 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I am currently living in Stuttgart with my 12-year-old son. As a foreign worker in Germany, I have worked hard to build a stable and reliable career, and I am proud to say that all my previous credits have been paid back on time.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are both below 100 DM, as most of my income is dedicated to supporting my son and covering daily living expenses. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no outstanding installment plans except with your bank, where I have had one previous credit, which was fully repaid without any issues.

Purchasing a new car is essential for my daily commute to work, as well as for my responsibilities as a single parent. My stable employment history and consistent credit repayment record demonstrate my trustworthiness. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments and manage the loan responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Farouk, and I am seeking a loan of 7,763 DM to buy a new car. For the past 9 years, I have been employed as a project manager at Siemens AG in Munich. I am a single father to my teenage daughter, and we have been living in our current apartment for 4 years, rent-free, as part of my employment benefits.

While my current financial situation shows a checking account balance below 0 DM and savings under 100 DM, I have always managed my obligations carefully. I have previously taken and repaid a credit with your bank, and my credit history is impeccable. I have no other debts or installment plans.

A new car is vital for my work, which sometimes requires travel between sites, and for transporting my daughter to school and activities. My long-term employment, history of responsible credit management, and stable living situation make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ahmed Farouk

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 7,763 DM. My name is Jan Kowalski, and I have been a self-employed IT consultant in Berlin for the last 8 years. As a foreign worker, I have built my own business from the ground up and have maintained a spotless credit record, always repaying my obligations promptly.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are both under 100 DM due to recent investments in my business and providing for my 10-year-old son, whom I support as a single parent. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans except for one previous credit at your bank, which I repaid fully and on schedule.

A new car will allow me to better serve my clients, many of whom are outside the city. My steady income, responsible financial management, and proven record as a borrower make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Jan Kowalski
