Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,258 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute and have been employed there for the past three years. My monthly salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account for over a year, and my current balance is always above 200 DM. Additionally, I have a savings account with a balance of 750 DM.

My financial history is solid, as I have previously taken out a personal loan for home appliances and have always paid back my credits on time. I do not have any guarantors or co-debtors, and all of my current installment plans are up to date. I have been living at my current residence for three years, and I own a small car as my main property.

As a divorced woman with one dependent, I am careful with my finances and always ensure timely payments. I am confident that my stable employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller
