Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1670 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, a position I have held for the past 10 months. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and my savings account holds less than 100 DM. 

My financial situation is stable, as I have consistently paid back all my existing credits on time. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and I manage my finances carefully. I have lived at my current residence for two years and own my car, which I use to commute to work. Although I have only been employed for less than a year, my contract is expected to be renewed due to my good performance.

As a divorced woman supporting myself, I am diligent and responsible. I have a good credit history and am committed to meeting the installment rate of 4 as agreed. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marta Nowak
