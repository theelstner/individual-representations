Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Johannes Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,848 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for three years. I am a 32-year-old single male, living in my own apartment, and I have two dependents—my younger brother and my elderly mother—whom I support.

Although I do not yet have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance of 320 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always repaid on time and in full. My co-applicant, my brother, is also employed and will guarantee this loan.

The car is essential for my daily commute and for fulfilling my family responsibilities, as public transport does not adequately serve our area. I am committed to upholding my excellent credit record and assure you of my reliability and responsibility in meeting all financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Johannes Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Karim, and I am applying for a loan of 2,848 DM to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for two years and eight months. As a foreign worker who has made Germany my home, I am dedicated to building a stable and responsible life here.

I currently reside in my own apartment, which I purchased with savings and a prior loan from your bank—repaid without issue. I do not yet have a checking account but maintain a savings account with a balance of 410 DM. My co-applicant is my cousin, who also lives with me and shares financial responsibilities.

I need a car to manage my commute and care for my two dependents, my twin sons, who are starting school. My installment rate is manageable, and my past credit record is spotless. I am committed to maintaining this standard and am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Karim
