Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 662 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for the past 9 months. My job provides a stable income, and I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a proven track record of repaying previous credits on time, as evidenced by my credit history. My savings are limited, but I own my residence and a small property in the outskirts of Stuttgart, which shows my commitment to long-term financial responsibility.

As a single father of two children, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family duties. This new car will enable me to maintain punctuality at work and ensure the wellbeing of my children.

I am trustworthy and financially responsible, as seen in my history of timely repayments and stable employment. I respectfully request your consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Jürgen Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 662 DM to purchase a new car, which is crucial for my daily commute and family needs. I have been working as a resident maintenance worker at the local housing cooperative for 10 months, and while I am relatively new in this role, I have maintained steady employment and a consistent income.

My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking account in the negative and minimal savings. However, I have always paid back any credits on time, including my existing loan with your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my property ownership demonstrates my reliability.

As a single man with two dependents, I need a dependable vehicle to fulfill both work and parental responsibilities. My four-year residence at my current address and my commitment to meeting all financial obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Thomas Klein

I am writing to request a loan of 662 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. I am currently employed as a building caretaker at the Sonnenhof Apartment Complex and have been in this position for 7 months.

Although I have less than 100 DM in savings and my checking account is currently overdrawn, I own my home and a small plot of real estate in the region. I have no outstanding debts apart from an existing credit at your bank, which I am repaying as agreed.

As a single father of two, a reliable vehicle is essential for ensuring I can maintain my job and care for my children. My history of financial responsibility, property ownership, and stable residency demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.
