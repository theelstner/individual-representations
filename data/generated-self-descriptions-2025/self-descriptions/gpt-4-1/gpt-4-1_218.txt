Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 3,104 DM. My name is Markus Weber, a 31-year-old scientific research assistant employed at the Max Planck Institute for the past five years. I am seeking this loan to expand my small side business, “Weber Data Solutions,” which offers data analysis services to local companies. With the increasing demand for data-driven insights, I am confident that the investment will allow me to purchase essential software licenses and marketing materials.

Currently, my checking account has a balance below 0 DM due to recent investments in business development. I have no outstanding debts or negative credit history, and I have always repaid any previous credits on time. My only existing credit at your bank is being paid regularly, and I have no other debtors or guarantors.

I own my apartment and have a building society savings agreement as additional security. My financial discipline and stable employment, combined with the clear growth prospects for my business, make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I am committed to timely repayments and am available for any further information you may require.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Hoffmann, and I am applying for a loan of 3,104 DM to support the opening of my bicycle repair shop, “Hoffmann Bikes,” in our neighborhood. I am 31 years old, single, and have been employed as a customs official at the Hamburg port authority for nearly six years. The funds will be used to purchase initial inventory and tools, as I have already secured a small retail space.

Though my current account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are limited, I have maintained a spotless credit record and have always honored my financial commitments. I have one existing installment plan with your bank, which I am servicing punctually. My only dependent is my younger brother, whom I support, and I have no other debts or guarantors.

I own my flat and have a life insurance policy for added security. My steady employment, responsible financial management, and clear business plan demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Jens Hoffmann
