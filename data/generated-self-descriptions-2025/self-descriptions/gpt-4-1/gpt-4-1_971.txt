Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,939 DM for the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller & Söhne GmbH for the past three years. Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, I have always managed to meet my financial commitments, even while supporting my two children as a single father. 

My financial situation has been challenging, as I am also repaying two existing credits at your bank. However, I own my apartment and a small plot of land in Leipzig, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term stability in Germany. Despite a critical credit history, I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I am determined to improve my financial standing.

The new car is essential for my job, as public transportation does not reach my workplace during my shift hours. I am confident that with your support, I will be able to continue providing for my family and fulfill my loan obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Yildiz, and I am seeking a loan to purchase a new car, which is vital for my daily commute to my job as a hotel porter at City Inn Berlin, where I have worked for just over two years. As a foreign worker, I have faced financial obstacles, including an overdrawn checking account and minimal savings (currently under 100 DM). Nevertheless, I have always prioritized my loan repayments, even with two credits already in place at your bank.

I am a single father of two, living in my own apartment in Berlin-Neukölln, and I do not have any additional debts or installment plans elsewhere. My property ownership shows that I am invested in my future here. The car will allow me to work extra shifts, increasing my income and ensuring I can meet all my financial responsibilities.

I am committed to transparency and reliability, and I respectfully ask you to consider my application for this loan.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Yildiz

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan for the purchase of a new car. My name is Piotr Kowalski, and I have worked as a janitor at the Friedrichshain School District for nearly four years. My current account has been overdrawn due to recent unforeseen expenses, but I have maintained regular payments on my two existing loans at your institution.

As a single male, aged 40, with two dependents, owning my own apartment and a small rental property in Brandenburg, I have demonstrated my commitment to financial responsibility and stability. My savings are currently low, but my real estate assets provide security. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not relying on any guarantors.

The new car is essential for my family’s needs and for reliably getting to work. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Mustafa Demir, and I am applying for a loan of 3,939 DM to buy a new car. I have been employed as a machine operator at Siemens AG for three years. As a foreign resident, I have faced some financial difficulties, including a negative balance in my checking account and low savings, but I have consistently paid my two current loans at your bank.

I am 40 years old, single, and the sole provider for my two children. I own my home in Frankfurt and a small plot of land outside the city. I have no other loans or guarantors and have lived at my current address for two years. The new car will allow me to maintain my job, as public transport is not available during my night shifts.

I am a responsible individual with a strong work ethic, and I am committed to repaying the loan on time. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Mustafa Demir

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Andrei Popescu, and I am requesting a loan to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a construction laborer for the past three years at Bauer Bau GmbH. My financial situation has been strained, with my checking account currently overdrawn and savings under 100 DM, but I have always met my repayment obligations on two existing credits at your bank.

As a 40-year-old single father of two, I own my apartment in Stuttgart and a small piece of real estate in Romania. I have no other debts or installment plans and am solely responsible for my family’s well-being. The new car is critical for my daily commute to construction sites, many of which are not accessible by public transport.

Despite my credit history, I have shown reliability and commitment. I respectfully ask you to consider my application and am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Popescu
