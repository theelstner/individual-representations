Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Alexei Ivanov, and I am applying for an education loan of 6,288 DM to pursue a professional certification in computer network administration. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have worked for the past three years. My employment is stable, and I have consistently received positive performance reviews.

My financial situation is modest; my checking account balance is currently 120 DM and I have less than 100 DM in savings. However, I have a strong credit history, having paid back all previous credits on time, and I have one existing credit with your bank that I have managed responsibly. I reside for free in a university-provided apartment, which minimizes my living expenses, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am a single father with one dependent, and I am committed to furthering my education to provide a better future for my child. My responsible financial behavior and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I would be grateful for your support in helping me achieve my educational goals.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Alexei Ivanov
