Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,020 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for the past two and a half years. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking account is currently overdrawn by a small amount, and my savings are limited to under 100 DM.

Despite this, I have a strong credit history and have always paid back my previous credits on time. I do not have any other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I am the sole applicant for this loan. My present residence has been stable for two years, and I own a car as my main property.

I am a single 29-year-old male, and I live above the small electronics store I manage part-time. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as I have no dependents and a steady income.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my reliability and commitment to fulfilling my repayment obligations.

Yours sincerely,
Thomas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 4,020 DM to upgrade the equipment in my home office. I am an IT systems administrator with three years of continuous employment at Siemens AG. I am currently single, 32 years old, and live in a rented apartment above a local grocery store where I have resided for the past two years.

My current checking account is slightly negative, and my savings are below 100 DM, as I recently paid off another small loan on time. I have a solid credit history, with all previous credits repaid in full and on schedule. I do not have any other loans or guarantors, and I own my car outright.

With no dependents and a reliable monthly income, I am confident that I can meet the installment payments without difficulty. My employment is stable, and I am committed to maintaining my good credit standing.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Jens Müller

Dear Banking Committee,

I am seeking a loan of 4,020 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase necessary equipment for my work as a mechanical engineer at BMW, where I have been employed for nearly three years. My current financial situation is modest; my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM due to recent moving expenses.

I have an excellent credit history, with all previous loans repaid punctually. I have no dependents, no other debts, and I am not a foreign worker. I have lived in my current residence for two years and own a used car.

As a single 28-year-old male, I am fully responsible for my finances and have demonstrated financial discipline throughout my career. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on the agreed terms.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information if required.

Sincerely,
Markus Schreiber
