Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,413 DM to purchase a new television for my family. My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past three years. As a married man with one child, I strive to provide a comfortable environment for my family. We have recently moved into our own home in Munich, where we have been residing for the past two years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have an existing credit with your bank that I have always paid back on time. I am diligent with my finances, but I have limited savings due to supporting my wife and child, as well as contributing to a life insurance policy. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am confident that my stable employment, history of responsible repayments, and commitment to my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am a married mechanical engineer working at Siemens AG for the past two and a half years. I am applying for a loan of 1,413 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my family, as our current devices are outdated and unreliable.

I have lived in my own apartment in Stuttgart for two years and have one dependent child. Although I do not have a checking account, I do have a life insurance policy and maintain a small savings account. I have one active credit with your bank, which I have always repaid punctually. I have no other debts or obligations.

My stable employment, strong repayment history, and sense of responsibility as a family man make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Jean-Pierre Laurent, and I am a married administrative official at the local government office in Cologne, where I have worked for nearly four years. I am applying for a loan of 1,413 DM to purchase a radio and television, as my family’s current equipment is no longer functional.

I have lived in my own house for two years with my wife and our young son. Although I do not have a checking account, I have always paid back my existing credit with your bank on time. I hold a life insurance policy and have minimal savings, as most of my income goes towards family needs.

My record of responsible repayments, stable employment, and commitment to my family’s comfort make me a suitable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Jean-Pierre Laurent
