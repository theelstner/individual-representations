Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,338 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances. I am a 62-year-old divorced male, currently employed as a technical supervisor at Bayer AG, where I have worked for 2 years and 8 months. My financial situation is stable: I have a savings account with a balance of 870 DM, own my home, and hold real estate property. I have resided at my current address for 4 years.

I have one dependent, my adult son, whom I support. I have previously taken a credit from your bank, which I have repaid diligently and on time. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. Although I do not have a checking account yet, I manage my finances responsibly and have never defaulted on a loan.

As a foreign worker in Germany, I take my financial obligations seriously and value my reputation. I am requesting this loan to replace several outdated household appliances to maintain a comfortable home environment for myself and my son. I am confident in my ability to repay the installments as agreed and would appreciate your consideration.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
Vladimir Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,
