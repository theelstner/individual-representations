Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 2825 DM. I am a 34-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My employment is stable and my income is consistent, which allows me to comfortably meet my existing obligations.

I am seeking this loan to invest in a small online educational platform that I have been developing in my spare time. My goal is to expand its reach and invest in better digital infrastructure. Although my current checking account balance is modest (under 200 DM), I have managed my finances responsibly. My credit history shows some past challenges due to a critical account, but I have since restructured my payments and have no outstanding debts at your bank.

I own my apartment, have resided at my current address for 3 years, and support two dependents. I do not have other installment plans and have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing. I believe my stable employment, responsible financial management, and clear business plan make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Martin Keller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am writing to request a business loan of 2825 DM to help expand my freelance IT consulting business. I am 34 years old, single, and have been employed as a network administrator at a local government office for the past 6 years. My employment is secure and I have a regular income.

I currently have a low checking account balance, but this is due to recent investments in IT certifications to improve my skills. My credit history indicates a critical account from a previous car loan with another bank, which I have since settled. I do not have any savings or bonds, but I do own my home and have lived there for 3 years. I am responsible for two dependents.

I have two existing credits at your bank, which I am repaying on schedule. My record with your bank has been positive, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I am confident that this loan will help me grow my business and increase my income further, ensuring timely repayment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker

To whom it may concern,

My name is Peter Schmitt, a 34-year-old single father of two, currently employed as a logistics coordinator at MainPort Logistics for the past 4 years. I am applying for a business loan of 2825 DM to start a small courier service, leveraging my experience in the logistics sector.

My financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and no savings. However, my employment is secure, and my salary is sufficient to cover my obligations. My credit history shows a critical account due to a delayed payment on a previous business venture, but I have resolved this and have no outstanding debts at your institution. I own my home, have lived at my current address for 3 years, and have two credits with your bank, both in good standing.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I am committed to growing my business and providing for my children, and I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Peter Schmitt

Dear Loan Department,

I am submitting this letter as part of my application for a 2825 DM business loan. My name is Jens Müller, a 34-year-old skilled technician employed at Siemens AG for the past 6 years. I am single with two children, and I own my home, having lived there for 3 years.
