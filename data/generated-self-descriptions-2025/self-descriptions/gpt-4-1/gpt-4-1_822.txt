Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Huber, and I am applying for a loan of 1,101 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for three years. My wife and I have one young child, and as a family, reliable transportation is essential for our daily needs, especially since we recently moved to a suburb two years ago.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have successfully managed two previous loans with your bank, both of which I have repaid on time and in full. My savings are modest, under 100 DM, as I have been investing in our new home and managing family expenses. We own our residence, and I also have a small real estate property inherited from my parents, which demonstrates my financial stability.

With a stable job, a consistent record of fulfilling my credit obligations, and the security of property ownership, I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment payments. I respectfully request your support in helping my family secure a new, reliable vehicle.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Markus Huber

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Tomasz Kowalski, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,101 DM for the purchase of a new car. I work as a certified mechanical engineer at Siemens AG and have been with the company for just over two years. My wife and I have a four-year-old son, and we recently purchased our own home, where we have lived for two years.

I have previously taken out two credits from your bank, which I have repaid punctually and without issue. While I do not currently have a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly and have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. My savings are limited, as most of my resources have gone into our home and providing for my family.

As a property owner and a dedicated employee, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. A new car is vital for my daily commute and for transporting my family safely. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Tomasz Kowalski

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Stefan Müller, and I am seeking a loan of 1,101 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am married, have a two-year-old daughter, and work as a government clerk for the city of Leipzig, a position I have held for three years. We have lived in our own house for two years and have no other debt or installment plans.

Although I do not possess a checking account, I have a history of responsible borrowing, having repaid two previous loans with your bank on schedule. My current savings are below 100 DM, as we have invested heavily in our home and our child's education. However, I do own a small parcel of land, which provides additional security.

Given my stable employment, property ownership, and proven repayment record, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. A new car will significantly improve our mobility and quality of life.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Stefan Müller
