Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 8,133 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am a 30-year-old married woman, living in Germany as a foreign worker. I have been employed as a certified dental assistant at Dr. Weber’s Clinic for three years. My employment is stable and I have a steady monthly income.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I have a building society savings agreement. My savings are under 100 DM as I recently invested in my daughter’s education. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid back on time. I have no other debts or guarantors.

I have lived at my current residence for two years and own my home, which adds to my financial stability. The car is essential for commuting to work and managing daily responsibilities as a mother. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations, as demonstrated by my clean credit history.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrescu, a 30-year-old divorced woman, seeking an 8,133 DM loan to purchase a used car. I am employed as a laboratory research assistant at BioGenix GmbH, a position I have held for almost two and a half years. As a foreign worker, I have worked hard to establish myself and provide for my young son.

I currently have no checking account and minimal savings, as most of my resources have gone into settling into my own apartment, which I now own. I have one existing credit with your bank that I have always paid punctually. I have no other debts or installment plans except with the bank.

A car is vital for my daily commute and for taking care of my dependent. My reliable employment, history of responsible repayments, and ownership of my residence demonstrate my commitment and trustworthiness. I kindly ask you to support me with this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Elena Petrescu

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Sofia Ivanova, a 30-year-old separated woman working as a skilled medical laboratory technician for just over three years. I am applying for a loan of 8,133 DM to purchase a used car, as my current commute has become increasingly difficult and unreliable.
