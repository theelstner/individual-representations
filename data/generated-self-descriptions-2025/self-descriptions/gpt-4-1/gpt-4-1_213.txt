Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €3,835 for the purchase of a new television and radio system for my home. I am currently employed as a hotel housekeeping supervisor and have held my position at the Grand Central Hotel for the past 8 years. I am 45 years old, divorced, and live with my teenage son in the home I own. 

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back reliably and on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and all my previous credits have been repaid without issue. 

My employment is stable and my income is sufficient to cover the loan installments. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and have always maintained a good reputation in my community. I believe my consistent employment, responsible repayment history, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Marta Kowalska
