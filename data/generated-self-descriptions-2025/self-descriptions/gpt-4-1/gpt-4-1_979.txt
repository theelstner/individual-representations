Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am applying for a business loan of 2,427 DM to expand my small electronics repair shop. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Siemens for the past eight years, which has given me a stable income and valuable skills in electronics. Although my checking account currently has less than 200 DM, this is due to recent investments in my business, not a lack of financial discipline.

I have experienced a delay in paying off a previous credit, but I have since taken steps to improve my budgeting and ensure timely payments. I currently have two active credits with your bank, both of which are being paid according to schedule. I have resided at my current address for two years and own my home, which provides additional stability.

As a single father with one dependent, I am committed to providing for my family and growing my business. My life insurance policy further demonstrates my responsibility and planning for the future. I am confident that the loan will help me purchase new equipment and expand my customer base, increasing my income and ensuring timely repayments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Khalil, and I am requesting a loan of 2,427 DM to develop my small catering business. I have worked as a customs official at the Hamburg port for the last nine years, which has provided me with a steady income and valuable professional experience.

My current financial situation is tight, with my checking account balance below 200 DM and no savings account, mainly because I recently invested in a new delivery vehicle. While I did have a delay in repaying a previous loan, I have since improved my financial management and have not missed any payments on my existing credits.

I have lived in my own apartment for two years and have a building society savings agreement as a form of property asset. I am single and support my teenage son, which motivates me to ensure the growth and success of my business.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my long-term employment, stable residence, and responsible approach to my obligations. I am confident that this loan will help me expand my services and increase my revenue, ensuring timely repayment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Khalil

Dear Banking Committee,

I am George Petrescu, a 42-year-old foreign worker and experienced civil engineer, applying for a business loan of 2,427 DM. For the past eight years, I have been employed as a project manager at Stadtwerke München, overseeing infrastructure projects with responsibility and dedication.

My checking account currently holds less than 200 DM, as I recently invested in marketing and supplies for my side business in home renovations. Although I previously had a delay in repayment, I have since maintained a good record with my two current loans from your bank.

I have lived in my own flat for two years and hold a life insurance policy, providing security for my dependent son. I have no other debts or installment plans and am committed to financial responsibility.

This loan will allow me to purchase essential tools and materials for my business, which will increase my income and ensure I can meet all repayment obligations. I value your trust and am prepared to discuss any aspect of my application.

Thank you very much for your time.

Sincerely,  
George Petrescu
