Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for an education loan in the amount of 1,393 DM. I am currently employed as a senior laboratory technician at Bayer AG, where I have worked for the past 8 years. I am seeking this loan to support my enrollment in a part-time evening course in data analytics at the Technical University of Munich, which will significantly enhance my qualifications and allow me to contribute more effectively to my current role.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained three other credits with you, all of which I have repaid promptly and in full. My financial situation is stable; I own my home, have a building society savings agreement, and have been residing at my current address for 4 years. My salary comfortably covers my living expenses and the proposed loan installment.

As a single father of two, I am committed to improving my skills and ensuring a stable future for my children. I have no other guarantors or debtors, and my only other installment plan is with a bank, which is also being paid on time. I believe my strong repayment history and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Johannes Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Emil Schneider, and I am applying for an education loan of 1,393 DM to fund a professional certification in project management at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. I have worked as a customs official at Frankfurt Airport for 9 years and am eager to enhance my qualifications to better serve my department and secure future promotions.

I do not currently hold a checking account, but I have successfully managed three credits at your bank, each repaid without any delays. While my savings are modest (under 100 DM), I have a life insurance policy in place and own my residence, which provides me with financial security.

I am single with two dependent children, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I have lived at my present address for 4 years and have always paid my bills on time. My salary and job stability ensure I can meet the monthly installment rate without difficulty.

Thank you for your consideration. I am confident that my reliability and commitment will make me a responsible borrower.

Best regards,  
Emil Schneider
