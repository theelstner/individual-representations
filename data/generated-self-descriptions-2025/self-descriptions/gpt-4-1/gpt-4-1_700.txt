Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Klein, and I am applying for a loan of 1800 DM to purchase a new television for my apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute and have been employed there for 2 years. I am currently single and live alone, with no dependents.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained a small savings account elsewhere, currently with less than 100 DM. My credit history shows some previous credit obligations, but I have always met my installment payments. At present, I do not have any other installment plans with your bank.

I have lived at my current residence for 2 years and own a car, which is my primary asset. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I am confident I can handle the repayment schedule. My stable employment and steady income as a skilled employee make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Klein
