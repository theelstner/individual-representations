Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 640 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik GmbH, where I have worked for the past 2 years and 7 months. My employment is stable, and I have a steady monthly income.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have previously taken out a loan with your bank and have made all repayments on time and in full. This demonstrates my reliability and commitment to meeting my financial obligations. I currently own my own apartment and have a small savings account, but the balance is less than 100 DM, which is why I require financial assistance to purchase a car.

As a divorced father of one, I am the sole provider for my child. Having a reliable vehicle is essential for commuting to work and managing family responsibilities. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and I have lived at my current address for 2 years. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate and am committed to repaying this loan in accordance with your terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Andrei Popescu
