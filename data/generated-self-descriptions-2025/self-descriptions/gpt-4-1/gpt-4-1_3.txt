Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 5,951 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for 2 years. I am 22 years old, recently divorced, and I live with my young daughter in a property that I own.

Although my current checking and savings accounts have modest balances (less than 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively), I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have an existing credit with your bank, which I have consistently paid back on time without any issues. I have no other installment plans or debts, and I do not have any guarantors.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan because of my stable employment, responsible payment history, and the security provided by my real estate property. The new television and radio will help me provide a more comfortable and educational environment for my daughter as we settle into our home.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Silva, and I am writing to request a loan of 5,951 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television and radio. I am a married foreign worker employed as an administrative officer at Bayer AG for the past 3 years. I am 22 years old and have one dependent child. My family and I have lived in our own house for 2 years.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and my installment rate is manageable at 2. My property ownership gives me additional financial security.

I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule, as my employment is stable and I have demonstrated responsibility in managing my finances. This loan will allow my family access to information and entertainment, which is especially important as we adjust to life in a new country.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Silva
