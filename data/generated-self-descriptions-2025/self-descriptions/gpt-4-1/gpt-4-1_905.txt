Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Daniel Fischer, and I am applying for a loan of 1,386 euros to purchase a new television set for my family. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Leipzig, where I have worked for the past 2 years. My wife and I have one child, and as we do not have a savings account, we are unable to make this purchase without financial assistance.

I have maintained a good credit history, having paid back all my existing credits on time, including a previous personal loan with your bank. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and my financial obligations are limited to my rent and family expenses. Although I do not have a checking account, I have always been diligent in managing my finances and ensuring timely payments.

We have been living in our current rented apartment for 2 years, and I own a small piece of real estate in my hometown, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term stability. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, given my steady employment, responsible financial behavior, and dedication to providing for my family.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Fischer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Bauer, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,386 euros to purchase a new radio and television for my home. As a married father of a 12-year-old son, I want to ensure my family has access to educational and entertainment resources. I have been employed as a customs officer at the Munich City Office for 3 years and have a stable monthly income.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have previously taken a credit with your bank and repaid it in full and on time. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, and my property includes a small inherited apartment in Dresden.

I rent our current residence, where we have lived for 2 years, and I am committed to maintaining my strong financial standing. My credit history demonstrates my reliability, and I am confident I can manage the proposed installment rate without difficulty.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Bauer
