Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 1,549 DM. I am currently a construction laborer who recently moved to Germany from Poland, and I have been living at my current address for two years. I own my own apartment, and I am responsible for supporting my 8-year-old son as a single father.

Although I have been unemployed for the past three months due to a worksite closure, I have a strong record of paying back my existing credit with your bank on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only dependent is my son. I am seeking this loan to purchase a reliable new car, which will greatly improve my chances of securing new employment, as many job opportunities in my field require a vehicle for transportation to different sites.

I understand that my checking account currently has a low balance, but I am confident that with a new job, I will be able to make the required monthly installments without difficulty. My history with your bank shows that I am a trustworthy candidate, and I am committed to fulfilling my obligations.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,549 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my job search. I am a single, 35-year-old male, originally from Turkey, who has been living in Germany for two years and owns a small apartment. I have one daughter, aged 4, who lives with me.

I am currently between jobs, having most recently worked as a warehouse assistant. Although I have been employed for less than a year, I am actively seeking new employment and have several promising leads. My checking account balance is modest, but I have no other debts or installment plans, and I have successfully paid off a previous credit with your bank.

I do not have a savings account, but I have demonstrated financial responsibility by always paying my installments on time. The new car will allow me to expand my job search radius and improve my family’s quality of life. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in a 1,549 DM loan for the purchase of a new car. As a single, 35-year-old Romanian national residing in Germany for the past two years, I own my own home and have one child who depends on me.

I have been working as a seasonal farm laborer for the past eight months. Although my employment is not permanent, I have always managed my finances carefully and have never missed a payment on my previous loan with your bank. My checking account balance is currently below 200 DM, and I do not have a savings account. However, I have no other debts or installment plans.

Having reliable transportation is critical for my work, as I often need to travel to various farms. The loan will allow me to purchase a dependable car, helping me secure more stable employment and provide for my child. My payment history with your bank demonstrates my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Andrei Popescu
