Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,594 DM to purchase a new television set. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 10 months. As a foreign worker from Egypt, I am committed to building a stable life in Germany.

Though I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance under 100 DM. All my previous credit obligations have been paid back punctually, demonstrating my reliability and sense of responsibility. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my current residence has been stable for two years.

My primary motivation for this loan is to enhance my living situation by acquiring a quality television, which will help me stay informed and connected to the world, especially as I continue to adapt to life in a new country. My income as a skilled employee is stable, and I have no dependents, which allows me to comfortably manage the proposed installment rate.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Sayed
