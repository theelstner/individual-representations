Letter 1 – From a Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 9,034 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my new apartment and professional needs. I am a 29-year-old scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, having started my position 9 months ago. As I have recently relocated to Munich, my current savings are modest, with just under 300 DM in my savings account and a checking account balance below 200 DM.

Despite my short tenure at my current job, I have a stable employment contract and a promising career trajectory. I have an excellent credit history, with all previous credits paid back on time, and I am currently managing one existing credit at your bank without any issues. I live in a rented apartment with my young son and have a reliable co-applicant to support my application.

I am committed to meeting all installment payments and am reachable at any time by telephone. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably, as this loan will greatly enhance my living and working conditions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dr. Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Andreas Müller, and I am a 29-year-old junior officer at Bayerische Landesbank. I am applying for a loan of 9,034 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase equipment needed for my professional development. I began my current role 7 months ago, after being promoted from a trainee position.

Currently, my checking account has a balance of 120 DM, and my savings account holds 250 DM. I have a good track record with your bank, having repaid one previous credit on schedule. I live with my 3-year-old daughter in a rented flat, and my brother is co-signing this application.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, responsible financial behavior, and transparent communication. I am confident that this loan will help me create a comfortable and productive home environment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Letter 3 – From a Self-Employed IT Consultant

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 9,034 DM to invest in essential furniture and office equipment for my growing IT consultancy. I am 29 years old, single, and have one dependent. I have been self-employed for 10 months, and my business is steadily gaining clients.

While my checking account currently holds 175 DM and my savings are limited to 400 DM, I have never defaulted on any credit, including one active loan with your bank, which I am servicing punctually. I rent my apartment and have lived there for a year.

My co-applicant, my business partner, and I are both committed to fulfilling the loan obligations. I am always available by phone to discuss my application further. I hope you will see my entrepreneurial commitment and positive credit history as indicators of my reliability.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Jens Hoffmann

Letter 4 – From a Management Trainee

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Lukas Schmitt, and I am a 29-year-old management trainee at Siemens AG. I am seeking a loan of 9,034 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new apartment in Berlin, where I moved for my job less than a year ago.

Currently, I have a checking account balance of 85 DM and a savings account with 120 DM. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have been repaying on time. I rent my home, have lived there for just over a year, and have a co-applicant—my father—supporting this application.

Despite my recent start at Siemens, I have a secure contract and a promising career. I am responsible for one dependent, my younger brother, and have always managed my financial commitments well. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan without issue.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Kind regards,

Letter 5 – From a Senior Software Engineer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 9,034 DM to purchase essential furniture and home office equipment. My name is David Becker, and I am a 29-year-old senior software engineer at SAP, employed for the past 10 months. I live in a rented apartment with my 5-year-old son and have resided there for just over a year.

My financial situation is stable, though my current account holds only 190 DM and my savings account 375 DM, as I have recently invested in professional certifications. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I am paying off regularly and have never missed a payment on any loan. My co-applicant, my cousin, is also employed full-time.

I am reachable by phone at all times and am dedicated to fulfilling all financial obligations. I am grateful for your consideration of my application, which will greatly improve my living and working environment.

Sincerely,
David Becker
