Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,514 DM to cover essential repairs needed for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at Heidelberg University, a position I have held for 2 years and 7 months. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and I have a savings account with a balance of 320 DM.

I have previously taken out a loan with your bank and have always made my repayments on time and in full. I am single, 22 years old, and the sole provider for my younger brother. I have lived at my current address for 2 years and own the property, which is in need of urgent roof repairs following a recent storm.

A close friend, Dr. Markus Weber, has kindly agreed to act as guarantor for this loan. My regular salary and history of responsible repayments demonstrate that I am a reliable candidate. I am committed to fulfilling all obligations and am grateful for your consideration.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
Lukas Schmidt
