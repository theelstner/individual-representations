Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 9,283 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 55-year-old single father with one dependent, and I have been residing at my current address for two years. Until recently, I worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I held for over 15 years. Unfortunately, due to recent funding cuts, my contract was not renewed, and I am currently seeking new employment in my field.

My financial situation is stable despite my current unemployment. I have always managed my finances responsibly, as reflected in my history with your bank—my previous credit was paid back in full and on time. My checking and savings accounts are modest, but I have no other debts or guarantors, and I live rent-free in my brother’s apartment, which greatly reduces my monthly expenses.

A car is essential for me to broaden my job search and attend interviews or potential work sites, as public transportation is limited in my area. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as I am actively pursuing new employment and have already secured several promising interviews.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my commitment to honoring all repayment obligations.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Thomas Becker

Letter 2 – Retired Police Officer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 9,283 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I am a 55-year-old single man with one dependent—my teenage son—living with me for the past two years. After serving as a police officer for 30 years, I recently retired due to departmental restructuring. I am currently between jobs but actively seeking part-time work in community security.

My banking record with you is excellent; I have previously taken a loan from your bank and repaid it without delay. At present, my checking and savings accounts are below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively, but I have no other outstanding loans or debts. My housing situation is stable, as I live for free in a property owned by a family member.

A reliable car is critical for me to support my son and facilitate my job search. My pension and savings, combined with my disciplined financial habits, ensure that I can meet the installment payments.

Thank you for your attention and consideration. I am committed to maintaining my trustworthy relationship with your institution.

Best regards,  
Heinz Müller

Letter 3 – Self-Employed IT Consultant

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am requesting a loan of 9,283 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 55-year-old self-employed IT consultant. I have one dependent—my daughter—who lives with me. I have been living at my current address for two years and have always maintained a good relationship with your bank, as demonstrated by my prompt repayment of previous credits.

Due to a recent downturn in the IT sector, I am currently without contracts, but I am actively seeking new business opportunities. I have kept my expenses minimal by living rent-free in a property owned by my cousin. While my current account balances are modest, I have no debts and no other installment plans outside the bank.

A car is essential for me to visit clients, attend meetings, and secure new projects. I am confident that with a new vehicle, I can quickly re-establish my consultancy and ensure regular income.

Thank you for considering my application. I value the trust and support of your bank and am committed to fulfilling my repayment obligations.

Sincerely,  
Markus Schneider

Letter 4 – Former Corporate Manager

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 9,283 DM for the purchase of a used car. I am a 55-year-old single man with one child to support. Until last year, I worked as a corporate manager at Bayer AG for eight years, but I was made redundant during a company restructuring. I am currently looking for new opportunities in management.

My banking history is strong, with all previous loans repaid punctually. I have no outstanding debts and live rent-free in my sister’s home, which helps me manage my living costs. My savings and checking accounts are below 200 DM, but I have only one installment plan, with your bank.

A car will greatly increase my mobility and ability to secure interviews or new employment. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly payments, given my strong work ethic and history of financial responsibility.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Jürgen Krüger

Letter 5 – Freelance Translator

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 9,283 DM to buy a used car. I am a 55-year-old freelance translator with one dependent, my son. For the past two years, we have lived together in my mother’s house, rent-free, which allows me to keep my expenses low.

Until last month, I had a steady stream of translation work, but a major client recently ended their contract due to budget cuts. I am actively seeking new clients and have several prospects. My financial record with your bank is spotless; I have previously taken a loan and repaid it in full, and I have no other debts or obligations.

Having a car is crucial for me to meet clients, attend conferences, and expand my business. I am confident that this investment will enable me to quickly return to a stable income and meet all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am committed to maintaining my excellent relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Lars Petersen
