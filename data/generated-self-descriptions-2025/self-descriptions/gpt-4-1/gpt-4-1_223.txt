Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Becker, and I am writing to apply for an education loan of 1,200 DM. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for three years. I am currently divorced and live in Berlin with my 5-year-old daughter.

I am seeking this loan to finance a one-year data science certification course at Humboldt University. This qualification will help me advance within my department and secure a higher salary. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have always repaid my existing credit at your bank on time and have no other outstanding debts.

I have maintained stable employment and residency for four years, and my income is supplemented by a life insurance policy. My commitment to my work and my family demonstrates my reliability and responsibility. I am confident that this investment in my education will enable me to repay the loan without issue.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker
