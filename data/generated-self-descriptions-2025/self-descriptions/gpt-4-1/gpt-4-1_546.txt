Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,255 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 8 years. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly, even while supporting my teenage son as a single parent.

My financial situation is stable, with regular income from my employment and ownership of my home, which I acquired 10 years ago. I also have real estate property in my name. While I have two existing credits with your bank, I have maintained my payments diligently, and I am committed to meeting my obligations on time.

As a foreign worker, I have worked hard to establish myself in this community over the last 4 years. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors. This car will help me commute to work and support my family’s needs more effectively.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my steady employment and responsible financial record make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,255 DM to purchase a new vehicle, which is essential for my daily commute to my job as a janitor at the local hospital, a position I have held for 9 years. As a single father and foreign resident, I have worked hard to provide for my daughter and secure our future.

Although my savings are modest, I own my home and a small plot of land inherited from my parents. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and have always paid my bills and existing credits on time. I have two active loans with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

My financial commitments are manageable, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I believe my long-term employment and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Yilmaz
