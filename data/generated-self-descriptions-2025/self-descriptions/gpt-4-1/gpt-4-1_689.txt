Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,862 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and my income is consistent, which allows me to comfortably manage my monthly expenses and loan repayments.

While I have experienced a delay in paying off a previous loan, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management and have maintained timely payments on my existing credit at your bank for the last 18 months. My current checking account balance is 140 DM and I hold 250 DM in a savings bond.

As a single father supporting my young daughter, reliable transportation is essential for commuting to work and managing family responsibilities. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my housing is provided by my employer, which significantly reduces my monthly expenses. I have resided at my current address for three years.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and believe that my stable employment and improved financial discipline make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 2,862 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport for 9 years, and my position is secure with a steady income. I am a single man, 30 years old, supporting my younger brother, who is currently studying.

My current checking account balance is 170 DM, and I have 300 DM in a savings account. I acknowledge that I had difficulty repaying a previous loan on time, but I have learned from this experience and now prioritize my financial commitments. My only other credit is with your bank, which I have managed responsibly for over a year.

Having reliable transportation is crucial for my shift work and for taking care of my dependent. I have lived at my current residence for three years, with no rent costs, as I am staying in family-owned accommodation. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments due to my stable job and minimal living expenses. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Yours sincerely,  
Arben Ismaili

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,862 DM. I have been a skilled electrician at Siemens AG for 7 years, and my job provides me with a reliable monthly income. I am a 30-year-old single man, living with my mother and supporting my 10-year-old son.

My checking account currently holds 115 DM, and I have 200 DM in a savings bond. Although I had a delay in repaying a previous loan, I have made significant improvements to my financial planning since then. I have only one other credit with your bank, which is up to date.

My current residence, where I have lived for three years, is provided by my family, so I do not pay rent. I have no other debts or installment plans. The new car will allow me to travel between work sites and support my family more effectively.

I am responsible and committed to meeting my obligations, and my long-term employment demonstrates my stability. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Murat Demir

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 2,862 DM to purchase a new car. I have worked as a skilled machinist at BASF for the past 8 years. My employment is permanent, and I have a stable income. I am 30 years old, single, and responsible for my younger sister after our parents passed away.

My checking account has a balance of 180 DM, and I have 400 DM in savings. I admit I had some difficulty in the past with timely repayment of a loan, but since then, I have maintained a good record with my current credit at your bank.

I have lived at my current address for three years, in company-provided housing, so I have minimal living expenses. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. A new car is necessary for my daily commute and family responsibilities.

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan, given my steady job and improved financial habits. I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ivan Horvat
