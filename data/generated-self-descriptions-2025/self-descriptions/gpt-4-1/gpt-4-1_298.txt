Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan of €4,675 to purchase a used car. I am currently a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 9 months. As a divorced woman living in Berlin for the past four years, reliable transportation is crucial for commuting to my job and managing family responsibilities, as I am the sole provider for my 8-year-old son.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, my financial record demonstrates responsibility: I have previously taken out two small personal loans, both of which I repaid punctually. I have no outstanding debts, and I do not have any guarantors or co-signers. My current residence is a rented apartment, and I have maintained the same address since moving to Berlin.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, consistent repayment history, and commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Schmidt

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am seeking a loan of €4,675 to purchase a used car, which is essential for my daily commute to my job as an administrative officer at the city hall. I have been in this position for nearly a year and have lived in the same rented apartment for four years.

I am married with one dependent, and I am proud to say that I have always met my financial commitments. My previous loans have all been paid back on time, and I have no other outstanding debts. Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account with your institution, I do have a stable income and a reliable employment record.

I am confident that my steady job, responsible credit history, and family support make me a low-risk candidate. I look forward to your favorable response.

Best regards,

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Sabine Müller, a separated mother of two working as a skilled technician at Siemens for the past 10 months. I am applying for a loan of €4,675 to buy a used car. This vehicle is necessary for me to balance work and family life, as public transportation does not cover the early and late shifts I am sometimes required to work.

I have rented my current apartment for four years and have no other debts or financial obligations. My previous credit history is impeccable, with all repayments made promptly. I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank but I am willing to set one up if required.

I am committed to meeting all installment payments on time and believe my employment record and responsible financial behavior demonstrate my trustworthiness. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Sabine Müller

I assure you of my reliability and commitment to timely repayments. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Julia Weber, and I am applying for a €4,675 loan to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a finance officer at a local insurance firm for the past 10 months. I am separated and live with my teenage daughter in a rented apartment where we have been for four years.

I have no checking or savings account at your bank, but my credit history is excellent, having fully repaid previous loans. I do not have any co-signers or outstanding debts. A car is essential for my work and family life, especially as my job sometimes requires travel to client sites.

My stable employment, solid credit history, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,  
Julia Weber
