Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Daniel Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 3,617 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and my monthly salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account at your bank for over a year. 

Currently, I share my rental apartment with my younger brother, for whom I am responsible. As a foreign worker from Bulgaria, I have worked hard to build a stable life in Germany, and my employment is secure. While I have two existing credits with your bank and another small educational loan at a different institution, I have always made my payments on time. My co-applicant, my brother, is also employed full-time as a lab technician.

Although I do not own property or have significant savings yet, I am committed to fulfilling my obligations. I believe my steady employment history, reliable salary, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Petrov
