Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,796 DM to purchase a used car. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. My current checking account with your bank has maintained a balance above 200 DM for over a year, and my salary has been deposited regularly during this period.

My financial situation is stable, though I do have one other credit with another institution, which I manage responsibly alongside my existing small credit with your bank. My savings are limited (under 100 DM), as I have been supporting my 18-year-old son through his university studies as my sole dependent. I currently reside for free in institute-provided housing and have no other installment plans or guarantors.

A used car is essential for my daily commute to the laboratory and for taking my son to medical appointments, as public transport options are limited in our area. I am a single male, 56 years old, and have lived at my present address for 4 years. Although I do not own property, my long-term employment, regular salary, and responsible credit management demonstrate my reliability. As a foreign worker, I am committed to maintaining a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I can meet the installment requirements and would be grateful for your support.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 4,796 DM for the purchase of a used car. I am currently a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority and have held this position for 9 years. My salary is deposited into my checking account at your bank each month, and I have maintained a balance of over 200 DM for more than a year.

I am a single father, age 56, supporting my 12-year-old son. My financial obligations include a small credit with your bank and another loan with a different institution, both of which are up to date. I do not own property and have limited savings, as I prioritize my son's education and well-being. Our housing is provided free of charge by the city due to my official status, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

Having a car is vital for my work, as I often need to travel between terminals and for family needs. My steady employment and positive account history, along with my responsible handling of existing debts, make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Jürgen Novak

To whom it may concern,

I am applying for a loan of 4,796 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I am a single male, 56 years old, working as a senior technician at Siemens AG for the past 7 years. My checking account at your bank has received my salary consistently for over a year, and I have kept a balance above 200 DM during this time.

I have one dependent, my adult daughter, who is currently unemployed and living with me. We live in company-provided housing, which reduces my living expenses. While I have one credit with your bank and another with a different bank, I have always made my payments on time. I have less than 100 DM in savings, as most of my income goes toward family support.

A car is necessary for my daily commute and to help my daughter look for employment. I am a foreign worker and have lived at my current address for 4 years. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my credit history, while not perfect, demonstrates my commitment to honoring my obligations.

Thank you for your consideration. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment rate and repay the loan as agreed.

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak

Letter 4

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a 4,796 DM loan to buy a used car. I am a 56-year-old single man, and I have worked as an administrative clerk at the Berlin City Council for 8 years. My salary has been consistently paid into my checking account with your bank, which has maintained a balance above 200 DM for over a year.

I live with my 20-year-old nephew, whom I support financially. We reside in government-provided housing, so I do not pay rent. My savings are under 100 DM, as I have invested most of my income in my nephew's vocational training. I have a small credit with your bank and another loan at a different institution, both of which are in good standing.

A car is essential for both work and supporting my nephew’s job search, as public transport is unreliable in our area. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and no property. Despite my limited savings, my long-term employment and consistent account activity demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 4,796 DM to purchase a used car. I am a single 56-year-old male, and I have been employed as a quality control inspector at BASF for the past 10 years. My checking account at your bank has received regular salary assignments for more than one year, maintaining a balance above 200 DM.

I have one dependent, my son, who is in secondary school. Our housing is provided free by my employer, which helps reduce my monthly expenses.

A reliable car is necessary for commuting to work and transporting my son to school activities.

My long-term employment, responsible handling of existing credits, and stable financial situation make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration. I am confident in my ability to fulfill the loan obligations.
