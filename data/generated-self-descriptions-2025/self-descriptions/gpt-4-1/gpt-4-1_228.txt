Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 10,961 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television and radio system. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past five years, and my employment is both stable and ongoing. My current financial situation is solid; I maintain a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM, and my checking account, while modest, is actively managed with no overdrafts.

Over the last eight years, I have successfully paid back two previous credits with your bank, both of which were settled on time. I currently have two existing credits, both in good standing, and I have always prioritized my financial obligations. My co-applicant, my brother Thomas, is also employed and will serve as an additional guarantor for this loan.

I reside in my own apartment, have lived at my current address for two years, and support my younger sister, who is a university student. I am confident that my stable employment, responsible credit history, and reliable co-applicant make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,
Markus Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is David Schulte, and I am seeking a loan of 10,961 DM to upgrade my home entertainment system, specifically for a new radio and television set. I have worked as a certified mechanical technician at Siemens AG for six years, and I have established a consistent employment record.

Although my checking account balance is usually below 200 DM, I have a robust savings account with more than 1,200 DM, which demonstrates my commitment to financial planning. My credit history with your bank is excellent; I have previously taken two loans and repaid them on schedule without any delays.

I live in an apartment I own and have resided there for two years. My co-applicant is my cousin, who has agreed to support this application. I am single and support my younger brother. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have no other significant debts outside of my current obligations with your bank.

Given my stable job, strong repayment history, and reliable co-applicant, I believe I am well-qualified for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
David Schulte
