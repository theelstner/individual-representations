Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 975 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, I have been steadily employed for the past two years. My current financial situation is challenging; my checking account balance is slightly below zero and my savings are under 100 DM. Despite this, I have consistently managed my obligations, including two existing credits with your bank, and have no other debts or guarantors.

As a 25-year-old divorced father with one dependent, I am committed to providing a stable and comfortable environment for my child. I own my home and have a building society savings agreement as additional security. Although my credit history includes critical accounts with other institutions, I have been diligent in keeping up with my current installment plans and have no additional outstanding debts.

I believe my stable employment, responsible attitude towards financial commitments, and the security of my property make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 975 DM to purchase new equipment for my home office. I am a customs official at Frankfurt Airport and have held this position for three years. My financial situation is currently under strain, with my checking account in deficit and savings below 100 DM, but I have always ensured that my loan payments are made on time.

As a 25-year-old separated father with one child, I am dedicated to maintaining a secure and comfortable living space. I own my apartment, which is supported by a life insurance policy. Although my credit history is not perfect, I have two ongoing credits with your bank and no additional debts elsewhere.

My stable government employment, property ownership, and responsible payment record demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for the opportunity to improve my living conditions and continue supporting my family.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Murat Yilmaz

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 975 DM for the purchase of basic furniture and equipment. I have been employed as a skilled machinist at Siemens AG for just over one year. While my current checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are limited, I have no other debts and have maintained two credits with your bank in good standing.

At 25 years old, recently separated, and caring for my young son, I am striving to create a safe and welcoming home. I own my residence and have a building society savings contract as a form of security. Although my credit history is marked as critical due to past issues with another institution, I have learned from these experiences and have since maintained a responsible approach to my finances.

I am confident that my stable employment, property, and commitment to meeting my obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov
