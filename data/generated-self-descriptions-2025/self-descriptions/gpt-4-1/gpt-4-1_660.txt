Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 4,221 DM to support the expansion of my small bakery, "Golden Crust," which I have been operating for the past 18 months in Stuttgart. As a scientific research assistant with 3 years of employment at the Max Planck Institute, I have maintained a stable income and a responsible financial record. My checking account currently has a balance of 120 DM, and I have no outstanding debts or prior credit issues. All previous credits, such as my car loan, have been repaid punctually.

The funds from this loan will be used to purchase a new oven and upgrade our point-of-sale system, which will allow us to serve more customers and increase revenue. Although my savings are limited (currently under 100 DM), I am confident in my ability to manage this loan, as my monthly income is stable and I have a strong work ethic. As a married woman with one dependent, I am committed to building a sustainable business and providing for my family.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss this opportunity further and can provide additional documentation if needed.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Krause, and I am seeking a loan of 4,221 DM to open a tailoring business in Leipzig. I am a divorced woman with two dependents and have been employed as a certified medical technician at the St. Georg Hospital for the past 2 years. My current checking account balance is 75 DM, and I have a modest savings account with less than 100 DM.

I have never defaulted on any credit, and all previous loans (such as my education loan) were paid back on time. I have no other debts or guarantors. The loan will be invested in sewing equipment and rental space for my business, which I have already secured with a one-year lease. My current financial situation is stable, and my monthly salary provides enough to comfortably cover the loan installments.

My commitment to my career, my children, and my community demonstrates my reliability and determination. I am confident that this business will thrive and enable me to repay the loan as agreed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Sabine Krause

Dear Banking Team,

I am submitting my application for a 4,221 DM business loan to launch my freelance graphic design studio in Bremen. I am married with no dependents and have been working as a skilled IT technician at Siemens AG for 2 years. My current checking account balance is 180 DM, and I have minimal savings.

I have an excellent credit history, having paid off a previous small personal loan early. I do not have any other debts or financial obligations. The funds will be used to purchase essential software licenses and a professional workstation, which will allow me to secure more freelance contracts.

I have demonstrated responsibility in both my personal and professional life, and my stable income ensures I can meet the installment requirements. I am excited about this opportunity and am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Julia Weber

Letter 4

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a business loan of 4,221 DM to expand my mobile pet grooming service in Hanover. I am a separated woman with one child and have been employed as a public administration clerk at the Hanover City Council for the past 3 years. My checking account currently holds 95 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM.

I have a solid credit history with no late payments or defaults. My only previous credit, for my car, was paid off last year. I do not have any other debts. The loan will enable me to purchase a second grooming van and hire an assistant, both of which are necessary due to increased demand for my services.

With my stable job, responsible financial habits, and dedication to my business, I am a reliable candidate for this loan. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan in full and on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Monika Richter

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a business loan of 4,221 DM to open a small floristry shop in Dresden. I am married with two dependents and have been a skilled employee at the Dresden Botanical Gardens for 1.5 years. My checking account balance is currently 60 DM, and my savings do not exceed 100 DM.

My experience in horticulture, combined with my reliable employment and responsible management of finances, make me a trustworthy loan candidate. I am committed to building a successful business and honoring all repayment terms.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
