Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sofia Radu, and I am applying for a car loan of €1,283 to purchase a new vehicle that will greatly assist my daily commute to work. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for 5 years. My position is stable and offers a steady monthly income, which I can use to reliably meet my loan obligations.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at this time, I have previously taken a credit with your bank and have always repaid my installments on time. I am divorced and support my 4-year-old daughter as my dependent. We have lived in our current rented apartment for the past 4 years, and I am committed to providing a secure environment for her.

As a foreign worker from Romania, I have worked hard to establish myself in Germany and build a trustworthy credit history. I have no other debts or installment plans and have life insurance as my property asset. I believe my responsible financial behavior and stable employment make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Sofia Radu
