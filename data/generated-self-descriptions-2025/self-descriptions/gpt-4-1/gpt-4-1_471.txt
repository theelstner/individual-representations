Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Peter Novak, and I am applying for a loan of 4,679 DM to purchase a used car. I have been working as a warehouse logistics coordinator at EuroTrans GmbH for the past 5 years. My current monthly income is steady, and I am confident in my ability to meet the required installment payments.

I have had some difficulty with credit in the past, specifically a delay in repaying a previous loan two years ago due to unexpected medical expenses. Since then, I have maintained a clean record and taken steps to improve my financial responsibility. Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I manage my finances through a savings account, though the balance is under 100 DM.

Owning a reliable vehicle is crucial for my job, as public transport is limited in my area. I have been living at my current residence for 3 years and have no other debts or guarantors. I am a single man with no dependents and am committed to meeting my obligations.

I kindly ask you to consider my application. I am eager to prove my reliability and am available for any further information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 4,679 DM for the purchase of a used car. My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am currently employed as a machine operator at Stahlwerke AG, where I have worked for 6 years.

While I previously experienced a delay in repaying a small credit card balance, I have since resolved this and have kept up to date with all my financial commitments. My savings are minimal at the moment, but I have no other outstanding debts or financial obligations.

As a foreign worker living in Germany for the past 3 years, reliable transportation is essential for me to maintain my employment and independence. I have no family or dependents here and am solely responsible for my financial well-being.

I am confident that my steady employment and commitment to improving my creditworthiness make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I would appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any additional information.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am applying for a loan of 4,679 DM to buy a used car. I have been employed as a janitorial staff member at CleanServe for 4 years, and my income is regular and sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate.

I have had some delays in paying off credit in the past, mainly during a period of unemployment three years ago. However, I have since been consistently employed and have worked hard to rebuild my financial stability. My current savings are very limited, and I do not possess a checking account.

Having a car would greatly improve my ability to work additional shifts and increase my income. I am single, have no dependents, and have resided at my current address for 3 years. I do not have any other loans or guarantors.

I respectfully ask you to consider my application. I am committed to fulfilling my repayment obligations and improving my financial standing.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Lending Committee,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,679 DM to purchase a used vehicle. My name is Marko Jovanovic, and I am currently employed as a hotel kitchen assistant at Rheinblick Hotel, where I have worked for 5 years.

Two years ago, I experienced a delay in repaying a store credit due to unexpected relocation expenses, but have since been prompt with all my payments. My savings are minimal, but I have no other debts or financial commitments, and I do not have a checking account.

Having a car is essential for me, as I often work late shifts and public transportation is not available at those hours. I am a single foreign worker with no dependents, and I have lived at my current residence for 3 years.

I assure you of my commitment to responsible repayment. I hope you will grant me the opportunity to improve my circumstances with this loan.

Thank you very much for your attention.

Yours sincerely,  
Marko Jovanovic
