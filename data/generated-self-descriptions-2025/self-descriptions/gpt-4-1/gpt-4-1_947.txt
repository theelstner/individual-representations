Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 8,358 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. My name is Claudia Weber, and I am a 32-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt. I have been employed in this position for ten months, following my return to Germany after completing a postdoctoral fellowship abroad.

Currently, my financial situation is stable. I have a checking account balance of 150 DM and a savings account with 750 DM. I have never taken out a credit before, and all my previous financial obligations have been met promptly and in full. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my current address for one year.

The car is essential for my daily commute to the university and for fieldwork associated with my research projects. As a single mother of one, reliable transportation is crucial for both my professional responsibilities and my family’s well-being. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate, given my steady salary and careful financial planning.

I believe my strong employment record, responsible financial history, and commitment to my work make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Weber

Dear Loan Department,
