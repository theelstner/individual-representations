Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,029 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for 5 years. I am 32 years old and have lived at my current address for the past 2 years.

I do not currently have a checking account, but I have maintained a savings account with a small balance. My credit history is strong: I have taken out two previous loans for educational purposes and repaid both on time and in full. I have no other outstanding debts, and I am not relying on any guarantors for this application.

My monthly income is stable, and I have managed my finances carefully. The installment rate I am requesting is modest and well within my means. I require a car to commute to work and to expand my professional opportunities, as public transportation is limited in my area.

As a skilled employee with a proven track record of financial responsibility, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,029 DM to purchase a used car. I am Peter Weber, a 29-year-old IT specialist at Deutsche Telekom, where I have worked for 4.5 years. I have resided at my current address in Hamburg for 2 years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance under 100 DM. My credit history is positive, with all previous credit obligations paid back promptly. I have no other debts, nor do I have any guarantors.

I have a steady income, and the proposed installment rate is reasonable for my budget. I need the car to support my work commitments, as my job occasionally requires travel to client sites not accessible by public transport.

I am a reliable and trustworthy candidate with a proven record of financial responsibility. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Peter Weber
