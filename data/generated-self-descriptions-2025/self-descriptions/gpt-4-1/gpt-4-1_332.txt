Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Karl Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 6,615 DM to purchase a used car. I am a retired scientific research assistant, having worked for 8 years at the Max Planck Institute before retiring. Since then, I have been unemployed, but I continue to support my adult son, who lives with me.

Currently, my financial situation is modest. My checking account is overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I do not own any property, but I have lived in my current residence for four years, rent-free, thanks to a family arrangement. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being paid regularly, and I have a critical account at another institution due to prior medical expenses.

Despite these challenges, I am a trustworthy candidate. My background in research has taught me discipline and responsibility, and my credit at your bank has always been managed diligently. The car is essential for my daily activities and for assisting my son with medical appointments. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2 and fulfill my obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Karl Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Friedrich Müller, and I wish to apply for a loan of 6,615 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I am a retired school principal with 12 years of management experience, currently unemployed due to age. I support my granddaughter, who lives with me as my dependent.

My financial status is currently strained; my checking account is in deficit, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have no property or assets, but I have maintained my current residence for the past four years without rent, as my late wife’s family owns the property. I have two existing credits at your bank, both serviced on time, and a critical account at another bank due to a business I attempted post-retirement.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate because of my proven record of leadership and integrity. The car will allow me to remain independent and support my granddaughter’s needs. I have always made my installment payments on time and can assure you of my commitment to meeting this obligation as well.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Friedrich Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Hans Richter, and I am seeking a loan of 6,615 DM to purchase a used car. I spent 15 years as a self-employed accountant before retiring. I have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I care for due to his disability.

Unfortunately, my current financial situation is difficult. My checking account is negative, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I do not own property, but I have resided at my current address for four years without paying rent, as it is owned by a family friend. I have two active credits with your bank, both in good standing, and a critical account elsewhere from a previous business venture.

Despite these issues, I am confident in my reliability. My long career as an accountant has instilled in me a strong sense of fiscal responsibility. The car is essential for taking my brother to medical appointments and for managing our daily needs. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and will ensure timely repayment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Hans Richter

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Dieter Schulte, and I am applying for a loan of 6,615 DM for the purchase of a used car. I am a retired police officer, having served for 20 years before retiring. I am currently unemployed and support my adult daughter, who has special needs.

Presently, my finances are under strain, with my checking account below zero and savings of less than 100 DM. I have lived at my current address for four years, rent-free, as part of a family arrangement. I have two credits with your bank that I am repaying steadily, and a critical account with another institution due to past medical bills.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my service record and reputation in the community. The car is necessary for transportation to my daughter’s therapy and for daily errands. I have always honored my commitments and will continue to do so with this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Dieter Schulte

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Otto Braun, and I am requesting a loan of 6,615 DM to purchase a used car. I am a retired civil engineer, previously employed for 10 years in municipal infrastructure projects. I am currently unemployed and support my nephew, who lives with me as my dependent.

At present, my checking account is overdrawn, and I have under 100 DM in savings. I have no property, but I have lived in my current home for four years without paying rent, as it is provided by a close friend. I have two existing loans at your bank, both serviced regularly, and a critical account elsewhere from a failed investment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Otto Braun
