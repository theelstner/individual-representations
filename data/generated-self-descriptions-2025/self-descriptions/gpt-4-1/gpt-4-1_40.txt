Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Marko Petrovic, and I am applying for a loan of 1,225 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances for my new apartment. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years, and my monthly salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account with your bank for over a year now.

I have always taken my financial responsibilities seriously. I previously took out a small credit for a laptop, which I repaid in full and on time. My current savings are below 100 DM, as I recently had to cover relocation expenses when I moved to Munich for my job. I do not have any guarantors or co-debtors, and I have no other outstanding loans.

I am single, 29 years old, and a foreign worker from Serbia. My residence in Munich has been stable for the past two years. I own a car, which helps me commute to work. I have always honored my financial commitments, and my employment with a reputable institution ensures regular income. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 2 DM.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Masry, and I am seeking a loan of 1,225 DM to purchase a washing machine and refrigerator for my new apartment.

I am single, 32 years old, and have been residing in Stuttgart for the past two years. I own a used Opel Astra, which is my only significant property.

As a foreign worker from Egypt, I am committed to building a stable life in Germany. I have no dependents, no guarantors, and no other outstanding debts.

Best regards,
