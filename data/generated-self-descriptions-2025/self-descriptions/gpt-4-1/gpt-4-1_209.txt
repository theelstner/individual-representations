Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,424 DM for the purpose of purchasing essential domestic appliances for my home. I am a 26-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My employment is stable and I have a reliable monthly income.

At present, I have one small credit with your bank, which I am repaying regularly. While my credit history includes a previous critical account at another institution, I have since taken significant steps to improve my financial management. My current checking account balance is modest (under 200 DM) and my savings are limited, but I am committed to meeting my financial obligations.

I own my residence, have no other installment plans, and support one dependent. My property includes a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning. I am applying for this loan to replace outdated appliances, which will improve my family's quality of life and energy efficiency at home.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the 12-month period and hope you will consider my application favorably. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Khan, and I am seeking a loan of 1,424 DM to purchase necessary domestic appliances. I am a 26-year-old single male, working as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for over 4 years. My employment is secure, and I have a steady income.

I currently have one existing credit at your bank, which I am servicing without issue. While my credit history includes a critical account with another institution, I have learned from past mistakes and now manage my finances responsibly. My checking account and savings are currently below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively, as I recently invested in minor home repairs.

I have lived at my current address for three years and own my home, where I live with my younger brother, whom I support. My only property is a life insurance policy, which I keep up to date. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, responsible repayment history at your bank, and commitment to improving my financial situation. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,424 DM to purchase new domestic appliances for my household. My name is Ivan Popov, a 26-year-old single male. I have been employed as a telecommunications technician at Deutsche Telekom for the past six years, providing me with a regular and secure income.

Though I have a critical account on my credit history from a previous loan at another bank, I have since maintained a positive repayment record with your institution, where I hold one active credit. My current financial resources are limited, as my checking account balance is less than 200 DM and my savings are under 100 DM.

I own my home, where I reside with my young son. My assets include a building society savings agreement, showing my commitment to future financial stability. I have lived at my present address for three years and have no other debts or installment plans.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate over the 12-month loan period. I hope you will see my improved financial behavior and steady employment as evidence of my trustworthiness. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Popov
