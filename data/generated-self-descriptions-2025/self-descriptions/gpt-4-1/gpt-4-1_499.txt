Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Alexander Petrov, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,585 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my residence. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, where I have been employed for the past 5 years. I have lived at my current address for 3 years and am a single father to my 8-year-old son.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained two credits with you in good standing. My savings are limited, with less than 100 DM in my savings account, as most of my income goes towards supporting my child and maintaining our home. However, I do have a life insurance policy, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

I have no other debtors or guarantors, nor do I have other installment plans. My credit history includes some critical accounts, but I have consistently met my obligations for the last 24 months. I am confident that my stable employment and residence, as well as my status as a skilled professional, make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Alexander Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 1,585 DM to purchase new office equipment and furniture. I am a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority, with 6 years of continuous employment. I am 40 years old, single, and have a 10-year-old daughter whom I support.

I currently do not have a checking account with your bank but do hold two existing credits in good standing. My savings are minimal, as I have less than 100 DM set aside, but I hold a building society savings agreement as part of my long-term financial planning. I have lived in my own apartment for 3 years and have no other installment plans or guarantors.

While my credit history is not perfect, I have always honored my repayment agreements. As a foreign worker in Germany, I have worked hard to build a stable life for myself and my child. My steady employment and responsible approach to my finances make me a strong candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,585 DM to furnish my home and purchase necessary equipment. My name is Ahmed Hassan, and I am a skilled mechanical technician at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 4 years. I am a single man, aged 40, with one dependent—my 12-year-old nephew, whom I have been raising since my brother’s passing.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have two existing credits with your institution, both in good standing. My savings are currently under 100 DM, as I prioritize supporting my family member and maintaining our home, which I own. I also hold a life insurance policy as part of my financial safety net.

I have resided at my current address for 3 years and have no other debts or installment plans. My credit history includes some past difficulties, but I have demonstrated responsibility in managing my obligations over the last 24 months. My steady employment and long-term residence reflect my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Hassan

Yours faithfully,
