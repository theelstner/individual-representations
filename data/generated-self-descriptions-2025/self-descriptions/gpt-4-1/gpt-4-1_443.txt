Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elif Demir, and I am applying for a loan of 1,620 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am 30 years old, married, and have one child. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich for the past three years. My co-applicant is my husband, who is also employed full-time.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, and I maintain a small life insurance policy as a form of financial security. My savings are limited, but my employment is stable, and I have no other installment plans or outstanding debts besides the one credit at your bank, which I am managing responsibly.

We have owned our residence for three years, which gives us a stable living environment. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2 and would be grateful for your support. Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling all obligations related to this loan.

Sincerely,  
Elif Demir

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marta Kowalska, a 30-year-old divorced mother of one, currently working as a certified dental hygienist at a local clinic for the past two years. I am seeking a loan of 1,620 DM to purchase new appliances and basic furniture after moving into my own apartment three years ago.

Although my checking account is presently below zero and my savings are minimal, I have a solid history of paying back previous loans on time. I have a building society savings agreement in place as a measure for future security. My co-applicant, my sister, will also support this application, ensuring additional financial stability.

I have no other installment plans and only one existing credit at your bank, which I am managing well. Owning my home has given me a sense of responsibility, and I am committed to meeting the agreed installment payments. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Marta Kowalska
