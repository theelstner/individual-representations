Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,499 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past three years. My current financial situation is somewhat strained, as my checking account balance is below zero and my savings are less than 100 DM. However, I own my home and a small piece of real estate, which demonstrates my commitment to financial stability.

The new car is essential for my daily commute to the institute and for managing my responsibilities as a single mother to my 6-year-old daughter. I have a co-applicant, my sister, who has stable employment and is willing to support my application. Although I have two existing credits at your bank, I have always made my installment payments on time, and I am confident that I can manage this additional loan with my current salary.

As a dedicated employee and a responsible parent, I am committed to meeting my financial obligations. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Letter 2 – Registered Nurse

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,499 DM to purchase a new vehicle, which is necessary for my job as a registered nurse at St. Joseph’s Hospital. I have been with the hospital for just over two years and have demonstrated reliability and professionalism in my role. My current account is overdrawn, and my savings are minimal, but I own my apartment and a small plot in the countryside.

As a divorced mother of an 8-year-old son, reliable transportation is crucial to fulfilling my shift duties, especially during nights and weekends when public transport is unavailable. I have a co-applicant, my cousin, who is also a hospital employee and will support the repayment process. Although I have two other credits at your bank and a critical credit history, I have consistently made payments and have no other installment plans.

I am committed to improving my financial situation and believe that this car will enable me to continue supporting my family and fulfilling my responsibilities as a healthcare worker. I would greatly appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,499 DM to purchase a new car. I am a civil engineer at BauProjekt GmbH and have held this position for three years. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, but I own both my home and a small piece of real estate.

I am married with one young child and, as a foreign worker, reliable transportation is essential for my work on various construction sites across the region. My spouse, who is also employed, is my co-applicant and will help ensure timely repayment. While I have two existing credits at your bank and a challenging credit history, I have maintained regular installment payments and have no other outstanding installment plans.

I am dedicated to my profession and my family, and I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

I am applying for a 3,499 DM loan to purchase a new car. I am a high school teacher at Goethe Gymnasium, where I have been employed for almost four years. Although my checking account is currently negative and my savings are low, I am a property owner and have lived at my current residence for two years.

As a married woman with a 5-year-old daughter, reliable transportation is vital for both my work and family life. My husband, who works as an accountant, is my co-applicant. Despite having two existing credits at your bank and a difficult credit history, I have always prioritized my financial obligations and have no other installment plans.

I am committed to maintaining my excellent work record and supporting my family. I kindly ask for your trust and support in this matter.
