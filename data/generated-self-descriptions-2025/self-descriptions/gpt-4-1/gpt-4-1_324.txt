Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 2,910 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My employment is stable and well-compensated, and I have always made sure to fulfill my financial obligations punctually. 

Although my checking and savings accounts have limited funds at the moment due to recent unexpected expenses related to my child’s medical care, I have a strong history of repaying credits on time. I already have one credit with your bank, which I have always serviced reliably. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my living situation is stable as I reside in a family-owned apartment rent-free.

The car is essential for commuting to work and managing responsibilities as a single father. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, given my secure employment and responsible financial history. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,910 DM for the purchase of a used vehicle. My name is Dragan Petrovic, and I am a project manager at Siemens AG, a position I have held for 6 years. My employment is secure, and I have consistently demonstrated my reliability by paying back all previous credits on schedule.

Currently, my bank accounts are low due to recent investments in professional development courses. I have no property assets, but I have always managed my finances responsibly, with no outstanding debts or installment plans except for one existing credit at your bank, which I am servicing without issue.

A car is crucial for my work as I frequently need to travel between project sites. As a single father with one dependent, reliable transportation is also vital for my family. I believe my track record and professional standing make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

To whom it may concern,

My name is Jan Schulte, and I am applying for a 2,910 DM loan to purchase a used car. I am currently a self-employed IT consultant, a role I have maintained for 4 years. My business is stable, and I have a steady stream of clients, which ensures regular income.

Though my current account balance is below zero, this is a temporary situation resulting from the recent purchase of new equipment for my business. I have always paid back my credits on time, including one current loan with your bank. I have no other debts and live rent-free in an apartment owned by my brother, which keeps my monthly expenses low.

As a single parent with one child, having a reliable car is necessary for both business and personal responsibilities. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and appreciate your trust in my application.

Sincerely,  
Jan Schulte
