Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is István Nagy, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,344 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 43-year-old Hungarian national residing in Munich, where I have been living for the past two years. I work as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for three years. My job provides a stable income, and I am committed to maintaining my employment in Germany.

Currently, my financial situation is challenging. My checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have two existing credits with your bank, which I am repaying regularly, although I did experience delays in the past due to unexpected medical expenses for my children. However, I have since adjusted my budget and all payments are now up to date.

The car is essential for my job and for transporting my two children to school and other activities. I own my apartment and some real estate in my home country, which I believe demonstrates my commitment and reliability. I have no other debts or installment plans and no guarantors.

I am confident that with the new car, my ability to work overtime and provide for my family will improve. I assure you of my dedication to honoring all my financial commitments, and I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
István Nagy

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, a 43-year-old Egyptian working as a janitor at a residential complex in Stuttgart for almost two years. I am applying for a loan of 1,344 DM to buy a new car, which is crucial for commuting to work and supporting my two children, who live with me.

My current financial situation is tight. My checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are minimal. I have two small credits at your bank, which I am repaying, though I did have delays last year due to a temporary loss of part-time work. Since then, I have stabilized my income and have not missed any payments.

I own my apartment and a small piece of land in Egypt. I have no other debts or installment plans. I believe that with a reliable car, I can expand my work hours and possibly take on additional cleaning jobs, thus improving my financial standing.

Although my credit history is not perfect, I am determined to improve it and can provide proof of my steady employment. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations. I hope you will see me as a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Banking Team,

I am Marko Petrovic, a 43-year-old Serbian citizen, and I am requesting a loan of 1,344 DM to purchase a new car. I have lived in Frankfurt for two years and work as a construction helper at BauService GmbH, where I have been employed for just over one year.

My financial resources are currently limited, with my checking account in negative balance and savings of less than 100 DM. I have two ongoing credits at your bank, which I am actively repaying. I acknowledge there were delays in the past due to an accident that left me temporarily unable to work, but since returning to full employment, my payments have been punctual.

Owning a car will enable me to accept more job offers and transport my children to daycare. I own my apartment and a small plot of land in Serbia, which adds to my financial stability. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and believe this loan will help me improve my family’s quality of life. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Yuriy Ivanov, a 43-year-old Ukrainian living in Hamburg for two years. I am employed as a night shift cleaner at a hospital, a job I have held for just over three years. I am seeking a loan of 1,344 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for getting to work at odd hours and for my two children’s needs.

Currently, my financial situation is strained. My checking account is below zero and my savings are under 100 DM. I have two existing credits at your bank, which I am repaying. Admittedly, I was late on some payments last year due to unexpected expenses, but I have since stabilized my finances.

I own my apartment and a small house in Ukraine. I do not have any other debts or installment plans. A new car will help me maintain my job and, in the future, increase my income by working additional shifts.

I am committed to meeting my obligations and respectfully request your support.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Yuriy Ivanov
