Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Anna Keller, and I am applying for a business loan of 2,528 DM to support the opening of my own scientific research consultancy. I am a 32-year-old divorced mother of two, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 10 months.

While my current checking and savings accounts hold less than 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively, I have a strong record of managing my finances responsibly, including paying back my previous credit at your bank on time. My current income is stable, and my housing is secure, as I own my own apartment.

I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance policy, which further demonstrates my commitment to financial planning. I have no other debts or installment plans and am the sole provider for my children. My business plan is sound, and I am confident in my ability to make timely loan repayments. I am reachable by phone at any time to discuss my application.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Stefanie Bauer, and I am writing to request a loan of 2,528 DM to expand my small bakery, "Bauer’s Brot," which I established last year. I am a 32-year-old married woman with two children, and I have been working as a certified pastry chef for the past 11 months.

Despite having less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings, I have always managed to pay back my previous loan on time and have no outstanding debts. My bakery has seen a steady increase in customers, and this loan would allow me to purchase a new oven and additional inventory.

I own my home, have a life insurance policy, and have been a responsible customer of your bank with one existing credit paid off duly. I am confident that the bakery’s growing revenue will allow me to meet the installment payments without issue.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available by phone should you need further information.

Best regards,  
Stefanie Bauer
