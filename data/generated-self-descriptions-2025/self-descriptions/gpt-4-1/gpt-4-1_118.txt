Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,174 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. My name is Maria Schneider, and I am a divorced woman currently employed as a senior project manager at a logistics firm in Frankfurt, where I have worked for five years. Despite my current checking account being slightly overdrawn, I have an excellent credit record, with all previous loans paid back on time. 

I do not have a savings account at the moment, as I have recently invested in a reliable used car to facilitate my daily commute. I have been living at my current residence for three years and do not have any other outstanding debts or guarantors. My monthly income comfortably covers my living expenses and the proposed installment rate for this loan. 

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan in a timely manner, as my position is stable and my career continues to progress. I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate, and I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Maria Schneider
