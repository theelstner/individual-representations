Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,376 DM to purchase a new television for my household. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for 5 years and have demonstrated a consistent and reliable work history. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly and have always repaid my existing credits on time.

My current savings account holds 700 DM, which I have built up through careful budgeting. I have no guarantors or co-debtors, and I have always managed my financial obligations independently. My present residence is in Berlin, where I have lived for just over a year, and I own a small car as my primary property.

As a married woman with one dependent, I am committed to providing a stable and comfortable home. I have no other installment plans except for a small furniture installment that will be completed in 28 months. I am confident that my stable employment and history of responsible credit management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Lena Hoffmann

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schulz, and I am seeking a loan of 1,376 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my family. I have been working as a primary school teacher in Stuttgart for the past 6 years, and my employment is secure and long-term.

I have a savings account with 950 DM and have always paid back my previous credits on time. I am divorced, with two children, and I am the sole provider for my household. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors and prefer to handle my finances independently.

I have resided at my current address for just over a year and own a reliable car. While I do not currently have a checking account, I have always managed my budget carefully and have a good track record with credit repayments. My only other installment plan is for a kitchen appliance, which will be paid off in 28 months.

I believe my steady employment, reliable credit history, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Schulz
