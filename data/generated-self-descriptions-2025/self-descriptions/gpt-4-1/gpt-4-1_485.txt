Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 960 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 30-year-old married woman and have been working as a certified laboratory technician at the Frankfurt Medical Research Institute for the past 5 years. I have lived at my current address for 2 years and own my home.

While I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with over 1,000 DM. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are being paid regularly. Although I have experienced a delay in repayment in the past, I have since stabilized my finances and can assure you of my commitment to timely payments moving forward.

I have one dependent and no other debts or guarantors. My employment is stable, and I hold a building society savings agreement as additional security. As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to establishing a strong financial foundation in Germany. The loan will be used solely to furnish my home, creating a safe and comfortable environment for my child and me.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my steady employment and financial discipline make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Kind regards,  
Anna Petrova
