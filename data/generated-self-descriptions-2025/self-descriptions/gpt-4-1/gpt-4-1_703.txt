Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Schreiber, and I am applying for a loan of 6,331 DM to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, where I have built a strong reputation for reliability and diligence. My current financial situation is somewhat strained, as my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have managed to consistently meet my financial obligations, despite having two existing credits at your bank and a critical account history.

The car is essential for commuting to my workplace and for taking care of my 12-year-old son, who lives with me. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and I have lived at my current address for 4 years, enjoying stable, free housing. My long-term employment and responsible handling of previous loans demonstrate my trustworthiness. I am confident that with this car, I can further stabilize my financial situation and continue to provide for my family.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Schreiber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,331 DM to purchase a used vehicle. My name is Stefan Müller, and I have worked as a senior technical specialist at Siemens for 9 years. While my current account is overdrawn and I have limited savings, my employment has been stable and my salary reliable. I do have a critical account history and existing credit elsewhere, but I have always prioritized loan payments.

I currently live rent-free in a family-owned apartment, which reduces my monthly expenses significantly. As a single father to a teenage daughter, reliable transportation is crucial for both my job and family commitments. I have no dependents other than my daughter and no other installment plans. My responsible employment record and consistent payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Stefan Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 6,331 DM to finance the purchase of a used car. I have been employed as a customs officer for the past 8 years, earning a steady income. Unfortunately, my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are minimal, less than 100 DM. I am aware that my credit history is marked as critical, and I have two existing credits at your institution.

Despite these challenges, I have always honored my commitments and kept up with installment payments. I have resided at my current address for four years and benefit from living rent-free, which allows me to allocate more resources to loan repayment. As a single parent with one dependent, reliable transportation is necessary for both my professional duties and family needs.

I am committed to repaying this loan and believe my stable job and history of responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker
