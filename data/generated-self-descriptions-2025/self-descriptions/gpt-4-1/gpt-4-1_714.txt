Letter 1  
From: Martin Schäfer, Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €2,476 to purchase a used car. I am a 46-year-old single father living in my own home in Stuttgart, with my 14-year-old son as my dependent. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years.

I currently do not have a checking or savings account, but I have a solid credit history, having always repaid my previous loans on time, including one existing credit at your bank. My current residence has been my home for the last 4 years, and I own the property outright. My employment is stable and well-paid, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

The car is essential for my daily commute and for transporting my son to his extracurricular activities, as public transport options in our area are limited. I am committed to managing the monthly installments responsibly, as I have always done in the past. My stable job, property ownership, and history of timely payments make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Martin Schäfer

From: Thomas Weber, Small Business Owner

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a loan of €2,476 to purchase a reliable used car for my small landscaping business. I am 46 years old, single, and have one dependent—my 10-year-old daughter. I have owned my home for 4 years and have been self-employed for the past 9 years, operating my business successfully from the same location.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, my credit record is strong: all my previous credits, including one with your bank, have been paid back on schedule. I currently have no other loans or installment plans, and my income from the business is steady throughout the year.

The car will be used for client visits and transporting equipment, which is vital for expanding my services. My financial discipline, property ownership, and long-standing business experience demonstrate my reliability and ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Weber
