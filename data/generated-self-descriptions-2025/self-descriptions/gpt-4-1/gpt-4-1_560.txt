Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 3,552 DM for the purpose of purchasing new furniture and equipment for my apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years, and my position is stable and permanent. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn due to recent unexpected expenses, and my savings are limited, but I have always paid back all previous credits from your bank on time and in full.

I have lived at my current residence for 4 years and have no other debts or guarantors. My only property is my car, which is fully paid off and in good condition. As a single male, I manage my finances independently and responsibly. I am confident that my steady income and proven record of repaying loans make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 3,552 DM to purchase essential home equipment and furniture as I recently moved into a new apartment. I have been a skilled employee at Siemens AG for 6 years, where I work as an electronics technician. My account is currently slightly negative due to moving costs, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, but I have always repaid my loans at your bank reliably.

I have no dependents or other debts, and I have lived in my current home for 4 years. I own a car, which is my only property. I have demonstrated financial responsibility over the years, and my employment is secure. I believe this loan will help improve my living situation and allow me to continue my professional development.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker
