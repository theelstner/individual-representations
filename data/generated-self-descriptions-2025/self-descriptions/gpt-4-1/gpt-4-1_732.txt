To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Stefan Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 6,403 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute, where I have been working for the past 10 months. Although my employment is still within my first year, I am on a permanent contract and my prospects are secure.

Currently, my checking account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are limited, with less than 100 DM available. I have experienced some delays in paying off credit in the past, primarily due to unexpected medical expenses last year. However, I have since taken steps to manage my finances more responsibly and have not missed any recent payments.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have been living at my current address for two years. I own a used Volkswagen Golf, which serves as my primary property. I am single with no dependents, and I have my own credit at your bank with a good track record apart from the aforementioned delays.

I am a skilled employee and take pride in my work ethic and reliability. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan because I have a stable job, a clear plan for repayment, and a commitment to improving my financial habits. The purchase of a radio and television will allow me to keep informed and entertained, especially as I often work long hours and value quality downtime.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information you may require.

Sincerely,
Stefan Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Becker, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,403 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my apartment. I am currently a junior systems administrator at Siemens AG, a position I have held for 8 months. My employment is stable, with opportunities for advancement.

I acknowledge that my checking account and savings are both below 200 DM and 100 DM respectively. I had a delay in repaying a previous credit due to a brief period of unemployment, but since securing my current role, I have been consistent with all my financial obligations.

I live alone, have no dependents, and do not have any other outstanding debts. I have resided at my current address for two years and own a small car, a 2016 Opel Corsa. My credit at your bank is managed solely by myself, and I am diligent in keeping track of all payments.

As a skilled employee, I understand the importance of financial responsibility. I am requesting this loan to improve my quality of life and enhance my home environment. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the agreed period and would be grateful for your consideration.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Best regards,
