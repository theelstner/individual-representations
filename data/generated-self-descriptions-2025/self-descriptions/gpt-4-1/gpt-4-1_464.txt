Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,017 DM to furnish my recently rented apartment and purchase necessary equipment for my home office. My name is Maria Petrova, a 34-year-old divorced woman, and I have been working as a scientific research assistant at Heidelberg University for the past 10 months. 

My financial situation is stable: I have an existing checking account with a balance under 200 DM and a savings account with less than 100 DM, as I have recently relocated to Germany as a foreign researcher. Despite this, I have always paid back my previous credits on time, including my current loan with your bank, which is in good standing. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am a responsible borrower with real estate property in my home country, which demonstrates my commitment to financial obligations. My current employment contract is expected to be renewed, and my income is sufficient to cover the monthly installment rate of 3. 

I kindly ask you to consider my application, as this loan will help me create a comfortable and productive environment for myself and my young daughter. I am confident in my ability to manage this responsibility and continue my positive credit history with your institution.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Aisha Khan, and I am a 34-year-old married woman currently working as a self-employed interior designer. I am applying for a loan of 3,017 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment, which I have rented since moving to Munich a year ago with my son.

I have been self-employed for the past nine months, and although my checking and savings accounts are modest due to initial business investments, I have consistently repaid all previous credits, including one currently held at your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I own real estate in my home country, which provides me with additional financial security. My business is steadily growing, and I am confident that my monthly income is sufficient to meet the installment rate of 3.

I assure you of my reliability and commitment to honoring my financial responsibilities. This loan will greatly assist me in establishing a stable home and work environment as I continue to build my life and business in Germany.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Aisha Khan

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,017 DM for the purpose of purchasing furniture and home office equipment. My name is Elena Smirnova, a 34-year-old separated woman and a newly appointed project manager at a local logistics company, where I have been employed for the past 11 months.

Since relocating to Frankfurt a year ago, I have been renting an apartment and supporting my young son.

I own real estate abroad, which demonstrates my long-term financial stability. I have no other debts or installment plans and am fully committed to meeting the monthly installment of 3 DM.

I am a responsible and trustworthy client, and I believe that this loan will enable me to establish a comfortable home for my family and continue my professional development.
