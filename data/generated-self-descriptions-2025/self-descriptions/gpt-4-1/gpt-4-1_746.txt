Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 14,179 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new home. I am a 30-year-old single male, currently working as a research and development manager at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for the past 5 years. My current financial situation is challenging, as my checking account is currently overdrawn, and I do not have a savings account. However, I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations and have maintained two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being repaid on time.

I have lived at my current residence for four years and own my home, which provides stability for me and my 7-year-old son, whom I support as my sole dependent. I also hold a building society savings agreement, demonstrating my commitment to long-term financial planning. While I have other credits with institutions outside your bank, I have never defaulted on a payment and am actively managing my debts.

Given my stable employment, ownership of my home, and history of responsible credit management, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I am requesting this loan to improve my living conditions and further support my family. I appreciate your consideration and am available for any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Martin Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Alexander Schmidt, and I am a 30-year-old single father, currently self-employed as an IT consultant for the past 6 years. I am applying for a loan of 14,179 DM to purchase necessary equipment and furniture for my expanding home office, which will allow me to increase my client base and income.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to recent investments in my business, and I do not have a savings account. Despite this, I have been diligent in maintaining my financial commitments, including two ongoing loans at your bank that are in good standing. I have also resided in my own apartment for four years and have a life insurance policy in place.

While my credit history includes a critical account, I have learned from past financial challenges and have taken significant steps to improve my situation. My business is growing steadily, and I am confident that the additional investment in equipment will further enhance my earning capacity.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to repaying the loan on time and am available for any further discussion.

Best regards,  
Alexander Schmidt
