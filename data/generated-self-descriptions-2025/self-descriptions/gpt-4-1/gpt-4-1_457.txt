Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,679 DM to purchase a reliable used car. My name is Sarah Klein, I am 29 years old, divorced, and have one child. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at Technische Universität München for the past 8 months. 

Although I have not yet opened a checking account, I have a savings account with a modest balance. I have held a previous credit with your bank and have always made my payments on time. Currently, I have no other debts or installment plans.

Owning a car is essential for me to manage my daily commute and take care of my child’s needs. My financial situation is stable, and my employment at the university is secure. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations, as I have demonstrated in the past.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Sarah Klein
