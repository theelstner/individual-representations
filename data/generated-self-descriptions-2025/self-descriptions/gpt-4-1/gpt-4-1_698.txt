Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,103 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a 29-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My current checking account balance is modest, but I have always managed my finances responsibly and have a clean credit history with all existing credits paid back on time.

I own my own home and have a small amount in savings, less than 100 DM, as most of my resources have been dedicated to supporting my 6-year-old daughter, whom I care for as a single parent. I have lived at my current residence for 3 years and am proud to say that I also own a small piece of real estate nearby, which adds to my financial stability.

I currently have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are being repaid according to the agreed schedule. My brother has kindly agreed to act as a guarantor for this loan. I am committed to continuing my excellent repayment record and am confident that my stable employment and assets make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Andreas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,103 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my apartment. I am a 29-year-old single man, working as a skilled machinist at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 6 years. My checking and savings accounts are quite limited, as I am the primary caregiver for my 4-year-old son, but I have never missed a payment on my current loans.

I own my apartment and a small plot of land inherited from my father. I have resided at my current address for 3 years and have no other installment plans except for my two current credits with your bank. My uncle is willing to act as a guarantor for this loan, which further demonstrates my reliability.

Despite my low cash reserves, I am diligent in my financial obligations and have a strong employment record. I believe this loan will improve my family’s quality of life and I am fully committed to meeting the repayment terms.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Jens Bauer

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,103 DM to purchase a new television and radio, which will greatly enhance the comfort of my home for myself and my 7-year-old son. I am 29 years old, single, and have been employed as a civil servant in the local government for the past 4 years.

Although my checking and savings accounts are currently under 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, my financial discipline is reflected in my perfect credit history. I own a small house and a piece of real estate, and I have resided here for 3 years. I currently have two loans with your bank, both of which are in good standing, and my cousin will serve as a guarantor for this application.

I do not have any other installment plans or outstanding debts, and my stable employment and property ownership make me confident in my ability to repay this loan without issue.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Felix Schneider

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,103 DM to buy a new television and radio for my home. I am a 29-year-old single man, working as a laboratory technician at Bayer AG for the past 5 years. My checking account currently holds less than 200 DM and my savings are below 100 DM, as most of my income goes towards supporting my 5-year-old daughter.

I have lived in my own home for 3 years and also own a small parcel of land outside the city. My credit history is excellent; I have always repaid my two existing credits with your bank on time. My older brother has agreed to be my guarantor for this loan.

With my steady employment, responsible financial history, and property ownership, I believe I am a strong and trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Yours faithfully,
