Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kowalska, and I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 609 DM. I have recently separated from my husband and am currently living with my young son in an apartment I own. I have been employed for the past 7 months as a kitchen assistant at a local catering service, and my salary has been regularly deposited into my checking account for over a year.

I am seeking this loan to start a small home-based bakery, which I believe will allow me to support my family and build a secure future. Although I have only been in my current job for less than a year, I have demonstrated responsibility by paying off my previous loan with your bank on time. My savings are limited, but I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate of 4 DM due to my stable employment and low expenses.

As a property owner with a consistent payment history and no other debts or guarantors, I am committed to meeting my financial obligations. I kindly request your support in helping me achieve my goal of financial independence and stability for my family.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kowalska

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Hana Petrova, and I am applying for a 609 DM business loan to launch a tailoring service from my home. I am 26 years old, married, and have lived in my current residence for one year. I own my home and have one dependent child.

After recently arriving in Germany as a foreign worker, I have been working as a seasonal agricultural laborer for the past 9 months, with my salary consistently deposited into my checking account for over a year. My employment is stable, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I have previously taken a loan from your bank and repaid it in full and on time, demonstrating my reliability. My savings are modest, but I am determined to expand my skills and income by starting my own business. My property serves as additional security, and I am fully committed to fulfilling my obligations.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to work with your bank.

Kind regards,  
Hana Petrova
