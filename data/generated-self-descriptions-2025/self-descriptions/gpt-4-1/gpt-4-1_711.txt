Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Istvan Kovacs, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,118 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Bayer Logistics for the past three years, and I am currently living in my own apartment, which I own. I am 37 years old, single, and have two children who live with me.

My financial situation is stable, though modest. My checking account typically has a low balance (currently under 200 DM), and my savings are limited to less than 100 DM. However, I have a reliable income from my employment and have always paid back my previous credit from your bank on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not supporting any other relatives besides my two children.

I am requesting this loan to purchase a television, which will provide both educational and recreational benefits for my family. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my clean credit history, responsible repayment behavior, and stable employment. I am confident I will be able to meet the installment payments without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Istvan Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Piotr Nowak, and I am seeking a loan of 2,118 DM to buy a new radio and television set for my household. I am 37 years old, single, with two dependents, and I have been employed as a janitor at Siemens AG for two and a half years. I am a foreign worker residing in Germany for the last two years, and I own my residence.

Although my savings are limited (less than 100 DM), and my checking account balance is modest, I have demonstrated financial responsibility by repaying my previous credit with your bank in full and on time. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

The new radio and television will help my children with their German language skills and keep us connected to our new community. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my job provides a steady income and I have a strong record of meeting my financial obligations.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Best regards,
Piotr Nowak
