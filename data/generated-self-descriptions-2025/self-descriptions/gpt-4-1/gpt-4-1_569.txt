Letter 1

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Daniel Weber, and I am a 34-year-old single male employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich for the past eight years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,578 DM to purchase a new television and radio system for my apartment.

Although I do not currently hold a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance above 1,000 DM and have managed my finances responsibly. My credit history includes a previous loan for a car, which I am repaying punctually at another financial institution. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my installment rate is moderate, which I believe demonstrates my commitment to meeting my financial obligations.

I have lived at my current residence for two years and rely on my car for commuting. I have no dependents and no other installment plans apart from my current obligations. As a skilled professional with a stable income and a strong record of employment, I am confident in my ability to repay the requested loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require and look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Weber
