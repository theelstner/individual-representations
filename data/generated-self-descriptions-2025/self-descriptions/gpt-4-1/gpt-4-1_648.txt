Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,583 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for three years. As a divorced father of one, I am working hard to provide a stable environment for my child.

My financial situation is currently tight, with my checking and savings accounts both under 100 DM, as my recent move and legal expenses have depleted my reserves. Despite this, I have always managed my finances responsibly: I have never defaulted on a loan, and my two existing credits at your bank are being paid on time.

I am a permanent resident, owning my home and holding real estate assets. My guarantor, a respected colleague, further supports my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my employment is secure and my monthly salary is stable.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 4,583 DM to furnish my home with necessary equipment, as I recently relocated after my separation. I am a certified electrician with three years of steady employment at Siemens AG. My current financial resources are limited due to the costs of divorce and setting up a new household, and my checking account is currently overdrawn.

I have maintained an excellent credit history, with two loans at your bank—both of which are in good standing and have never been overdue. I own my residence and have real estate in my name, providing a solid base of security for the loan.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life for myself and my young daughter. My brother, who works as a bank manager, has agreed to act as guarantor. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan in a timely manner.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Andrej Novak

Letter 3

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 4,583 DM to purchase furniture and basic equipment for my new apartment. I am an administrative officer at the City Council of Stuttgart and have been with the department for just over two years. Following my recent separation, I have custody of my son and am working to provide a comfortable home for him.

My financial position is currently strained, with a negative balance in my checking account and minimal savings, due to moving expenses and legal fees. However, I have no outstanding debts aside from two ongoing credits with your bank, which I have always repaid punctually.

I own my home and have real estate assets, which I hope demonstrate my financial responsibility. My friend, a local business owner, has agreed to be my guarantor. I am committed to making all payments on time and believe my stable employment ensures my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Best regards,
Milan Jovanovic

Letter 4

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to seek a loan of 4,583 DM to buy essential furniture and appliances for my home. I am a skilled machinist at Bosch, with over one year of continuous employment. Since my divorce two years ago, I have been living with my son in our own house, which I own outright along with a small plot of land.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are below 100 DM due to the costs of moving and legal proceedings. Despite these challenges, I have maintained a perfect credit history, with no late payments on my two existing credits at your bank.

My cousin, who is a senior engineer, will act as my guarantor. I am committed to meeting my repayment obligations and believe my property ownership and stable job make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Petar Markovic

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a 4,583 DM loan to purchase furniture and equipment for my new residence. I have been employed as a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport for two years. After my separation, I have been focused on creating a stable environment for my child, whom I support fully.

My financial situation is currently challenging, with less than 100 DM in both my checking and savings accounts due to recent personal upheavals. However, I have a strong credit history, with two active loans at your institution that have always been repaid on schedule.

I own my home and possess real estate, which I hope reflects my financial stability. My brother-in-law, a reputable businessman, will serve as my guarantor. I am confident that my steady income and responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,
Ivan Petrov
