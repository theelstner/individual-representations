Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Bauer, and I am applying for a loan of 3,441 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have worked for three years. 

After my recent divorce, I relocated to a new residence and am now in need of basic furnishings and a laptop to continue my work effectively. My financial situation is stable: I have a checking account with a small balance (currently 110 DM) and a savings account with 230 DM. I have always paid back my previous credits on time and have no outstanding debts, aside from a manageable installment plan.

My co-applicant, my sister, is also employed and will support this application. Together, we are confident in our ability to meet the installment rate of 2 and manage the repayment over the proposed 30-month period. We have lived at our current address for four years and use our car as our main property. 

I am a reliable candidate with a proven track record of financial responsibility and steady employment. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Claudia Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martina Schneider, and I am writing to request a loan of 3,441 DM to purchase new office equipment and living room furniture for my home. I have been working as a certified administrative official at the City Council of Mannheim for two years and have maintained a consistent income during this time.

Currently, my checking account balance is 150 DM, and I have a savings bond worth 380 DM. I have always repaid my previous credits in full and on schedule. My husband, who is also employed, will act as my co-applicant for this loan.

We have lived at our current residence for four years, and our only major asset is our family car. Our monthly installment obligations are well within our means, and our total number of existing credits is limited to our rent payments. 

I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments, as demonstrated by my employment history and financial discipline. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
