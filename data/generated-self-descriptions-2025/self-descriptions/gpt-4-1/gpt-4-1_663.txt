Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 900 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Thomas Berger, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 2 years and 8 months. I am married and currently have no dependents.

I have maintained a checking account with your bank for the past year, though my current balance is below zero due to unexpected household expenses. I have no savings account at this time. However, I have always paid back my existing credits promptly, as my credit history with your institution will confirm.

A new car is essential for my daily commute to the university and for family needs, especially since my current vehicle is no longer reliable. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my property consists of my existing car, which I intend to trade in.

I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, as evidenced by my steady employment, responsible credit history, and commitment to meeting all financial obligations. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am applying for a 900 DM loan to purchase a new car. I have been working as a logistics coordinator at MainRiver Logistics for 3 years. I am a widower, living alone, and have no dependents.

My checking account with your bank is currently overdrawn due to recent medical bills, but I have always paid back any previous credits on time. I do not have a savings account, but I own my current car, which is now too unreliable for my job requirements.

A new car is crucial for my work, as I need to travel between warehouse sites regularly. I have no other debts, and I have always managed my finances responsibly. My employment is stable, and I have resided at my current address for the past 2 years.

I assure you of my commitment to repay the loan in full and on time. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Markus Klein

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 900 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. My name is Jens Hoffmann, married, age 35, and I have been employed as an IT systems administrator at DigitalWerk GmbH for 1 year and 6 months.

My financial situation is currently tight, as my checking account is in deficit due to moving expenses and settling into our new home. Despite this, I have a clean credit history and no outstanding debts. I do not have a savings account or bonds at present.

Reliable transportation is necessary for both my job and my family’s needs, especially as we have recently relocated and public transport is not convenient. I own my current car, which will be sold to help with the purchase.

Given my steady employment, history of timely repayments, and responsible financial behavior, I believe I am a suitable candidate for the requested loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your response.

Sincerely,  
Jens Hoffmann

Dear Bank Manager,

My job requires me to commute daily, and reliable transportation is essential. I have lived at my current residence for 2 years, and my employment is secure. I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments, as my income is stable.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,
