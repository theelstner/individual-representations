Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,530 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. My name is Dr. Maria Kovács, and I am a 38-year-old Hungarian national working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich. I have been employed in this position for the past 5 years, and my work is stable and well-compensated.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I maintain a small savings account with less than 100 DM. My residence in Munich has been stable for the past 4 years, and I am divorced with one dependent child. I have a car as my primary property and pay rent for my housing. I have some other credits, but none at your bank, and I have always made my payments on time, despite a critical credit history due to an unexpected medical emergency last year.

I am a responsible borrower with a consistent income, and I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 4 DM as proposed. My telephone is always reachable, and I am eager to establish a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Maria Kovács

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Petrescu, a 42-year-old Romanian citizen residing in Berlin for the past four years. I am currently self-employed, running a small import-export business. I am married with two children and am applying for a loan of 4,530 DM to purchase a high-quality radio and television for my family and for use in my business office.

While I do not have a checking account, I manage my finances through a small savings account. My business has been operational for 6 years, providing me with a steady income. I rent my apartment and own a car, which is essential for my business operations. Although I have existing credits with other institutions, I have maintained timely payments and have no guarantors or other debtors.

As a foreign worker, I am keen to demonstrate my reliability and commitment. I am reachable by telephone at all times and am confident that my financial stability and strong work ethic make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Anna Petrescu
