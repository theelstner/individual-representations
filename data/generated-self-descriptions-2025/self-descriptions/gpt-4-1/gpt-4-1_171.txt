Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 1,935 DM to support the expansion of my small consulting business. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My financial situation is stable: I own my home and a small real estate property, and I have always made timely payments on my existing credits at your bank.

Although my current checking and savings accounts are modest, this is due to my recent investment in business equipment and my ongoing responsibility to support my 6-year-old daughter. I have no other debtors or guarantors and have maintained my residence here for the past 4 years. My credit history includes some critical accounts, but I have never defaulted on a loan, and my official employment assures a steady income.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable job history, responsible financial management, and commitment to growing my business. I am confident this loan will help me increase my income and continue to meet all my obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martin Schulz. I am seeking a loan of 1,935 DM to purchase new machinery for my carpentry workshop, which I started three years ago. I have been a certified mechanical technician at Siemens AG for the past 9 years, and my employment is secure.

I am divorced and the sole provider for my 10-year-old son. While my current checking and savings balances are low, I have invested much of my personal funds into my business. I own my residence and a small rental property, and have lived at my current address for 4 years. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I am repaying on schedule. My credit history reflects a previous critical account, but I have resolved all issues and currently have no outstanding debts elsewhere.

I am dedicated, responsible, and have a proven record of meeting my financial commitments. I believe this loan will help me grow my business and improve my family’s future.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Martin Schulz

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Jens Meyer, a 31-year-old senior accountant at Deutsche Bahn, where I have worked for 8 years. I am applying for a 1,935 DM loan to launch a small online retail business specializing in eco-friendly products.

My finances are carefully managed, though my checking and savings accounts currently have limited funds due to recent investments in my business project. I own my home and a small piece of real estate, have lived at my address for 4 years, and have one dependent, my 7-year-old daughter. My credit history includes a critical account, but I have always fulfilled my repayment obligations and have no outstanding debts apart from two existing credits at your bank.

I am a reliable and stable candidate, with a long employment history and a clear plan to use the loan for business growth. I am committed to maintaining my excellent repayment record.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jens Meyer

I am divorced, with one child who lives with me. My checking and savings accounts are low because I recently purchased business software and equipment.

I have two existing credits at your bank, both in good standing, and no other installment plans or debts. While my credit history shows a critical account, I have resolved all issues and have always honored my commitments.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
