Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,329 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my household. I am a 45-year-old skilled employee working as a scientific research assistant at the Institute for Renewable Energy in Berlin, where I have been employed for 10 months. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. 

I have been living in my own home for one year and have one dependent, my teenage son. I am a divorced woman and, as a foreign worker, I have worked diligently to build a stable life here. I currently have one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid back on time. My real estate property is my main asset, and my financial commitments are well-managed, with no other installment plans or debts.

I am requesting this loan to improve the quality of life for myself and my son, as our old television and radio are no longer functional. My sister, who is a government employee, will act as my guarantor. I am committed to making the installment payments on time and maintaining my good credit history. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova
