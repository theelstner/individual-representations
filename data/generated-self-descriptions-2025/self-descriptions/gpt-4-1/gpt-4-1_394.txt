Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 3,249 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a project manager at Siemens AG for the past 5 years, overseeing a team in the engineering division. As a single father of two children, reliable transportation is crucial for both my professional commitments and family responsibilities.

Although my current checking account balance is below zero and my savings are limited, I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have consistently paid back on time over the last three years. My credit history reflects my reliability and dedication to honoring my commitments.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my employment is stable and my housing is provided free of charge by my employer, which minimizes my monthly expenses. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger
