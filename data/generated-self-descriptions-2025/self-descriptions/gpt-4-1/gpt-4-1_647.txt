Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of $7,980 to launch my mobile auto repair service in the city. I have been working as a certified automotive technician for the past 10 months at a reputable car dealership, and I see a growing demand for reliable roadside assistance in my area. 

My current financial situation is modest; I do not have a checking or savings account, and I have had some delays in repaying previous debts, but I have learned from those experiences and am now focused on building a stable future. I have been living at my current address for four years and have no dependents or guarantors. I rent my apartment and own a used van, which I intend to use for the business.

I am a skilled employee with a strong work ethic and a clear plan for my business. I am committed to making timely repayments and improving my credit standing. Your support will enable me to purchase essential tools and equipment and cover initial operating expenses. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Samuel Okoro

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a loan of $7,980 to open a small electronics repair shop. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for 9 months, specializing in hardware maintenance at a local university. My technical skills and dedication have been recognized by my supervisors, and I am eager to transition these abilities into my own business.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account and have previously experienced delays in repaying debts, I have taken steps to manage my finances more responsibly. I have lived at my present address for four years, pay rent, and have no dependents. My only asset is my car, which I use to commute to work.

I am confident that my experience and commitment make me a reliable candidate for this loan. With your assistance, I will be able to secure a storefront and purchase necessary equipment. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Mariusz Kowalski
