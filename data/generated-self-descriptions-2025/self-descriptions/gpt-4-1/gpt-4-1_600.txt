Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,775 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My job provides me with a stable monthly income, and I am highly dedicated to my work.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained two existing credits with your institution, both of which I have serviced reliably. My credit history includes other credits at a different bank, which I have managed responsibly, despite some past difficulties. I currently have a building society savings agreement, though my savings are under 100 DM.

I am single, 31 years old, and have one dependent. I have lived at my current address for two years and own my home. My installment rate for the requested loan will be manageable alongside my other obligations. As a foreign worker, I am fully committed to building my life and career in Germany.

I am confident that my stable employment, history of repaying loans, and ownership of property make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,
Dragan Petrovic

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,775 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and family responsibilities. I have been employed as a certified electrical technician with Siemens AG for the past 6 years. My employment is stable and well-compensated, and I have a strong record of punctuality and reliability.

Although I have no checking account at your bank, I have successfully maintained two loans with you and have never missed a payment. My credit history includes accounts at another bank, which are currently in good standing after a brief period of difficulty last year due to unexpected medical expenses for my child.

As a 31-year-old single father with one dependent, I take my financial responsibilities very seriously. I own my home and have a life insurance policy as security. My savings are currently below 100 DM, as I have prioritized supporting my child’s needs.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, given my stable employment and responsible financial management. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Murat Yilmaz

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Piotr Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 2,775 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for the last 4 years. My position is permanent, and my income is consistent and sufficient to meet my obligations.

I have been a customer of your bank for 18 months, holding two credits which I have serviced reliably. Although I do not have a checking account, I have always met my repayment schedules. My credit history at another bank was marked as critical in the past, but I have since resolved all outstanding issues.

At 31, I am single with one child, and we have lived in our own apartment for two years. My property includes a building society savings agreement, but my current savings are less than 100 DM due to recent home improvements.

I do not have any guarantors or additional debtors, and I have no telephone at home. I am a foreign worker, fully integrated and committed to my life in Germany. I believe my employment record and responsible repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Kind regards,
Piotr Nowak
