Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Peter Schulte, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,552 DM to purchase a new television for my apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past five years, where I have a steady and reliable income. I do not currently have a checking account, but I have maintained a savings account with a small balance, and my previous credits have always been repaid on time.

As a single professional, my financial obligations are straightforward, and I do not have any dependents or other guarantors. I have lived at my current residence for just over a year, and I own a small car which serves as my only property. My monthly expenses are well within my means, and I have always managed my finances responsibly.

I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 3 and pay back the loan within the agreed period. I believe my stable employment history and clean credit record make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Peter Schulte
