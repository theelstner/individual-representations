Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Klaus Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 2,348 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home and work. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for three years. My current financial situation is challenging, as my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I am steadily employed and my income is reliable.

I have been a resident at my current address for two years and own my home, which provides stability for my family—my wife and our 12-year-old son. I have a building society savings agreement as a form of property. While I have two existing credits at your bank, I have managed them responsibly, and I do not have any other installment plans or debts elsewhere. I am confident that my employment and stable living situation make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by telephone for any further information.

Sincerely,
Klaus Müller
