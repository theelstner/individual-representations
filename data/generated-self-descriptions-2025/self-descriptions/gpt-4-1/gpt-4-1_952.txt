Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 3,590 DM to start my own small taxi business in Frankfurt. I am a married man, 41 years old, and have been living in Germany for the past three years. Although I am currently unemployed, I have eight years of experience as a professional driver in Bulgaria and possess a valid German driver’s license. 

My financial situation is currently modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and no significant savings. I have some outstanding credit at another bank, but I have always managed my obligations responsibly, despite some previous difficulties. I do not have any guarantors or co-signers for this loan, but I do own a used Opel Astra, which I plan to use for the taxi business. 

I am confident that with this loan, I will be able to provide for my family and repay the loan in full, as the taxi market in Frankfurt is strong and I already have connections in the local Bulgarian community. I am committed to building a better future for my wife and son and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Mustafa, and I am seeking a loan of 3,590 DM to open a small grocery store specializing in Turkish and Middle Eastern products in Mannheim. I am married, have two children, and have been residing in Germany for three years. I am currently unemployed, but I have five years’ experience managing a food stall in Istanbul.

My financial resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings and a checking account balance below 200 DM. I have some existing credit obligations at another bank, but I have always made my payments on time. I do not have any other debts or installment plans beyond what is declared.

I am a foreign worker but have been active in the local community, volunteering at the neighborhood mosque and supporting new arrivals. My property consists of a small delivery van, which I will use for the store. I am confident that my experience and dedication make me a reliable candidate for this loan, and I am committed to repaying it as agreed.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Mustafa
