Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 639 DM to cover urgent repairs to my car, which I rely on daily for my work as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt. I have been employed there for just over two years and have built a solid reputation for reliability and diligence.

My financial situation is stable, though modest. My checking account usually contains under 200 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, as I am in the early stages of my career. However, I have always managed my credit responsibly; my previous loan was repaid on time and in full. I do not have any other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I have resided at my current address for two years.

I am confident that I can meet the installment payments of 4% over the 12-month period, thanks to my steady income and careful budgeting. My car is essential for my job, and this repair will ensure I can continue to perform my duties effectively. I am committed to honoring my financial obligations and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Markus Feldmann

Letter 2 – Junior Police Officer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 639 DM to finance necessary repairs to my vehicle. I am a junior police officer with the Wiesbaden Police Department, where I have been serving for three years. My employment is stable, and I am dedicated to my profession.

I have a good credit record, having paid off a previous loan with your bank without any issues. I have no other debts, and I live alone in a rented apartment where I have resided for the past two years.

My monthly salary is sufficient to cover the loan installments, and I have always managed my finances prudently. As an officer of the law, I hold myself to high ethical standards and take my financial commitments very seriously.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you that your trust in me will be well placed.

Best regards,
