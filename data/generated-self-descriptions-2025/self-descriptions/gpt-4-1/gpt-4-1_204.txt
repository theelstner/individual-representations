Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 5,117 DM. My name is Thomas Becker, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years. I am seeking this loan to launch a small-scale consultancy focused on data analytics for local businesses.

Although I do not currently have a checking account and have had a delay in paying off credit in the past, I have taken significant steps to improve my financial responsibility. My current employment is stable, and I have a reliable monthly income. I have lived at my current residence for 4 years and own a car, which I use for work.

I am single, have no dependents, and do not have any other outstanding debts or guarantors. My savings are limited at present, but I am confident in my business plan and my ability to repay the loan in the agreed installments. I am committed to building a strong relationship with your bank and maintaining a positive credit history moving forward.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker
