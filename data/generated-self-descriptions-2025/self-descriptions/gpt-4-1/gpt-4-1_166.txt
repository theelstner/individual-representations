Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Andrei Petrescu, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 909 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am 36 years old, single, and have been residing at my current address for four years. I am employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past eight years. 

I have one dependent, and I am a foreign worker from Romania. My financial record is solid: I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time, and no other installment plans or debts. I own my home and have a building society savings agreement with a current balance of 700 DM. 

I am applying for this loan as my current car is unreliable and I need a dependable vehicle to commute to my workplace, which is not easily accessible by public transport. My stable employment and reliable payment history demonstrate my trustworthiness. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% over the 36-month duration.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu
