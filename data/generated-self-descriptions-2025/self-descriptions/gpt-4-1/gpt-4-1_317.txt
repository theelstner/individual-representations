Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,746 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past 8 years, and I am currently single, living in my own residence for the last 4 years.

Although my current checking and savings accounts are below 100 DM, I have an excellent credit history with your bank, having paid back all previous loans diligently and on time. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and I have maintained a steady employment record throughout my career.

The new furniture and equipment will greatly improve my living environment and support my work-from-home needs. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my monthly income is stable and I have carefully planned my finances. My past record of responsibility and reliability makes me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Feldmann
