Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1213 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. My work is stable and rewarding, and I am proud to contribute to advancements in my field.

My financial situation is solid. I have consistently paid back my existing credits on time, and I currently have a savings account with a balance of 750 DM. I also hold a life insurance policy, which further underscores my commitment to financial responsibility. My only other installment plans are with local stores, which I manage without issue.

I have resided at my current address for 3 years and own my home. As a single father with one dependent, I am diligent about managing my finances. I have never had a checking account but have managed my obligations efficiently. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM per month.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Johannes Weber

I have lived in my owned apartment for the past 3 years, and I have one son who lives with me. I am single and have no guarantors or co-debtors. My financial discipline and long-term employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I am available for any further information you may require.
