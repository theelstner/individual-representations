Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,181 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been steadily employed for the past eight years. I am currently single, 36 years old, and have one dependent child. I have been living at my current address for four years and own my home.

Although my checking account balance is currently modest, I have always prioritized my financial obligations. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I am servicing reliably. While I do have a critical account on record from a prior loan with another institution, I have since maintained a solid repayment record and have no outstanding installment plans elsewhere.

As a foreign worker with permanent residence status, I am committed to building my life here and ensuring my financial stability. My property ownership further underscores my dedication and reliability. This new vehicle is essential for my daily commute and my child’s needs.

I kindly ask for your consideration and assure you of my intent to honor all loan commitments.

Sincerely,
Andreas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,181 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute to my job as a senior technician at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for the past seven years. I am 36, single, and have a young son who lives with me. For the last four years, I have owned and resided in my apartment in Munich.

While my current checking account balance is below 200 DM and I have a critical account due to a delayed payment on a previous credit elsewhere, I have no other installment plans and have consistently paid my two existing credits at your bank on time. I do not have a savings account, but I do own real estate, which provides security.

As someone who takes pride in my work and responsibilities, I assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate. The car will help me continue to provide for my family and fulfill my professional duties.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Murat Yilmaz

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Viktor Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 2,181 DM to buy a new car. I am 36 years old, single, and have one dependent child. I have been working as a customs officer at the Hamburg port authority for eight years, and I am a homeowner residing at my address for the past four years.

I acknowledge that my checking account currently holds less than 200 DM and that my credit history includes a critical account from a previous loan with another bank. Despite this, I have no other debts or installment plans and have always met my obligations with your institution, where I hold two existing credits.

As a foreign national, I have invested in real estate here and am committed to my life and work in Germany. This car is vital for my job and family life. I respectfully ask you to consider my application, confident in my ability to fulfill the repayment terms.
