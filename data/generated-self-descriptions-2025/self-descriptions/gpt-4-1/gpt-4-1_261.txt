Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,154 DM to purchase a new television for my home. My name is Marta Kovacs, and I have been a resident of Hamburg for the past four years. I am 57 years old, divorced, and currently unemployed after having worked as a cleaning assistant for over 15 years. I live with my adult daughter, who is partially dependent on me due to her health issues.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have a savings account with a current balance of 250 DM. I own my home and have real estate assets, which provide some financial security. I have three existing credits at your bank, all of which I have managed responsibly, making timely payments despite my modest income.

The television is essential for both my and my daughter's well-being, as it provides information and entertainment during our time at home. My previous television broke beyond repair, and I do not have the funds to replace it outright.

I understand that my credit history includes some critical accounts at other banks, but I have always prioritized my obligations and have no guarantors or other installment plans. I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 4 DM per month and am confident in my ability to repay the loan as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available to provide any further information you require.

Sincerely,  
Marta Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Fernandez, a 57-year-old married woman and a foreign resident in Berlin for the past four years. I am writing to request a loan of 1,154 DM to purchase a new radio and television set, as my family’s current appliances are no longer functional.

I am currently unemployed, having lost my job as a kitchen helper eight months ago. Despite this, I own my home outright and have a small savings account of 350 DM. I have one dependent, my grandson, who lives with me since my daughter moved abroad for work.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained three credits with your bank and have always made my payments on time. My credit history shows some issues with other banks from several years ago, but I have since stabilized my finances and have no other debts or installment plans.

I believe my ownership of real estate, lack of other debts, and history of responsible repayments make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The television and radio are vital for staying informed and connected, especially as I look for new employment opportunities.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Fernandez

Dear Banking Team,

I am Sofia Ivanova, a 57-year-old separated woman residing in Leipzig for the past four years. I am applying for a loan of 1,154 DM to purchase a new television, as my previous one was damaged beyond repair during a recent move.

I am currently unemployed, following the closure of the factory where I worked as an assembly line worker for 12 years. I have a savings account with a balance of 180 DM and own my apartment. I live with my teenage son, who is my sole dependent.

Though I do not have a checking account, I have three active credits at your bank, all in good standing, and I have never defaulted on a payment. My credit history includes some challenges with other creditors, but I have no additional debts or installment plans.

The television is important for both educational and entertainment purposes for my son and me. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate, and my property ownership demonstrates my financial stability.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Sofia Ivanova

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,154 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my household. My name is Elena Popescu, a 57-year-old divorced foreign resident living in Stuttgart for four years. I live with my adult son, who relies on my support while he searches for employment.

I have been unemployed for the past year after the restaurant where I worked as a dishwasher closed. I do not have a checking account but maintain a savings account with 220 DM. I own my own home, have three existing credits at your bank (all paid on time), and have no other debts or installment plans.

While my credit history with other banks has had some difficulties, I have always honored my commitments with your institution. The new television and radio are important for staying informed and connected, especially as I continue my job search.

I am confident in my ability to make the required installment payments and respectfully request your favorable consideration.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Elena Popescu
