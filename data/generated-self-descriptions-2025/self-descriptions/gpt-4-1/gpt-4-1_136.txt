Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Meier, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 10,144 DM to purchase a new television and sound system for my home. I am 21 years old, recently divorced, and have been employed as a certified laboratory technician at Bayer AG for the past 5 years. My current financial situation is stable; I own my home and have a small savings account with 250 DM. I have no other outstanding debts and have always paid back my previous credits on time, including one existing credit at your bank.

I am responsible for my 3-year-old son and am committed to providing him with a comfortable living environment. The new radio and television will not only enhance our quality of life but also allow me to stay informed and engaged with current events and educational content. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors, relying solely on my consistent income.

I believe my employment history, responsible credit behavior, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Meier
