Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,155 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked steadily for the past 8 years. My financial situation is stable: while my checking and savings accounts have modest balances, I have consistently paid back all previous credits on time, as confirmed by my credit history at your bank.

I am married with one child, and we have been living in our own home for the past three years. Although I currently have two existing credits at your bank, I have always managed my installments responsibly, and I have a real estate property as security. My brother-in-law has agreed to act as guarantor for this loan.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a solid life here. I am confident that my stable employment, history of reliable payments, and ownership of real estate make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Murat Kaya

Dear Loan Officer,

I have been employed as a janitorial staff member at the City Hospital for the past 9 years, and I have always honored my financial obligations.

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,155 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my family. I have worked as a sanitation worker for the City of Stuttgart for the past 8 years, providing steady support for my wife and daughter. We have lived in our own house for three years, and I am proud to own this property.

Although my current and savings account balances are below 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have always paid my credits on time, and I currently have two active credits with your bank. My financial discipline is further supported by a guarantor—my uncle—who is willing to back this loan.

As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building a secure future for my family. My long-term employment, responsible payment record, and property ownership demonstrate my trustworthiness. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and attention.
