Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 12,169 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently 36 years old, single, and have one dependent, my son Lukas. I have been living at my current address for four years and, while I am currently unemployed after my previous position as a project manager at a logistics company, I am actively seeking new opportunities and have several interviews scheduled.

I have maintained a checking account with your bank for over eight years, and I have always repaid all credits on time, including my current small loan. Although I do not have significant savings or property at the moment, I have a reliable co-applicant—my brother, who is a civil servant with a stable income. We live together and share living expenses, which helps keep my financial obligations manageable.

This car is essential for my job search and for transporting my son to school and activities. My commitment to responsible financial management is demonstrated by my clean credit history with your bank. I am confident that, with your support, I will soon regain employment and continue to meet all my financial commitments.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Stefan Müller, a 36-year-old self-employed IT consultant. I am writing to request a loan of 12,169 DM over 48 months to purchase a new vehicle. As my consulting work often requires client visits across the region, a reliable car is essential for maintaining and expanding my business.

Though I am currently between contracts, I have a solid history of successful projects, and all previous credits with your bank have been paid back in full and on time. I have one dependent, my daughter, who lives with me part-time. I live rent-free in my parents’ house, which keeps my monthly expenses low.

While I do not currently have a savings account or property, my co-applicant—my business partner, who has a steady job at a local engineering firm—provides additional financial security for this application. I am committed to maintaining my excellent repayment record and believe this investment will help me quickly return to a stable income.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Alexander Weber, a 36-year-old former officer in the German Armed Forces, now transitioning to civilian life. I respectfully request a loan of 12,169 DM for the purchase of a new car, to be repaid over 48 months. Reliable transportation is crucial as I attend job interviews and retraining programs to secure stable employment.

I have always managed my finances responsibly, as shown by my spotless credit history with your bank. I currently have one dependent—my nephew, whom I care for since my sister’s passing. I reside with my aunt, rent-free, which helps me meet my financial obligations despite being temporarily unemployed.

Although I do not have savings or property, my cousin, a schoolteacher, has agreed to co-sign the loan, which further assures my ability to repay. My discipline and reliability, developed during my military service, will ensure that I honor this commitment as I have with all previous loans.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Alexander Weber

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Markus Hahn, and I am seeking a 12,169 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for both personal and professional reasons. I am 36 years old, single, and support my elderly mother, who is my dependent. After eight years as a department head in a manufacturing company, I am currently between jobs due to company downsizing.

I have always paid back my loans at your bank promptly, and my current account, although modest, is well managed. I live with my mother in her apartment, so I have no housing expenses. My brother, who works as a pharmacist, will be my co-applicant, providing additional financial security for this loan.

With my strong management background and proven financial responsibility, I am confident I will soon return to stable employment. This car will be instrumental in helping me secure a new position. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Markus Hahn
