Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 2,625 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, where I have developed a stable career and income. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn (< 0 DM), and my savings are modest (< 100 DM), as I have been supporting my teenage son through school.

Although my credit history reflects some previous challenges, I have consistently made payments on my existing credit at your bank and maintain a building society savings agreement as a form of security. My residence in Munich has been stable for 4 years, and I have a reliable guarantor to support this application.

Owning a new car is essential for my daily commute and for transporting my son to extracurricular activities. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my employment is secure and my financial obligations are well-managed. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,625 DM to finance the purchase of a new vehicle. My name is Sven Müller, and I have worked as a senior technician at Siemens AG for the past 10 years. As a single father with one dependent, reliable transportation is crucial for both my job and my family responsibilities.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are minimal, as I have recently paid for a necessary medical procedure for my son. Despite a critical credit history due to past obligations, I have a consistent record of repaying existing credits, including one at your bank, and I hold a life insurance policy as collateral.

I have rented my current apartment for 4 years, and my employment provides a steady income. My brother has agreed to act as a guarantor, further assuring my commitment. I am confident that I will meet the monthly installments without issue.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Sven Müller

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Jens Schneider, and I am applying for a 2,625 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my work as a logistics coordinator at DB Schenker, where I have been employed for 9 years. As a single man supporting my younger brother, I rely heavily on personal transportation.

My current financial situation is tight, with an overdrawn checking account and less than 100 DM in savings, as my resources have gone into supporting my brother’s education. While my credit history is not perfect, I have always honored my financial commitments and have a building society savings agreement as additional security.

I have lived in my current rental for 4 years, and I have a trusted friend willing to act as guarantor. My stable employment and clear repayment plan make me a responsible candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration and trust.

Sincerely,  
Jens Schneider

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Peter Fischer, a municipal administrative officer with 8 years of service at the Hamburg City Office. I am seeking a loan of 2,625 DM for the purchase of a new car to facilitate my commute and family needs, as I am the sole provider for my 10-year-old daughter.

At present, my account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are low due to recent home repairs. I acknowledge a critical account in my credit history, but I have a good track record of repaying my existing credit with your bank. I also hold a life insurance policy, which adds security to this application.

Having rented the same apartment for 4 years and with a reliable guarantor in place, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule. My employment is secure, and I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Peter Fischer

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,625 DM. My name is Martin Weber, and I have been a skilled machinist at Bosch for 8 years. As a single parent, having dependable transportation is vital for both my work and my child’s activities.

Currently, my financial reserves are limited, with an overdrawn checking account and under 100 DM in savings, largely due to covering my son's recent school expenses. My credit history shows a critical account, but I have consistently paid down my existing loan with your bank, and I have a building society savings agreement as a backup.

I have lived in my rented apartment for 4 years and have arranged for my cousin to act as a guarantor. My job is stable, and I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Martin Weber
