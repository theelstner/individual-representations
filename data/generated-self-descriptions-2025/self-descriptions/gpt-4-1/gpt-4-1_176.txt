Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,414 DM to support my pursuit of a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich. I am currently employed as a research assistant at Siemens AG, a position I have held for the past 10 months. Although I have been in Germany for only a year, I am committed to building my future here.

While my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are less than 100 DM, I have consistently managed my finances despite supporting my younger brother. My previous delays in repayment were due to unexpected medical expenses for my family, but I have since taken steps to ensure timely payments by setting up automatic transfers.

I am a single 26-year-old male, residing in my own apartment for the past year. I have no other debtors or installment plans and have maintained two credits with your bank, which I am diligently repaying. My property includes a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning.

I believe this loan will be a valuable investment in my education and future earning potential. I am dedicated, responsible, and determined to honor my obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Mikhail Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am requesting a loan of 3,414 DM to finance my postgraduate studies in Business Administration at the University of Frankfurt. I am a 26-year-old single male from Egypt, and I have been employed as a junior compliance officer at Deutsche Bank for the past 8 months.

I have faced some financial difficulties, as reflected in my overdrawn checking account and minimal savings. These challenges arose during my relocation to Germany and while supporting my young son, who lives with me. My credit history shows a past delay in repayment, which was due to the initial costs of settling into a new country. Since then, I have maintained regular payments and have learned to better manage my finances.

I currently have two existing credits with your bank and own my apartment. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors. My assets include a life insurance policy, which I have kept active as a safety net.

I am committed to furthering my education to advance my career and improve my family’s future. I am reliable, and my current employment provides stability. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 3,414 DM to cover tuition fees and educational materials for my studies in Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University. I am 26 years old, single, and have one dependent—my younger sister, whom I support financially.

I have been employed as an IT support specialist at Bosch for 9 months. Although my checking account is currently negative and my savings are under 100 DM, this is temporary and due to initial expenses incurred when I moved into my own apartment last year. My credit history does show a delay in payment, which was a one-time issue caused by a delayed salary payment. Since then, I have set up stricter budgeting and payment reminders.

I have two current credits with your bank, which I am managing responsibly. I have no other outstanding loans or installment plans, and I own my apartment. My assets include a building society savings agreement, reflecting my commitment to future financial security.

I am confident that this loan will help me achieve my educational and professional goals, leading to greater financial stability. I am trustworthy and fully intend to repay the loan as agreed.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Radu Popescu

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Daniel Kim, and I am seeking a loan of 3,414 DM to finance my advanced studies in Electrical Engineering at the University of Stuttgart. I am a 26-year-old single male, residing in my own apartment with my 5-year-old nephew, whom I care for.

I have been working as a quality assurance technician at Mercedes-Benz for almost a year. My checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are minimal, as I have been supporting my nephew after the passing of his parents. I acknowledge a previous delay in repayment, which occurred during this difficult period, but I have since caught up on all payments and put measures in place to avoid future delays.

I have two ongoing credits with your bank, no other installment plans or guarantors, and my property includes a life insurance policy. I have lived at my current address for one year and am dedicated to creating a stable home for my nephew and myself.

This loan will allow me to complete my education and secure better employment opportunities. I am hardworking, responsible, and committed to fulfilling my obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Kim

Dear Loan Committee,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,414 DM to support my studies in Finance at Goethe University. My name is Tomasz Nowak, I am 26 years old, single, and have been living in my own apartment for a year with my son.

I have been employed for 11 months as a financial analyst at Allianz. My checking account is currently negative and my savings are less than 100 DM, largely due to the costs of moving from Poland and supporting my child. Although my credit history includes a delayed payment, this was a result of unforeseen expenses during my transition to Germany. I have since established a strict budget and have not missed any further payments.

I have two credits with your bank, no other loans or installment plans, and my assets include a building society savings agreement. I am a foreign worker but am committed to building a stable and prosperous life here.

I am dedicated to my education and career, and I am confident that with this loan, I can further improve my financial situation. I am responsible and determined to meet all my financial commitments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Tomasz Nowak
