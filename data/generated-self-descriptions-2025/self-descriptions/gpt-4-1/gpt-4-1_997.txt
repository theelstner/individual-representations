Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,736 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a divorced woman of 31 years old, I am currently employed as a hospital orderly, a position I have held for the past 5 years. My financial situation is stable, as I own my residence and have a history of timely loan repayments, including one existing credit at your bank which I have managed responsibly.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have always ensured my financial obligations are met. I have minimal savings due to supporting my young daughter, but I do have real estate property which provides additional security. My installment rate is manageable, and I have no other debts or guarantors involved.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my employment is secure and my expenses are carefully managed. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Kovács

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,736 DM to buy necessary furniture and equipment for my apartment. As a married woman, aged 31, I have worked as a warehouse assistant for the past 6 years. I have been living at my current address for 4 years and proudly own my home.

Despite not having a checking account, I have always paid my credits on time, including my current loan with your bank. My savings are limited, as most of my income goes toward supporting my 8-year-old son. I do not have any other installment plans, and there are no co-debtors or guarantors involved.

My stable employment, responsible repayment history, and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment rate and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 1,736 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home. I am a separated woman, 31 years old, and have worked as a supermarket cashier for the last 4 years. I am a foreign worker and have resided at my current address for 4 years, where I own my property.

While I do not have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, I have always fulfilled my credit obligations promptly, including my existing loan with your institution. I have no other debts, installment plans, or co-signers.

Supporting my son on my single income is challenging, but my job is secure, and I am committed to meeting my financial responsibilities. I assure you of my reliability and hope for a favorable decision.

Yours sincerely,  
Maria Lopez
