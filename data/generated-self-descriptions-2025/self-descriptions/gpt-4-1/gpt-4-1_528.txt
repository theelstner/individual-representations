Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,532 DM to support my continuing education in business administration. I am a divorced woman, 34 years old, and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past two years. My goal is to complete a specialized certification program that will improve my qualifications and allow me to advance within my department.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance of 350 DM. My financial situation is stable: I have managed my existing obligations with other credit institutions responsibly, and I have no dependents or guarantors. I have lived at my current address for three years and own a car as my primary asset.

I am a reliable and diligent professional, and my record as a skilled employee demonstrates my commitment. I am confident that this investment in my education will increase my earning potential and allow me to repay the loan within the agreed terms.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,532 DM to finance a two-semester advanced IT course at the University of Stuttgart. As a married woman and an official in the city’s administrative office, I have worked in my current position for three years. This course is essential for my professional development and future promotion prospects.

My financial background includes a savings account with 200 DM and a history of punctual payments on my existing credit, which is not with your bank. I do not have a checking account at this time, but I manage my finances prudently, and I have no other installment plans except for my current car loan.

I have lived in my present residence for three years, own my car, and have no dependents. I am a trustworthy candidate, as evidenced by my stable employment and responsible management of financial obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Sabine Müller
