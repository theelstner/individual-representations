Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Richter, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €1,126 to purchase a new television for my home. I am 21 years old, divorced, and have one dependent, my young daughter. I have been employed for the past 8 months as a scientific research assistant at the Dresden Institute of Technology. My financial situation is stable; I pay my rent and other monthly expenses on time, and I have a good credit history, having paid off a previous loan with your bank without any issues.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have no other debts or installment plans at this time. I am renting my current residence and have lived there for two years. I also own a small piece of real estate in my hometown, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

I am confident that I can meet the monthly installment rate of 4 and repay the loan in full and on time. I am a trustworthy candidate, as shown by my previous history with your bank and my consistent employment. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of €1,126 to purchase a new radio and television for my family. My name is Maria Dobrev, I am 21 years old, married, and the mother of a 3-year-old boy. I have been working for the past 10 months as an official in the local government office in Leipzig. My employment is stable and my income covers my living expenses, including rent and utilities.

My credit history with your bank is excellent; I have previously taken out a small loan and repaid it fully and on time. I do not have a checking or savings account, but I have always managed my obligations well. I own a small apartment in Sofia, which I rent out, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

My family relies on me, and this loan will help us purchase necessary appliances to improve our quality of life. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan at the agreed installment rate. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.

Best regards,  
Maria Dobrev
