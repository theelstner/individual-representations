Letter 1 – From a Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a personal loan of €5,943 to purchase a new television and radio set for my household. As a scientific research assistant at MedTech Innovations GmbH, I have been employed for 9 months and am currently on a fixed-term contract. My financial situation is stable: I have no outstanding debts, and my previous credit was paid back in full and on time. Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have always managed my finances responsibly.

I am recently divorced and live alone in a rented apartment, where I have resided for the past year. My only asset is my car. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my monthly installment rate for this loan will be manageable given my regular income. My employment as a skilled professional, along with my consistent payment history, demonstrates my reliability. I am also a foreign worker with proper documentation and a valid residence permit.

I am confident that I will meet all repayment obligations and would be grateful for your support in helping me improve my quality of life.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Hana Kovacs

Letter 2 – From a School Administrator

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of €5,943 to purchase new radio and television equipment for my family. I am currently employed as a school administrator at the International School of Düsseldorf, where I have worked for 7 months. My employment is stable, and I have always paid back any previous credits without delay.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at this time, my financial discipline is evident from my positive credit history. I am married and support one dependent. We have resided at our current address for just over a year and do not own our home; however, we do own a family car.

I have no other installment plans or debts, and the proposed installment rate is well within my monthly budget. I believe my employment status, history of responsible repayments, and commitment to my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Fernandez
