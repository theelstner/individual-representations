Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ana Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 3990 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances for my apartment. I am 29 years old, recently separated, and currently living with my 6-year-old son in Munich. Since moving to Germany from Bulgaria two years ago, I have worked various short-term jobs, most recently as a kitchen assistant for the past 9 months. Although my employment is not permanent, I have always managed to pay my obligations on time, as demonstrated by my clean credit history with your bank.

Currently, my checking account balance is low, but I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only existing credit with your bank was paid back in full and on schedule. I have no savings or property, but I am committed to improving my family's living standards. The appliances I wish to purchase—a washing machine, refrigerator, and stove—are essential for my son's well-being and our daily life.

I believe my consistent payment history and responsible approach make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Gomez, a 29-year-old divorced mother of one, living in Frankfurt. I am seeking a 3990 DM loan to buy domestic appliances for my new home, as I have recently moved out of shared accommodation and am now responsible for my own household. Although I have been in my current job as a hotel housekeeper for just under a year, I am diligent and reliable. My previous credit with your bank was paid back promptly, and I have always managed my finances carefully despite a modest income.

I have no savings or property, and my checking account is currently below 200 DM, but I have no outstanding debts or other installment plans except with your bank. I have been residing at my current address for two years and am committed to building a stable life for myself and my daughter.

I kindly ask you to consider my application. I am confident that my responsible history and determination to provide a better home environment for my child make me a suitable candidate for this loan.

Best regards,  
Maria Gomez

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Leila Hassan. I am 29 years old, married, and the primary caregiver for my 4-year-old son. I am applying for a 3990 DM loan to purchase basic domestic appliances, as our current ones are unreliable and costly to repair. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant for 8 months, and although my employment is still new, I am committed to my job and my responsibilities.

My current account balance is modest, and I do not have a savings account or property. However, I have successfully repaid a previous loan from your bank on time and have no other debts or installment plans elsewhere. I have lived at my present address for two years and am working hard to build a better life for my family in Germany.

I believe my proven track record of repaying credit and my dedication to supporting my family demonstrate my reliability as a borrower. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Leila Hassan

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Olga Ivanova, a 29-year-old separated woman residing in Stuttgart with my 7-year-old daughter. I am requesting a loan of 3990 DM to replace our old and malfunctioning domestic appliances. Since arriving in Germany, I have held several temporary jobs, and I am currently working as a retail assistant, a position I have held for 10 months.

Although my checking account has a low balance and I have no savings, I have previously taken a loan from your bank and repaid it without any delays. I do not own any property or have other debts, and my only installment plan is with your bank. I have lived at my current address for two years and am determined to provide a comfortable home for my child.

I am confident that my history of responsible financial behavior makes me a trustworthy applicant for this loan. I would greatly appreciate your support.

Kind regards,  
Olga Ivanova
