Letter 1 – Maria Schneider, Self-Employed Interior Designer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,474 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my home office. I have been self-employed as an interior designer for the past 10 months, working with several clients in the Munich area. My checking account with your bank has received regular salary assignments for over a year, and I have always managed my finances responsibly.

I have one previous credit with your bank, which I have repaid on time, and I currently have no other debts or guarantors. My savings are limited, as I have invested most of my resources into growing my business. I do, however, have a life insurance policy as additional security.

As a divorced mother of one, I am committed to providing for my family and growing my business. My stable income and history of timely repayments make me a trustworthy candidate. I kindly ask for your support in helping me equip my workspace, which will allow me to take on more clients and further stabilize my financial situation.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Maria Schneider

Letter 2 – Sabine Weber, Marketing Manager

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,474 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase essential equipment. I recently accepted a position as a marketing manager at a reputable firm in Stuttgart and have been employed there for 8 months. My salary is deposited into my checking account with your bank, which has been active and well-managed for over a year.

I am married with one child and currently own my home. I have always paid back previous credits on time and have no outstanding debts. My savings are modest, as I recently moved and had to cover several initial expenses, but I have a building society savings agreement as a form of property.

My responsible financial behavior and stable employment demonstrate my reliability. This loan will help me settle into my new home and improve my family's quality of life. I appreciate your consideration and am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,
Sabine Weber

Letter 3 – Anja Fischer, Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,474 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new residence. I recently started a position as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have been working for 7 months. My salary has been consistently paid into my checking account with your institution for over a year.

As a separated woman with one dependent, I am solely responsible for my child and our household. I have a previous credit with your bank that I have fully repaid, and I have no other ongoing debts. My savings are under 100 DM, as I am still establishing myself, but I do have a life insurance policy.

My employment in academia is stable, and my history with your bank shows I am a reliable and trustworthy client. This loan will allow me to create a comfortable home for myself and my child. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Sincerely,
Anja Fischer
