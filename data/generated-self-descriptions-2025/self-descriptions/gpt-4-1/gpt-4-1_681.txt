Letter 1

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Eliza Petrova, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,453 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, a position I have held for 10 months. As a single mother of one, I am committed to providing a comfortable and educational environment for my child.

Though I do not have a checking account yet, I have maintained a savings account, albeit with less than 100 DM in it. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always repaid promptly and in full. I do not have any other debts or installment plans, and I am the sole owner of my apartment, which provides me with stability.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my steady employment, responsible credit history, and ownership of real estate. The television will support both my child’s learning and our family’s leisure. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Eliza Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marta Nowak, a 26-year-old divorced civil servant, and I am seeking a loan of 1,453 DM to purchase a radio and television set. I have been employed as a customs officer for the past 11 months, and I am the sole provider for my 3-year-old son.

I currently own my home, and while I have limited savings, I have successfully paid off a previous credit with your bank. I have no other debts or installment agreements, nor do I rely on guarantors. My financial discipline is demonstrated by my timely repayments and prudent management of my single existing credit.

As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building a stable life in Germany. Access to radio and television would greatly enhance our quality of life and help me stay informed about local affairs. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Kind regards,
Marta Nowak
