Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,546 DM to purchase a new television for my apartment. I am currently employed as a warehouse supervisor at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for five years. My financial situation is modest; my checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have always paid back previous loans from your bank on time, as my credit history shows.

Although I am single and have no dependents, I take my financial obligations very seriously. My monthly income is stable, and I live alone in a rented flat, having resided at my current address for four years. I also have a guarantor for additional security.

I am confident that I will be able to repay the loan in the agreed installments, as I have successfully managed similar financial commitments in the past. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,546 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I work as a delivery driver for a local courier service and have been with the company for nearly six years. My financial resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings and a checking account that is currently in the negative.

Despite these challenges, I have a solid track record with your bank, having always repaid my previous loans promptly. I have lived in my current rental residence for four years, and my position provides me with a reliable monthly income. I also have a guarantor to support this application.

I am committed to meeting the installment payments and believe my employment stability and responsible repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jens Richter

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1,546 DM to upgrade my radio and television, which are essential for my daily life and professional development. I have been employed as a janitorial assistant at the central hospital for four and a half years. My financial situation is tight, with an overdrawn checking account and savings below 100 DM, but I have always honored my repayment agreements with your bank.

I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my current address for four years. I rent my home and have a reliable guarantor to back my application. My job provides a steady, though modest, income.

Given my consistent repayment history and stable employment, I am confident in my ability to fulfill the loan terms.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marco Schmitt

I am writing to request a loan of 1,546 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I have worked as a kitchen assistant at Café Linden for the past four years and eight months. My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking account overdrawn and savings under 100 DM.

Nevertheless, I have always repaid my previous loans from your bank on schedule. I have lived in the same rented apartment for four years, and I have a guarantor who can vouch for my reliability. My employment is steady, and my monthly income is sufficient to cover the proposed installment payments.

I am a responsible borrower and believe my history with your bank demonstrates my trustworthiness. I would appreciate your consideration of my loan application.

Kind regards,
