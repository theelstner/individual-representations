Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Feldmann, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,313 DM to furnish my recently rented apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and my employment is secure and ongoing. 

I have no checking account at this time, but I do maintain a savings account, although the balance is currently below 100 DM. My credit history is spotless, as I have always paid back my existing credits on time and in full. I currently have no other debts, nor do I have any guarantors or co-signers.

I have lived at my current address in Freiburg for 4 years, and I own a small car as my main asset. I am single, have no dependents, and am not a foreign worker. My current housing situation is temporary, and I do not have any other installment plans except one for a small electronics purchase, which is almost paid off.

I am requesting this loan to purchase basic furniture and equipment to improve my living conditions and to allow me to work from home more efficiently when required. My stable employment, strong repayment history, and clear need for the loan make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Markus Feldmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am seeking a loan of 1,313 DM to buy essential furniture and office equipment for my new apartment. I have worked as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for 9 years, and my employment is permanent and well-compensated.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have always managed my finances responsibly, as reflected in my flawless credit history. All my previous loans have been paid back in full and on time. My savings are currently below 100 DM, as I have recently moved and had to cover several upfront expenses.

I have resided at my current address for 4 years, and I own a reliable Volkswagen Golf. I am single, have no children, and have no other debts or installment plans except for a small appliance purchase, which is nearly completed.

I am confident that my stable employment, reliable repayment history, and the clear purpose for this loan make me a trustworthy applicant. I am dedicated to fulfilling my obligations and would greatly appreciate your support.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker
