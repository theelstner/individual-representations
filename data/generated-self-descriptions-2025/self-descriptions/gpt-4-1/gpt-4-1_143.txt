Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,795 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. I am currently employed as a project manager at a local engineering firm, a position I have held for 8 months. My financial situation is stable; I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying diligently and on time. My checking and savings accounts are modest, with balances under 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, as I am currently supporting my 5-year-old daughter as a single mother.

I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, and I have been residing in my own home for the past year. Although I do not own other property, my reliable payment history and steady employment demonstrate my commitment to meeting my financial obligations. I am confident that my income will cover the monthly installments without issue.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Anna Becker, and I am seeking a loan of 4,795 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am a recently appointed scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, having started less than a year ago. My current financial resources are limited as I have recently completed my doctorate and moved into my own apartment with my 6-year-old son.

Despite my modest savings and checking balances, I have a strong record of repaying credit on time, as evidenced by my existing credit with your bank. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My employment at the university is secure, and I expect my income to increase with upcoming research grants.

I am committed to maintaining my excellent credit history and would greatly appreciate your support in this matter.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Dr. Anna Becker

To whom it may concern,

My name is Julia Weber, and I am a self-employed graphic designer requesting a loan of 4,795 DM to purchase a high-quality radio and television for both personal and professional use. I have been self-employed for 10 months and have built a growing client base. I live with my 8-year-old son in our own home, where we have resided for the past year.

My checking and savings account balances are currently below 200 DM and 100 DM, as I have invested most of my earnings back into my business. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not reliant on any guarantors.

I am confident that my increasing income will allow me to comfortably meet the monthly installment rate. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
