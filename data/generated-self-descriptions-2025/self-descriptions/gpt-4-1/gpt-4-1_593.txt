Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schneider, and I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,965 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am currently employed as a laboratory research assistant at a local university, where I have worked for the past 2 years. As a divorced woman supporting my teenage daughter, reliable transportation is essential for both commuting to work and taking care of my family’s needs.

My current checking account balance is modest, usually around 150 DM, as I prioritize paying monthly rent and other living expenses. While I have experienced delays in paying off a previous small consumer loan, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management, including enrolling in a budgeting course. I do not have a savings account at this time, but my consistent employment and regular salary provide stability.

I have lived at my present address for 4 years and do not have any other debts or guarantors. My only major financial obligation is the monthly rent. As a skilled employee with a steady job and a history of meeting my core responsibilities, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to making regular installment payments and see this car purchase as an investment in my family’s future.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova. I am a married foreign worker employed as an administrative officer at the city council, where I have worked for 3 years. I am seeking a loan of 1,965 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute and to support my husband’s work as a freelance technician.

My financial situation is stable, with a checking account balance that fluctuates between 80 and 180 DM, depending on the time of month. While I have previously experienced a delay in repaying a store credit card, I have since maintained all my payments on time and have no outstanding debts. We currently rent our apartment and have no other installment plans except for a small monthly furniture payment.

Having lived at our current residence for 4 years and maintained steady employment, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments for this loan. I am responsible, organized, and committed to fulfilling my obligations. I believe this loan will enable me to better support my family and my work.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Banking Officer,

My name is Sandra Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 1,965 DM to purchase a new car. I am a separated mother of two and have been employed as a skilled machine operator at Müller Industries for the last 1.5 years. My current checking account rarely exceeds 100 DM, as I am focused on providing for my children and covering our monthly rent.

Two years ago, I experienced a delay in paying off a mobile phone contract, but I have since learned from that mistake and now manage my finances with greater care. I have no savings account at the moment, but I do own a small secondhand car, which I plan to trade in for the new one.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years and have no additional debts or guarantors. My only ongoing installment is the rent, and I have always paid it on time. I am committed to meeting the repayment schedule for this loan, as reliable transportation is vital for my job and my children’s schooling.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Sandra Weber

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ana Gomez, and I am seeking a loan of 1,965 DM to purchase a new car. I am a married skilled employee, working as a scientific research assistant at the Technische Universität for the past 2.5 years. As a foreign worker, I rely heavily on public transportation, which is often unreliable and makes it challenging to balance my work and family responsibilities.

My checking account balance is currently 170 DM. I do not have a savings account, as my salary is allocated to rent, utilities, and supporting my younger sister, who lives with us. I did have a delay in paying off a previous credit card, but I have since set up automatic payments to avoid any future issues.

We have lived at our current address for 4 years and have no other debts or guarantors. I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments, given my stable employment and commitment to financial responsibility. This car will be a valuable asset for my work and family life.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ana Gomez
