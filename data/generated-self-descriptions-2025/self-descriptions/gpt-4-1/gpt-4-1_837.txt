Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,082 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for 3 years. My monthly salary is stable and sufficient to cover my living expenses and loan installments.

My financial situation is solid, although my checking and savings accounts currently hold less than 100 DM due to recent necessary expenses, such as moving to a new apartment and supporting my younger brother’s university fees. I have never taken out a loan before, and my credit history is spotless.

I need a reliable car to commute daily from my residence in Göttingen to the institute, as public transport does not align with my work schedule. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my current address for four years.

As a dedicated employee and responsible citizen, I assure you that I will make all repayments on time. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Keller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,082 DM for the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as a mechanical engineer at Bosch GmbH for 2.5 years. My employment is secure, and my monthly income is 2,400 DM.

Currently, I have less than 100 DM in my checking and savings accounts, as I recently paid for dental surgery and supported my parents with home repairs. I have no outstanding debts and have always paid back any previous credits promptly, although I have not required loans in the past.

A new car is essential for my job, as I am frequently required to visit client sites in neighboring cities. I have lived at my current residence in Stuttgart for four years, and I do not have any dependents or co-signers.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, given my stable employment and responsible financial behavior. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Sebastian Meier

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,082 DM to buy a new car. I am a single male, 29 years old, working as an IT specialist at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 3 years. My monthly income is consistent, and I have no existing loans.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and I have minimal savings, as I recently paid for a training certification to advance my career. My credit history is clean, and I have always managed my finances responsibly.

A new car will enable me to travel to project sites and work overtime when required, as public transportation is not reliable at night. I have lived at my present address in Munich for four years and have no other debts.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, and I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Martin Schulz

Dear Loan Department,

I am seeking a loan of 1,082 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a junior architect at Bauhaus Architekten for 1 year and 8 months, with a steady monthly income of 1,900 DM. My current checking and savings balances are under 100 DM due to recent relocation costs and professional exam fees.

I have never defaulted on a loan, and my credit history is unblemished. As a single individual with no dependents, I am solely responsible for my finances and have managed them well.

A car is necessary for site visits and client meetings outside the city. I have lived at my current address in Leipzig for four years and have no other loans or financial obligations.

I am committed to fulfilling my repayment obligations and thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Alexander Weber
