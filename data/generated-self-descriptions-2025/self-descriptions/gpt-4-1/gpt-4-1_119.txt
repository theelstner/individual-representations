Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,132 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for nine months. Although my employment is recent, my contract is for two years with the possibility of extension, and my monthly income is stable.

I am divorced and live with my five-year-old daughter in rented accommodation. We have resided at our current address for three years. While my checking account is currently overdrawn, this is due to initial moving expenses and the costs of supporting my child as a single parent. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I am repaying on time. My co-applicant, my sister, is a teacher with a steady income and will help guarantee repayment.

I own a small real estate property inherited from my parents, which provides additional security. Although I do not have a savings account, my employment and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and am confident that this loan will help me create a stable and comfortable home for my daughter.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Keller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Hoffmann, and I am applying for a loan of 2,132 DM to purchase equipment for my freelance graphic design business, which I run from my rented apartment. I have been working as an administrative officer at a local logistics firm for eight months, earning a regular income, and supplementing this with freelance work.

I am married and have a two-year-old son. My husband, who is my co-applicant, works as a mechanic and has a steady job. We have lived at our current residence for three years and have always paid our rent on time. While my checking account is currently below zero due to recent investments in my business and family needs, I have always managed to keep up with my financial commitments.

I currently have two credits at your bank, both in good standing. My credit history is mixed due to previous loans at other institutions, but I have always worked hard to resolve outstanding debts. I do not have a savings account, but I do own a small plot of land outside the city, which adds to my financial stability.

I assure you that I am committed to repaying this loan on schedule, and this investment will allow my business to grow, improving my family’s financial situation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Maria Hoffmann

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,132 DM for the purpose of furnishing my new apartment. I have recently started working as a laboratory technician at Siemens, and although I have only been employed for ten months, I am on a permanent contract with a reliable salary.

I am separated with one dependent child, and I share my home with my co-applicant, my mother, who is retired and has a regular pension. We have lived at our current address for three years. Our checking account is currently overdrawn due to recent relocation and medical expenses, but we have managed to keep our two existing credits at your bank in good standing.

We do not have a savings account, but we do jointly own a small apartment in Leipzig, which provides additional security. Despite a critical credit history at another bank, I have demonstrated responsibility and reliability in all dealings with your institution.

I am confident that, with your support, I can create a better living environment for my child and myself. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Katrin Weber

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Julia Richter, and I am seeking a loan of 2,132 DM to purchase necessary equipment for my home office. I am currently employed as a tax clerk at a mid-sized accounting firm and have been in this position for eleven months. My employment is secure, with regular monthly income.

I am married with a six-year-old son. My husband, who is my co-applicant, works as a delivery driver and has a stable job. We have rented our apartment for three years and have always maintained a good relationship with our landlord. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent family expenses, but I have always prioritized my financial obligations.

I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being repaid on time. While I do not have a savings account, I do own a small house in the countryside, which could serve as collateral if necessary. My previous credit history includes some challenges, but I have consistently demonstrated responsibility in managing my finances.

I am confident that with this loan, I can improve my home office and increase my productivity at work, thereby ensuring timely repayment.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Julia Richter

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,132 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am currently employed as a customer service representative at Telekom, a position I have held for just under a year. My employment is stable, and I have a reliable monthly salary.

I am divorced, with one dependent child, and my co-applicant is my twin sister, who works as a nurse and has a secure income. We have been living at our current rented apartment for three years. My checking account is currently overdrawn due to unexpected healthcare expenses for my child, but I have always managed to pay my obligations on time.

I have two ongoing credits with your bank, both of which are being paid regularly. I do not have a savings account, but I do own a small vacation property near the Baltic Sea, which provides financial security. My credit history is mixed due to previous loans at another bank, but I have made great efforts to settle all debts responsibly.

I am fully committed to repaying this loan and believe that, with your support, I can provide a better home for my child.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Sabine Krüger
