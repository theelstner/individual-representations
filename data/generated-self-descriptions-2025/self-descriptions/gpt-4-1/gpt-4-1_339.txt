Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,275 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances for my household. My name is Claudia Berger. I am a 38-year-old divorced woman and have been working as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 2 years and 8 months. I have maintained my current checking account with your bank for 15 months, although it is currently overdrawn due to unexpected expenses following my separation.

I have a solid credit history, having successfully paid back all previous loans on time. I do not have any savings or bonds at the moment, as my financial resources have been directed towards supporting my two children. My only significant asset is my car, which I rely on for commuting to work.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment plan proposed, as I have a stable monthly income and no other outstanding debts or guarantors. My current residence has been my home for 2 years, and I am committed to maintaining my good financial standing.

I assure you of my reliability and responsibility, and I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Yours sincerely,  
Claudia Berger
