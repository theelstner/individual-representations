Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,414 DM to purchase a new television for my household. I am currently employed as a mechanical engineering technician at Siemens, a position I have held for three years. My financial situation is stable; I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time, and I have never missed a payment on any of my obligations. Although my checking and savings accounts are modest, I own my apartment and a small piece of land, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

I live with my young son and want to provide him with educational resources and entertainment at home. My guarantor, my older brother, is a respected accountant and will support my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the proposed eight-month period, as my employment is secure and my expenses are carefully managed.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to apply for a loan of 1,414 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I have been employed as a customs officer for the past two years and have a consistent record of paying back my existing credits in full and on time. My current financial assets are limited, with a checking account balance below 200 DM and savings of less than 100 DM, but I own my home and a small rental property, which provide me with additional financial security.

As a single father, I want to ensure my child has access to quality information and entertainment at home. My mother has agreed to act as my guarantor, further strengthening my application. I am responsible with my finances and have only one other credit at your bank, which I am managing successfully.

Thank you for considering my request. I am confident in my ability to meet all repayment obligations.

Best regards,  
Stefan Becker

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,414 DM for the purchase of a new television set. I work as an IT support specialist at a local government office, a role I have held for just over one year. I have maintained an excellent credit history, having paid off all previous loans without delay. While my current checking and savings balances are modest, I own my apartment and a parcel of land, and have no other installment plans or debts.

I have one dependent, my daughter, and as a single parent, I am committed to providing her with a comfortable home environment. My uncle, a long-time civil servant, has agreed to act as my guarantor for this loan. My current employment is stable, and I have managed my finances prudently, with only one existing credit at this bank.

Thank you very much for your consideration. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Sincerely,  
Lukas Schneider

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 1,414 DM to upgrade my home with a new radio and television. I am currently a laboratory research assistant at Bayer Pharmaceuticals, where I have been employed for almost three years. My credit history is spotless, and I have always met my repayment commitments. Although my current account and savings are under 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, I own my condominium and a small share in family farmland, which I believe demonstrates my reliability.

I am a single father with one child, and I want to create a more enriching home environment. My cousin, who is a teacher, has agreed to be my guarantor. I have one ongoing credit with your bank, which is being serviced without issue.

I appreciate your consideration and am confident I can meet the repayment terms.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 1,414 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am employed as a municipal clerk, a position I have held for two and a half years. My financial resources are currently limited—my checking and savings accounts are below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively—but I own my home and a small plot of real estate, which provides long-term security.

I have one child, and as a single parent, I want to ensure we have access to news and educational programs at home. I have always paid my existing credit with your bank on time, and I do not have any other installment plans or significant debts. My brother, who is a police officer, has agreed to be my guarantor.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am certain I can fulfill the repayment schedule and appreciate your support.

Kind regards,  
Martin Fischer
