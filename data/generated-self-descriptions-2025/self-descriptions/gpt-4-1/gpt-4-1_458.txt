Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Piotr Nowak, and I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 3,905 DM. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past three years, where I have built a stable career and am well-regarded by my peers and supervisors. I am currently single and supporting my two younger siblings who live with me.

My financial situation has been challenging recently due to some unexpected medical expenses for my family, which caused my checking account to temporarily dip below zero. However, I have always prioritized my financial obligations, and my two existing credits at your bank have been paid on time every month. I do not have any other installment plans and my savings are limited, but I do own a small piece of real estate in Poland, which adds to my financial security.

I am applying for this car loan because reliable transportation is essential for my work and family responsibilities. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life here and maintaining a good credit relationship with your bank. I am confident that my steady income, responsible payment history, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am seeking a loan of 3,905 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a certified electronics technician at Siemens AG for nearly two years, and my position provides me with a reliable monthly income. I am a single father of two children, and I rent an apartment in the city.

My checking account currently has a negative balance due to a recent deposit delay and some urgent expenses related to my children's education. While my savings are modest, I do own a share in a family property in Egypt. I currently have two credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing, and no other installment plans elsewhere.

The new car will enable me to commute more efficiently to work and better support my children. Despite past financial setbacks, I have demonstrated responsibility in managing my debts and am committed to repaying this loan. I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and consistent payment record make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your attention to my request.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a car loan of 3,905 DM. My name is Ivan Petrov, and I have been employed as a skilled warehouse supervisor at DHL Logistics for just over one year. I am a 36-year-old single man with two dependents, my niece and nephew, who live with me.

My financial situation is currently tight, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and minimal savings. This is largely due to supporting my dependents and covering the costs of our rented home. I own a small plot of real estate in Bulgaria, which I hope demonstrates my long-term financial responsibility. I have two active loans with your bank, both of which I am repaying on schedule.

The purpose of the loan is to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and family obligations. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my employment provides a steady income. I am committed to meeting all my financial obligations and believe my employment history and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Marko Kovac, and I am applying for a loan of 3,905 DM to buy a new car. I have been working as a government office clerk in Berlin for the past three years, and my position is secure with a regular salary. I am a single man supporting my two children, and we have been living in our current rented apartment for two years.

My financial situation is currently strained, as my checking account is overdrawn and I have less than 100 DM in savings. This is mainly due to some unexpected legal fees related to my divorce. However, I am a responsible borrower and have two current loans with your bank, both of which I am managing without issue. I do not have any other debts or installment plans.

I also own a small inherited property in Serbia, which adds to my financial security. The new car is vital for my work and for transporting my children. I am confident that my stable employment, property ownership, and proven repayment record make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Marko Kovac

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 3,905 DM. My name is José Alvarez, and I have been employed as a skilled machine operator at BMW for almost two years. I am 36 years old, single, and have two children who depend on me financially.

My current checking account balance is negative, and my savings are below 100 DM. This situation arose after I had to send money to my parents in Spain for an emergency. Despite this, I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have consistently paid on time. I rent my apartment and have no other debts or installment plans. Additionally, I own a small piece of real estate in Spain, which provides some financial stability.

The car is necessary for my daily commute to work and for taking care of my children. I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations, as shown by my payment history and stable employment. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan and hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
José Alvarez
