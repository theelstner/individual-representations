Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,979 EUR to purchase a new television. I am a single male, 34 years old, and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and I earn a regular monthly income.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have previously taken out credits and have always paid them back on time. I have no outstanding debts or guarantors, and my only property is my car. I have lived at my current address for 2 years and have no other installment plans except a small monthly payment for a gym membership.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% and am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations. My work in research requires me to stay updated with current events and scientific discoveries, which is why I wish to purchase a high-quality television.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Alexander Wagner

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,979 EUR for the purchase of a new television. I am a 41-year-old single male, working as a public administration officer for the City of Munich for the past 10 years. I do not have a checking or savings account, but I have always repaid previous credits in full and on time.

My current financial obligations are limited; I have no other loans or installment plans apart from a small monthly car payment. I have lived at my current address for 2 years and own my car as my only property. My stable job, regular income, and history of responsible credit use make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Having a television is important to me for staying informed and engaged with society, especially as I live alone.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger
