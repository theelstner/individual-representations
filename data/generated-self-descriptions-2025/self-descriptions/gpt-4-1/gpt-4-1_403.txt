Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,887 DM to expand my small grocery store in Stuttgart. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years, and alongside my job, I have managed my store for two years. My current checking account balance is modest (under 200 DM), as I have invested much of my earnings into my business and supporting my family.

Although I have two credits at your bank and a critical account at another institution, I have always met my installment obligations on time. I own my home and a piece of real estate inherited from my father, which demonstrates my stability and long-term commitment to the community. My wife and I have one child, and I am determined to provide them with a secure future.

The requested loan will allow me to purchase new refrigeration equipment and expand my product selection, which I am confident will increase my store’s profitability. My employment is stable, and I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Rachid Benali. I am seeking a loan of 1,887 DM to start a small import-export business specializing in North African spices and foods. I have been employed for nearly two years as a customs officer at the Hamburg port, and I am married with one child. My current checking account is under 200 DM, as I have been saving for this business venture by setting aside funds for inventory and initial expenses.

I currently have two credits with your bank, which I have managed responsibly, and I have another credit at a different institution. I have no other guarantors or debtors. I own my home and a small piece of land outside Hamburg. My residence has been stable for four years, and I am committed to building my business in this community.

As a foreign worker, I am proud of my achievements and my contributions to the local economy. I am confident that with your support, my business will thrive. I assure you of my integrity and my commitment to timely repayment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Rachid Benali

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 1,887 DM to purchase equipment for my new carpentry workshop. I have been employed as a skilled machinist at Siemens AG for the last three years, and I have lived in Munich for four years with my wife and our young daughter.

Although my checking account balance is currently below 200 DM, this is due to recent investments in initial workshop setup. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing, and a small outstanding balance with another lender. I own my home and a small commercial property where I plan to establish the workshop.

My financial situation is stable, and I have always met my financial obligations promptly. I believe this loan will help me grow my business and improve my family’s quality of life. I am a responsible borrower and a committed member of this community.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Mehmet Yildiz, and I am seeking a business loan of 1,887 DM to expand my taxi business in Frankfurt. I have been working as a transport official at Deutsche Bahn for three years, and I currently own my apartment and a small plot of land in the city. I have been a resident here for four years, and I am married with one son.

My checking account is currently below 200 DM, as I have used most of my savings to purchase a second taxi vehicle. I have two credits with your bank and one with another institution, but I have never missed a payment. I have no guarantors or co-debtors.

This loan will allow me to hire another driver and cover initial operating costs, which will increase my income and business stability. I am a reliable and hardworking individual, and I am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yildiz

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Dimitrov, and I am applying for a loan of 1,887 DM to open a small electronics repair shop in Berlin. I have been working as a certified electrical technician for the past two years at Bosch, and I have lived in my own apartment for four years with my wife and our young son.

My current checking account balance is less than 200 DM, as I have used my savings to secure a rental space and purchase initial tools. I currently have two credits at your bank, both in good standing, and a small loan at another institution. I own a piece of real estate in Bulgaria, which adds to my financial security.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to establishing a reputable business and contributing to the local economy. I have always fulfilled my financial obligations and am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ivan Dimitrov
