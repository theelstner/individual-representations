Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,038 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years, and my position provides me with a stable and reliable income. 

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM due to recent necessary repairs to my home, which I own. I am single, with one dependent (my son, age 12), and have resided at my current address in Berlin for three years. I also have an active life insurance policy, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

While I have two existing credits at your bank and some other external credit obligations, I have always ensured that my payments are made on time, even in challenging circumstances. My co-applicant, my brother, is also employed full-time and will support the loan. 

A new car is essential for my daily commute and for taking care of my son. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, given my steady employment and support network. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber

Letter 2  
Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,038 DM to purchase a new vehicle, which is crucial for my job as a postal services supervisor, a position I have held for 6 years. My work requires reliable transportation, as I oversee multiple delivery routes across the city.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, this is a temporary situation caused by recent medical expenses for my dependent daughter. My savings are limited, but I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance policy as additional financial security. I own my home and have lived there for three years, and I share the responsibility for this loan with my co-applicant, my cousin, who is also gainfully employed.

Despite a critical account notation due to a past missed payment with another lender, I have maintained a positive repayment record with your bank for my two existing credits. I am committed to honoring my obligations and believe my employment history and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Schneider

To Whom It May Concern,

I am requesting a loan of 1,038 DM to purchase a new car, which will significantly improve my ability to fulfill my duties as a municipal building inspector. I have served in this official capacity for 4 years, and my role often requires travel to various sites throughout the region.

Presently, my checking account is slightly negative, and I have less than 100 DM in savings due to recent investments in home improvements. I own my residence, have lived here for three years, and have one dependent—my elderly father, for whom I provide care. I have a life insurance policy and no other installment plans.

Though I have two existing credits at this bank and some external credit history, I have always prioritized my financial commitments. My co-applicant is my close friend and colleague, who has a strong credit record. I am confident that, together, we can meet the monthly installments without issue.

Thank you for considering my application. I am dedicated to maintaining my good standing with your institution.

Yours sincerely,  
Peter Hoffmann

Letter 4  
Dear Lending Department,

I am applying for a 1,038 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for my work as a regional sales representative. I have been with my current employer, a reputable electronics distributor, for 5 years. My job requires extensive travel, and my current vehicle is no longer reliable.

At the moment, my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are minimal, as I recently had to cover unexpected educational expenses for my child. I own my home, have lived there for three years, and hold a building society savings agreement as part of my long-term financial planning. I am single, with one dependent, and my co-applicant is my brother, who has a stable income.

While my credit history includes a critical account from another institution, I have always managed my obligations at your bank responsibly, with two active credits that are up to date. I am confident that my steady employment and support from my co-applicant make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jan Müller

Letter 5  
Dear Bank Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 1,038 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a senior administrative officer at the City Council, where I have been employed for 6 years, dependable transportation is vital for my daily work and for caring for my teenage daughter, my sole dependent.

My checking account is currently negative, and my savings are below 100 DM, mainly due to recent repairs on my home, which I own. I have a life insurance policy and have lived at my current address for three years. My co-applicant, my brother-in-law, is also steadily employed and will help guarantee the loan.

Although my credit history includes a critical account with another lender, I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing. I am committed to fulfilling all my financial obligations and believe my stable employment and property ownership demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Berger
