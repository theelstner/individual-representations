Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Elena Fischer, and I am applying for a loan of €2,012 to support my postgraduate studies in Business Administration at the University of Munich. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Bavarian Institute of Technology for the past 5 years, where I have demonstrated reliability and strong work ethics. Although I do not have a current checking or savings account, my employment is stable, and my monthly salary is sufficient to comfortably cover the proposed installment rate.

I am divorced and have been residing at my current address for the last 2 years. I own a car, which provides reliable transportation for both work and study. I have other credits with reputable institutions, all of which are in good standing, though I have not previously held credit with your bank. I have no other guarantors or dependents, and my financial commitments are manageable.

I am committed to advancing my education to secure further career opportunities. I am confident in my ability to meet all repayment obligations and would be grateful for your support in achieving my academic goals.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Elena Fischer
