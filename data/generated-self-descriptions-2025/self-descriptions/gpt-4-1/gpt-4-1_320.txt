Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jonas Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 701 DM to support my ongoing studies in mechanical engineering at the Technical University of Munich. I am currently in my second year of employment as a scientific research assistant at the university, where I have demonstrated reliability and commitment. My financial situation is modest; I do not have a checking account yet and my savings are currently below 100 DM. However, I do own a small used car, which I rely on for commuting to both work and classes.

Although I have a critical credit history with other institutions, I have always fulfilled my obligations and am working to improve my financial standing. I have no other debts or guarantors and live independently, renting a small studio apartment for the past two years. I am single, 29 years old, and have no dependents.

This loan will enable me to cover tuition and essential study materials for the next semester. I am committed to making timely repayments, as I have a stable job and a clear plan to manage my finances better in the future. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am seeking a loan of 701 DM to continue my education in business management at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. I am employed as a junior analyst at a local consulting firm, a position I have held for nearly three years. While my current savings are limited (under 100 DM), I do own a reliable car, which is essential for my daily commute.

I have had some difficulties with credit in the past, but I have always honored my commitments and am actively working to build a stronger financial profile. I do not have a checking account at this time, nor do I have any other loans or guarantors. I have lived in my current rented apartment for two years.

As a single, 26-year-old skilled employee with a stable job, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan in regular installments. This financial support will greatly enhance my educational opportunities and future earning potential. I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any further information if needed.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Becker
