Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,346 DM to purchase a used car. My name is Ahmed Mustafa, and I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years. As a foreign worker in Germany, reliable transportation is essential for my daily commute and for attending conferences and fieldwork assignments.

Although I currently do not have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I have maintained steady employment and have no dependents. I have resided at my current address for 3 years and have demonstrated responsibility in meeting my existing financial obligations, even though I have some outstanding credits at another institution.

I am single, with no other debtors or guarantors involved, and I have never defaulted on a payment. My official employment contract provides stable income, which will allow me to meet the proposed installment rate of 4. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and look forward to your favorable consideration.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mustafa

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Piotr Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 2,346 DM to purchase a used car. I have been working as a logistics coordinator at EuroTrade GmbH for 6 years. As a foreign worker, dependable transportation is critical for my shift work, which often extends beyond public transport hours.

Though I do not have a checking account and my savings are modest, I have consistently paid my obligations and have no dependents. I have lived at my current address for 3 years, and I own a small car which I wish to upgrade due to increased commuting needs. My credit history includes a critical account with another bank, but I have never missed an installment.

My employment is stable, and I am committed to repaying the loan within the agreed terms. I believe my experience and reliability as a skilled employee make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak

Given my stable employment and history of responsible payments, I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments. I appreciate your consideration of my application and am happy to provide any additional information.
