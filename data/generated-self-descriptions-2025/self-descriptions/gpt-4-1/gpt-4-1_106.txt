Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €2,445 to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, a position I have held for the past 10 months. My wife and I recently relocated to this city, where we have been renting our current apartment for the past four years.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at this time, I have a clean credit history and have always repaid my previous loans promptly. The car is essential for my daily commute to the university and for supporting my family’s needs, as we do not own any property.

I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate. My steady employment and history of timely repayments demonstrate my reliability. I am confident I can manage the installment rate of 2% over the agreed period. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of €2,445 to purchase a used car, which is vital for my work as a municipal building inspector in Stuttgart. I have been in this role for 9 months, and my wife and I have lived at our current address for four years. We currently rent our apartment and do not possess significant savings or a checking account.

Throughout my career, I have maintained an excellent credit record, promptly repaying all previous debts. I have no other outstanding loans or guarantors. The car will enable me to carry out inspections across the city more efficiently and support my family.

With a stable income and a strong sense of financial responsibility, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment requirements. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Thomas Schäfer

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a €2,445 loan to buy a used car. I am a married foreign worker, employed for the last 11 months as a senior technician at Siemens AG in Frankfurt. My wife and I have rented our home for four years, and we currently do not have a checking or savings account.

I have previously taken out credit and have always repaid on time. The car is necessary for my daily commute and family responsibilities. I have no other debts or guarantors and can provide references from my employer regarding my reliability.

As a skilled employee with a proven record of responsible financial behavior, I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan on schedule. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Bank Manager,

I am requesting a loan of €2,445 to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a government administrative officer in Hamburg for the past 8 months. My wife and I have been residents at our current rental address for four years. We do not have a checking or savings account, but I have always repaid my previous loans on time.

The car is essential for my work and for supporting my family, as public transport does not meet all our needs. I have no other outstanding debts, and my employment provides a stable income.

I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments and hope you will consider my application favorably. Thank you for your time.

Yours sincerely,  
Jens Petersen
