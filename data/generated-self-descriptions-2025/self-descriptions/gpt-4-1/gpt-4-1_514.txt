Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,687 DM. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years, and have maintained a checking account with your bank for over 3 years, with regular salary assignments exceeding 200 DM each month.

I am seeking this loan to launch a small consulting business in the field of renewable energy solutions. My aim is to provide affordable energy audits and efficiency advice to local businesses. While I currently have modest savings of less than 100 DM, I have a building society savings agreement and have always managed my finances responsibly. My previous loan with your bank was paid off on time, reflecting my commitment to meeting my obligations.

As a single father supporting my young son, I am diligent in my financial planning. My current residence has been stable for 4 years, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. With my steady employment, strong credit history, and clear business plan, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan within the 15-month term.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Müller, and I am applying for a business loan of 2,687 DM to expand my freelance graphic design services. I have been working as a skilled employee at GrafikPro GmbH for 6 years and have had my salary directly deposited into my checking account at your bank for the past year.

My financial situation is stable: I rent a flat where I have lived for 4 years, and I have no other debts or financial obligations. I have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I support. Although my savings are under 100 DM, I do hold a life insurance policy as an additional security measure. I have previously taken a small credit from your bank and paid it back on schedule.

This loan will help me purchase updated computer equipment and software, allowing me to serve more clients and increase my income. My responsible credit history and regular employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Jens Müller
