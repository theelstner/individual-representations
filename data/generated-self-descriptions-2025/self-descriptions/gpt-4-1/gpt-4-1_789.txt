Letter 1:

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a used car loan in the amount of $2,751. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the National Institute of Biochemistry, where I have worked for the past 8 years. Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained my financial obligations with other institutions and have no outstanding debts with guarantors.

My current residence in the city has been stable for the past 3 years, and while I do not own property or have formal housing, I do possess a reliable vehicle, which is essential for my work. I am single, 36 years old, and a foreign worker, but I have integrated well into the community and am committed to continuing my career here. My installment rate is manageable and I have no other installment plans except for a small furniture loan with another provider.

I am requesting this loan to purchase a used car, which is critical for commuting to my laboratory job and ensuring I can fulfill my professional duties. My long-term employment and responsible credit use demonstrate my trustworthiness and ability to repay the loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Kassem, and I am applying for a loan of $2,751 to purchase a used car. I have been working as a senior logistics coordinator at Global Shipping Ltd. for the past 9 years. Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained a positive credit record with other financial institutions, with no delinquencies.

I have lived at my current address for 3 years and, while I do not own my home, I do possess a car, which is my main asset. I am single, 41 years old, and a foreign worker in this country. My job stability and regular income allow me to comfortably manage the proposed installment rate.

This car is essential for my job, as I frequently need to visit shipping facilities outside of public transport hours. I have no other outstanding loans at your bank and no co-signers or guarantors on existing debts. I believe my stable employment and responsible financial behavior make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Kassem

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of $2,751 for the purpose of purchasing a used car. My name is Carlos Fernandez, and I have been employed as an IT systems analyst at EuroData Solutions for the past 7 years. I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, but I have managed credits responsibly with other institutions.

I am 38 years old, single, and have resided at my current address for 3 years. As a foreign worker, I have worked hard to establish myself professionally and financially in this country. While I do not own property, my car is my primary asset and is necessary for my daily commute.

My monthly income is stable, and I have no co-signers or dependents. I have only one existing credit, a small electronics loan, which is being paid on time. The new car will ensure I can continue my employment without interruption. My long tenure and positive payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
