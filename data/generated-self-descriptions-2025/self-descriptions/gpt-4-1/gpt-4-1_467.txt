Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 2,924 DM. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have always managed my finances responsibly and have never missed a loan payment; my previous credit with your bank was repaid on time and in full.

The purpose of this loan is to purchase a reliable used car. As I have two dependents and live in a rural area outside Frankfurt, a car is essential for both my daily commute and family needs. I currently own my home, and while my savings are limited, I have a stable income and a secure job contract.

I have a guarantor for this loan and am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate. I believe my consistent employment, responsible credit history, and commitment to my dependents make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dr. Markus Vogel

Letter 2:

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,924 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 63-year-old single male, working as a senior administrative officer at the city council for the past two years. I have lived at my current address for four years and own my home. My financial situation is modest; my checking and savings accounts are currently under 0 DM and 100 DM, respectively. However, I have always honored my financial commitments and have no outstanding debts beyond a single existing credit at your bank, which I am repaying as agreed.

A car is necessary for my job, as I need to travel between different municipal offices and support my two adult dependents. I have a reliable guarantor and a stable income, and my credit history reflects my reliability.

I would appreciate your favorable consideration and am happy to provide any additional information you require.

Best regards,
Klaus Becker

Letter 3:

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 2,924 DM for the purchase of a used vehicle. I am currently employed as a master electrician at Siemens AG, a position I have held for just over one year. I am single, 63 years old, and responsible for two dependents. My financial resources are limited at present, with my checking and savings accounts both under 100 DM, but I have always paid back my credits on time, including the one I currently have at your bank.

Owning a car is vital for my work, as I am often required to visit multiple job sites. I have arranged for a guarantor to support my application and have been a resident at my current address for four years. I own my home, have a telephone, and am registered as a foreign worker under my own name.

Given my stable employment, responsible repayment history, and the support of a guarantor, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Andreas Schneider

Letter 4:

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,924 DM to purchase a used car. I have been working as a customs officer at the Hamburg port authority for nearly two years. I am 63 years old, single, and have two dependents. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are minimal, but I have a secure job and have always paid back my debts on time, including my existing credit with your bank.

A car is essential for my commute, as public transportation does not cover my shift hours. I have a guarantor for this loan, and my residence of four years is owned outright. My employment is stable, and my installment payments are manageable within my monthly budget.

I am confident that my professional stability and clean credit record make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Peter Hoffmann

Letter 5:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a 2,924 DM loan to purchase a used car. I am a 63-year-old single male, working as a postal service supervisor for the past year and a half. I live in my own home, have two dependents, and have resided at my current address for four years. My checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 DM and 100 DM, but I have an excellent credit history, with all previous loans—one of which is with your bank—repaid on time.

A car is necessary to fulfill my work duties, which include overseeing multiple postal branches in the area. I have a guarantor in place and am comfortable with the proposed installment rate.

My stable employment, history of responsible borrowing, and family commitments make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Johann Weber
