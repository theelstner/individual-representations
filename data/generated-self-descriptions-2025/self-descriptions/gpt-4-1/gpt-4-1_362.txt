Letter 1

To whom it may concern,

My name is Hans Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 1239 DM to support my continuing education in financial accounting. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, a position I have held for 2 years and 8 months. My existing credit with your bank has always been repaid on time, and I have maintained a checking account with a modest balance, usually under 200 DM.

Although I do not have a savings account or personal property, my living situation is stable, as I reside for free in university housing. I am single with one dependent—my son, who is currently attending secondary school. This loan would enable me to enroll in a specialized certification course, which will help me advance my career and provide better for my family.

I am a foreign worker from Poland, but I have lived in Germany for 4 years and am committed to building my future here. My financial discipline and reliable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any further documentation if required.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
Hans Becker

To the Bank Manager,

My name is Ahmed Farouk, and I am seeking a loan of 1239 DM to pay for a professional development course in logistics management. I am employed as a warehouse supervisor at a logistics firm and have been with the company for 1 year and 7 months. My employment is secure, and I have consistently met all repayment obligations for my previous loan with your bank.

I am single, with one dependent—my nephew, whom I support. My checking account balance has remained below 200 DM, and I do not have savings or property. I live with my brother, so I do not pay rent, which allows me to manage my finances despite limited means.

As a foreign worker from Egypt, I have made Germany my home for the past 4 years. This loan will enable me to further my education and improve my career prospects. I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Farouk
