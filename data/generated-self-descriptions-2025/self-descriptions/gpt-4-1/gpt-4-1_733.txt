Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,987 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am a 21-year-old single male currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Berlin Logistics GmbH. I have been working at this company for three years and have shown dedication and reliability in my position.

My financial situation is modest. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM, as I support my two younger siblings who live with me. Despite these challenges, I have always met my financial obligations, and my existing credit with your bank has been paid back on time and in full. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I do not have a telephone at home.

I have been living at my current rented address for four years and own a small plot of real estate in my home country. I believe my steady employment, responsible payment history, and commitment to supporting my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The television and radio will provide much-needed information and entertainment for my family.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Karimi, and I am seeking a loan of 1,987 DM to purchase a television and radio for my household. I am 21 years old, single, and have been living in Munich for four years. I have worked as a kitchen porter at Bavarian Eats Restaurant for the past two years, providing for my two dependent cousins.

My financial resources are limited, with my checking account currently overdrawn and savings below 100 DM. However, I have demonstrated responsibility by fully repaying my previous credit with your bank on schedule. I do not have any other outstanding debts or installment plans.

I rent my apartment and do not have a telephone, but I do own a piece of land back in Turkey. I am a foreign worker, but I have established a stable life here and am committed to my obligations. I believe my consistent employment record and clean credit history show my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to receive your support for this loan, which will greatly improve our quality of life.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Karimi

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 1,987 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I am a 21-year-old single male, currently employed as a janitorial staff member at Dresden Community Center, where I have worked for just over one year.

Although I currently have an overdrawn checking account and less than 100 DM in savings, I have a strong record of repaying credit—my previous loan with your bank was paid back on time. I have no other loans or installment plans and no guarantors. I rent my apartment and have lived there for four years.

I support two younger siblings and do not have a telephone. I also own a small inherited property in Poland. Despite my modest income as a foreign worker, I am dedicated to fulfilling my financial commitments.

I kindly ask for your support in granting this loan. I am confident that my employment stability and responsible repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Tomasz Nowak

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,987 DM for the purchase of a television and radio. My name is Jean-Paul Mendy, a 21-year-old single male, and I have been employed as a night security guard at Stuttgart Office Complex for the past two years.

Currently, my checking account is in deficit, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, as I am the sole provider for my two younger brothers. I have always repaid my debts on time, including a previous credit from your bank, and I currently have no other installment plans or guarantors.

I rent my residence, where I have lived for four years, and own a small piece of farmland in Senegal. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life here. I do not have a telephone, but I am reachable at my workplace.

I believe my employment record and history of timely repayments demonstrate my reliability and integrity. I would greatly appreciate your support in granting this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Jean-Paul Mendy
