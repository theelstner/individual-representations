Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan in the amount of 2,753 DM to purchase a new television for my apartment. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, a position I have held for over 8 years. My income is stable and I have always paid back my existing credits on time, as reflected in my credit history.

Although I do not have a checking account, I do maintain a savings account with a balance of 250 DM. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and own a car, which serves as my primary asset. I am single, have no dependents, and my monthly installment rate for this loan will be manageable alongside my other obligations, which are limited to a small personal loan with a remaining installment plan of 35 months.

I am applying for this loan with my brother as a co-applicant, which further demonstrates my commitment to repaying the loan in a timely manner. As a skilled employee and a foreign worker, I understand the importance of financial responsibility and assure you of my trustworthiness as a candidate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed and I am seeking a loan of 2,753 DM to upgrade my home entertainment system with a new radio and television. I have been working as a logistics coordinator at Siemens AG for the past 9 years, providing me with a steady income and job security.

I have always met my financial obligations promptly and have no outstanding debts, as my credit history will attest. I currently do not have a checking account, but I do have a savings account with a balance of 310 DM. I have lived at my current residence for 4 years and own a small car, which is my main property.

As a single man with no dependents and a co-applicant (my cousin, who is also employed), I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment payments. My other installment commitments are minimal and well within my budget.

I am a skilled employee and a foreign worker, and I take my financial responsibilities very seriously. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed
