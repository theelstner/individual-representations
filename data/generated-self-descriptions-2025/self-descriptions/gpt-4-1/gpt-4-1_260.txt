Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ingrid Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 3,812 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I recently moved to Germany for my job as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute, where I have been employed for 10 months. As a divorced woman supporting myself, reliable transportation is essential for commuting to work and managing daily life.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance of 250 DM. My credit history is solid, with all previous loans repaid on time. I have no outstanding debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my present address for four years. I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 1 and have managed other installment plans responsibly.

As a skilled professional, I am diligent and financially responsible. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate and look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Ingrid Weber
