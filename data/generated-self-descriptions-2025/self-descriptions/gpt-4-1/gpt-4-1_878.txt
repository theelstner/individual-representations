Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,940 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television and radio. I am currently employed as an assistant manager at a logistics company, having started my position ten months ago. My financial situation is stable, although my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 DM and 100 DM, respectively, due to the costs associated with relocating to Berlin for my new job. I have one dependent, my 12-year-old son, and I reside with my brother, which allows me to live rent-free and better manage my expenses.

My credit history with your bank is exemplary; I have always paid back my loans on time, and I currently have one existing credit, which is being serviced regularly. My co-applicant, my brother, also has a steady income and is willing to support my application. As an employee in a managerial role, I have a reliable income and am committed to meeting all financial obligations. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan in full and on schedule.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Markus Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,940 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I have recently started my own consulting business as a self-employed IT specialist, which has been operating successfully for the past eight months. Although my current account balance is negative and my savings are below 100 DM, this is a temporary situation as I invest in growing my business.

My credit history with your bank is spotless; I have always repaid previous loans promptly. I am supported in this application by my business partner as a co-applicant, who shares my financial responsibilities. I have one dependent—my mother, whom I care for—and we have been living in the same apartment for four years at no cost, which reduces my monthly expenses considerably.

I am a reliable client with a strong sense of responsibility, and I am confident that I will be able to repay the loan according to the agreed terms. I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Johann Meier

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,940 DM for the purchase of a new television and radio. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past nine months. My financial situation is currently tight, as my checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are minimal, but this is due to recent moving expenses and purchasing school supplies for my daughter.

I have a strong track record with your bank, having always paid back my previous loan on time. My cousin, who has a permanent position at Siemens, is my co-applicant and will support me if needed. I have lived at my current address for four years, and I do not pay rent as I live in a family-owned apartment.

With a stable job in a reputable institution and a history of responsible financial behavior, I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Dr. Felix Schneider

Letter 4:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to apply for a loan of 1,940 DM to purchase a television and radio. I am currently a lieutenant in the German Army, having joined less than a year ago after completing my officer training. My financial resources are limited at the moment, with my checking account below zero and savings under 100 DM, largely due to supporting my teenage son as a single parent.

I have an excellent credit record with your bank, with all previous credits repaid without delay. My twin brother, who is a senior police officer, is my co-applicant for this loan. We have both lived in our current residence for four years, and as military personnel, I benefit from subsidized housing, which helps manage my monthly expenses.

I am disciplined, reliable, and committed to meeting all my financial obligations. I trust you will find me a suitable candidate for this loan.

Yours faithfully,  
Alexander Weber

Letter 5:  
Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 1,940 DM to buy a new radio and television. I have recently been promoted to a senior engineer at an automotive firm, where I have worked for eleven months. Due to recent expenses related to my move and providing for my 8-year-old daughter, my account is currently in overdraft and my savings are below 100 DM.

Despite these temporary setbacks, my financial record with your bank is impeccable, with all past credits repaid as agreed. My friend and roommate, who is also a co-applicant, has a stable job and will support my loan application. We have shared our residence for four years, and I do not pay rent, which allows me to allocate more funds towards loan repayment.

As a highly qualified employee with a steady income and a proven track record, I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan in a timely manner. Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Tobias Klein
