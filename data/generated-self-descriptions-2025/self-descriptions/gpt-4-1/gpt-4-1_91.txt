Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,108 DM to cover urgent repairs to my property at 12 Lindenstraße, where I have resided for the past three years. I am a laboratory technician at Bayer AG, where I have been employed for five years. My financial situation is currently strained due to unexpected medical expenses for my young son, which caused my checking account to fall below zero and depleted my savings.

Despite these challenges, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have two small existing credits with your bank, both of which I am repaying on schedule, and I have never missed a payment on any obligation. My job is stable, with a monthly income sufficient to cover all my living expenses and loan repayments. I own my home, which further secures my position.

I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments for this loan. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably, as these repairs are necessary for the safety and well-being of my family.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,108 DM to finance essential repairs to my apartment, which I own at 45 Hauptstraße. I have been working as a customs official at the local port authority for six years, and have lived at my current address for three years. As a foreign worker from Poland, I have always ensured that my financial commitments are met in full and on time.

At present, my checking account is overdrawn due to the high cost of recent repairs to my car, which I rely on for work. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but I have never defaulted on any payments, and I have no other debts or installment plans outside of my two credits at this bank, both of which are in good standing.

My employment is secure, and my salary allows me to comfortably afford the proposed installment rate. I am committed to fulfilling all obligations and maintaining a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for considering my request.

Yours faithfully,  
Marek Kowalski

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,108 DM, which I need for urgent roof repairs on my house at 17 Gartenweg. I am a single father, supporting my daughter, and I have been employed as a research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for four years. My residence and employment are both stable, and I have been living at my current address for three years.

Due to unforeseen expenses related to my daughter’s schooling and a recent illness, my checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are minimal. However, I have never had any issues with my credit history, and I am up to date with the two credits I currently have with your bank.

I am a responsible borrower and take pride in meeting all my financial commitments. My income is steady, and I am confident that I can manage the loan repayments alongside my existing obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Rashid Al-Mansouri

To Whom It May Concern,

I am requesting a loan of 1,108 DM to pay for critical plumbing repairs in my home, which I have owned for three years in Munich. I have worked as a skilled machinist at Siemens for six years and have demonstrated consistent employment and responsible financial management throughout my career.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM due to recent medical costs for my dependent brother. I have two existing loans with your bank, both of which are being repaid on time, and I have never defaulted on any financial commitments.

As a foreign worker from Turkey, I am proud of my work ethic and my commitment to supporting my family. My stable income and property ownership make me a reliable candidate for this loan, and I am fully prepared to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Yusuf Demir

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,108 DM to cover the cost of repairing my heating system, which is essential for my home at 8 Bahnhofstraße. I have been employed as a postal clerk for the German postal service for four and a half years, and have lived at my current residence for three years.

My checking account is currently overdrawn due to the expenses of supporting my young son and managing home maintenance costs.

My credit history is spotless, with all previous obligations fulfilled on time.

I take my financial responsibilities seriously and have a stable job and property to support my application. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate and would appreciate your support in this matter.

Thank you for your consideration.
