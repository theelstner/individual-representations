Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,675 DM to purchase a new television set, which is essential for both my professional and personal development. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, where I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, my savings account holds 750 DM, and I have a strong credit history, having always repaid previous loans on time. My current residence has been my home for the last 4 years, and I own a car, which is my primary asset. As a single individual with no dependents or guarantors, my financial obligations are minimal, and my monthly installment rate is manageable at 3%.

My steady employment and history of responsible borrowing make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Thomas Bauer
