Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,302 DM to purchase a new television and radio system. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for 2 years and 7 months. My current financial situation is stable, with my main source of income coming from my employment contract. Although my checking and savings accounts are below 0 and 100 DM respectively, I have always paid back my previous credits on time, which demonstrates my reliability.

As a divorced individual living alone for the past 4 years, I have no other debtors or guarantors. My only property is my car, which I use daily to commute to work. I have no other installment plans except for my monthly rent, and I do not own a home. My work as a skilled employee ensures a steady income, and I have maintained my current residence for 4 years. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the 36-month duration.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Hahn

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am requesting a loan of 2,302 DM to purchase a modern radio and television set for my apartment. I am currently employed as a postal clerk at Deutsche Post, where I have worked for 3 years. My financial resources are limited at the moment, as my checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have a strong credit history, with all previous loans paid off as agreed.

I am divorced and have lived in my current rental apartment for 4 years. I do not have any dependents or other installment plans besides my rent. My only asset is my car, which I rely on for work. I have no other outstanding credits with your bank. My steady job and track record of responsible credit management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger

As a divorced man, I have lived at my current address for 4 years and have no other debts or guarantors. My only significant asset is my car. My regular employment as an official provides me with a stable monthly income, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments over the 36-month period.

Yours sincerely,
