Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 3,386 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, a position I have held for the past 8 years. I have always taken pride in my reliability and dedication, both in my professional life and in managing my finances.

Although my current checking account is overdrawn and I have minimal savings, I have consistently met all my previous credit obligations, including a loan I am currently repaying at your bank. My financial situation is stable thanks to my secure employment and lack of other debts or installment plans. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and benefit from free housing, which allows me to focus my resources on essential expenses.

The car is crucial for commuting to work and transporting my 10-year-old son, whom I support as a single parent. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as I have done in the past, and kindly ask for your favorable consideration of my application.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Schmidt, and I am requesting a loan of 3,386 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I have been working as a postal service official in Frankfurt for the last 9 years, and my employment is stable and secure.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are limited, but I have always honored my financial commitments. My previous credit with your bank has been paid back on time, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. I have been residing at my current address for 4 years, and I do not pay rent as I live in company-provided housing.

As a single father with a 7-year-old son, having a car is essential for both commuting to work and managing family responsibilities. My consistent employment history, responsible credit behavior, and stable living situation make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I would be grateful for your support.

Best regards,  
Markus Schmidt

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,386 DM for the purchase of a used car. My name is Sven Krause, and I am a certified electrician, employed at Siemens AG for 8 years. My job provides a steady income, and I have a good track record with credit—my existing loan at your bank has always been repaid on schedule.

Although my current account is overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, I have no other debts or installment obligations. I have lived at my current residence for 4 years without paying rent, as I live in my parents’ home. As a single parent to a 12-year-old, reliable transportation is necessary for both work and family duties.

I am committed to meeting my financial obligations and believe my long-term employment and responsible repayment history demonstrate my trustworthiness. I would appreciate your consideration of my application.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,  
Sven Krause
