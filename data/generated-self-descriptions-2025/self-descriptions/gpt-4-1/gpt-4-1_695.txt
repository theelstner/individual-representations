Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,716 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have been working for 9 months. My current financial situation is challenging, as my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to unexpected expenses related to my children’s education. I have two dependents, and reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities.

Although I have a critical credit history and existing credits at other banks, I have always ensured that my payments are made, even if sometimes late. I own my home and a small piece of real estate inherited from my parents, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial responsibility. I have lived at my current address for three years and am dedicated to maintaining stability for my family.

I am a trustworthy candidate because I am committed to improving my financial standing and providing for my children. A new car will enable me to maintain my employment and fulfill my obligations. I am confident in my ability to manage the repayment of this loan and appreciate your consideration.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 4,716 DM for the purpose of buying a new car. My name is Ahmed Hassan, and I have been employed as a hotel porter at Parkside Hotel for the past eight months. I am a single man with two dependents, and I am a foreign worker who has been residing in my own home for three years.

My current financial status is strained, with my checking account in the negative due to covering medical expenses for my children. I do not have a savings account, and while my credit history is marked as critical, I am actively repaying two existing credits at this bank. My property ownership provides security, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am a responsible person, working hard to provide for my family and improve our living conditions. Reliable transportation is essential for my job, and I am committed to making regular payments. I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my dedication to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Best regards,
Ahmed Hassan
