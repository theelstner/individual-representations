Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs and I am applying for a loan of 5,324 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years. As a foreign worker, I have worked hard to build a stable life for myself and my 10-year-old daughter since moving to Germany.

Currently, I have no checking account, but I do maintain a savings account with a balance of 700 DM. I have lived at my current residence for four years, where I am fortunate to have free housing through my employer. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back on time without any issues. Additionally, I have no other debts or installment plans, and no guarantors.

I am requesting this loan to purchase a reliable car, as my current commute to work and my daughter’s school has become increasingly difficult without one. I believe that my long-term employment, stable living situation, and clean credit history make me a trustworthy candidate. I am committed to meeting my installment obligations promptly.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anja Bauer, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,324 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a married woman, 35 years old, with one dependent child. I have been employed as a mid-level administrative official at the Stuttgart City Hall for nine years.

I have a savings account with 950 DM, and although I do not have a checking account, my financial discipline is proven by my history: I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time. I have no other debts or installment plans and have resided at my current address for four years, where I live rent-free in a family-owned apartment.

This car is essential for my daily commute and family needs, especially with my husband working shifts and my daughter attending school across town. My stable employment and responsible repayment record underscore my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Anja Bauer
