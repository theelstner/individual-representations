Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 10,974 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new business. I am a 38-year-old divorced woman, and for the past eight years, I worked as a self-employed marketing consultant, helping small businesses in Berlin grow their online presence. Due to the recent economic downturn, I have been unemployed for four months, but I am now launching a home-based digital marketing agency.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have a proven record of paying back my previous credits on time, and I have no outstanding debts or other guarantors. My financial reserves are modest, with less than 100 DM in savings, but I own a reliable car that I use for client meetings and business errands.

I have lived at my current address for two years and am committed to building a stable future. I am confident that with your support, I will quickly return to financial stability and repay the loan in the agreed-upon installments. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am a 45-year-old married woman applying for a loan of 10,974 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new co-working space in Munich. After 12 years as a management consultant, I decided to start my own business. Unfortunately, I have been unemployed for the past six months as I transition into this new venture.

Although I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, I have always paid back my previous credits in full and on time. I do not have any co-signers or other debts, and I own a small delivery van, which I plan to use for my business.

I have lived in my current apartment for two years and am determined to make my new business a success. I am requesting this loan to help set up the workspace, which will provide an essential service to the growing number of freelancers in the city. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly and appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,
Maria Kovacs
