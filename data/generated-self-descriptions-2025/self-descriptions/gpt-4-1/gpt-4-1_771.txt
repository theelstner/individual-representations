Letter 1

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Klaus Meier, and I am applying for a loan of 1,655 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked diligently for the past 8 years. I am 63 years old, live in my own home, and have been a resident at my current address for 4 years.

While I do not currently hold a checking account, I have maintained two previous credits with your bank, both of which I have serviced reliably. My savings are limited, under 100 DM, as I support my adult son who lives with me. I have no other installment plans, and there are no guarantors or other debtors attached to this application.

Although my credit history includes critical accounts, I have always prioritized my financial obligations. My property—a house I fully own—serves as a testament to my stability and commitment. I am single and have no dependents aside from my son, and my only regular expense beyond the basics is the installment rate of 2.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my long-term employment, property ownership, and consistent payment history with your bank. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,
Klaus Meier

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Novak, and I am seeking a loan of 1,655 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. After working for 9 years as a janitor at the local hospital, I have proven my reliability and commitment to steady employment.

I currently live alone with my teenage daughter in a house I own. We have resided at our present address for 4 years. My finances are modest, with less than 100 DM in savings, as most of my income goes toward living expenses and supporting my daughter’s education.

I understand my credit history reflects some challenges, but I have always honored my commitments, including two previous loans at your bank. I have no other installment plans, and I am not relying on any guarantors.

Despite not having a checking account, I am reachable by telephone and am a registered foreign worker, fully compliant with all regulations. My property provides security for the loan, and my employment history demonstrates my dependability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I will meet all repayment obligations.

Best regards,
Peter Novak

To the Loan Department,

My name is Emil Schneider, age 63, and I wish to apply for a loan of 1,655 DM to purchase a modern radio and television. I have been employed as a building caretaker for 10 years at the same company, which attests to my reliability.

I own my home and have lived at my current address for 4 years. My financial resources are limited, with savings below 100 DM, as I am the sole provider for my adult dependent son. I have no other outstanding installment plans or guarantors.

Though my credit history is not perfect, I have maintained two other credits with your bank and have always made my payments on time. My property ownership and steady job make me a low-risk candidate.

I do not have a checking account, but I am easily reachable by phone and am a registered foreign worker. My installment rate is manageable, and I am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Emil Schneider
