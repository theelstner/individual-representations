Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 3,077 DM to purchase a new television. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past two years. My employment is stable and my monthly income is sufficient to meet all my obligations.

I have always paid my previous credits on time, and I take my financial commitments seriously. Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are less than 100 DM, I have no other debts or guarantors, and my current car is fully paid off. I have lived at my present residence in Munich for four years, which demonstrates my stability.

As a skilled employee with no dependents, I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2. My only other installment plan is a small electronics purchase that will be paid off within the next year. I am a foreign worker from Poland, but I have integrated well and have a reliable telephone contact.

I am requesting this loan to improve my living conditions and stay up to date with current events and educational programming, which is important for my profession. I assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate and will honor all repayment terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak
