Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,116 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years and have maintained a stable income, with salary assignments regularly deposited into my checking account for over a year. My financial conduct is responsible; I have an existing credit with your bank, which I have always repaid on time.

Currently, I own my residence and have lived there for two years. Although my savings are modest (less than 100 DM), I have no other debts or installment plans. My only dependent is my 12-year-old son, whom I support as a single father. I believe my consistent employment, reliable repayment history, and ownership of real estate make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am available at any time for further information.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Klein

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 2,116 DM to purchase new equipment for my home office, which is necessary for my work as a systems analyst at Siemens AG. I have been with Siemens for two years and my salary is deposited monthly into my checking account, which has maintained a balance above 200 DM for over a year.

I am 41 years old, single, and have one dependent—my mother, who lives with me. I have no other debts, and my previous loan with your bank was paid off without delay. I own my home and have resided there for two years, and while my savings are limited, I have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility.

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a 2,116 DM loan to purchase furniture for my recently renovated apartment. I have been employed as an administrative officer at the City Council for the past year and a half. My salary has been regularly credited to my checking account, which has maintained the required balance for over twelve months.

I have previously taken a loan with your bank and have repaid it in full and on time. I own my apartment and have lived there for two years. As a single man with one dependent (my teenage nephew, whom I am raising), I manage my finances carefully and have no other debts or installment plans.

My stable employment, responsible financial history, and home ownership make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Vogel

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 2,116 DM to purchase equipment needed for my home-based carpentry workshop. I have been working as a skilled technician at Bosch for just over three years, with my salary consistently deposited into my account for more than a year.

I have a good credit record, having repaid my previous loan with your bank without any issues. I own my home, have lived there for two years, and have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. My savings are currently under 100 DM, as I have recently invested in my property.

As a 41-year-old single man supporting my college-age brother, I am diligent in managing my finances and am committed to fulfilling my obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Michael Fischer

Letter 5:  
Dear Loan Department,

I am seeking a 2,116 DM loan to purchase new furniture for my home. I have been employed as a civil engineer with Deutsche Bahn for nearly two years and have maintained a checking account balance of over 200 DM for more than a year.

My previous loan with your bank was paid off in full and on time. I am single, 41 years old, and the sole provider for my 10-year-old daughter. I own my home, have lived there for two years, and have no additional debts or installment plans. My savings are minimal, as I have recently completed necessary home repairs.

Given my stable employment, responsible repayment history, and property ownership, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Sebastian Weber
