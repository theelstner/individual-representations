Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am applying for an education loan in the amount of 6,224 DM. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology for the past 8 years. My goal is to further my qualifications by enrolling in a distance learning program in Data Science, which will help me advance in my field and provide better opportunities for my family.

Currently, my checking account balance is under 200 DM and my savings are limited, with less than 100 DM in my savings account. I am single, supporting my 12-year-old son, and living rent-free with my brother, which helps manage my expenses. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am repaying regularly. While I did face delays in repayment in the past due to unexpected medical expenses for my son, I have since stabilized my finances and maintained a steady payment record.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my long-term employment, stable residence of 4 years, and commitment to improving my professional skills. This education loan will significantly enhance my earning potential and financial stability. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Alex Petrov, a senior machine operator at Siemens, where I have been employed for the past 9 years. I am writing to request a loan of 6,224 DM to finance a part-time business administration course. This qualification is essential for my career progression, as I have recently been offered a supervisory role contingent on further education.

My current financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings. I have one dependent, my 15-year-old daughter, and I reside free of charge in a company-provided apartment. Although I experienced delays in repaying a previous loan, I have since taken steps to ensure timely payments by setting up automatic transfers and have had no issues in the last year.

I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan due to my long-standing employment, responsible family support, and the clear purpose of the loan. This investment in my education will directly contribute to my career growth and financial security. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Alex Petrov

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Daniel Schmidt, and I am applying for an education loan of 6,224 DM. I have worked as an administrative officer at the Munich City Council for 10 years. I am seeking to enroll in a professional certification course in public administration to enhance my skills and competitiveness in my field.

My checking and savings account balances are currently below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively. I am a single father to a 17-year-old son, and we have lived in the same apartment for 4 years without paying rent, thanks to a family arrangement. Although I previously had difficulty meeting repayment deadlines due to a period of illness, I have since maintained regular payments and learned to better manage my finances.

With my stable employment, strong commitment to personal development, and improved financial discipline, I am confident in my ability to honor this loan. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Daniel Schmidt
