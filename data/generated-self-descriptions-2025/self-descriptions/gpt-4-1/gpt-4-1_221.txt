Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,364 DM. My name is Anna Müller, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years. As a foreign worker in Germany, I have worked diligently to build a stable life here and have always honored my financial commitments, including the timely repayment of all my previous credits.

I am currently separated and have one dependent child. My financial situation is modest, with savings of less than 100 DM, and I do not have a checking account. I have lived at my current residence for four years, and I own a used car, which is now unreliable. A new car is essential for my daily commute to work and for taking my child to school.

I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and my record with your bank is clean. I am confident that my steady employment, responsible credit history, and commitment to my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am requesting an installment plan of 2, as it is manageable given my monthly income.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am a married foreign worker employed as a senior administrative official with the Berlin City Council for the last two years. I respectfully request a loan of 1,364 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute and family responsibilities.

I have maintained an excellent credit history, with all previous credits paid back on time. Although I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, my secure employment and steady income provide me with the means to meet the proposed installment rate of 2.

I have resided at my current address for four years and have no other debts or guarantors. My husband and I share one dependent, and we rely on my income for our main financial stability. I have always managed my finances prudently and would be grateful for the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability further.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Kind regards,
Elena Petrova

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Maria Singh, a divorced mother and a skilled employee at Siemens AG, where I have been working for almost four years. I am applying for a loan of 1,364 DM to purchase a new car, as my current vehicle is no longer reliable for commuting and transporting my child.

Despite not having a checking account and minimal savings (less than 100 DM), I have always paid back my credits on time and have no other outstanding debts. I have lived at my current residence for four years and own a small car as my only property.

I am the sole provider for my child, and a new car is essential for both work and family obligations. I have a stable job, a clean credit record, and no other installment plans. My dedication to my work and family underscores my trustworthiness as a loan candidate.

Thank you for considering my request. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Maria Singh
