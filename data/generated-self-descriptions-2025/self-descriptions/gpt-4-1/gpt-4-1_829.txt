Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 4,165 DM. My name is Martin Schulz, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 3 years. I am currently single and have been residing at my current address for 2 years.

I am seeking this loan to open a small electronics repair shop in the local shopping district, a venture for which I have already secured a rental space. Although I do not have a checking account, I have always managed my finances responsibly, with no outstanding debts and a perfect credit history.

My current savings are limited, but I have a car as my main asset and no other outstanding loans or guarantors. My monthly salary from my position at the Institute is stable and sufficient to cover the loan installment rate of 2%. I have always paid my bills on time and can provide references from my employer and landlord to attest to my reliability.

I am confident that my strong work ethic, stable employment, and commitment to my business plan make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Martin Schulz

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jonas Becker, and I am applying for a business loan of 4,165 DM to expand my small grocery store, which I have been operating for the past 18 months. I am currently employed as a skilled retail manager at a local supermarket, a position I have held for 2 years.

I have always prided myself on being financially responsible. I have no history of unpaid debts or missed payments, and I do not have any outstanding credits. My savings are modest, but I own a reliable car which serves as collateral.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained good standing with my savings account and have no other obligations or guarantors. I live alone and have been at my current address for 2 years. The loan will help me purchase new refrigeration equipment and expand my product range, which will increase my store’s profitability.

I am committed to making timely repayments and have a solid business plan to ensure the success of my store. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,  
Jonas Becker
