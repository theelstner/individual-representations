Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is David K. Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €1,867 to purchase a new television set. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years. My work is stable, and I take pride in my professional reputation for reliability and dedication.

Currently, I do not have a checking or savings account, but I have always managed my finances responsibly. Over the past four years at my current residence, I have successfully paid off two previous credits, always on time and in full. I have no other debts or financial obligations, and I do not have any guarantors or co-signers.

I do not own property, but I do have a car, which serves as my main asset. As a foreign worker in Germany, I have consistently demonstrated my commitment to financial responsibility, and I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 4% as proposed.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to continue building my credit history with your bank and am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
David K. Müller
