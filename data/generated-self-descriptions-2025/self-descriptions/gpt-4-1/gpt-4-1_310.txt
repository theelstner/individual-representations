Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1237 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 24-year-old scientific research assistant, currently employed at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics for the past 3 years. Since my recent divorce, I have been the sole provider for my young daughter.

My current checking account balance is modest (below 200 DM), and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have always managed my finances responsibly, and I have a proven record of repaying my previous credit with your bank on time. I reside in my own apartment, which is part of a small real estate property I inherited from my parents. I have lived at this address for 4 years.

Despite my limited liquid assets, my steady employment and property ownership make me a reliable candidate. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only dependent is my daughter. I am committed to maintaining my good credit history and believe this loan will help improve our quality of life.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anna Kowalska

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1237 DM to furnish my new home and purchase necessary equipment for my child’s studies. I am a married 24-year-old administrative officer at the Munich City Hall, where I have worked for the past 2 years. My husband and I recently moved into our own apartment, which we own as part of a real estate investment.

Although my current account and savings are below 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have always paid back my existing credit with your bank on time. We have no other outstanding loans or installment plans. I have been residing at my current address for 4 years and have one dependent, my son.

My stable employment, responsible repayment history, and property ownership demonstrate my trustworthiness. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 3% and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Elena Petrova
