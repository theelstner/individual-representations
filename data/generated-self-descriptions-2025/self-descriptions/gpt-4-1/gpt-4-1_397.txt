Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 11,760 DM to further my education. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 5 years, specializing in environmental studies. My goal is to enroll in a postgraduate program that will significantly enhance my skills and career prospects.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest (around 150 DM), and my savings amount to approximately 350 DM. I have had a delay in repaying a previous credit, but I have since taken active steps to improve my financial management and have not missed a payment in the last 18 months. I am single, supporting my 6-year-old son, and have been renting my current apartment for the past 3 years.

I am a reliable employee with a stable income and a proven commitment to my professional development. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been servicing regularly. With no other debts or installment plans, I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed loan responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at your convenience for further discussion.

Sincerely,  
Martin Hoffmann

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for an educational loan of 11,760 DM to attend a part-time MBA program at Goethe Business School. I have been employed for 6 years as a logistics coordinator at a major shipping company in Mainz, where I have consistently demonstrated reliability and growth.

My current financial resources are limited, with a checking account balance under 200 DM and savings of about 120 DM. I acknowledge a previous delay in credit repayment, but have since prioritized my financial obligations and maintained a clean record for over a year.

As a single father to a 10-year-old daughter, I am motivated to advance my education and secure a brighter future for my family. I have lived at my current address for 3 years, have no property or other debts, and only one existing credit at your bank, which I am repaying on schedule.

I am confident in my ability to honor my commitments and would appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jan Becker

Dear Banking Team,

I wish to apply for a loan of 11,760 DM to fund my continuing education in Information Technology. I am a 32-year-old single man, working as a technical support specialist for Deutsche Telekom for the past 4 years. I am the sole provider for my young son.

My financial situation is stable but modest, with a checking account balance of 120 DM and savings of 400 DM. Three years ago, I experienced a delay in credit repayment due to unexpected medical expenses, but I have since established better financial discipline and have met all subsequent obligations.

I rent my home, have no other installment plans, and maintain only one credit with your bank. My steady employment and responsible financial behavior over the past few years make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Sincerely,  
Tobias Klein
