Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Schneider, and I am applying for a loan of 802 DM to purchase a new television. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, which has provided me with stable and reliable employment. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, as I have recently invested in a used car to facilitate my daily commute.

I am single and have been living at my current address in Munich for the past 3 years. I have no other debts or guarantors, and all my previous credit obligations have been paid back on time, as reflected in my positive credit history. I have been responsible with my finances, ensuring that I meet all my installment obligations, including a separate installment plan of 37 DM per month.

Although I do not own property or housing, my steady employment and proven track record of repaying loans make me a trustworthy candidate. The new television will help me stay informed and connected, which is important for both my work and personal development.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on schedule and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Markus Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Thomas Weber, a skilled employee at Siemens AG, where I have worked as a technical specialist for the past 9 years. I am applying for a loan of 802 DM to purchase a new radio and television set, as my old devices have become unreliable and are essential for my daily life.

My current financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance of 80 DM and minimal savings. Despite this, I have always managed my finances carefully, paying off all previous credits on time. I have lived at my current residence in Stuttgart for 3 years and do not have any dependents or other debt obligations.

I do not own a home but have recently purchased a car, which is my only significant asset. I have no guarantors or co-signers, but my stable employment and consistent payment history demonstrate my reliability. I am single, 34 years old, and have no plans to relocate in the near future.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am confident that I will meet all repayment obligations and appreciate the opportunity to explain my situation.

Best regards,
Thomas Weber

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Stefan Bauer, and I am writing to request a loan of 802 DM for the purchase of a radio and television. I have been employed as a mechanical engineer at Bosch for 8 years, which provides me with a stable monthly income. My current checking account holds 95 DM, and my savings are limited, as I have recently invested in a second-hand car to improve my daily commute.

I have an excellent credit record, having paid back all previous loans on time. I am single, 36 years old, and have lived at my current residence in Frankfurt for 3 years. I do not have any dependents or other financial obligations, and I am solely responsible for my finances.

Though I do not own a house, my steady employment and history of responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate for this loan. The new television and radio will enhance my quality of life and help me stay informed.

Thank you for your consideration. I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan on schedule.

Kind regards,
Stefan Bauer
