Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,413 DM to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years. My current financial situation is stable: I have a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM and a building society savings agreement as additional security.

I have previously taken a credit from your bank, which I repaid fully and on time. I own my home, have no other installment plans or debts, and have resided at my current address for 2 years. As a single father, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and supporting my child. My installment rate is manageable, and my steady employment history demonstrates my commitment and reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber
