Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Weber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,323 DM to purchase a new television and radio system. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for the past five years. My current checking account balance is modest (around 150 DM), and my savings are below 100 DM, as most of my income goes towards rent and daily expenses.

I have a solid credit history, having paid back previous credits on time and in full. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I have resided at my current address for four years. I do not own real estate, but I do have a reliable car. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have always prioritized my financial commitments.

As a single, responsible employee with a steady job and a good record with your bank, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Schulte, and I am seeking a loan of 2,323 DM to buy a high-quality radio and television set for my new apartment. I am a single male, 31 years old, and have worked as a customs official at Düsseldorf Airport for six years. My checking account currently has a balance of 120 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM, as I recently moved and paid a security deposit.

I have always paid back my previous loans on time and have no other debts. I have lived at my present residence for four years and have no dependents. I do not own a house, but I do own a car, which I use to commute to work. My installment payments are up to date, and I have never defaulted on any obligations.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and would appreciate your consideration, as this purchase will improve my quality of life and allow me to better relax after work.

Kind regards,  
Markus Schulte
