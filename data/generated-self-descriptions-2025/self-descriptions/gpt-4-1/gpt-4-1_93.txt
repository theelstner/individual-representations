Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,409 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, providing me with a stable and reliable income. I am currently single and have one dependent, my teenage son, whom I fully support. Although my current checking account is overdrawn, this is due to unexpected medical expenses for my son, which I am now managing with a strict budget.

I own my apartment and a small piece of real estate in Frankfurt, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. I have no other installment plans and only one existing credit at your bank, which I have managed responsibly. My savings are currently below 100 DM, but I am working diligently to build them up again. 

I am a foreign worker, originally from Poland, and have lived in Germany for the past 12 years, with 3 years at my current address. I am applying for this loan because I need a reliable car to commute to work and take my son to school and medical appointments. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as I have a steady job and a proven record of meeting my obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Andrzej Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I am applying for a loan of 1,409 DM to purchase a used car. I have worked as an electrical technician for Siemens for the past 10 years, and I have always been dedicated to my profession. I am a single father with one dependent, my 16-year-old daughter. 

While my checking account is currently negative due to recent home repairs, I have always prioritized my financial commitments. I own my home in Stuttgart and a small plot of land in Turkey, which serves as additional security. My savings are low at the moment because I recently paid for my daughter's school tuition. 

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am repaying on schedule, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I have lived at my current residence for 3 years and have a stable and secure lifestyle. As a Turkish national working in Germany for over 15 years, I have always strived to integrate and be a reliable member of the community.

This car is essential for commuting to work and supporting my daughter's activities. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments without difficulty.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,409 DM for the purchase of a used car. My name is Jean-Pierre Dubois, and I have been employed as a customs official for 9 years in Munich. I am a single male with one dependent, my elderly mother, whom I support.

My current financial situation is strained, with my checking account below zero due to recent expenses related to my mother's healthcare. My savings are under 100 DM as I have been covering these costs. However, I own my own apartment and a small vineyard in France, which underscores my financial stability in the long term.

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am managing responsibly, and no other debts or installment plans. I have lived at my present address for 3 years and am committed to maintaining a stable household.

The car is necessary for my daily commute and for transporting my mother to her medical appointments. I am confident that my steady employment and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jean-Pierre Dubois
