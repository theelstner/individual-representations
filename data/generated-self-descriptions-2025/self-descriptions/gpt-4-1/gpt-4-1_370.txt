Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Stefan Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 3,446 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my apartment. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My employment is stable, and I have a steady monthly income.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have always paid back all my previous credits on time, and I do not have any other outstanding debts or guarantors. I have lived at my current address in Munich for 2 years and have no dependents.

The new furniture and equipment will help me create a more comfortable and productive living environment. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4, as I have managed similar payments in the past without issue. My reliable employment history and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Müller
