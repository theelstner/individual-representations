Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,424 DM for the purpose of purchasing new furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and my monthly salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account with your bank for over 5 years. 

I have maintained a positive credit history and have previously taken out a loan with your institution, which I repaid in full and on time. My current financial situation is stable: I own my residence in Freiburg and have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. My only dependent, my daughter, is currently attending university.

As a divorced woman of 55, I have managed my finances independently for many years and have always prioritized meeting my obligations. I am requesting this loan to update necessary equipment at home, which will support both my professional work and family life.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my record with your bank demonstrates my reliability, and I am happy to provide any additional information required.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Sabine Keller

Letter 2 – Small Business Owner

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,424 DM for the purchase of new office furniture and equipment for my consulting business. I have been self-employed as the owner of “Weber Consulting” for 9 years, with my salary regularly assigned to my checking account at your branch for over 7 years.

My credit history is strong, with all previous loans repaid punctually. I currently have one active credit with your bank, which is being serviced without issue. I reside in my own property in Stuttgart, where I have lived for 4 years with my teenage son.

As a married woman aged 55, I take pride in my responsible financial management and have no additional debts or installment plans. I do not have a savings account, as my earnings are reinvested in my business and household.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and believe my professional stability and credit record make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Brigitte Weber
