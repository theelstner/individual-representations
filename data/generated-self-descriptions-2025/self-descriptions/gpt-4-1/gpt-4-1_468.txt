Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Sabine Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 1,659 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a cashier at a local supermarket in Frankfurt, a position I have held for the past nine months. Although my employment is still relatively new, I am dedicated and have consistently received positive feedback from my supervisors.

My financial situation is challenging at the moment, as my checking account balance is below zero and my savings are less than 100 DM. I have experienced delays in repaying credit in the past, primarily due to unexpected medical expenses following my divorce last year. However, I have since made significant efforts to improve my financial responsibility, including setting up payment reminders and tracking my expenses more closely.

I live alone and have no other debts or guarantors. I have resided at my current address for two years and rely on public housing. My only property is a used car, which I need for commuting to work. I have one dependent, my teenage daughter, whom I support on my own.

Despite my previous financial struggles, I am committed to meeting my obligations. I believe that with the installment rate offered, I can comfortably manage the monthly payments. Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to rebuild my credit and provide a stable environment for my family.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Novak, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,659 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I recently separated from my husband and am now supporting myself and my young son. I have been working as a cleaning staff member at a local hotel in Munich for the past eight months.

Currently, my financial resources are very limited, with less than 100 DM in savings and an overdrawn checking account. I acknowledge that I have had some late payments in the past, particularly during my separation when my household income was disrupted. However, I have since established a budget and am focused on improving my payment history.

I have no other loans or guarantors, and I rent my apartment, where I have lived for two years. My only asset is a small scooter, which I use for commuting. Despite my current challenges, I am determined to provide a better life for my son and rebuild my financial standing.

I am a responsible person and have taken steps to ensure that I can meet the monthly installment rate. I appreciate your consideration and hope you will give me the opportunity to prove myself as a trustworthy client.

Kind regards,  
Maria Novak

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Fatima El-Sayed, and I am applying for a loan of 1,659 DM to purchase a television and radio for my home. I am a married woman originally from Egypt, now living in Berlin for the past two years. I have been working as a kitchen assistant at a local restaurant for the last ten months.

My financial position is currently quite strained, with my checking account in deficit and minimal savings. I did experience some delays in paying off previous credit, which was due to unexpected costs after relocating to Germany. Since then, I have made every effort to bring my finances under control, including regular communication with creditors and setting up a direct debit system for payments.

I have no other outstanding loans and no guarantors. My family and I rent a small apartment, and our only property is an old family car. We have one dependent, my young son, who attends school nearby.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and see this loan as a crucial step toward improving our quality of life. Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan responsibly.

Yours sincerely,  
Fatima El-Sayed

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Katarina Petrova, and I am seeking a loan of 1,659 DM to buy a new television and radio for my household. I have recently divorced and am now living alone in Stuttgart, where I have resided for two years. I am currently employed as a warehouse worker, a job I started ten months ago.

My financial situation is difficult: my checking account is overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. In the past, I had some late payments, mainly due to the financial strain of my divorce and moving expenses. However, I have since taken steps to stabilize my finances, such as creating a repayment plan and cutting unnecessary costs.

I rent my apartment and have no other debts or guarantors. My only asset is an old car, which is essential for getting to work. I have one dependent, my daughter, who lives with me part-time.

Despite my current circumstances, I am a reliable and hardworking person. I am committed to making the monthly installments on time and rebuilding my credit. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Katarina Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan of 1,659 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I am a married woman living in Hamburg with my husband and our young child. I have been employed as a factory assistant for the past eleven months.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling all repayment obligations.

Sincerely,  
Anna Schmidt
