Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,831 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a 36-year-old divorced woman currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 3 years. My current financial situation is stable, though I do not have significant savings (less than 100 DM), and I do not maintain a checking account at this time.

My credit history includes a critical account and an existing loan for a car, but I have always met my installment payments on time. I am dedicated to fulfilling my financial obligations. I have lived at my current residence for 2 years and do not have any dependents. While I do not own property, I do own a car, which I use for commuting to work.

As a skilled employee with a stable job and reliable income, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan in the agreed installments. I am a foreign worker with a valid work permit and have been proactive in maintaining my financial commitments. I am trustworthy and responsible, and this loan will greatly improve my quality of life by allowing me to stay informed and connected through television.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Maria Novak

Letter 2

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,831 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my new apartment. I am a married woman, 41 years old, and I have been working as a certified medical technician at the Städtisches Klinikum for the past 2 years. My employment is secure, and I am paid regularly.

Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are minimal, I have always managed my finances prudently. My credit history is not perfect due to a previous credit card issue, but I have no current delinquencies and have no debts at your bank. I have lived at my current address for 2 years and own a small car.

I have no guarantors, but I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as I have a fixed monthly salary and no dependents. I am a responsible borrower and value my reputation. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a good credit standing in Germany.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ana-Maria Dumitrescu
