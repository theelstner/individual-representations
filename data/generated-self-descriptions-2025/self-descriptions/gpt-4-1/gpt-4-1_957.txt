Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,231 DM for the purchase of a new television. As a divorced woman of 57 years, I have been steadily employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My current residence has been my home for the last 4 years, and I am a registered foreign worker under my own name. 

Though my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have maintained a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM and hold an active life insurance policy. I am responsible for one dependent, and I have always prioritized their wellbeing and education. While I have two existing credits with your bank and a critical account status due to past financial challenges, I have consistently met my installment payments, including my current rate of 4. My credit history includes other credits at different institutions, but I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

This television will allow my family to stay informed and connected, especially as my child prepares for university entrance exams. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule, drawing on my stable income and prudent financial planning. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Maria Weber

To the Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Richter, and I am seeking a loan of 1,231 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my household. I am a 57-year-old married woman, living with my husband and our teenage son. I have been employed as a department manager at Siemens AG for 9 years and have resided at my current address for 4 years.

Despite a negative checking account balance, I possess a building society savings agreement with over 1,000 DM and a strong record of employment. Although I have two current credits with your bank and a critical credit history, I have always made timely payments and have no other outstanding installment plans. I am the sole provider for my family, and my stable management position assures regular income.

I am requesting this loan to improve our family’s quality of life and to help my son access educational programming. With my responsible financial habits and long-term employment, I am confident in my ability to fulfill the loan obligations. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Richter

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,231 DM for the purchase of a new television. I am a 57-year-old married woman, currently working as a self-employed tax consultant for the past 10 years. I have lived at my rented residence for 4 years and have a dependent daughter who is studying at university.

While my checking account is overdrawn, I have a savings account with a balance above 1,000 DM and a valid life insurance policy. My credit history is marked as critical due to previous financial obligations with other lenders, but I have always honored my installment payments, including my current rate of 4. I have two existing credits at your bank but no other installment plans or guarantors.

This loan will help me replace our broken television, which is essential for both work and family use. My consistent income and careful financial management make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for your attention to my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Helga Baumann

Dear Banking Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,231 DM to purchase a radio and television set. My name is Sabine Keller, a 57-year-old divorced woman, working as a senior officer in the municipal government for the past 8 years. I have lived in my current rental home for 4 years and support one dependent, my elderly mother.

Although my checking account is presently below zero, I have a building society savings agreement exceeding 1,000 DM and an uninterrupted employment history. My credit history is critical due to previous loans with other banks, but I have never defaulted on any payments and currently maintain two credits with your bank. I have no guarantors or other installment plans.

This loan is necessary to replace our outdated television, which my mother relies on for news and entertainment. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan given my stable income and prudent management of finances. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,  
Sabine Keller
