Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,496 DM to furnish my new apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Siemens AG for the past three years, with a stable monthly income and a savings account balance of 1,200 DM. My current checking account balance is 150 DM, as I recently covered moving expenses.

I have previously taken two loans with your bank, both of which I repaid on time and in full. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. I am single, 29 years old, and have lived at my current address for two years. My property includes a used Volkswagen Golf, which I own outright.

My work contract is secure, and my employer can confirm my reliability. I believe my steady employment, good savings habits, and positive credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I would be grateful for your consideration.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Martin Weber
