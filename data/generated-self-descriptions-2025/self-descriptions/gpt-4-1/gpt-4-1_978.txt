Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 753 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a 64-year-old divorced woman, currently working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past three years. My steady employment provides me with a reliable monthly income, and I have always paid back my previous credits in a timely manner, as reflected in my credit history with your bank.

My financial situation is stable, albeit modest. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I own my residence and have real estate property, which adds to my financial security. I have one dependent, my granddaughter, whom I support.

I have a guarantor for this loan, which further assures my ability to repay. I have no other outstanding installment plans and only one existing credit at your bank, which is being serviced regularly without any delays.

I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably, as this loan will greatly enhance my quality of life. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 753 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new radio and television set. I am a 64-year-old married woman, employed as a senior administrative official at the Munich City Council for the last two years. My employment is stable, and I have a proven track record of repaying all previous credits without delay.

While my checking account currently holds 75 DM and my savings are less than 100 DM, I do own my home and a small piece of land, which strengthens my financial position. I have one dependent, my daughter, who is currently attending university.

I have a guarantor who is willing to back this loan, and I have no other installment plans apart from one ongoing credit with your bank, which I am repaying promptly. My residence in Munich has been stable for the past three years.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and assure you of my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you very much for your attention and consideration.

Best regards,  
Elisabeth Schreiber

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a 753 DM loan to purchase a new television, which is essential for staying informed and connected. I am a separated woman, 64 years old, currently working as a skilled employee in the logistics department at Deutsche Post, where I have been employed for one and a half years.

My current financial resources are limited; my checking account balance is 190 DM and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I am a property owner and have lived in my current home for three years. My credit history is excellent, with all previous credits repaid as agreed, and I currently have only one outstanding credit with your bank.

I have a guarantor supporting my application, and I have no other installment plans. I also have one dependent, my son, who lives with me.

I am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations promptly and thank you for considering my application.

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 753 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am a 64-year-old divorced woman and have worked as a skilled technical assistant at Bayer AG for nearly two years. My employment is secure, and I have consistently demonstrated responsibility in managing my finances, as seen by my history of timely credit repayments.

Though my checking account balance is 180 DM and my savings are under 100 DM, I own my home and a small plot of real estate, which provides a strong financial foundation. I have one dependent, my grandson, who lives with me.

I have a guarantor to support my application, and I currently have only one other credit with your bank, which is being serviced reliably. I have no other installment plans and have lived at my current address for three years.

I assure you of my commitment to repay this loan on schedule and thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Sabine Hoffmann
