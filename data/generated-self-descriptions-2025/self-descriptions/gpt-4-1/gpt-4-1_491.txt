Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,518 DM to purchase a new car. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 2 years. My work requires frequent travel to partner universities and research sites, making reliable transportation essential.

My financial situation is stable. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been paying back on time without any delays. I currently rent an apartment where I have lived for 3 years, and I have a building society savings agreement as my main asset. Although my savings are below 100 DM, my steady monthly income and my record of timely payments demonstrate my financial responsibility.

I am single with one dependent, and my brother is willing to act as a guarantor for this loan. I am confident that I can manage the installment rate of 2, given my current expenses and income. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building my life and career here, and owning a car would greatly support my professional and personal responsibilities.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrović

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,518 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority, a position I have held for 3 years. My job often requires me to work late shifts, and public transport is not always available at those hours.

I have a solid track record of repaying credits, including one current loan with your bank, which I have serviced punctually. Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are limited to under 100 DM, I do possess a life insurance policy, which adds to my financial security.

As a single man with one dependent, my financial obligations are manageable. I have lived at my current rented address for 3 years, and my cousin has agreed to act as my guarantor for this loan. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, thanks to my stable employment and careful budgeting.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I am eager to discuss any further information you may require.

Best regards,  
Ivan Novak

Letter 3

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a 3,518 DM loan for the purpose of purchasing a new car. I am a skilled technician at Siemens, where I have been working for 1.5 years. My work schedule and the location of my workplace make owning a car a necessity rather than a luxury.

My financial situation is sound. I have always paid my existing credits on time, including one credit with your bank. My savings are minimal at this time, but I have a building society savings agreement in place for future security. I have been living in my current rented apartment for 3 years and have no other installment plans.

I am single with one dependent, and my close friend has offered to act as a guarantor for this loan. As a foreign worker, I am committed to establishing myself here, and this loan would significantly enhance my mobility and job performance.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available to provide any additional information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Paolo Rossi

Letter 4

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to apply for a loan of 3,518 DM to buy a new car. I am a junior civil servant at the Berlin City Council, where I have been employed for 2 years. Reliable transportation is critical for my job, as I am often required to visit different municipal sites.

I have a clean credit history, having paid all my previous credits on time, including my current loan with your bank. Although my savings are less than 100 DM, I do have a life insurance policy. My monthly income comfortably covers my living expenses, the planned installment rate, and my obligations to my dependent child.

I have lived at my current rented apartment for 3 years. My uncle, who is a long-time resident and property owner in Berlin, is willing to act as my guarantor. I am confident that I will be able to fulfill all my repayment obligations.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your response.

Kind regards,  
Markus Schneider

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 3,518 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently a skilled warehouse supervisor at DHL, a position I have held for 3 years. My work requires me to commute at odd hours, and public transportation does not meet my needs.

I have an excellent repayment record, with one existing credit at your bank that I have always paid punctually. Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, I have a building society savings agreement and a stable monthly income.

I am single with one dependent, and my father has agreed to be my guarantor. I have lived in my current rented apartment for 3 years. I am a foreign worker, but I am fully committed to my work and life in Germany.

Thank you for considering my loan application. Please let me know if you need any further information.

Sincerely,
