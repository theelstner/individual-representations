Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 802 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse supervisor at Müller Logistik GmbH, where I have worked for 2 years and 8 months. My job is stable and provides a regular income, but I have not yet opened a checking account, as I have managed my finances mainly through cash and a small savings account with less than 100 DM.

My financial history includes a delay in repaying a previous credit two years ago, which was due to an unexpected medical expense. Since then, I have taken steps to improve my financial discipline and have had no further delays or issues. I have no other outstanding debts, and I do not have any guarantors.

The car is essential for my daily commute and for supporting my family, as public transport is not available in my area during my shift hours. I am single, 29 years old, and have been living at my current address for 2 years. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% and have no other installment plans except for a small furniture purchase.

I assure you of my commitment to meeting all payment obligations and am happy to provide any further information you require. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Andreas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 802 DM to purchase a new car, which is critical for my job as a field technician at ElektroFix Services. I have been with the company for just over 3 years. My employment is stable, and my monthly income is sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate of 4%.

Although I experienced a delay in repaying a previous loan 18 months ago due to a temporary reduction in work hours, I have since maintained a clean payment record and have no other debts or guarantors. My current savings are minimal, as I have been supporting my younger brother through his studies.

I have resided at my current address for 2 years and am renting a room in a shared apartment. I am single and 34 years old. I do not have a checking account yet, but I am planning to open one as part of my financial planning.

My work requires frequent travel to client sites, and a new car will greatly improve my reliability and job performance. I am committed to repaying the loan on time and am happy to provide references from my employer.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Markus Schmitt

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 802 DM to purchase a new car, which will enable me to expand my work as a self-employed delivery driver. I have been self-employed for 1 year and 7 months, and my income has been steadily increasing as my client base grows.

I have a small amount in savings, under 100 DM, and no checking account yet due to my previous reliance on cash payments. I did have a delay in repaying a credit card debt last year, but I have since improved my budgeting and have no other outstanding debts.

I live alone in a rented apartment and have been at my current address for 2 years. I am single, 27 years old, and have no dependents. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate as I have shown commitment to improving my financial habits and have maintained regular payments on all other obligations.

A new car is essential for my business growth, as it will allow me to take on more deliveries and increase my income. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
Jan Richter

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 802 DM to buy a new car. I have been working as a retail associate at Kaufhaus Lenz for 3 years, and my position provides a reliable income. I do not have a checking account and keep less than 100 DM in savings, as I recently helped my parents with some urgent repairs to their home.

I admit there was a delay in paying off a small consumer loan two years ago, but since then, I have managed my finances more carefully and have not had any further issues. I have no other debts or installment plans except for a minor electronics purchase.

I have lived at my current address for 2 years, am single, 31 years old, and have no dependents. I have no guarantors. A car is vital for commuting to work, especially for early and late shifts when public transport is unavailable.

I am committed to meeting the installment payments and am willing to provide proof of income and references. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Sebastian Krüger

Letter 5

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 802 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a machine operator at Stahlwerk AG, where I have worked for 2 years and 3 months. My income is stable, but I have not yet opened a checking account, and my savings are less than 100 DM due to recent moving expenses.

I did have a delay in repaying a previous loan when I lost my part-time job three years ago. However, since securing my current full-time position, I have maintained all payments without issue. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I live alone in rented accommodation, where I have resided for 2 years.

I am 30 years old, single, and have no dependents. The car is necessary for my commute to work, as public transportation is not available for my early morning shifts. I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment rate and am eager to demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Tobias Weber
