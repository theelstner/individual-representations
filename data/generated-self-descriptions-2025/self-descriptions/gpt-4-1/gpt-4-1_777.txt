Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,371 DM to purchase a new car. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for the past 2 years and 7 months. I am 25 years old, married, and currently renting my apartment, where I have lived for the last 4 years with my daughter.

My financial situation is stable; although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a reliable income and have always repaid my existing credit with your bank on time. I do not have any other debts or installment plans, nor do I have a savings account, as my earnings are allocated to my family’s needs and rent.

I am seeking this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for commuting to work and transporting my daughter. My employment is secure, and my history with your bank demonstrates my commitment to meeting my financial obligations. I also own real estate in my home country, which provides additional security.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, and I hope to continue building a positive relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,371 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am employed as a customs official with the Hamburg Port Authority, a position I have held for just over 3 years. I am 25 years old, divorced, and responsible for supporting my young son. We have lived at our current rented address for 4 years.

Despite my current account balance being below zero, I have always fulfilled my previous credit obligations with your bank. I have no additional debts or outstanding installment plans. While I do not have a savings account, my regular salary provides a reliable source of income.

Owning a car is crucial for my work, as my shifts often require early or late travel when public transport is unavailable. I believe my stable employment, history of responsible credit repayment, and property ownership abroad make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Fatma Yildiz

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 1,371 DM to purchase a new car, which I need to commute to my job as a certified laboratory technician at Heidelberg Medical Center. I am 25, married, and have one dependent child. We have rented our current home for 4 years.

Although my current account is overdrawn, I have consistently paid off my existing credit at your bank and have no other debts. I do not hold a savings account, as my income is used for daily expenses and supporting my family.

I have been employed at my current job for 2 years and 3 months, and my position is secure. I am a foreign worker from Poland and own a small property in Warsaw, which further demonstrates my financial responsibility.

I respectfully request your consideration for this loan, confident in my ability to meet the installment payments. Thank you for your attention.

Yours sincerely,  
Marta Nowak

Letter 4

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,371 DM. I am a skilled office manager at Berlin Consulting Group, where I have worked for 3 years. I am 25 years old and separated, living in rented accommodation with my 5-year-old son for the past 4 years.

While my current account is slightly overdrawn, I have always repaid my previous credit with your bank on schedule. I do not have any other loans, savings, or installment plans. My monthly salary is steady, covering our living expenses and rent.

A car is vital for my daily commute and managing childcare. My employment is long-term, and I own a small plot of land in my home country, Romania, which adds to my financial stability.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am committed to repaying the loan reliably.

Kind regards,  
Elena Popescu
