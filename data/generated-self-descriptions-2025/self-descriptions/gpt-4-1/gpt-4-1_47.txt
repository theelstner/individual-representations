Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,393 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the local university, a position I have held for 10 months. While I do not yet have a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly through other means and have maintained a stable credit history with other institutions.

As a married woman supporting one dependent, reliable transportation is essential for both my professional and family obligations. I have lived at my current residence for four years and have no other debtors or guarantors. My property includes a used car, which I plan to trade in as part of my purchase.

Though my savings are currently below 100 DM, I have a steady income and am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4. I have always honored my financial commitments and am seeking this loan to improve my family's mobility and to continue advancing my career.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Maria Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a car loan of 1,393 DM to replace my old vehicle, which is no longer reliable for my daily commute. As a divorced woman working as a self-employed management consultant for the past 9 months, I understand the importance of maintaining a professional image and punctuality, both of which require dependable transportation.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained accounts and credit with other financial institutions. My current financial obligations are manageable, and I have no other installment plans beyond those disclosed. My savings are limited, but I have a consistent income from my consulting work.

I have lived at my current address for four years and have a good record with my previous creditors. I am committed to meeting the installment rate and believe my professional background as a highly qualified consultant makes me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Krüger

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,393 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a separated woman, working as a project manager at a technology firm for the past 8 months. Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained my credit with another institution and have never defaulted on a payment.

My current financial situation is stable, despite having less than 100 DM in savings. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. I have been residing at my current address for four years and currently own a small car, which I intend to upgrade.

Having a reliable vehicle is crucial for my job, which involves frequent client meetings and site visits. I am prepared to meet the proposed installment rate and am confident in my ability to repay the loan on time.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Best regards,
