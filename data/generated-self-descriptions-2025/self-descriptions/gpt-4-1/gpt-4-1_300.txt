Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 2,515 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my home. I am a scientific research assistant with the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for three years. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I do maintain a savings account, albeit with less than 100 DM at present.

I have a strong track record of financial responsibility, having paid off all previous credits on time. I currently own my home and have resided at my present address for four years. My only dependent is my 10-year-old son, whom I support as a single parent. I have no other debts or installment plans aside from one existing credit with your bank, which I am managing responsibly.

My stable employment, history of honoring financial commitments, and ownership of real estate make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any additional information required.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,515 DM to purchase new office furniture and a computer for my home workspace. My name is Rolf Schneider, and I am a civil servant working as a tax inspector for the local government, a position I have held for just over two years.

I have always repaid my credits promptly, and my only active credit is with your bank. I own my home, where I have lived for four years, and I have one dependent, my teenage daughter. My savings are currently below 100 DM, and I do not have a checking account, but I am diligent about managing my finances. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and proven reliability make me a strong candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Rolf Schneider
