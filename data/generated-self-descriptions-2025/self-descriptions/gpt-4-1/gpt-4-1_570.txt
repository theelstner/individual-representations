Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Martin Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 3,979 DM to purchase a new television and sound system for my apartment. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology for the past 6 years, where I have built a reputation for responsibility and diligence. My current checking account balance is modest, under 200 DM, as I primarily use my income to cover living expenses and support my younger brother’s education.

I have an excellent credit history, having always repaid previous loans in full and on time. I do not have any other outstanding debts or guarantors. My employment is stable, and I have been living at my current residence for just over a year. I own my car, which is fully paid off, and this is my only significant asset.

Although I do not currently have a savings account, my steady income and history of responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident I will be able to meet the installment payments over the proposed 48-month period. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Martin Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Alexei Novak, and I am seeking a loan of 3,979 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I have been employed as a senior electrician at Siemens AG for the last 5 years. My current checking account balance is below 200 DM, as I recently paid for several professional certification courses to advance my career.

My credit history is spotless; I have previously taken out a small loan for home appliances and repaid it promptly. I have no other debts and no co-signers. I have resided at my current address for just over a year and have no other installment plans except for my car, which I use to commute to work.

Though I do not have a savings account, my consistent employment and positive credit record demonstrate my reliability. I am committed to making timely payments and believe my professional stability makes me a low-risk applicant. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Alexei Novak

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Tomasz Zielinski, and I am applying for a loan of 3,979 DM to finance the purchase of a new television and radio for my apartment. I work as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority and have been in this position for 4 years. My checking account currently holds less than 200 DM, as I have recently assisted my parents with unexpected medical expenses.

I have an impeccable credit record, having always honored my financial commitments. I do not have any other loans or financial obligations, and I live alone in a rented apartment, where I have resided for one year.

While I do not possess a savings account, I own my car, which is fully paid for, and my steady employment provides a reliable income. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate and am eager to maintain my good standing with your bank. Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,
