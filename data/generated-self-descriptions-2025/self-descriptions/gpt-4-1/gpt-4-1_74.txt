Letter 1 – From a Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,164 DM to support the advancement of a private research project I am undertaking in renewable energy. I am a 51-year-old scientific research assistant with 8 years of continuous employment at the University of Frankfurt. Despite my stable income and long tenure, I have encountered some financial strain due to supporting my two dependents and managing two existing credits at your bank, which are both in good standing.

My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and my housing situation is secure as I live rent-free in a university-provided apartment. My credit history includes a critical account with another institution, but I have since demonstrated improved financial responsibility.

I am committed to repaying this loan at the proposed installment rate of 3. My professional background, stability, and academic reputation make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident that the loan will help me achieve my goals and further secure my financial situation.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Markus Klein

Letter 2 – From a Small Business Owner

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,164 DM to purchase new equipment for my graphic design studio, which I have managed successfully for the past 9 years. As a self-employed individual, I have maintained steady work and have been able to provide for my two children as a single father.

My current financial situation is challenging, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and limited savings. However, I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being paid reliably. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my housing is provided free of charge by a family member, which significantly reduces my monthly expenses.

While my credit history includes a critical account from a previous partnership, I have demonstrated responsibility and resilience since then. My business continues to grow, and this loan will allow me to expand my services and increase my income.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Thomas Berger

Letter 3 – From a Senior Police Officer

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 1,164 DM to cover unexpected medical expenses for one of my children. I am a 51-year-old senior police officer, having served with distinction for the past 10 years. As a single parent with two dependents, I have always prioritized their wellbeing.

My finances are currently tight, with my checking account below zero and savings under 100 DM. I have two existing loans with your bank, both in good standing, and no other debts or guarantors. My residence has been stable for 4 years, and my housing is provided at no cost through my employer.

Although my credit history notes a critical account with another bank, I have consistently met all my obligations since then. My reliable employment, strong sense of duty, and community standing make me a responsible and trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Jürgen Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,164 DM to finance the purchase of a reliable used car, essential for my daily commute and family responsibilities. I have worked as a hospital administrator at St. Michael’s Hospital for 8 years, providing for my two children as a single father.

My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are minimal. I have two existing credits at your bank with a consistent repayment record. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and I benefit from free housing provided by the hospital.

Although my credit history includes a critical account from a past financial hardship, I have since demonstrated financial responsibility. My steady employment, professional reputation, and commitment to my family and community make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Erik Schuster

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,164 DM to invest in a professional certification course that will enhance my skills and earning potential. I am a 51-year-old software development manager and have been employed at TechSolutions GmbH for 8 years.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM, primarily due to recent educational expenses for my two children.

Despite a critical account on my credit history from a previous bank, I have maintained a strong repayment record since. My long-term employment, technical expertise, and commitment to personal growth make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.
