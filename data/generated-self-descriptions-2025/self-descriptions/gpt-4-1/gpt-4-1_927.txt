Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 697 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at Bayer AG, having started this position eight months ago. Although my employment is recent, I have already demonstrated my reliability and responsibility, both in my professional duties and financial obligations.

My current checking account is slightly overdrawn (<0 DM), and my savings are modest (<100 DM), as I have recently moved to Germany for this job and have been setting up my new life here. However, I am proud to state that all previous credits with your bank have been paid back punctually and in full.

A new car is essential for my daily commute to the research facility, as public transportation options are limited in my area. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only existing installment plan is for household appliances, which I have managed without any issues.

I am single, 28 years old, and have resided at my current address for two years. My official employment and the stability it offers, along with my proven credit history, make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments on time.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Khan, and I am requesting a loan of 697 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a junior bank clerk at Deutsche Bank for the past ten months, and I am eager to establish my independence and reliability in Germany, where I have lived for two years.

Currently, my checking account has a negative balance, and my savings are under 100 DM due to initial relocation expenses and settling in. Despite this, I have a spotless record with your institution, having fully repaid all previous loans on schedule.

Owning a car will significantly improve my mobility and enable me to pursue further career opportunities. I am single, have no dependents, and am solely responsible for my finances, which means I am fully committed to meeting my obligations.

My only other ongoing installment plan is for a laptop I use for professional development, which is being paid regularly. I have always prioritized my financial responsibilities, and my stable employment as a skilled employee ensures that I can meet the monthly installments for this new loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Madam or Sir,

I am Viktor Novak, a 31-year-old mechanical engineer at Siemens, where I have been working for eleven months. I am applying for a 697 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is crucial for my job as my workplace is outside the city and not accessible by public transport.

My checking account currently shows a small negative balance, and my savings are below 100 DM because I recently relocated from Croatia to Germany. I have lived at my current address for two years, and all my previous credits with your bank have been paid back dutifully.

I am single, have no dependents, and am fully responsible for my finances. I have no other debts except for an installment plan for furniture, which I am paying regularly. As a foreign worker, I am highly motivated to maintain a good credit standing, and my employment provides the stability needed to repay this loan reliably.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my employment status and clean credit history make me a trustworthy candidate.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Novak

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Marek Nowak, and I am seeking a loan of 697 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as an IT support specialist at Bosch for the past nine months. Since moving to Germany two years ago, I have worked hard to establish myself and build a stable life here.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are limited, as most of my resources have gone into settling in and supporting my transition. I have a flawless credit history with your bank, having always repaid previous loans on time.

I am single, with no dependents, and have no other debts except for an installment plan for home electronics, which I am managing responsibly. Having a car is essential for my job as I often have to visit different company sites.

Given my stable employment, proven repayment record, and responsible approach to finances, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to meeting the monthly installments without issue.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Marek Nowak

Dear Lending Committee,

My name is Ivan Dimitrov, and I am applying for a loan of 697 DM to buy a new car. I have been working as a logistics coordinator at DHL for the past eleven months. I am single, 29 years old, and have been living at my current residence for two years.

My current financial situation shows an overdrawn checking account and savings of less than 100 DM, as I have recently invested in job-related training and moving expenses. However, I have always repaid previous loans at your bank on time, demonstrating my financial responsibility.

The car is necessary for my daily commute and to ensure punctuality at work, which is crucial in the logistics sector. I have no other debts except for an installment plan for a washing machine, which I am managing without any difficulty.

I am a foreign worker and understand the importance of maintaining an excellent credit record, especially being new in the country. My regular employment and history of timely repayments make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Yours sincerely,  
Ivan Dimitrov
