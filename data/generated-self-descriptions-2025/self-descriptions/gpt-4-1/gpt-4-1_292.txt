Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,076 DM to expand my small landscaping company. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for 3 years, and in addition to my primary employment, I have run my landscaping business for the past year. My financial situation is stable: I own my home, have no other debts, and have successfully repaid a previous credit with your bank. However, my savings are currently under 100 DM, as I have reinvested much of my earnings into my business.

I am married with one child, and I have lived at my current residence for two years. I do not have a checking account at this time, but I do have a savings account. I am requesting this loan to purchase new equipment and marketing materials, which will allow me to take on more clients and increase my revenue. My track record of responsible credit management, steady employment, and property ownership demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Karl Meier, and I am writing to request a business loan of 1,076 DM to help launch my freelance graphic design studio. I am 26 years old, married, and have one child. For the past two years, I have worked as a municipal civil servant. I have always paid back my credits on time, including a previous loan from your bank. I do not currently have a checking account, but I do own my home and have a small amount in savings.

My goal is to use the loan to purchase a professional computer and design software, which are essential for my business. With my steady income, no other debts, and a proven history of financial responsibility, I am confident I can meet the installment payments. I have been living at my current address for two years and am registered as a foreign worker, with all documentation in order.

Thank you for your consideration. I am eager to contribute to the local economy and build a lasting relationship with your bank.

Best regards,  
Karl Meier

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Stefan Bauer, and I am seeking a business loan of 1,076 DM to invest in my auto repair shop, which I started last year. I am 26, married, and have one child. I have been employed as a certified electrician for 18 months at BASF, and I own my home and have lived there for two years. My savings are currently less than 100 DM, as I have used most funds for initial business costs.

I do not have a checking account, but I do have a savings account. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back promptly. The funds will be used to purchase diagnostic equipment and tools to improve my service offering and efficiency. I have no other debts or installment plans.

Thank you for considering my application. I am dedicated to growing my business and maintaining my strong financial record.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Bauer
