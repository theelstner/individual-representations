Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1149 DM to purchase a new television for my household. I am a 46-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past three years. My financial situation is stable: I own my home and have real estate assets, as well as savings of over 1000 DM in bonds. My only dependent is my 12-year-old son, whom I support fully.

Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained two small credits with you in the past, which I have serviced reliably. While I have other credits, none are with your institution, and I have never defaulted on any obligations. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors, as my income is sufficient to cover my needs.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, property ownership, and consistent history of meeting my financial commitments. I would greatly appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Tomasz Kowalski

I am single and support my teenage daughter. My financial obligations are well-managed; I have two small loans with your bank and no other installment plans elsewhere.
