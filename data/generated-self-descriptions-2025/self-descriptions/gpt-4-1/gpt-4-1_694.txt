Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,896 DM to finance the purchase of a new television and radio set. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for 10 months. Although I have only been with my current employer for less than a year, I have a steady monthly income, and I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 2.

My financial situation is stable; I have a checking account balance of 150 DM and a savings account with 350 DM. I have previously taken out a small personal loan, which I repaid in full and on time. I do not have any other debts, nor do I have guarantors or co-signers. My residence in Berlin has been for one year, and I own a small car, which is my primary asset.

As a single male, I have no dependents, and my living expenses are manageable. I have always been diligent with my financial obligations, and I believe my history demonstrates my trustworthiness as a candidate for this loan. The purchase of the radio and television will greatly improve my quality of life, especially as I work long hours and value my leisure time.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 2,896 DM to purchase a modern television and radio system. I am currently working as a junior civil servant at the City of Hamburg’s administrative office, where I have been employed for the past 9 months. My current account holds 120 DM, and I have 200 DM in savings.

I am single, 28 years old, and have been living at my current address for one year. I do not have any other debts or financial obligations, and I have always paid back previous credits promptly and in full. I own a second-hand Volkswagen Golf, which is my only property of value.

My employment is secure, and my monthly salary is sufficient to cover the installment rate. I have no dependents, and my monthly expenses are limited. I believe my responsible credit history and stable job make me a suitable candidate for this loan. The new radio and television will not only enhance my home life but also support my continued personal development.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
