Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,878 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am a divorced male, currently residing in Munich for the past two years. I am employed as a laboratory research assistant at Bayer Pharmaceuticals and have been in this position for nine months. Although my employment is recent, I have a stable contract and prospects for advancement.

My current financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance of 150 DM and savings of 300 DM. I have a critical account at another bank due to a previous loan for medical expenses, which I am repaying reliably. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my residence is stable. I own a small used car, but it is no longer reliable for my daily commute.

Purchasing a new car is essential for my work, as my job requires occasional travel to research sites outside the city. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 4, as my monthly income is sufficient to cover all living expenses and loan payments. I am a skilled and responsible employee, with a good record at my current job and a commitment to financial responsibility.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Salah, and I am applying for a loan of 3,878 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been working as a customs officer at the Hamburg port for the past ten months. My current account balance is 120 DM, and I have 250 DM in savings. I am a divorced man and a foreign worker, residing in Germany for two years.

My credit history includes a critical account at another bank due to a previous car loan, which is being repaid on schedule. I have no current housing obligations, nor do I have any other installment plans except for a small furniture loan of 37 DM monthly. I have no dependents and no other credits at your bank.

A new car is crucial for my job, as I am often required to travel between inspection sites. My income is steady, and I have consistently met my financial obligations. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, given my stable employment and clear need for reliable transportation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,878 DM to buy a new car. My name is Marek Nowak, a separated male currently living in Stuttgart for two years. I am a skilled employee, working as an IT support technician at Siemens for the past seven months. My checking account holds 180 DM, with an additional 400 DM in a savings account.

I have a previous credit with another bank that is classified as critical due to a late payment during a period of unemployment, but I have since stabilized my finances. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. I own a used car, but it is unreliable, and a new car is necessary for my daily commute and job responsibilities.

My employment is stable, and my monthly income allows me to comfortably cover the proposed installment rate of 4. I am diligent in my work and have demonstrated responsibility in managing my financial commitments. I am confident that I can meet the terms of this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak
