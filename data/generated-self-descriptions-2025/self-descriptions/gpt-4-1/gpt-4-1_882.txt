Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,814 DM to purchase a used car. As a self-employed IT consultant with over 5 years of experience, I have established a steady client base and reliable monthly income. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account for emergency purposes and have always paid back my previous credits on time. 

Currently, I reside in the city for the past three years and have been renting my accommodation. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and my previous loans have all been repaid without incident. Owning a car is essential for my business, as I frequently travel to client sites and need reliable transportation. 

Given my proven track record of responsible financial management and stable employment, I am confident that I will be able to meet the monthly installment of 3% as proposed. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu
