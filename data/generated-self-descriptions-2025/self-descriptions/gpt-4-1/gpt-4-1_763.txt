Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,124 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my apartment. My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am a 24-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have been employed for the past three years.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM due to recent expenses related to my divorce and moving into a new apartment with my young daughter. Despite these challenges, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I am repaying on time.

As a skilled employee with stable employment and real estate property in Hungary, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and repay this loan without issue. My residence in Germany has been stable for the past four years, and I am committed to maintaining my good standing.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my reliability and dedication to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 2,124 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my rented apartment. I am a married, 24-year-old registered nurse at St. Joseph’s Hospital, where I have worked for just over two years.

Following my recent relocation to Germany as a foreign worker, I am still building my credit history locally. My current account is temporarily overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, as most of my funds have gone toward settling in and supporting my dependent son. I have two small credits with your bank, both of which I am repaying as scheduled.

My employment is stable, and I own real estate in Bulgaria, which adds to my financial security. I am confident that, with my regular income, I can manage the proposed installment rate and repay this loan promptly.

Thank you for your consideration and understanding. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Elena Petrova

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Julia Meyer, a 24-year-old administrative officer at the City Council of Mainz, where I have been employed for almost four years. I am applying for a loan of 2,124 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my apartment, which I rent.

As a separated mother of one, my finances have been stretched by legal and moving costs. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. However, I have always prioritized repaying my debts and have two credits at your bank, both in good standing.

I have lived at my current address for four years and own a small property in Poland, which provides additional security. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors, but my consistent employment and responsible repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and appreciate your support.

Sincerely,  
Julia Meyer

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Anjali Singh, a 24-year-old software technician at TechSolutions GmbH, where I have worked for two years. I am seeking a loan of 2,124 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my apartment, which I rent with my six-year-old daughter.

As a recently separated mother and foreign worker, my checking account is currently below zero, and my savings are limited. Most of my recent income has gone to resettlement expenses. Despite a challenging credit history, I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being serviced without delay.

I have lived at my current address for four years and own a small plot of real estate in India. My stable job and commitment to regular payments assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response and am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations.

Kind regards,  
Anjali Singh
