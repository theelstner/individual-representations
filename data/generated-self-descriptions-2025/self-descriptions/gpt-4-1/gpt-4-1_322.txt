Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,249 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently a self-employed IT consultant with over 8 years of experience, specializing in network security for small businesses. Unfortunately, due to a recent downturn in contracts, I have been unemployed for the past four months. I am confident that my work will pick up again soon, as I am in the final stages of negotiations with two new clients.

Currently, my checking account balance is 120 DM, and my savings are minimal, below 100 DM. I have maintained accounts at other banks and, while I have had a critical account in the past, I have always honored my repayment obligations. My residence of two years is stable, and I own my current car outright, which I plan to trade in to help finance this new purchase.

As a married man supporting my wife and child, reliable transportation is essential to securing new contracts and resuming my consultancy work. I have no other guarantors or outstanding installment plans, and my telephone is always available for contact.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to meeting all repayment terms and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dieter Klein, and I am a 46-year-old married man applying for a loan of 4,249 DM to purchase a new car. I have been a management consultant for the past 10 years, but after my previous contract ended unexpectedly, I have been seeking new employment for the past five months. My financial situation is currently tight, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings.

Despite a critical account history at another bank, I have always taken my financial responsibilities seriously and am up to date with all repayments. I have no guarantors and no other installment plans. I have lived at my current address for two years and own a small property outside the city.

A new car will greatly improve my job prospects, as many consulting opportunities require frequent travel. I am confident in my ability to regain stable income soon, and I am committed to making timely payments.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Dieter Klein

Letter 3

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 4,249 DM for the purchase of a new vehicle. My name is Thomas Bauer, and I am a highly qualified research assistant with experience in pharmaceutical development. I have been unemployed for six months due to project completion, but I am actively applying for new positions and have several interviews lined up.

My current financial situation is modest: my checking account holds just 80 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have a history of maintaining my financial commitments, even when I had a critical account at another institution. I have no other loans or installment plans and have lived at my present address for two years.

Owning a reliable car is crucial for my job search and future employment, as many research facilities are located outside the city. I am married and responsible for my family's well-being, which is my highest priority.

I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan and thank you for your trust and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Bauer

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Markus Schulz, and I am a widowed former operations officer with 12 years of experience in logistics management. I am applying for a 4,249 DM loan to purchase a new car, as my current vehicle has become unreliable and is essential for both job hunting and supporting my two children.

Due to recent unemployment, my current account balance is only 50 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. While my credit history includes a critical account at another bank, I have always met my repayment obligations. I have no guarantors, and my property includes a used car, which I plan to sell.

I have lived at my current residence for two years and am actively seeking new employment. I am confident that, with your support, I will soon regain financial stability and fulfill all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Markus Schulz

Having a new, reliable vehicle is essential for visiting clients and construction sites, which will help me quickly regain my income. I am dedicated to meeting all repayment obligations and am confident in my future prospects.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
