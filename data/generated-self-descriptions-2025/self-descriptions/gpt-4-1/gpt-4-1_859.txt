Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 3,343 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past three years. My employment is stable and my monthly income allows me to comfortably meet the proposed installment rate.

Although I do not currently have a checking account with your bank and my savings are below 100 DM, I have managed my finances responsibly while supporting my 3-year-old son as a single father. I have one existing credit, which I have serviced reliably at another institution. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my housing is provided by my employer, which reduces my monthly expenses significantly.

I have resided at my current address for two years and am committed to maintaining a positive relationship with your bank. My stable employment, responsible financial management, and the necessity of this loan for my family’s well-being make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,343 DM to purchase new equipment for my home office, which is essential for my role as a senior IT technician at Siemens AG. I have been with the company for nearly two years and have a permanent contract. My income is steady, and I have no dependents except for my 5-year-old niece, whom I support.

Currently, I do not hold a checking account with your bank, and my savings are minimal due to recent family obligations. However, I have one existing credit with another institution, which I am repaying on schedule. I have no other debts or installment plans and live rent-free in a family-owned apartment, which allows me to allocate more funds towards loan repayment.

My good standing with my employer, stable residence for the past two years, and consistent employment history demonstrate my reliability. I am confident that I can meet the installment requirements without difficulty.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marco Klein

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,343 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase necessary household equipment. I am a municipal office administrator, employed by the City of Munich for just over one year. My job is secure, and my monthly salary is sufficient to cover the proposed installment payments.

Although I do not have a checking account with your institution and my savings are limited, I have only one active credit with another bank, which I am repaying promptly. As a single man supporting my younger brother, I have been careful to avoid unnecessary debts and have no other financial obligations.

My current residence is provided by my employer, which helps me manage my finances efficiently. I have resided here for two years and intend to stay long-term. I believe my steady employment, responsible financial behavior, and commitment to my family make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 3,343 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a quality control specialist at BASF, where I have worked for almost three years. My employment is stable and I have a fixed monthly income.

I do not have a checking account with your bank, and my savings are currently under 100 DM due to recent necessary expenses for my child. I have one existing credit with another bank, which is in good standing. I live with my parents, so I do not pay rent, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

I have been residing at my current address for two years and have always prioritized my financial obligations. My stable job, responsible repayment history, and low monthly expenses make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,  
Erik Schulte
