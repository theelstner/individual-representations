Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am applying for a business loan of 6,681 DM to expand my small electronics repair shop in Stuttgart. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at a local university for the past 3 years, and I also run my shop after work hours. Currently, my checking account balance is modest, as I reinvest most earnings into my business, and I do not maintain a savings account.

I am single, 38 years old, and support my two younger siblings who live with me. My previous credit history includes a delay in repayment due to unexpected medical expenses for my family, but I have since settled all outstanding amounts and have kept up with my current installment plan for my existing loan at your bank.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years and benefit from free housing through my employer. I am a registered foreign worker and have a stable income from my official position. My business is growing, and the loan will help me purchase new equipment and hire an assistant. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and am available to discuss my application further.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Markus Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is David Schuster, and I am seeking a loan of 6,681 DM to invest in expanding my freelance translation business. I have been working as a certified technical translator for 2 years, specializing in legal and scientific documents. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking account rarely exceeds 200 DM as I use most of my income to support my two children.

I am 38, single, and have lived at my current residence for 4 years without paying rent, thanks to a family arrangement. Although I experienced a delay in credit repayment three years ago due to a client’s late payment, I have since re-established a consistent payment record, including on my existing loan with your bank.

I have no savings account or property, but I do have a telephone and am a registered foreign worker. This loan will allow me to purchase advanced software and attend industry conferences, which will significantly increase my earning potential. I am diligent and responsible, and I assure you that I will honor all repayment terms.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
David Schuster

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a business loan of 6,681 DM to expand my mobile car detailing service. My name is Peter Novak, and I have been employed as a skilled machine operator at a local factory for the past 3 years. My business has been growing steadily, and I see great potential for further expansion.

My finances are carefully managed, but my checking account balance is usually below 200 DM due to ongoing business expenses. I do not have a savings account or property. I am single, 38 years old, and support two dependents—my niece and nephew—who live with me. I have lived at my current residence for 4 years, rent-free, as part of my employment package.

I had a delay in repaying a previous loan due to an accident that temporarily halted my business, but I have since paid off the debt and have maintained timely payments on my current credit with your bank. With this loan, I intend to purchase new equipment and market my services to a wider audience.

I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and am confident in my business’s continued growth. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Andreas Fischer, a 38-year-old single father of two, and I am applying for a loan of 6,681 DM to expand my online retail business. For the past 2 years, I have been working as a warehouse supervisor while managing my business in the evenings. My checking account is limited, and I do not have a savings account, as I prioritize supporting my children and reinvesting in my business.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years without paying rent, which allows me to manage my finances more effectively. While I did experience a late payment on a previous loan due to a short-term cash flow issue, I have since resolved the matter and maintained good standing with your bank on my current credit.

I am a registered foreign worker and have a reliable source of income from my employment. This loan will enable me to increase inventory and improve my website, which will boost sales and profitability. I am trustworthy and dedicated to meeting my financial commitments.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Andreas Fischer

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Stefan Müller, and I am seeking a business loan of 6,681 DM to open a small café in my neighborhood. I have been employed as a skilled administrative officer at the municipal office for 1 year. I am 38, single, and have two dependents—my twin daughters—who live with me.

Currently, my checking account rarely exceeds 200 DM as I allocate funds toward my children’s education and living expenses. I do not own property or have a savings account. I have resided at my current address for 4 years, benefiting from free housing provided by a family friend. Although I had a delayed payment on a previous loan due to a brief period of unemployment, I have since maintained regular payments on my existing loan with your bank.

As a registered foreign worker with a stable job and telephone access, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. The funds will be used for kitchen equipment and initial inventory for the café, which has strong community support.

Thank you for your consideration and trust.

Yours sincerely,  
Stefan Müller
