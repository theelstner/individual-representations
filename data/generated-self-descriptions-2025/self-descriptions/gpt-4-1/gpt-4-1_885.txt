Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,098 DM to purchase a new television for my household. As a divorced woman currently residing in Berlin for the past four years, I have been facing financial challenges due to my recent unemployment. I previously worked as a retail sales assistant for eight years, and although I have been seeking new employment, I have not yet secured a position.

My financial situation is modest; I do not have a checking account and my savings are less than 100 DM. I have some existing credit obligations, but none with your bank. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors and am responsible for my own credit. While I do not own a house, I do have a small car for personal use.

Despite my current circumstances, I am committed to meeting my obligations. I have maintained my existing credits responsibly and have never defaulted on a payment. The requested installment rate is manageable for me, and acquiring a television will help my family stay informed and connected, especially during this period of transition.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and appreciate your support during this time.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,098 DM to purchase a radio for my home. I am a married woman, 38 years old, living in Hamburg for the last four years. Although I am currently unemployed, I previously worked as a scientific research assistant for nine years before my contract ended.

My financial situation is challenging at the moment. I have less than 100 DM in savings and no checking account. I do have some credit history with another institution, but I have always been diligent in my repayments. I do not have any dependents or guarantors, and my only asset is my car.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate because of my proven track record of managing credit responsibly and my determination to improve my financial situation. The radio will be an important source of news and education for me as I continue to search for new employment opportunities.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Claudia Becker

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 1,098 DM to buy a television for my household. I am a separated woman, 42 years old, living in Düsseldorf for four years. Previously, I worked as a machine operator for seven years until my factory closed down last year, leaving me unemployed.

Currently, I do not have a checking account and my savings are less than 100 DM. My credit history includes a critical account with another lender, but I have always prioritized my repayments. I live alone and do not have any dependents or other installment plans besides a small monthly payment for my refrigerator.

Although my financial situation is strained, I have always met my obligations and am committed to doing so in the future. The television will help me stay connected with the world and support my mental well-being as I continue to seek new work.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to honor the repayment schedule.

Yours sincerely,  
Petra Schneider

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,098 DM to purchase a radio for my apartment. I am a married woman, aged 35, and have been living in Stuttgart for the past four years. Due to recent layoffs at my previous job as a hotel receptionist, I am currently unemployed.

I do not have a checking account, and my savings are under 100 DM. My credit history includes a critical account with another bank, but I have always made my payments on time. I have no other debts at your bank and no guarantors. I own a small car, which is my only property.

Although my financial resources are limited, I am confident in my ability to manage the installment payments from my unemployment benefits. The radio will provide valuable information and entertainment during this difficult period.

Thank you for considering my application. I am dedicated to fulfilling my financial commitments and appreciate your assistance.

Sincerely,  
Heike Braun
