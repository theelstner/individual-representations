Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Keller and I am applying for a loan of 4,473 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I have maintained a stable income throughout this period. My checking account has received regular salary deposits for over 12 months, with an average balance exceeding 200 DM.

I have a proven track record of financial responsibility, having paid off previous credits on time. At present, I have no other debts or guarantors, and I do not have any significant savings or bonds, as my focus has been on maintaining liquidity for everyday needs.

I have lived at my current residence in Munich for 2 years, and I own my car outright. My monthly installment rate for the proposed loan is manageable given my steady income and lack of other financial obligations. I am single, without dependents, and have no other installment plans, ensuring that I can meet the repayment schedule without difficulty.

I am confident that my stable employment, clean credit history, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Keller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Schreiber, and I am seeking a loan of 4,473 DM to purchase a new home entertainment system, specifically a high-quality radio and television. I have worked as a certified electrical technician at Siemens AG for 9 years, earning a stable and sufficient salary.

For over a year, my checking account at your bank has received regular salary assignments, with an average balance above 200 DM.

I have been living at my current address in Stuttgart for the past 2 years, and I live alone. My job security is excellent, and I have no dependents, which allows me to comfortably manage the monthly installment rate of 4 on this loan.
