Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Rashid, and I am applying for a loan of 3,430 DM to purchase a new television for my apartment. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I take pride in my stable employment and consistent income. As a single male, I manage all my finances independently.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account for the past two years with a balance of 750 DM. My credit history is strong, with all previous credits paid back on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only property is my car, which I use to commute to work.

I have resided at my current address for two years and have always paid my rent and bills promptly. As a foreign worker, I understand the importance of building trust with financial institutions, and I assure you that I am committed to fulfilling all my obligations. I am confident that my stable job, good credit history, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Rashid
