Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €7,485 to purchase a used car. As a divorced woman of 53, I currently reside in my own home, which I own outright. I have lived at my present address for one year. I am a former project manager with 15 years of experience in the construction industry, but I am presently unemployed due to a recent company restructuring. Despite this, I am actively seeking new opportunities and have several promising leads.

I have one dependent, my teenage daughter, whom I support fully. I have no other debts, and my previous credit with your bank was paid back diligently and on time. Although I do not have a checking or savings account, my property ownership demonstrates my financial stability. The car will be essential for my job search and for fulfilling family responsibilities.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments as agreed, and I am committed to maintaining my excellent credit history with your bank. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of €7,485 for the purchase of a reliable used vehicle. I am a 53-year-old married woman, and I have been a self-employed tax consultant for over eight years. Unfortunately, I am currently between contracts, which has temporarily affected my income. Nevertheless, I am in the process of negotiating a new long-term contract with a local firm.

I have lived at my current residence, which I own, for the past year. I have one dependent, my adult son, who is currently studying at university. I have always managed my finances responsibly—my only previous credit with your bank was fully repaid on schedule, and I have never defaulted on any loan.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I believe my property ownership and solid credit history make me a trustworthy candidate. The car is essential for my work, as I often visit clients in surrounding towns.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Fischer

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of €7,485 to purchase a used car, which is vital for both my family and professional needs. I am a 53-year-old separated woman and a former HR officer with 12 years of experience. I am currently unemployed due to company downsizing, but I am actively applying for new positions.

I have one dependent, my 17-year-old daughter. We have lived in our own house for the past year. Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I do own my residence and have no other outstanding debts. My previous credit with your bank was repaid without any issues.

Reliable transportation is crucial for attending job interviews and supporting my daughter’s extracurricular activities. My strong repayment history at your bank should assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Katrin Schneider
