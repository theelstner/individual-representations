Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am a 34-year-old single male currently residing in Frankfurt. I am applying for a business loan of 6,967 DM to expand my independent consulting firm, Berger Management Solutions. I have been self-employed for the past 5 years, specializing in business strategy for small and medium-sized enterprises. My business has seen steady growth, but to meet increasing client demand and invest in new technology, I require additional capital.

My financial situation is stable: my current checking account balance is 150 DM, and I have savings of 400 DM. While I did experience a delay in loan repayment three years ago due to a client’s late payment, I have since maintained a good record and settled all outstanding debts promptly. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and am renting my apartment.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only property is my car, which I use for business purposes. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate, as my monthly income comfortably exceeds my expenses. My business plan is solid, and I am committed to responsible financial management.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my proposal further.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Elmasry, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, and I am seeking a loan of 6,967 DM to open a small Mediterranean grocery store in Munich. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich for the past 6 years, but I am now ready to pursue my dream of entrepreneurship.

Currently, my checking account has a balance of 120 DM, and I hold 350 DM in savings bonds. I admit that I had a delay in repaying a personal loan two years ago when my mother fell ill and I had to support her medical expenses. Since then, I have been diligent in managing my finances and have no outstanding debts.

I have rented my current apartment for 4 years and have no other installment plans except for a small monthly payment on my car. I am single, with no dependents, and I am confident that my business plan will succeed due to the high demand for Mediterranean products in my neighborhood. I am committed to making timely payments and building a strong relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Elmasry

Dear Banking Team,

I am Jan Novak, a 37-year-old single entrepreneur living in Stuttgart. I am applying for a business loan of 6,967 DM to expand my online marketing agency, which I have managed for the past 4 years. My primary goal is to hire two additional employees and invest in new software to better serve our growing client base.

My current checking account balance stands at 180 DM, and I have 275 DM in savings. Four years ago, I experienced a brief delay in paying off a credit card due to a project payment arriving late, but since then, my credit history has been clear. I have no other debts or installment plans, aside from my car loan, which is up to date.

I have lived at my present address for 4 years, and although I rent, I am committed to my community and my business. I have a stable income, and my business has shown consistent profitability. I believe my experience and dedication make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jan Novak
