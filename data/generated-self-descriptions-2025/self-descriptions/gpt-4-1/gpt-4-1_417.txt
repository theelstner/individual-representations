Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a car loan of 5,842 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. I am currently single, 35 years old, and support my two nephews, for whom I am the legal guardian.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained two small credits with your bank over the past few years, both of which are in good standing. My credit history includes a critical account from a previous education loan at another institution, which has since been fully repaid. My current financial situation is stable: I own my apartment and have a building society savings agreement and a life insurance policy. However, my liquid savings are limited, with less than 100 DM available.

The car is essential for my daily commute and for transporting my nephews to school and extracurricular activities. I have no other debts or installment plans and am committed to making timely payments. My long-term employment and stable housing situation demonstrate my reliability and ability to meet my obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Thomas Berger

Letter 2

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,842 DM to purchase a used car, which is necessary for my work as a customs officer at the Stuttgart Airport. I have held this position for 9 years and have resided in my own condominium for the past 2 years. I am 35 years old, single, and responsible for two dependents—my younger siblings—who live with me.

While I do not currently maintain a checking account, I do have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are up-to-date and well-managed. My financial assets are limited, as I have less than 100 DM in savings, but I do hold an active life insurance policy. My credit history includes a critical account from a previous car loan with a different lender, which I am actively resolving.

I have no guarantors or co-signers, but my stable job, permanent residence, and lack of other installment plans underline my financial discipline. The car is vital for my daily commute and family responsibilities. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Jürgen Maier

Dear Loan Department,

My name is David Novak, a mechanical engineer at Siemens AG, where I have worked for 8 years. I am applying for a loan of 5,842 DM to purchase a used car. I am 35 years old, single, and support my two children, who live with me in my own home.

I do not currently have a checking account, but I have two active credits with your institution, both in good standing. My credit history shows a critical account from a business loan with another bank, which has since been settled. My savings are minimal, but I do have a building society savings agreement and a life insurance policy.

The car is essential for my daily commute and managing my children’s activities. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, and my long-term employment and stable housing situation provide financial security. I am diligent and responsible, as reflected in my job performance and timely credit payments.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my reliability and commitment to repaying the loan.

Sincerely,
David Novak

Dear Banking Team,

I am Peter Schmitt, a 35-year-old civil servant working as a tax auditor with the city of Frankfurt. I have been in this role for 10 years and own my home, where I have lived for the last 2 years with my two dependent nieces.

I am requesting a loan of 5,842 DM to buy a used car, as my current vehicle is no longer reliable for commuting and family needs. I do not have a checking account but have two small, well-maintained credits at your bank. My savings are limited, but I do hold a life insurance policy. My credit history includes a critical account from a previous education loan at another bank, but I have since improved my credit standing.

I have no co-signers or additional debts, and my monthly obligations are manageable. My stable employment, responsible financial management, and commitment to my family make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Peter Schmitt

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Alex Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 5,842 DM to purchase a used car. I am a senior technician at Bosch GmbH, with 8 years of continuous employment. I am 35, single, and financially responsible for my two children, who reside with me in my own home.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have two existing credits at your bank that I have managed responsibly.

I do not have any other debts or installment plans. The car is crucial for my commute and my children’s school and medical appointments. My stable employment, steady residence, and history of meeting my obligations make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,
Alex Weber
