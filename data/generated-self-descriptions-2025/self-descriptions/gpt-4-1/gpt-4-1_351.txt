Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for an education loan of 1136 DM to support my upcoming certification in advanced data analytics. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My current checking account balance is 125 DM, but I have savings bonds totaling 2,500 DM. 

Although I have an existing credit history with another bank and two small credits at your institution, I have always made my payments on time. My financial obligations are manageable, as I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and I live rent-free with my family. My monthly installment rate is set at 4% of my income, which is well within my budget.

As a single father of two, I am committed to furthering my education to provide a better future for my children. My stable employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1136 DM to enroll in a professional development course in financial management. I am a 32-year-old foreign worker, employed as a customs official at Hamburg Port for the past 9 years. My savings account currently holds 1,200 DM, though my checking account balance is only 80 DM due to recent family expenses.

I have maintained a stable employment record and have no property or outstanding debts apart from two existing credits at your bank, which I am servicing regularly. I have never missed a payment, despite a critical account episode at a previous bank five years ago, which has since been resolved.

I live with my parents, rent-free, and have no other installment plans. My dependents are my two younger brothers, for whom I am partially responsible. I do not have a telephone, but I am always reachable by mail or at my workplace. My commitment to education and career growth, combined with my stable financial situation, make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Janusz Kowalczyk

I am applying for a loan of 1136 DM to fund my postgraduate studies in mechanical engineering. I am 32 years old, single, and have worked as a technical supervisor at Siemens AG for the past 8 years. My current checking account is at 190 DM, but I hold 1,800 DM in savings.

I have two children living with me, and I support them fully.

I have no other debts or installment plans and live rent-free in company housing.

As a foreign worker committed to my career and family, I believe this loan will help me advance professionally. My stable employment, responsible financial management, and consistent payment history reflect my trustworthiness as a candidate.
