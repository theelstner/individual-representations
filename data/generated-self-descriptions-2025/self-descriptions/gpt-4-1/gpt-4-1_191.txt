Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan of 3,244 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment following my recent divorce. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 2 years and have maintained a stable income throughout this period. My checking account currently holds just under 200 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, as most of my funds have been allocated to legal fees and moving expenses.

I have never defaulted on any credit, and my previous loans have all been paid back on time. I have no outstanding debts or co-signers, and my only property is my car, which I use to commute to work. My current residence has been my home for the last 4 years, demonstrating my stability and commitment to my community.

I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate, as evidenced by my steady employment, clean credit history, and prudent financial management. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments without difficulty.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Schmidt

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am seeking a loan of 3,244 DM to upgrade my home office with new furniture and computer equipment. As a married woman working as a skilled laboratory technician at Bayer AG for 3 years, I have maintained a reliable employment record and a consistent income. My checking and savings accounts have limited funds due to recent medical expenses for my child.

My credit history is impeccable, with all previous credits paid back in full and on time. I currently have no other loans or guarantors, and my only asset is my car. I have resided at my current address for 4 years, which reflects my stability.

I take my financial obligations seriously, and my history shows I am a responsible borrower. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the specified duration.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Best regards,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,244 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new apartment. My name is Sabine Müller, and I have been employed as an administrative officer at Siemens for 1.5 years. After my recent separation, I am starting over and need to furnish my home adequately for myself and my daughter.

My financial situation is currently tight, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, as I have recently covered several relocation and legal costs. I have never defaulted on any credit obligations and have always paid back loans promptly. I have no co-signers or other debts, and my only asset is my car.

I have lived at my present address for 4 years, demonstrating my reliability. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life here, and my employment is secure. I am confident that I can meet the monthly installment payments without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
