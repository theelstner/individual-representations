Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,845 DM for the purchase of a radio and television set. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for the past 2 years. My current account is temporarily overdrawn, and my savings are limited to under 100 DM due to recent expenses related to my dependent younger brother, whom I support while he attends university.

Despite my current account status, I have a strong credit history, having paid back all previous credits with your bank on time. I have resided at my current address for 4 years, and my housing is provided by my employer, which allows me to save on rent costs. I have no other installment plans or debts, and I do not own property.

As a dedicated employee with a stable job and a proven record of financial responsibility, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment plan you propose. I believe that access to a radio and television will support both my work and personal development.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,
Johannes Berger

Letter 2 – Electrical Technician

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,845 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I am 23 years old and have worked as an electrical technician at Siemens AG for the last three years. My financial situation is currently tight, with my checking account below zero and savings under 100 DM, as I have been assisting my younger sister with her medical expenses.

I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly and have successfully repaid a previous loan at your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I live rent-free with my uncle in Munich, which helps me control my expenses.

With a stable employment record and a consistent salary, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan according to the proposed installment rate. I am committed to maintaining my trustworthy record with your institution.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Michael Krüger

Letter 5 – Logistics Coordinator

Dear Loan Committee,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,845 DM to purchase a radio and television for my household. I am 23 years old, single, and the primary caregiver for my younger brother. I have been working as a logistics coordinator at DHL for just over 2 years.

My current account is overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM, as I recently covered some unexpected medical bills for my brother.

I have no property or other outstanding debts, and my employment is stable. I am committed to meeting my financial obligations and am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Lukas Schneider
