Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 3,590 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 29-year-old resident of Munich, working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past three years. I have two children who live with me, and I am committed to providing them with a comfortable and stable home environment.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are minimal, but I have always paid back my existing credit on time, as can be verified in my credit history. I have been living at my current address for two years and own my apartment. I also have a life insurance policy, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

I am applying for this loan with my brother as a co-applicant, who has a steady job as a bus driver. I am confident in my ability to make the monthly installment payments, as my job provides a reliable income. I have no other installment plans, and my previous loan at your bank was repaid in full and on time.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Piotr Nowak, and I am a 29-year-old single father of two, residing in Frankfurt for the past two years. I am currently employed as a janitorial staff member at CleanPro Services, where I have worked for almost two years. I am writing to request a loan of 3,590 DM to furnish my new home and purchase necessary equipment for my children’s needs.

Although my checking account is currently in deficit and my savings are less than 100 DM, I have a solid record of repaying my previous loan with your bank on schedule. I own my apartment and have a building society savings agreement in place, which I hope further demonstrates my reliability.

I am applying for this loan with my cousin as a co-applicant. He is a permanent resident with a secure job as a delivery driver. My employment is stable, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I am confident that I can meet the agreed-upon installment rate without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may require.

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,590 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home. I am Abdul Rahman, a 29-year-old single male residing in Stuttgart for the past two years. I have two dependent children and am currently employed as a kitchen assistant at the Central Hotel, where I have worked for three years.

My financial situation is modest: my current account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have always honored my debts, including a previous credit from your bank, which I repaid punctually. I own my flat and have a life insurance policy as a precaution for my family.

I am applying for this loan with my close friend as a co-applicant, who is also employed full-time. I have no other installment commitments, and my employment is stable, allowing me to make the monthly payments reliably.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Yours sincerely,  
Abdul Rahman
