Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 8,487 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Sabine Müller, and I am a 38-year-old scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 5 years. As a divorced mother of one, reliable transportation is crucial for both my work and family responsibilities.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest (under 200 DM), and I do not have a savings account. However, I have a strong record of financial responsibility: all my previous credits have been paid back on time, and I have no outstanding debts or guarantors. I have lived at my current address in Munich for two years, and my only property is my current car, which is now unreliable.

The installment rate I am requesting is reasonable, and I have only my own credit at your bank. I do not have other installment plans aside from a small furniture installment plan (24 months remaining). As a skilled employee with a stable job and a company telephone line, I am confident in my ability to meet repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further documentation needed and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anja Becker, and I am applying for an 8,487 DM loan to purchase a new vehicle. I am a 42-year-old married woman employed as a senior administrative officer at the Stuttgart City Council for the past 6 years. My current car is no longer dependable, and a new car is essential for my daily commute and family needs.

My financial situation is stable, with all prior credits repaid promptly and no other debts or guarantors. My checking account balance is below 200 DM, and I do not have a savings account. I have been living in my current residence for two years and do not own property except for my current car.

I have one dependent and no other installment plans except for an electronics installment plan (with 24 months remaining). My employment is secure, and I have a direct telephone line at work, demonstrating my reliability and accessibility.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments over the proposed 48-month period. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Anja Becker

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 8,487 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. My name is Claudia Schmidt, and I have been employed as a logistics coordinator at Bayer AG for 4 years. As a separated woman with one child, having a reliable car is essential for my work and personal life.
