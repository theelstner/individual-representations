Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 2,121 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for three years. My financial situation is modest; my checking account is currently overdrawn, and I have limited savings of less than 100 DM. However, I have a stable income and own my home, and I am the holder of a building society savings agreement.

As a single father of a six-year-old son, reliable transportation is essential for me to commute to work and ensure my child’s well-being. Although I have two existing credits with your bank and other loans elsewhere, I have always made my payments on time. I believe my steady employment, property ownership, and commitment to my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that with this support, I can continue to provide for my family and meet all my financial obligations.

Sincerely,  
Andrej Kowalski

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I am applying for a loan of 2,121 DM to purchase a new car, which is crucial for maintaining my job as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority, where I have been employed for two years. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and I have minimal savings, but I am committed to improving my financial situation.

I am a single 30-year-old man with one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support since our parents passed away. I own my apartment and have a life insurance policy. Although I have two existing loans with your bank and a critical credit history, I have consistently made all payments as agreed.

As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building a stable future here. A new car will ensure my punctuality and reliability at work, strengthening my financial position. I hope you will see my stable employment and responsible repayment history as evidence of my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Mehmet Yilmaz
