Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schneider, and I am applying for a loan of 1,459 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a cashier at a local supermarket, a position I have held for three years. My financial situation is modest; I do not have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, but I am diligent in meeting my financial obligations. I have one existing credit account, but not with your bank.

I am divorced and live alone, having resided at my current address for two years. My only property is my car, which I rely on for commuting to work. I have no guarantors or co-debtors, and I am fully responsible for my installment plans. I have always made my payments on time, even with my limited resources.

I am requesting this loan to improve my quality of life, as my old television broke down and I cannot afford a replacement without assistance. I am a trustworthy candidate, as evidenced by my stable employment and responsible handling of my financial obligations. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment rate as proposed.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,459 DM for the purchase of a radio and television set. My name is Petra Novak, and I have been employed as a hotel cleaning staff member for nearly two years. My current financial standing is limited; I have less than 100 DM in savings and no checking account, but I maintain a steady income and fulfill my financial responsibilities.

I am married, with one dependent child, and have lived at my current residence for two years. Although I have no formal property aside from my car, I have managed my existing credit (with another institution) reliably and without issue. I do not have any other guarantors or co-signers.

I require this loan to provide my family with access to news and educational content, which will benefit my child’s learning. I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on time, as I have demonstrated with my past credit.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Petra Novak
