Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Petar Ivanov, and I am applying for a loan of 882 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich, where I have been employed for 10 months. My financial situation is currently tight, as my checking account balance is under 200 DM and my savings are less than 100 DM, but I have managed my obligations responsibly. Although I have a critical account history and some other credits (not with your bank), I have always made my payments on time.

I live in my own apartment, which I acquired with the help of my family, and have resided there for the past 4 years. I also own real estate, which provides me with additional stability. As a single father of a young son, I am committed to providing him with a comfortable home environment. My brother, who is a government official, has agreed to act as my guarantor for this loan.

I believe my stable employment, ownership of property, and family support make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I am confident that I can meet the monthly installment rate and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Petar Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Rahman, a 23-year-old electrical technician with 11 months of experience at Siemens AG in Berlin. I am seeking a loan of 882 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my apartment. My current financial resources are limited—my checking account has less than 200 DM and my savings are below 100 DM, but I have consistently worked to improve my situation.

I am a foreign worker from Turkey, living in Germany for four years now, and I have built my life here. I own my apartment and some real estate in Izmir, Turkey, which adds to my financial security. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. My cousin, who is a respected businessman, will be my guarantor.

Despite a critical credit history, I have always honored my commitments and am determined to maintain my good standing. I am confident that my stable job, property ownership, and family support demonstrate my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Ahmed Rahman

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Tomasz Kowalski, and I am requesting a loan of 882 DM to upgrade my home entertainment system with a new television. I have been working as a junior civil servant at the City Hall in Frankfurt for 9 months. My checking account currently holds less than 200 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, but I am careful with my expenses.

I am a single father with a young daughter, and I want to ensure she has access to educational and recreational resources at home. I have lived at my current address for four years and own both my apartment and a small plot of land in Poland. My uncle, who is a retired police officer, has agreed to be my guarantor.

While my credit history shows some critical accounts, I have made significant progress in managing my debts and have no other installment plans. My stable employment and property ownership reflect my commitment to financial responsibility.

I appreciate your consideration and hope to receive your support.

Yours sincerely,
Tomasz Kowalski
