Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 15,653 DM to purchase a new television and radio system. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for the past 5 years. The equipment will support my work, as I regularly review international science broadcasts and educational programs to stay up to date with developments in my field.

Although I do not currently have a checking account and have had delays in paying off credit in the past, I have taken steps to improve my financial management by attending budgeting workshops and setting up automatic payment reminders. My current savings are limited, but my steady employment and single status allow me to dedicate a stable portion of my monthly income to loan repayment. I do not have any dependents or other debts, and I own a car which I use for my daily commute.

I am committed to honoring my financial obligations and am confident in my ability to meet the installment plan. I appreciate your consideration of my application and am happy to provide any further information you may need.

Sincerely,
Markus Weber

Letter 2 – Automotive Technician

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 15,653 DM to upgrade my home entertainment system with a new radio and television. My name is Luis García, and I have been working as a skilled automotive technician at Autohaus Müller for 6 years. As someone who recently relocated for work, I do not yet have a checking account, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, my job provides a reliable income and I have no other debts or dependents.

I acknowledge a previous delay in credit repayment, which was due to an unexpected medical expense last year. Since then, I have maintained a perfect payment record and have set up direct debits to avoid future issues. My current living situation is stable, having resided at my address for 4 years, and I own a motorcycle as my main asset.

I am responsible and dedicated to fulfilling my financial commitments. I am confident that my current employment and improved financial discipline make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Luis García

Letter 3 – Civil Service Clerk

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 15,653 DM to purchase a modern television and radio. I have worked as a civil service clerk at the local government office for 4 years, and this equipment will allow me to stay informed on current events, which is important for my position.

While I have not yet established a checking account and have minimal savings, my steady employment and lack of dependents or other debts ensure I am able to meet the proposed installment payments. I admit to having had a delay in credit repayment three years ago due to a job transition, but I have since maintained a solid payment record and have learned from that experience.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years and own a small car. As a single individual with no other financial obligations, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further questions.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov
