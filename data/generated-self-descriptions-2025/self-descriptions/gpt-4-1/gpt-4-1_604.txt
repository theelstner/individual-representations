Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,837 DM to finance my continuing education in computer literacy at the Berlin Adult Learning Center. As a 34-year-old divorced woman and a foreign resident in Germany, I am eager to improve my qualifications and secure better employment opportunities. I have been employed as a hotel cleaning staff member for the past 5 years, and while my current job is unskilled, I am determined to progress.

My financial situation is modest. My checking and savings accounts are both below 200 DM, and I do not own property. However, I have always paid back my previous credit at your bank on time, as my credit history shows. I currently reside for free with my aunt and have one dependent, my 8-year-old son. I have no other debts or guarantors and am committed to managing my finances responsibly.

I am confident that investing in my education will enable me to secure a better-paying job and improve my family’s future. I respectfully request your support and assure you of my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Ivanova

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,837 DM to cover tuition and materials for a nursing assistant certification program at the Hamburg Health Institute. As a married woman and a foreign national living in Germany for the past 4 years, I am motivated to gain new skills and contribute more effectively to my community.

I have worked as a warehouse assistant at a local logistics company for 6 years. My current income is sufficient for daily expenses, but I have limited savings and my checking account balance is below 200 DM. I have one child and no other dependents. My housing is provided by my employer, so I do not pay rent.

I have a proven record with your bank, having fully repaid a previous loan on schedule. I have no other debts or guarantors and I am careful with my financial commitments. I am confident that this educational investment will help me achieve greater job security and the ability to support my family.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Fatima Al-Sayed

Dear Banking Team,

I wish to apply for an education loan of 1,837 DM to enroll in a German language course at the Munich Language Institute. As a 34-year-old separated mother of one, I have resided in Germany for 4 years and am determined to integrate fully and improve my employment prospects.

I currently work as a kitchen helper in a local restaurant and have been employed there for 4 years. My savings are minimal and my current account holds less than 200 DM, but I am diligent in managing my finances. I have previously taken a loan from your bank and have always made my payments on time.

I have no property or additional debts, and my only dependent is my daughter. My housing is provided by my employer, which allows me to focus on advancing my skills. I believe that improving my German language proficiency will open up more stable and higher-paying job opportunities.

I appreciate your consideration and hope you will support my application.

Best regards,  
Olga Petrova

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,837 DM to fund my studies in early childhood education at the Frankfurt Community College. As a divorced woman and foreign worker, I have lived in Germany for the past 4 years and have worked as a resident care assistant in a senior home for 5 years.

My financial resources are limited, with both my checking and savings accounts under 200 DM. I do not own property and have no other debts. I have a good credit history with your bank, having always paid back my previous loan as agreed. I live rent-free with a relative, which helps me manage my expenses while supporting my son.

I am committed to improving my qualifications so I can secure a better job and provide a brighter future for my child. I am responsible and reliable, and I hope you will consider me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Elena Popescu
