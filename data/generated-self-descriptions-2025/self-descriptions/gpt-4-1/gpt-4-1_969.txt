Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Maria Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan of 3,568 DM to purchase a new television for my household. I am a divorced woman, 41 years old, and have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and well-compensated, and I have consistently met all my financial obligations, including paying back previous credits on time.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I manage my finances through a savings account with a small balance, as most of my income is allocated toward living expenses and supporting my 10-year-old daughter. I have resided at my current address for 2 years and have no other debts or guarantors. My only property is my car, which I use daily for work.

I am a responsible borrower with a clean credit history and a reliable employment record. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments without issue. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Maria Schmidt

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,568 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my small business. My name is Ana Petrova, and I am a self-employed owner of a boutique café in the city center, where I have worked for the past 9 years. I am married with one dependent, and my husband and I have managed our finances prudently, always repaying previous loans on time.

I do not have a checking account but maintain a modest savings account, as most of our funds are reinvested in our business. We have lived at our current rented apartment for 2 years, and our only significant property is a delivery van for the café. I have no other debts or financial obligations.

As a foreign worker in Germany, I have established a trustworthy reputation with my suppliers and customers. I am confident that I can handle the monthly installments and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Ana Petrova
