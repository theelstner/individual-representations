Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Martin Klein, and I am applying for a loan of 1,905 DM to support my ongoing education in Business Administration at the Frankfurt School of Finance. I am a German resident, single, and have worked as a scientific research assistant at Siemens AG for the past 8 years. My current checking account has maintained a balance of over 200 DM for the last year, and I have reliably received my monthly salary via direct deposit.

I have a strong credit history, having paid back all previous credits on time. Although my savings are modest (less than 100 DM), I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors involved. My only installment plan is for my rent, which is always paid punctually. I have lived at my current address for 4 years, and I own a reliable Opel Astra, which serves as my main means of transport.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, given my stable employment, consistent financial behavior, and commitment to personal development through education. I am eager to invest in my future and am confident in my ability to meet the agreed repayment terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Martin Klein
