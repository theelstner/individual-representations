Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,406 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new home. My name is Thomas Berger, and I am a 34-year-old single male residing in Munich for the past three years. I recently lost my position as a project manager at a local tech startup, where I worked for eight years, and I am actively seeking new employment opportunities.

Despite my current unemployment, I have a strong history of responsible credit use, although some of my previous accounts have faced challenges due to my recent job loss. I do not have a checking account at this bank yet, but I am eager to establish a positive relationship with your institution. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but I do own a reliable Volkswagen Golf, which demonstrates my ability to manage assets responsibly.

I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and my only installment obligation is a small monthly payment on a previous furniture purchase. As a highly qualified professional, I am confident that I will secure employment soon and remain fully committed to repaying this loan on time. I am available by telephone at any time to discuss my application further.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Müller, and I am seeking a loan of 2,406 DM to purchase necessary office equipment for my new freelance consulting business. I am a single 41-year-old male, and I have resided in Hamburg for the past three years. I am currently between jobs after my previous contract as a scientific research assistant ended nine months ago.

Although my financial reserves are limited (less than 100 DM in savings), I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations. My current credit history reflects a period of difficulty due to recent unemployment, but I have managed all outstanding credits outside your bank without default. I do not have a checking account with your institution yet, but I am eager to build a trustworthy relationship.

I own a car, which I use for work purposes, and have no other debts or guarantors. My only installment payment is for a small electronics purchase, which I have paid consistently. I am highly motivated to get my business off the ground and am confident my income will stabilize shortly.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am available by phone to provide further information.

Best regards,  
Jens Müller
