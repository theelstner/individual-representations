Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Richter, and I am applying for a loan of 7,721 DM to purchase new furniture and essential equipment for my home. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past nine months, and although my employment is still under one year, I have a stable contract and a reliable monthly income.

I am divorced and the sole provider for my 6-year-old daughter. I have been living in my current home, which I own, for two years. Previously, I successfully repaid a credit from your bank without any delays or issues, demonstrating my commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations.

My checking account is currently overdrawn, which is why I am seeking this loan to help improve my living situation for myself and my daughter. I do not have any other debts, installment plans, or savings accounts at this time, but I do have a life insurance policy as additional security.

I am confident in my ability to manage the installments and assure you of my trustworthiness as a candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Anna Richter

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Meier, and I am seeking a loan of 7,721 DM to purchase equipment for my new home office. I have been employed as an administrative officer at the Stuttgart City Council for the past ten months. Although my account is currently overdrawn, I have always paid back previous credits on time and without any complications.

I am married with one dependent child, and we have lived in our own apartment for two years. My husband and I have no other debts, nor do we have installment plans elsewhere. Our only existing credit with your bank was paid back dutifully.

With a stable government job, a steady income, and a building society savings agreement as backup, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment plan. I hope you will consider my responsible credit history and my commitment to improving our family's living conditions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Meier
