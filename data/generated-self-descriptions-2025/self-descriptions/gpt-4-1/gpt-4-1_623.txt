Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,530 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for the past 2 years and 7 months. My employment is stable and I have a monthly net income of 2,400 DM. 

Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I do have a building society savings agreement which I contribute to regularly, although my savings are below 100 DM at present. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have serviced reliably and without delay. I also have a small installment plan with another bank, which is in good standing.

As a single father of a five-year-old daughter, reliable transportation is essential for my daily commute and for caring for my child. My housing situation is stable, as I own my apartment and have resided there for two years. While my credit history reflects some past challenges, I have worked diligently to meet all my obligations and have not defaulted on any payments in the last 18 months.

I believe my stable employment, responsible payment history, and commitment to meeting my financial obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,530 DM for the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as a customs officer for three years and currently earn a steady income of 2,700 DM per month. I am a foreign worker from Croatia and have lived in Germany for the past two years, where I own my residence.

My financial situation is stable, though I have limited savings (less than 100 DM) due to recent expenses related to my son’s education. I do not have a checking account at your bank but hold two credits which I am repaying as agreed. My credit history includes a critical account from a previous loan at a different bank, which I have since resolved and am now in good standing.

I have no guarantors or co-debtors, and my only dependent is my 7-year-old son. Reliable transportation is essential for my work, as I often need to travel between customs offices. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate and manage my financial commitments responsibly.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours faithfully,  
Ivan Markovic

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a 1,530 DM loan to purchase a new vehicle. As a mechanical engineer at Siemens AG, I have been employed full-time for the last 1 year and 11 months, with a monthly income of 2,350 DM. I am a single male, 32 years old, with one dependent child.

Although I do not have a checking account, I do possess a life insurance policy and have two existing credits at your bank, which I have always paid on time. My credit history indicates a critical account at another bank, but I have since restructured my finances and have not missed any payments in over a year.

I have lived in my own home for the past two years, and my only other installment plan is with a separate bank for a small household appliance. The car is necessary for commuting and transporting my daughter to school and extracurricular activities.

I am a responsible borrower with a strong commitment to fulfilling my obligations. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Murat Yilmaz

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,530 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a city government clerk and have held this position for 3 years and 3 months. My net monthly income is 2,100 DM, and I am a single father to my 6-year-old son.

I do not have a checking account, but I maintain a building society savings agreement, though my savings are currently below 100 DM.

My credit history shows a critical account at another bank, which I have been actively resolving and am now up to date on payments.

I own my home, have lived here for two years, and do not have any other debtors or guarantors. A new car is essential for my daily commute to work and for transporting my son.

Letter 5  
Dear Loan Department,

I wish to apply for a loan of 1,530 DM to purchase a new car. I am a foreign worker from Turkey, employed as a skilled CNC operator at Bosch GmbH for the past 2 years and 4 months, earning a monthly net income of 2,200 DM. I am 32 years old, single, and have one child living with me.

Although I do not have a checking account, I hold a life insurance policy and have been a reliable customer with two existing credits at your bank. My past credit history at another bank was marked as critical due to a period of unemployment, but I have since regained financial stability and kept up with all payments for the last 18 months.

I have lived in my own apartment for two years, and my only other installment plan is with a different bank for furniture. A new car is necessary for my work shifts and to provide for my child’s needs.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate and request your favorable consideration of my application.

Kind regards,  
Ahmet Demir
