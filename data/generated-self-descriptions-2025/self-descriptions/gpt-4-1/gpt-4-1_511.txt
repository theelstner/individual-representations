Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 8,588 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 36-year-old self-employed IT consultant, and have been working in this capacity for the past 8 years. My business is stable, and I have a consistent monthly income that comfortably covers my living expenses and financial obligations.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a small savings account of approximately 300 DM. My credit history is impeccable; I have always repaid my previous credits on time and in full. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and my only current installment plan is for a small business equipment purchase.

I have been residing at my current address for 2 years, and my only property is my current vehicle, which I intend to replace with the loan. As a single individual with no dependents, my financial commitments are limited and manageable. I am a foreign worker but have integrated well and established a reputable business here.

I am confident that my stable income, proven creditworthiness, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Lukas Petrovic

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 8,588 DM to acquire a used car, which is essential for my work as a senior pharmaceutical research assistant. I have been employed in this role for the past 9 years, and my position provides a steady and reliable income.

I currently do not hold a checking account but have a savings account with a balance of 250 DM. My credit history is excellent, with all previous loans repaid on schedule. I do not have any co-signers or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is a minor monthly payment for professional equipment.

I have lived at my present address for 2 years, and my only asset is my current car, which is now unreliable and needs replacing. I am single, have no dependents, and live alone, which allows me to manage my finances efficiently. As a foreign professional, I have established a positive reputation in my community.

Given my stable employment, responsible financial history, and the necessity of a reliable vehicle for my work, I believe I am a suitable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Martin Schuster
