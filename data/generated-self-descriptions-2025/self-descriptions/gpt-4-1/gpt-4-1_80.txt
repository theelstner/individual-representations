Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €9,436 to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at EuroLogistics GmbH, where I have worked for two and a half years. My employment is stable, and I have a regular income that allows me to cover my monthly expenses and support my two children as a single father.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have previously taken a small credit at your bank for home repairs, which I repaid in full and on time. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. I own my residence and have a life insurance policy, demonstrating my commitment to financial responsibility and planning for the future.

As a foreign worker, reliable transportation is essential for my job and to care for my family. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and would greatly appreciate your consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov
