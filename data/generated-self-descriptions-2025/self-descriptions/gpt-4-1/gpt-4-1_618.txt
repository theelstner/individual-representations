Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Novak, and I am applying for a loan of 9,157 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my household. I am currently working as a scientific research assistant at Heidelberg University, a position I have held for the past three years. My employment is stable, and I am committed to my work.

Currently, I have a checking account with a balance under 200 DM and no savings. I am a single father to my 4-year-old son, and we live with my brother, which allows us to save on housing costs. Although I have had a delay in repaying a past loan, I have since made every effort to ensure timely payments on my current credit at your bank.

My financial situation is improving thanks to my steady employment and free housing. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am determined to manage my finances responsibly. I believe that investing in reliable household electronics will improve our quality of life and support my son’s education.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment plan and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am requesting a loan of 9,157 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I have been working as an IT project manager at a mid-sized tech company in Stuttgart for two years. My employment is secure, and I am dedicated to my career.

While I do not have a savings account or property, I have managed to support myself and my 5-year-old daughter by living with my parents, which allows us to save on housing expenses. I acknowledge a past delay in repaying a previous loan, but since then, I have been punctual with my current loan payments at your bank.

I have only one existing loan, no other debts, and my financial discipline has improved significantly. I am confident that I can manage the monthly installments for this new loan. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life for my family here in Germany.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Tomasz Kowalski, a 27-year-old single father, currently residing in Munich. I am applying for a loan of 9,157 DM to buy a television and radio to enhance my family's daily life. I work as a self-employed translator, a role I have held for nearly three years, with a growing client base and steady income.

Although my checking account balance is modest and I do not have a savings account, I have no other debts or installment plans besides my current loan with your bank. I have experienced a delay in repaying a loan in the past, but I have since maintained a good payment record.

I live rent-free with a relative, which allows me to focus on supporting my young son. With my improved financial management and stable income, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Your support will help us create a more comfortable and educational home environment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Kowalski

Dear Lending Department,

I am Ivan Petrov, a single 27-year-old officer in the logistics sector, living in Frankfurt. I am seeking a loan of 9,157 DM to purchase a radio and television for my home. I have been employed in my current position for just over two years, and my job provides a stable income.

Though I have a limited checking account balance and no savings or property, my living situation—residing with my uncle—means I have no housing costs. I support my younger brother and have managed to remain free of other debts or installment plans.

I admit I had a payment delay in the past, but I have since been diligent with my existing credit at your bank. I am confident that my current financial discipline, stable employment, and minimal expenses make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Samuel Mensah, and I am applying for a loan of 9,157 DM to buy a new television and radio. I am a highly qualified employee, working as a civil engineer for a construction firm in Hamburg for the past three years.

I currently have a small checking account balance and no savings, as I send a portion of my earnings home to support my family. I live rent-free with a friend, which has helped me manage my finances. I have one dependent—my 6-year-old niece, whom I care for.

While I have had a delay in repaying a previous loan, I have since maintained a solid repayment record with your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my stable employment puts me in a good position to meet the proposed repayment schedule.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to honoring my financial obligations and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Samuel Mensah
