Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,169 DM to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years and have always maintained a stable income. Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, this is a temporary situation due to some unexpected medical expenses for my dependent son, who lives with me.

I own my residence and have invested in real estate, which provides me with a secure financial foundation. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly, making all payments on time. While I do have other credit accounts elsewhere, I have never defaulted and always communicate openly with my creditors.

I am a single, 67-year-old male, with one dependent and no other debtors or guarantors. My long-term employment, stable housing, and ownership of property make me a trustworthy candidate. I am committed to fulfilling all my financial obligations and am confident that I will be able to repay this loan within the agreed terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Karl-Heinz Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I have been working as a senior postal official for the German Postal Service for over nine years, and my employment is both stable and secure. My current account is in the negative due to recent repairs on my home, which I own outright.

I have one dependent, my 23-year-old son, who is currently studying at university. While I have some other credits at another bank, I have never missed a payment and maintain good standing with all my creditors. I have no savings account at present, as I have invested most of my funds into my real estate property.

I have resided at my current address for four years and am a registered foreign worker under my own name. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being serviced regularly. My reliability is demonstrated by my long-term employment, property ownership, and consistent payment history.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Rolf Schneider

Letter 3

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,169 DM for the purchase of a new television. I am a 67-year-old single male, currently employed as a municipal tax officer for the City of Hamburg, a position I have held for eight years. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, this is due to recent support I provided to my dependent grandson.

My financial stability is underpinned by the fact that I own my home and have invested in real estate. I have two loans with your bank, both of which are up to date. I have another credit elsewhere, but I have never missed a repayment, and I do not have any savings accounts.

I have lived at my current address for four years and manage my finances carefully, despite the occasional setback. My strong employment record, home ownership, and responsible credit management make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Hans-Jürgen Weber

Letter 4

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I am a single male, aged 67, and have been a senior administrative clerk at the Federal Employment Agency for the last eight years. My present checking account is overdrawn, mainly due to expenses related to my dependent daughter’s recent relocation.

I own my home and have a record of responsible property management. While I do have other credit obligations not with this bank, I have never defaulted on a payment. I have two credits with your bank, both in good standing, and no other debtors or guarantors.

Having lived at my current residence for four years and held stable employment for nearly a decade, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and continue my record of financial responsibility.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Dieter Müller
