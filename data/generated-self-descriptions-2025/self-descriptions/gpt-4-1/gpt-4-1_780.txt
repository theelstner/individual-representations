Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 5,711 DM. I am a 38-year-old software engineer, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. As a single individual with no dependents, I am fully responsible for my financial commitments.

My current financial situation is stable. I have maintained a savings account with a balance consistently above 1,000 DM and have no outstanding debts with your bank. While I have a critical account with another bank, I have always met my obligations on time and am committed to responsible financial management. 

The purpose of this loan is to purchase a used car, which is essential for my daily commute and research activities. I do not currently have a checking account, but I am prepared to open one if required. I have resided at my current address for 2 years and have no other installment plans or guarantors.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and assure you of my reliability as a borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Karim, and I am a self-employed management consultant applying for a loan of 5,711 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I have been successfully running my own consulting business for over 9 years, advising multinational companies on organizational development.

Financially, I maintain a savings account with a balance above 1,000 DM, and although my credit history includes a critical account at another institution, I have consistently honored my financial commitments. I do not have any current loans with your bank, and I have no co-signers or guarantors.

I have lived at my present address for 2 years. Reliable transportation is crucial for meeting clients and expanding my business. My current housing situation is temporary, but I am financially secure and can easily manage the monthly installment rate.

I am a foreign worker, originally from Egypt, and I have always prioritized integrity and responsibility in all my financial dealings. I kindly request your support for this loan and am happy to provide any further information.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Karim

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a car loan of 5,711 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I am a single, 41-year-old officer in the German Federal Police, with 10 years of continuous service. My employment is stable, and I have a good income with regular savings above 1,000 DM.

Although I have an existing credit account at another bank which is marked as critical, I have never defaulted on a payment. I understand the importance of maintaining a good credit standing and am committed to fulfilling all my obligations.

I have lived at my current residence for 2 years and have no other debts or guarantors. As I do not own a home or have a checking account, I am willing to establish one to facilitate this loan. The car is necessary for my daily commute and official duties, as public transport is not always reliable for my shift work.

I am confident that my long-term employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Thomas Schneider

Letter 4

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Piotr Nowak, and I am a highly qualified employee working as a project manager in a multinational construction firm. I have been with my current employer for 8 years, demonstrating reliability and dedication.

I am seeking a loan of 5,711 DM to purchase a used car, as my current vehicle is no longer dependable. My savings account has always maintained a balance above 1,000 DM, and I have no other debts or obligations with your bank. While I have a critical credit account elsewhere, it is being managed responsibly.

I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my present address for 2 years. I have no additional installment plans or housing commitments. The car is vital for my work, which often requires travel to multiple sites.

As a foreign worker from Poland, I understand the importance of trustworthiness and financial discipline. I am committed to meeting the agreed installment rate and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak
