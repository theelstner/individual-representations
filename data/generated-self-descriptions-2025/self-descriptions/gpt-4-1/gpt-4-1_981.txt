Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,264 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a mechanical engineering technician at Rheinmetall AG, where I have worked for three years. My current financial situation is stable, with a checking account balance of approximately 180 DM and a savings account of 320 DM. I have one dependent, my son, and I am married.

Over the past two years living in Düsseldorf, I have demonstrated financial responsibility, repaying my previous loan with your bank on time and in full. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only existing credit with your bank has been managed diligently. My income is regular, and I have a building society savings agreement as additional security.

As a foreign worker, reliable transportation is essential for both my job and my family. I am confident that with my stable employment and proven repayment history, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov
