Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,507 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for the past eight years. My employment is stable and provides a steady income, which has allowed me to meet all my financial obligations. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time.

I have a savings account with 750 DM, and I currently have no other debts or guarantors. My residence in Berlin has been stable for the past four years, and I am fortunate to live rent-free with a relative. Although I do not own property, I am responsible for my teenage son and need reliable transportation to ensure I can get to work and support him.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my consistent employment, good credit history, and responsible financial management. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment rate of 2 DM per month. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov
