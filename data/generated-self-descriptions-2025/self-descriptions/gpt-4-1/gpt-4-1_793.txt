Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Victor Meyer, and I am applying for a loan of €6,313 to purchase a used vehicle. I am currently a self-employed IT consultant and have been successfully managing my business for the past 8 years. My business provides software solutions to local companies, and my income is stable and sufficient to cover all my personal and professional expenses.

Until now, I have relied on public transport, but my growing client base requires frequent visits to their offices, making a car essential for my work. I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank yet, but I have a strong credit history and have always repaid previous loans on time. 

I live alone in a rented apartment and have resided at my current address for four years. I have no outstanding debts or guarantors, and I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate. As a foreign worker in Germany, I am committed to building a long-term relationship with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Victor Meyer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Rashid, and I am writing to request a loan of €6,313 to finance the purchase of a used car. I have worked as a senior management consultant for the past 9 years, currently employed at a reputable international firm.

I am single and have no dependents, which allows me to dedicate a significant portion of my income to loan repayment. I am confident that my stable employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
