Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 4042 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past three years. I am 36 years old, single, and the sole provider for my young son.

While I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained two credits with you over the past 42 months, both of which are in good standing. I have a savings account with 800 DM, and I own my residence, a small apartment in Munich, as well as a piece of real estate in my hometown. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my monthly installment rate is manageable within my current salary.

I am seeking this loan to furnish my home and purchase necessary equipment to improve my son's living conditions and support his education. As a skilled employee with stable employment and a history of responsible credit management, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on time. I am a registered foreign worker but have been a resident of Germany for the past four years.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Yours sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is David Schmidt, and I am applying for a 4042 DM loan to buy new furniture and office equipment for my home. I have been working as an administrative officer at the City Hall for nearly two years, and I am currently living in my own home with my 8-year-old son.

Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I do have two existing credits with you, both of which are up to date. I have a savings account with 950 DM and own a small property in the countryside. My credit history has had some challenges, but I have always met my obligations and have no other debtors or guarantors.

I am seeking this loan to replace old furniture and purchase equipment that will allow me to work from home more efficiently. My employment is secure, and my financial planning ensures that I can meet the monthly installment rate of 4%. I have lived at my current address for four years and have a telephone registered in my name.

Thank you for your consideration. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and appreciate your trust.

Kind regards,  
David Schmidt
