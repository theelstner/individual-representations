Letter 1

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,743 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a warehouse worker at Müller Logistik, where I have worked reliably for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is modest: my checking account balance is under 200 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. However, I have consistently met my financial obligations, including two existing credits at your bank, which I am paying off regularly.

As a single father to my 12-year-old son, I am committed to providing a comfortable home environment. My housing situation is stable, as I own my apartment, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors. Although I am a foreign worker, I have lived at my present address for 2 years and have integrated well into the community.

I understand the importance of trustworthiness in financial matters. Despite having a critical account in my credit history, I have always prioritized repaying my debts. My steady employment, property in the form of a life insurance policy, and responsible payment record make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,743 DM to purchase a new radio and television, which will allow me to stay informed and entertained at home. I am employed as a janitor at the Städtische Grundschule, a position I have held for 9 years. My current account has a low balance, and my savings are under 100 DM, but I have always managed my finances carefully.

I am 48 years old, single, and responsible for my teenage daughter. I have no other installment plans, and I am not supporting any other debtors or guarantors. I own my flat, and my only other credits are two small loans with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

Although I am a foreign national, I have lived at my current address for 2 years and am committed to building a stable life here. My financial history includes a critical account, but I am determined to maintain my good standing with your institution.

I believe my long-term employment, property in the form of a building society savings agreement, and commitment to my financial responsibilities make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
Tomasz Nowak

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,743 DM to buy a new television and radio for my household. I have worked as a sanitation worker for the city of Frankfurt for 8 years and have demonstrated reliability and consistency in my job. My checking account currently has less than 200 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, but I am careful with my expenditures.

I am 48, single, and have one dependent, my 10-year-old son. My current residence, which I own, has been my home for the past 2 years. I do not have any additional installment plans and am not a guarantor for anyone else. While I have two existing credits with your bank, I have never missed a payment.

I am a foreign worker, but I am committed to my life here and to fulfilling all my obligations. My property includes a life insurance policy, which adds to my financial stability. I understand my credit history is not perfect, but my long employment record and responsible handling of current loans demonstrate my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
