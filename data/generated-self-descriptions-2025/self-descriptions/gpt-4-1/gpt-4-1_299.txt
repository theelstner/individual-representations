Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,287 EUR to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and provides a reliable monthly income. 

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time and in full. I have no other installment plans, and my only dependent is my 10-year-old son, whom I support as a single father. My co-applicant, my sister Anna, has agreed to support my application.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I am diligent with my finances and have maintained a clean credit history. I have lived in my own apartment for the past two years and have a building society savings agreement as property security.

A new car is essential for commuting to work and taking my son to school and activities. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate and repay the loan in a timely manner. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jens Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,287 EUR to purchase a new car. I am a 45-year-old single male, currently employed as a janitor at the local hospital, a position I have held for 9 years. My job provides a stable income, and I have always met my financial obligations, including an existing loan with your bank that is being repaid on schedule.

I have lived in my own apartment for two years and do not have any other outstanding loans or installment plans. My daughter, aged 12, is my only dependent. My brother, who is financially stable, will co-sign this loan as a guarantor.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have a life insurance policy as property. The new car will be vital for my daily commute and family responsibilities. I am responsible and reliable, as demonstrated by my clean credit history. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Martin Weber
