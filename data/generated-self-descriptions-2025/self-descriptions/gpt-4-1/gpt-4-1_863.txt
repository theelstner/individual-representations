Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Peter Novak, and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,169 DM to expand my small mobile car repair service in Stuttgart. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at a local automotive firm for the past two and a half years. I am married, and my wife and I have been living in our current rented apartment for the last two years.

I do not have a checking account, and my savings are less than 100 DM, but I own a used van valued at 4,000 DM, which I use for my business. In the past, I experienced some delays in paying off a previous small personal loan due to unexpected medical expenses, but I have since cleared all outstanding debts and have maintained a good record for the last year.

I am seeking this loan to purchase additional tools and spare parts, which will allow me to take on more clients and improve my family’s financial stability. As a skilled employee with over eight years of experience in the automotive field, I am confident in my ability to grow the business and make timely repayments. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am committed to meeting the monthly installment rate of 4.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss my business plan and repayment schedule in detail.

Sincerely,
Peter Novak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, and I am applying for a business loan of 2,169 DM to open a small grocery kiosk in Frankfurt. I am a foreign worker from Egypt, married, and have been living in Germany for two years. I have been working as a warehouse supervisor for the past three years, and I am well-acquainted with supply chain management.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, and my savings are minimal. I have faced some challenges in the past with timely loan payments, but I have learned from these experiences and have taken steps to better manage my finances, including using budgeting tools and setting up payment reminders.

I own a small car valued at 2,500 DM, and I do not have any other debts or guarantors. The loan will be used to purchase inventory and equipment for the kiosk. With my background in logistics and strong work ethic, I am confident that I will be able to run a successful business and make regular repayments.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to prove my reliability as a borrower.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Hassan

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Marek Zielinski, and I am seeking a loan of 2,169 DM to invest in a mobile phone repair business in Munich. I am a married foreign worker from Poland and have worked as an IT technician for three years. My family and I have lived at our current address for two years.

Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, I do own a small car which I use for commuting and business errands.

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I would like to apply for a business loan of 2,169 DM to start a small courier service in Berlin. I am a married foreign worker from Bulgaria, and I have been employed as a delivery driver for the last 18 months.

I do not currently have a checking account, and my savings are below 100 DM. I own a car, which will be the primary asset of my courier service. I acknowledge that I have had a delay in repaying a previous loan, which was due to a temporary reduction in working hours, but I have since repaid the full amount.

I have no other debts or guarantors and have been living at my present residence for two years. My professional experience and personal commitment assure you that I will use this loan responsibly to build a reliable business and make timely payments.

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Tomasz Kwiatkowski, and I am requesting a loan of 2,169 DM to establish a small bicycle repair shop in Leipzig. I am a married skilled employee, originally from Poland, and have been working as a mechanical technician for three years.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, and my savings are minimal. I own a used car, which I plan to use for picking up and delivering bicycles to customers.

I have no other debts or guarantors. My technical expertise, stable employment, and dedication to customer service make me a reliable loan candidate. The requested funds will be used for purchasing tools and renting a small workshop.

Thank you for your attention and consideration. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability and discuss my plans further.

Yours sincerely,
Tomasz Kwiatkowski
