Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,237 DM to purchase a new television for my home. As a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology, I have been steadily employed for the past three years. My current financial situation is stable: I have a building society savings agreement with a balance of 320 DM, and I own my own apartment, where I have lived for the past year with my daughter.

Although I do not have a checking account and my credit history includes existing credits at other institutions, I have always met my repayment obligations on time. I currently have two small credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my only dependent is my daughter.

As a divorced woman and a foreign worker, I have worked hard to establish a secure life for my family in Germany. I am committed to maintaining my good financial standing and am confident I can manage the proposed installment rate. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova
