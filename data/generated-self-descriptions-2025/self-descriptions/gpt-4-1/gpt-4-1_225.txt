Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,978 euros. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for three years. I am seeking this loan to help launch a small consulting firm specializing in data analysis for local startups.

My financial situation is stable due to my permanent employment and property ownership. While I have experienced a delay in paying off a previous credit, I have since taken steps to ensure timely payments, including setting up automatic transfers. I have two dependents and am committed to providing for them responsibly.

Though I do not have a checking or savings account, my consistent salary and real estate assets demonstrate my reliability. I have no other debts or guarantors and have resided at my current address for four years. I am confident that my experience, stable income, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Alex Müller. I am applying for a loan of 2,978 euros to expand my small IT repair business. I have been a software support specialist at Siemens AG for two years, and I own my home, where I have lived for four years.

I have two children who depend on me, and while I have had a delayed payment in the past, I have since maintained regular payments on my existing credits. I do not have a checking or savings account, but my real estate property serves as security.

My current income is steady, and I have no other installment plans or financial obligations. I am single and have no guarantors, but my employment status and property ownership demonstrate my commitment and reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Alex Müller

As a single father of two, my goal is to grow my business to better support my family. I have no other debts and can be reached by telephone at any time.

To whom it may concern,

I am Peter Hoffmann, a 32-year-old single father of two, applying for a business loan of 2,978 euros to expand my carpentry workshop. For the past year and a half, I have been working as a certified electrician for a local construction company. I own my home, where I have lived for four years, and have no other installment plans or debtors.

With my experience, property ownership, and commitment to responsible borrowing, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Peter Hoffmann
