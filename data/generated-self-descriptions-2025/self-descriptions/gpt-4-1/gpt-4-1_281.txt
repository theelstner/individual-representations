My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have been residing at my current address for four years. I own a car, which is my only significant property.

As a single, foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life here. I am confident that my employment and financial discipline make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
