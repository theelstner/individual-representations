Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan of 2,288 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. As a recently divorced woman of 23 years old, I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the local university for the past 9 months. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a building society savings agreement and have one existing credit at your bank, which I have been servicing reliably.

My financial situation is stable, as I receive a regular monthly income from my employment, and I have no other installment plans or outstanding debts apart from one manageable credit. I am responsible for my 4-year-old daughter, and we have been residing at our current address for 4 years, where I own the apartment.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan because of my stable employment, responsible credit history with your bank, and commitment to providing a comfortable and secure home for my family. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Schmidt
