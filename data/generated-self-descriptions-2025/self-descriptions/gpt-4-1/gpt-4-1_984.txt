Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Anna Weiss, and I am applying for a loan of 2,923 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for three years. My monthly salary has been deposited into my checking account at your bank for over a year, and my balance consistently exceeds 200 DM.

I have previously taken out and fully repaid a credit with your bank, and I have no outstanding debts. My savings account currently holds 350 DM. As a divorced woman with one dependent, reliable transportation is crucial for both my work and family responsibilities. My current car is over 10 years old and has become unreliable, which is why I am seeking this loan.

I have always managed my finances responsibly and have a stable employment history. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Weiss
