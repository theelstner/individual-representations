Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Petar Ivanov, and I am applying for a loan of 3,976 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment in Frankfurt. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, as I have recently moved and incurred several moving expenses.

I have a solid credit history, having paid back all previous credits on time, and I currently have no other debts or guarantors. My only property is a used Volkswagen Golf, which I rely on for commuting to work. I have been residing at my present address for 3 years and have no other installment plans except for a small electronics purchase that will be paid off within 6 months.

Although I do not have a savings account, I am a reliable and skilled employee, as demonstrated by my steady employment and responsible financial behavior. I am single, 29 years old, and originally from Bulgaria, but I have integrated well into German society.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan in the agreed duration and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Petar Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Richter, and I am seeking a loan of 3,976 DM to furnish my new studio apartment and purchase a computer for work purposes. I am a 32-year-old single male, working as an IT specialist at Siemens AG for the past 6 years. My current checking account balance is 65 DM, as my recent relocation and initial rent deposit have limited my liquidity.

I have always paid back my credits on time, and I have no outstanding debts or co-signers. I own a second-hand Opel Astra, which is my only significant property. I have been living at my current address in Munich for 3 years and have no other installment plans besides a monthly mobile phone payment of 35 DM.

Although I do not have a savings account, my stable employment and good credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. As a foreign worker from Poland, I am committed to building my future in Germany.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Thomas Richter
