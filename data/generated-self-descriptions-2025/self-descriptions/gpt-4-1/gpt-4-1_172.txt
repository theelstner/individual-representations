Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 950 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and my position is permanent. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, with a balance below 0 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM. Despite this, I have always been diligent with my finances; I have never taken out a credit before, and any past financial obligations were paid back promptly.

My current car, a 12-year-old Opel Astra, has become unreliable and is no longer suitable for my daily commute to work and field research trips. A new car is essential for maintaining my punctuality and fulfilling my professional responsibilities.

I have been living at my current address for 3 years and have always paid my rent on time. I am single, have no dependents, and do not have any other debts or guarantors. My monthly installment rate of 4 DM is manageable within my budget.

I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and assure you of my reliability and commitment. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Feldmann

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Bauer, and I am seeking a loan of 950 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have worked as a senior electrician for Siemens AG for the past 9 years and have a stable income. At present, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM, but I have never defaulted on any payments or loans in the past.

The reason for this loan is my need for reliable transportation. My current vehicle broke down recently, and I require a car to commute to work and support my family, even though I am single with no children. I do not own any property, and I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors.

I have lived at my current residence for 3 years and always pay my rent on time. My employment history demonstrates my stability, and I am confident in my ability to make the agreed installment payments of 4 DM per month.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Jens Bauer

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 950 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my work as a postal service official. I have been employed with Deutsche Post for 10 years, and I am proud of my consistent work record and financial responsibility. My checking account is currently below 0 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM, but I have never missed a payment on any previous financial obligations.

I do not have any other debts or installment plans, and I am not a foreign worker. I have lived at my current address for 3 years and have always paid my rent promptly. As a single man with no dependents, my financial commitments are limited, and I can easily manage the proposed installment rate of 4 DM.

A new car will ensure I can continue to fulfill my job requirements efficiently and maintain my excellent record at work. I am committed to meeting all loan obligations and appreciate your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Thomas Reinhardt
