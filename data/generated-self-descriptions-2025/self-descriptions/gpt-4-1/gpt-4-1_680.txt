Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,384 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my household. My name is Ivan Petrovic, and I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Berlin Logistics GmbH for the past 8 years. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, as you can verify in my credit history with your bank.

My financial situation is modest. I support my adult son, and we live together in a rented apartment where I have resided for the last 4 years. While my savings are limited (less than 100 DM), I do own a small piece of real estate in my home country, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial responsibility.

I am a reliable borrower, as shown by my consistent employment and history of meeting my financial obligations. I have no other debts or guarantors and plan to manage repayments through my bank account. The new electronics will greatly improve our quality of life, especially since my son is currently studying and relies on media for his education.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jozef Novak, and I am seeking a loan of 2,384 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I have been working as a janitor at the Munich City Hospital for the past 9 years. Though my checking account is currently below zero, I have always managed my repayments responsibly and have no outstanding debts apart from my current loan with your bank.

I am a single father supporting my 17-year-old daughter. Our resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings, but I do own a small plot of land in Slovakia, which I intend to keep as an investment for my daughter's future. We have lived in our rented apartment for 4 years, and I have always paid rent on time.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable job history, punctuality in repaying credits, and commitment to providing for my family. I believe the requested loan will not only benefit us materially but also enable my daughter to access important educational content.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Jozef Novak

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 2,384 DM to buy a new radio and television. My name is Ahmed Yilmaz. I am a 64-year-old single man, originally from Turkey, and have worked as a building maintenance worker at Stuttgart Housing Cooperative for 8 years. My checking account is currently overdrawn, but I have a clean record of paying off all my credits.

I support my adult niece, who lives with me. Our financial situation is tight, with savings under 100 DM, but I do own a small house in Turkey, which I inherited from my parents. We have rented our current apartment for 4 years.

I have no other debts or financial obligations and am diligent in managing my expenses. I am requesting this loan to replace our broken television and radio, which are our main sources of news and entertainment. I am confident I can meet the installment payments, as I have done in the past.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Marek Kowalski, and I am writing to request a loan of 2,384 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television. I am currently employed as an unskilled resident worker at Frankfurt Municipal Services, where I have worked for 7 years. Although my checking account is currently negative, I have always paid my existing credits back on time.

I live in a rented apartment with my dependent brother, whom I support. My savings are minimal, but I do own a small piece of farmland in Poland. I have lived at my current address for 4 years, and I am careful with my finances, as evidenced by my repayment history.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. The new electronics will be invaluable for both leisure and staying informed, especially for my brother, who is often at home.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Marek Kowalski

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,384 DM to purchase a radio and television for my household. My name is Gheorghe Ionescu, and I have worked as a sanitation worker at Leipzig City Council for the last 10 years. My checking account is currently overdrawn, but I have a solid history of repaying all my credits without issue.

I am a single man, supporting my elderly mother. Our financial resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings, but I do own a small house in Romania, which I plan to keep for my retirement. We have lived in our rented apartment for 4 years.

I have always been reliable in meeting my financial obligations and have no other outstanding debts. The requested loan will help improve our daily life, as my mother spends most of her time at home and relies on television for company.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Gheorghe Ionescu
