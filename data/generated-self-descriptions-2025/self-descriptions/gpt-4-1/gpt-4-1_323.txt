Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a personal loan of 1,938 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a 32-year-old divorced male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for 10 months. My financial situation is stable; I own my own apartment and have consistently paid back all my previous credits on time, including a car loan I completed last year. While my checking and savings accounts are modest, I do have a life insurance policy as security. I am the sole provider for my 7-year-old son, and this purchase will greatly improve our quality of life. As a foreign worker with three years’ residence in Germany, I have demonstrated responsibility and reliability in all my financial dealings. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Markovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,938 DM to buy a radio and television set for my apartment. I am a 32-year-old separated male, currently working as a customs officer at Hamburg Port for the past nine months. Despite my recent employment, I have a strong record of repaying all previous loans, including a recent installment plan for home renovations. My financial reserves are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings, but I do have a building society savings agreement as an asset. I have lived in my current residence for three years and have no other outstanding debts. As the primary caregiver for my daughter, I am committed to maintaining a stable home environment. My history of responsible credit use and steady employment make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jan Petersen
