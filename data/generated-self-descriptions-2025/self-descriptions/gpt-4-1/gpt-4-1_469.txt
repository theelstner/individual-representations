Letter 1

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,238 euros to purchase a new television and radio system for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, demonstrating my stability and commitment in my professional life. While I do not currently have a checking or savings account, my regular income is directly deposited to my employer-provided payment card.

In the past, I have experienced some delays in paying off credit, mainly due to unexpected medical expenses. However, I have since taken steps to better manage my finances, and I am now in a much more stable position. I currently reside in the same apartment for the past 3 years, and my only property is my car, which is fully paid off. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors.

As a skilled employee with a steady job and no dependents, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I am committed to fulfilling all obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Johannes Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Erik Schneider, and I am seeking a loan of 7,238 euros for the purchase of a new home entertainment center (radio and television). I have worked as a municipal government official for the last 9 years, and my employment is permanent and secure.

Although I have had a delay in credit repayment several years ago, this was due to a temporary reduction in work hours during the pandemic. Since then, my financial situation has stabilized, and I have not missed any payments. I do not have a checking or savings account, but my salary is paid regularly, and I have no other debts.

I live alone and have been at my current residence for 3 years. My only property is a second-hand car. I do not have any other installment plans except for my monthly phone bill, and I do not act as a guarantor for anyone. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate for this loan and look forward to the opportunity to improve my living situation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Erik Schneider

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a 7,238-euro loan to purchase a high-quality television and radio system. I have been employed as an electrical engineer at Siemens for 8 years. My employment is stable, and I earn a reliable monthly salary.

Previously, I had a delay in credit repayment because of family-related emergency expenses. I have since learned from that experience, and I now have a strict budget and payment plan in place. While I do not maintain a checking or savings account, I have managed my finances through direct payroll deposit and careful cash management.

I have lived in my current apartment, which is financed through the bank, for 3 years. I own my car outright and have no other loans or dependents. With my steady job and careful financial planning, I am confident that I can manage the monthly installment of this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Lars Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 7,238 euros to purchase a new television and radio set. I have worked as an administrative officer at the Federal Employment Agency for 8 years, and my position is secure and well-compensated.

In the past, I experienced a delay in repaying a credit card due to a short-term job relocation, but I have since resolved all outstanding issues. I do not currently have a checking or savings account, but my salary is paid to a payroll card, and I have no other credit or loan obligations.

I have been living in my current bank-financed apartment for 3 years and own a used car. I am single, have no dependents, and do not serve as a guarantor for anyone. I am confident that my stable employment and careful budgeting make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Stefan Krüger
