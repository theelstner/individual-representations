Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 8,072 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at ChemTech Solutions, where I have been working for the past 11 months. My goal is to start my own laboratory equipment supply business, and this loan will serve as the initial capital for inventory and operational costs.

Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, this is due to recent relocation expenses and setting up my new residence, where I have lived for three years. I have no previous credit history, but all my small personal loans from family and friends have been repaid promptly. I do not have a savings account, but I do own a reliable Volkswagen Passat, which I use for both work and personal needs.

I am single, have no dependents, and have no other debts or guarantors. My installment rate is set at 2%, and I have a steady income with no other installment plans except for a minor furniture plan with a remaining term of 25 months. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan due to my stable employment, responsible financial habits, and clear business plan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 8,072 DM to open a small IT consultancy business. I have been employed as a network administrator at DataBridge AG for ten months, following a successful seven-year career as a skilled electronics technician. The purpose of the loan is to purchase essential computer equipment and cover initial marketing expenses.

My financial situation is stable despite my checking account being slightly negative, due to recent investments in professional certifications. I have always managed my finances responsibly, with no outstanding debts and a clean credit history. I currently do not have a savings account but own a 2016 Ford Focus as my primary asset.

I have lived at my current address for three years and have no dependents or other installment plans, except for a small electronics store installment which will be completed in 25 months. I am single, have no co-signers, and my monthly income comfortably covers the proposed installment rate.

I am committed to making this business a success and believe my technical skills and work ethic make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Michael Berger

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for an 8,072 DM loan to establish a home-based graphic design studio. I am currently employed as a junior designer at KreativHaus GmbH, where I have worked for nine months. This loan will be used to purchase high-end computers and professional software licenses.

My checking account is currently below zero due to a recent move and setting up my workspace. However, I have no history of missed payments or unpaid credits. I do not have a savings account, but I own a car (Opel Astra, 2015) that serves as my main property. I have no other debts, no dependents, and my monthly obligations are limited to a furniture installment plan with 25 months remaining.

I have lived at my current address for three years and have a steady, growing income. I am single, have no guarantors, and have always demonstrated responsibility in managing my finances.

I am confident that with your support, I can successfully launch my business and repay the loan as agreed. Thank you for your attention to my application.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to apply for a loan of 8,072 DM to start a small legal advisory firm specializing in tenant rights. I have been employed as a legal assistant at Müller & Partner for the past eleven months. This loan will help me secure office space and cover initial operational expenses.

My current account is slightly negative due to the costs associated with bar exam preparation, but I have no previous or outstanding credits. I do not have a savings account, but I own a Skoda Octavia, which is fully paid off. I have lived at my current address for three years, am single, and have no dependents or guarantors.

My only other financial obligation is a 25-month installment plan for professional attire, which I am paying off regularly. I have always been diligent and punctual in fulfilling my financial commitments.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, given my stable employment and clear business plan. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Sebastian Hoffmann

My monthly income is stable, and I am confident I can meet the installment rate required for this loan.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Keller
