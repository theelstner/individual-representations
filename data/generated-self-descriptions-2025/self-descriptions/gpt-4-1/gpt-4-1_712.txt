Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am applying for a loan of 629 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a 32-year-old single father with one dependent, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My financial situation is stable, with a savings account balance of 750 DM and a building society savings agreement as additional security. I have lived at my current residence for 3 years and own my home.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. My monthly installment rate is manageable at 4%, and my only other installment plan is with another bank, which I am servicing reliably. I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and have a long-term, stable employment history. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, and I am happy to provide any additional documentation as needed.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Markus Klein

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jan Novak. I am a 32-year-old single male, currently working as a self-employed IT consultant for the past 10 years. I am applying for a loan of 629 DM to purchase a new radio system for my home, which is essential for both personal and professional use. My finances are in good order, with 900 DM in savings and a life insurance policy. I have lived in my own house for 3 years, and I have one child who is dependent on me.

I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are being paid off according to schedule. While I have some other credits with a different bank, I have never missed a payment. My current installment rate is 4%, which is well within my budget. I do not have a checking account at this time, but I am happy to set one up if required. As a registered foreign worker, I have always prioritized my financial responsibilities.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Jan Novak
