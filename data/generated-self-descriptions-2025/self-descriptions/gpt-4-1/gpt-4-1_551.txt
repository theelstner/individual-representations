Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €8,858 to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for five years. As a single father supporting my 10-year-old son, reliable transportation is essential for commuting and fulfilling my parental responsibilities.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have responsibly managed two existing credits with you, always making timely payments. My current residence is provided by my employer, which allows me to save on housing costs. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I understand that my credit history includes some critical accounts, but I have worked hard to stabilize my finances and am committed to meeting all obligations. My stable employment and consistent income as a skilled employee make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of €8,858 to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I am currently employed as a logistics coordinator at DHL Express, a position I have held for nearly six years. This car will be crucial for my daily commute, as well as for ensuring I can support my 8-year-old daughter’s school and extracurricular activities.

While I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, I have two active credits with you, both of which are in good standing. My living situation is stable, as I reside rent-free with my brother, reducing my monthly expenses significantly. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my employment provides a steady income.

Despite a critical note in my credit history from a previous loan at another institution, I have demonstrated financial responsibility with your bank. My track record as a single, skilled employee with a dependent highlights my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Best regards,
Milan Jovanovic

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of €8,858 to buy a used car, which is necessary for my work as a municipal administrative officer, a position I have held for four and a half years.

I have two ongoing credits with your bank, both serviced regularly without delay. Although I do not have a checking account or savings, my job is secure and my housing is provided by my uncle, which allows me to keep my living costs low. I have no other debts or installment plans.

My credit history includes a critical account from a previous financial challenge, but I have maintained a strong payment record with your institution. I am committed to upholding this trust.

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of €8,858 for the purchase of a used car. I am a skilled machine operator at Bosch Automotive, where I have been employed for nearly six years. As a single man supporting my 9-year-old son, a car is essential for commuting and managing family responsibilities.

Currently, I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly. Although I do not have a checking or savings account with you, I have a stable income and no other debts or installment plans. My housing is provided by my parents, so I do not pay rent.

I acknowledge a critical account in my credit history from a previous lender, but my recent financial conduct has been exemplary. My stable job and consistent payments to your bank make me a dependable candidate.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response.

Kind regards,
