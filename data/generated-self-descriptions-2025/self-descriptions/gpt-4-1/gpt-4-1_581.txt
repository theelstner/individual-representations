Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan in the amount of 937 DM to support my retraining as an automotive electrician. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for 10 months. My goal is to transition into a more skilled trade to provide a stable future for my wife and our young child.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a small balance and have always met my previous credit obligations on time. My financial situation is modest, with less than 100 DM in savings, but I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. We have resided in our current apartment for 3 years, and I own a used Opel Astra, which serves as our primary means of transportation.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my retraining will lead to a better-paying and more secure job. I am a responsible individual with a proven record of meeting my financial commitments, and I am eager to invest in my professional development.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 937 DM to finance my retraining as a certified nursing assistant. I have been working for the past 8 months as a janitor at a local school, but I wish to pursue a more meaningful and stable career in healthcare, especially since I am the sole provider for my wife.

Despite not having a checking account, I have always repaid my credits promptly and have no current debts. Our living situation is modest, as we rent a small flat and have lived here for 3 years. My only property is our family car, a 2007 Volkswagen Polo.

I am dedicated to improving my family’s future and am confident that this retraining will allow me to secure a better job. My record of responsible credit repayment demonstrates my trustworthiness as a candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Jürgen Schneider

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 937 DM to fund my retraining as a computer support technician. For the past 11 months, I have worked as a delivery driver, but with the growing importance of IT skills, I am eager to retrain for a more promising career path.

I have no checking account, but I do have a small savings account and a clean credit history, having always paid back previous loans on time. I have no guarantors or additional debts and currently live with my wife in a rented apartment, where we have resided for the last 3 years. Our only asset is an older Ford Fiesta.

With this loan, I will be able to complete my retraining and significantly improve my employment prospects. My reliable payment history and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.
