Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,882 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 5 years. I am currently residing in Berlin, where I have lived for 4 years, and I am grateful to have housing provided by my employer.

Though my current checking and savings accounts are below 100 DM, I have a proven record of financial responsibility. Over the past 42 months, I have consistently repaid all existing credits on time. I currently have one active credit at your bank, which is being serviced without issue.

As a single father of two, I am committed to providing a stable home environment. My guarantor, Mr. Ivan Petrov, a long-time colleague, further supports my application. Additionally, I hold a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning.

I am confident that my stable employment, positive credit history, and support system make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Jovanovic
