Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Artur Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 1,249 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for 10 months. My wife and I have one young child, and we have recently settled into our own home, which we purchased two years ago. 

I have maintained a good credit history, having successfully repaid my previous loan with your bank on time. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have always managed my finances responsibly, and my savings are limited as I recently invested in our home. I do not have any other debts or installment plans at this time.

The new car will greatly assist me in commuting to work and supporting my family’s needs. As a permanent resident with real estate property, I am committed to staying in this community. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate and assure you of my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Artur Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,249 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute to my job as a customs officer at the local port. I have been with the customs office for 8 months now, and my family, including my wife and our 4-year-old son, rely on my steady income.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have always repaid my financial obligations, including my previous loan from your bank. We own our home and have lived here for two years. My savings are currently under 100 DM, as we have invested most of our resources into our property.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and I take pride in my financial discipline. As a foreign worker who has made this community my home, I am eager to demonstrate my reliability and commitment.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Best regards,  
Mikhail Ivanov

My name is Daniel Müller. I am applying for a car loan of 1,249 DM. I have been employed as a skilled machinist at Siemens for the past 9 months. My wife and I, along with our young son, have owned our home for two years.

I have a proven record of repaying my previous loan with your bank on time, and I have no other outstanding debts. While my savings are currently minimal due to recent investments in our home, I am financially stable and have always met my obligations.

Having a new car is necessary for me to maintain punctuality at work and to support my family’s needs, especially as we have no other means of reliable transportation. I am committed to paying the agreed-upon installment rate and maintaining my good credit standing.
