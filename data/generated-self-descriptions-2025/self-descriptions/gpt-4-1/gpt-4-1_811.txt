Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,778 DM to purchase a new vehicle. My name is Elena Petrova, I am a 26-year-old divorced woman living in Germany for the past year. I have been employed as a cashier at a local supermarket for 9 months, after moving here from Bulgaria. I currently have a checking account with a balance below 200 DM and less than 100 DM in savings, but I am diligent with my finances. 

Although I have only been in my current residence for one year and have limited work history in Germany, I have a strong record of paying back all previous credits on time. I currently rent my apartment and have no other installment plans or outstanding debts, except for two small credits at your bank, both of which are being paid on schedule.

I am applying for this loan to purchase a reliable car that will enable me to commute to work and better care for my young son. My financial situation is modest, but I am committed to repaying the loan as agreed. I own a small property in Bulgaria, which demonstrates my sense of responsibility and stability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Fernandez, and I am a 26-year-old married woman originally from Spain, now living in Berlin for the past year. I am currently unemployed, but actively seeking work in hospitality, having previously worked as a hotel receptionist for three years in Madrid. My present checking account balance is under 200 DM and my savings are limited, but I have always managed my finances prudently.

I am seeking a loan of 1,778 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for me to access job opportunities outside the city center and transport my 4-year-old daughter to daycare. I have no other debts apart from two small credits at your bank, both of which I am repaying without issue. My credit history is spotless, with all previous loans paid back on time.

Despite my current employment status, I am a reliable candidate for this loan. I have property in Spain, which provides some financial security, and I have always honored my financial commitments. I am confident that with a car, my employment prospects will improve significantly, ensuring I can meet all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Maria Fernandez

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,778 DM for the purchase of a new car. My name is Laila Ahmed, a 26-year-old separated woman living in Munich for the past year. I have been working as a part-time cleaner for 8 months, and although my income is modest, I have managed to keep my checking and savings accounts active, albeit with low balances.

I have a dependent son and no other debts or installment plans apart from two existing credits at your bank, which I am paying back regularly. I rent my apartment and have no telephone at home. I own a small plot of land in my home country, Morocco, which is my only significant asset.

I am applying for this loan because a car is crucial for me to reach various cleaning jobs scattered around the city and to provide for my son. My credit history is excellent; I have never missed a payment on any loan. I am a foreign worker, but I am committed to building a stable life here and maintaining a trustworthy relationship with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling all repayment requirements.

Sincerely,
Laila Ahmed
