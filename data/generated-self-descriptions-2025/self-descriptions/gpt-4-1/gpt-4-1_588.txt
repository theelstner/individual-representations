Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 2,799 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology, where I have worked for three years. I have two children who depend on me, and as a foreign worker, reliable transportation is essential for both my job and family responsibilities.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn due to recent medical expenses for my children, I have a stable monthly income and own a small apartment building in Poland, which demonstrates my financial responsibility. While I have other credits at a different bank, I have always made my payments on time and can provide documentation to confirm this.

I am committed to fulfilling my obligations, as shown by my steady employment and property ownership. The loan will greatly improve my family's quality of life and my ability to perform at work. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, a single father of two, working as a customs official at Hamburg Port for the past two years. I am seeking a loan of 2,799 DM to buy a new car, which is crucial for my daily commute and for transporting my children to school and activities.

My financial situation is currently strained due to an unexpected apartment repair and supporting my family abroad, which led to my checking account being slightly overdrawn. However, I have a secure job with consistent income, and I own a plot of land in Egypt, providing me with additional security.

I have two ongoing credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors, and I have always prioritized meeting my financial commitments. I am confident that with this loan, I can further stabilize my family’s situation and continue being a reliable customer.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Banking Team,

I am Marek Kowalski, 36 years old, and have been employed as a skilled machinist at Siemens AG for nearly four years. I am applying for a loan of 2,799 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my work shifts and to take care of my two children.

I have a critical account status due to helping my family with relocation costs when I moved to Germany two years ago. My savings are minimal at present, but I own real estate in my home country, which adds to my financial stability. I currently rent an apartment and have maintained my residence since arriving in Germany.

Despite having two existing credits at this bank, I have never missed a payment, and my employer can vouch for my reliability. I am confident that with this new car, I can ensure punctuality and job security, supporting my dependents effectively.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Marek Kowalski

Dear Loan Manager,

My name is Ivan Petrov, a single male aged 36, with two children. I am employed as a certified logistics coordinator at Munich Freight Services, a position I have held for just over two years. I am requesting a loan of 2,799 DM to buy a new car, as my current vehicle is no longer reliable for my daily commute and family needs.

My checking account is currently negative due to unexpected school fees and moving expenses. My savings are below 100 DM, but I do own a piece of real estate in Russia, which I believe strengthens my financial profile. I have two other credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

I am a foreign worker, but I have always been diligent in repaying my debts and maintaining stable employment. I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,
Ivan Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ali Hassan, a 36-year-old single father of two, currently working as a senior technician at Deutsche Bahn for the past three years. I am applying for a loan of 2,799 DM to purchase a new car, as my job requires flexible commuting and my previous car recently broke down beyond repair.

Presently, my checking account is overdrawn due to paying for my children’s medical bills and covering rent. I have very limited savings at this time. However, I own a small house in Turkey, which serves as proof of my commitment to securing my family’s future.

Although my credit history shows some challenges, I have consistently met my obligations with your bank and have no other installment plans or guarantors. I am a responsible employee and father, and this loan will help me maintain my employment and support my children.

Thank you for your trust and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ali Hassan
