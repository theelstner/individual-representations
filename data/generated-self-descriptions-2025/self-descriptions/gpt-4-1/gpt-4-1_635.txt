Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Richter, and I am applying for a loan of 1,980 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 8 months. After my recent divorce, I relocated to Munich and have been residing in my current apartment for two years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a small balance and have always paid back my previous credit obligations on time. My co-applicant, my sister Anna, is also employed and will support this application.

My financial situation is stable: my monthly salary covers my living expenses and allows for regular installment payments. I am committed to maintaining my excellent credit record, and my employment in a reputable institution further demonstrates my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I will meet all repayment obligations and am happy to provide any further information required.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Richter
