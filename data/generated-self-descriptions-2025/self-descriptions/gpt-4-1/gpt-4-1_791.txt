Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for an education loan of 5,998 DM to pursue a part-time Master’s degree in Business Administration at the University of Frankfurt. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 3 years, where I have demonstrated reliability and dedication in my work. Although my current financial situation is challenging—my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM—I have always prioritized timely payment of my obligations, as evidenced by my responsible management of a previous loan from your bank.

As a single father with one dependent, I am committed to furthering my education to secure a better future for my child and myself. My stable employment and the fact that I have resided in my current home for three years underscore my reliability and commitment. I believe that investing in my education will not only improve my career prospects but also enhance my ability to repay the loan in a timely manner.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martin Schuster, and I am writing to request a loan of 5,998 DM to fund my continuing education in Information Technology at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt. I have worked as a certified IT specialist at Siemens AG for 2 years, and I am eager to expand my qualifications to advance within the company.

Currently, my financial resources are limited, as my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are minimal. However, I have a steady income and a solid employment record. I have managed my previous credit with your institution responsibly, and I have never defaulted on any payments, despite a challenging credit history with another bank in my early twenties.

I am confident that this investment in my education will enable me to achieve a higher position and salary, ensuring that I can meet the repayment schedule. I have no other guarantors or debtors, and my commitment to my career and my dependent child motivates me to succeed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Martin Schuster
