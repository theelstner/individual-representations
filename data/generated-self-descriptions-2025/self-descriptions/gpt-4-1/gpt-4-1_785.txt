Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 836 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a cashier at Müller Supermarkt, having started less than a year ago. My employment is stable and I am confident about my future prospects.

My financial situation is modest but stable. I have a checking account balance of 150 DM and a savings account with 300 DM. I have previously taken a credit from your bank and have paid it back on time without any issues. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is with the bank. I have a building society savings agreement as property.

As a divorced woman with a young child, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family life. I have been living at my current residence for two years and own my home. Despite being new to my job, I am committed to managing my finances responsibly. I believe my track record with your bank demonstrates my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 836 DM to purchase a new car. I recently began working as a cleaner at the City Hospital and have been in this role for 8 months. My checking account currently has 120 DM, and I have 250 DM in a savings account.

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I repaid promptly and in full. I have no other debts and my only installment obligations are with your institution. I also hold a life insurance policy as my main asset.

As a married woman and mother of a five-year-old, I need a reliable car to commute to work and take my child to school. I am a foreign worker, but I have lived at my current address for two years and own my home. I am dedicated to building a secure future for my family and have always managed my finances carefully.

Thank you for your consideration. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and appreciate your support.

Kind regards,  
Maria Petrova

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 836 DM for the purpose of buying a new car. I have been working as a kitchen assistant at Restaurant Am Markt for six months. My current account holds 180 DM, and I have 120 DM in my savings.

I previously took a loan from your bank and repaid it fully and on time. I have no other debts or guarantors. My only other installment plan is with the bank, and I have a building society savings agreement.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my reliability and look forward to your favorable reply.

Sincerely,  
Elena Ivanova
