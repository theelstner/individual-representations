Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of $9,277 to purchase a reliable used vehicle. As a divorced father of one, I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the City University Medical Lab for the past 3 years. My current job provides stable income, and I have a proven track record of responsibility, having paid off my previous credit with your bank in full and on time.

At present, I do not have a checking or savings account, and my housing is provided free of charge by my employer. I have lived at my current address for 4 years. My only dependent is my teenage daughter, whom I support fully. The car is essential for commuting to work and transporting my daughter to school and activities.

I am committed to meeting my financial obligations, as evidenced by my previous repayment history. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and my installment rate is manageable at 2. I believe my employment stability and responsible payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker
