Letter 1: Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,422 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, a position I have held for the past 10 months. My work involves supporting cutting-edge research in renewable energy, and reliable transportation is essential for my daily commute and fieldwork.

Although my checking account currently has a negative balance, I have always repaid my previous credits on time, as reflected in my credit history. I have minimal savings at the moment, but my employment is stable and my prospects for advancement are strong. I have one dependent—my younger brother—whom I support, and I live rent-free with a family member.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my proven record of responsible credit management, my commitment to my profession, and my reliable income. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Steiner

Letter 2: Junior Software Engineer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,422 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute to my job as a junior software engineer at TechSolutions GmbH. I began this position nine months ago, and it has provided me with a steady income and valuable experience in my field.

While my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM, I have demonstrated financial responsibility by always paying back my previous credit on time. I live with my parents rent-free, which allows me to allocate more of my income to loan repayment and supporting my young daughter.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am confident in my ability to fulfill the installment payments. My stable employment and clean credit history make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

My stable government employment, strong sense of duty, and history of responsible credit management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.
