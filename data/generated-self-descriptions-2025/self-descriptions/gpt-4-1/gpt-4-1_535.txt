Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,311 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology, where I have worked for the past 5 years. I am 26 years old, married, and have one child.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance between 100 and 500 DM, and I currently hold a building society savings agreement. My credit history is spotless; I have always paid back any existing credits on time, including a previous loan with your bank.

My monthly income is stable, and my wife and I own our home, which further secures my financial situation. I have no other outstanding installment plans or debts, and there are no guarantors involved. I have lived at my current address for 3 years and have always paid my bills promptly.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my employment is secure and my financial obligations are well managed. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Martin Schulz

My financial situation is stable. I have a savings account with 350 DM and a life insurance policy in my name. I have no checking account at present, but I have successfully paid back a previous credit at your bank without any issues. I do not have any other debts or installment plans.

We have owned our home for three years, and I have resided at the same address during this time. My employment is secure, and my monthly salary is sufficient to cover all family expenses and loan repayments. I also have a telephone registered under my name for easy contact.
