Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,984 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years and four months. My employment is stable, and I am proud to say that I have always met my financial obligations, including two previous loans from your bank, which I am repaying on schedule.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, and my savings are below 100 DM. I live rent-free in a shared family property, which allows me to manage my expenses efficiently while supporting my 12-year-old son as a single parent. Despite not owning property or having significant savings, I have demonstrated reliability in repaying my debts and managing my finances responsibly.

I am seeking this loan to improve my living situation with essential furniture and equipment, which will also enhance my ability to work from home when necessary. I am confident that my steady employment and responsible financial record make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,984 DM to purchase new furniture and necessary equipment for my apartment. I have been working as a customs officer with the Frankfurt City Administration for just over two years and have maintained continuous employment during this time.

Although I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are limited, I have a strong credit history with your bank, having successfully repaid two previous credits. I live with my younger brother in a family-owned apartment, which means I have no rent expenses, and I am financially responsible for my 9-year-old nephew.

I have no other debts, and my installment rate is manageable given my secure employment. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable future in Germany and believe that my track record demonstrates my trustworthiness as a borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ivan Mihailov

Letter 5

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,984 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am 47 years old, single, and have been working as a municipal records officer in Berlin for just over three years. My position is stable, and I am supporting my 15-year-old son as my sole dependent.

I do not have a checking account, and my savings are under 100 DM, as most of my income goes toward supporting my son and maintaining our household. I am currently living rent-free in my aunt’s flat, which has helped me stay on top of my existing two credit payments at your bank, both of which are up to date.

I have no other debts and no property, but my consistent employment and clean repayment record demonstrate my trustworthiness. I am confident that with this loan, I can further improve our living conditions and continue to meet my financial obligations.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Kind regards,
Jusuf Kelmendi
