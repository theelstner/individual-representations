Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs and I am applying for a business loan of 4,308 DM to expand my recently established catering service in Munich. I have been working as a scientific research assistant for the past 10 months at the Max Planck Institute, which has provided me with a stable income. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always paid back my previous credit at your bank on time and in full.

As a 24-year-old divorced mother with one dependent, I am determined to build a secure future for my child and myself. I have resided at my current address for four years and pay my rent reliably. My only asset is a life insurance policy, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning.

I am confident that the proposed business expansion will significantly increase my income, enabling me to meet the installment rate of 3 without difficulty. I hope you will consider my strong repayment history and dedication to my work as proof of my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovacs
