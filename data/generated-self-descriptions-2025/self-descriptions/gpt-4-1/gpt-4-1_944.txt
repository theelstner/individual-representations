Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is David Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan of 929 euros to purchase new furniture and essential equipment for my apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology for the past 5 years, and I am currently living alone in a rented apartment above a local store, where I have resided for the last 2 years.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have a solid credit history, having paid back previous credits promptly and without issue. I own a reliable car, which further demonstrates my financial responsibility. My monthly income comfortably covers my expenses, and I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors.

This loan will allow me to furnish my home and purchase necessary work equipment, which will enhance both my living conditions and job performance. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule, as my employment is stable and my financial obligations are well managed. I can be reached at any time by phone to discuss my application further.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
David Schmidt
