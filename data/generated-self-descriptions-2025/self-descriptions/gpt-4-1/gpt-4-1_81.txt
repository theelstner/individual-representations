Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Alexei Petrov, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,832 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for the past 8 months. My wife and I, along with our young daughter, recently moved to Munich, and we are working hard to build a stable life here.

Although my checking and savings accounts currently have less than 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have an existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying diligently and on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only dependent is my daughter.

I hold a building society savings agreement, reflecting my commitment to long-term financial planning. My employment is stable, and my prospects for advancement are good. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 2 and repay the loan within the agreed 30-month period.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to continue building my life in Germany and assure you of my reliability as a client.

Sincerely,
Alexei Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Novak, and I am requesting a loan of 3,832 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my family home. I have been working as an IT support specialist at Siemens AG for 10 months. My wife and I immigrated to Germany last year with our son, and we have been living in our own apartment for the past year.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts have minimal balances, as most of our funds went into securing our home. However, I have an excellent credit history, having paid off a previous loan with your bank without any issues. I have no other debts, and my only dependent is my 3-year-old son.

I also contribute regularly to a life insurance policy, demonstrating my commitment to financial responsibility. My employment is secure, and I am confident in my ability to make the monthly payments. I believe my record with your bank shows that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Viktor Novak

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Piotr Kowalczyk, and I am writing to request a loan of 3,832 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new residence. I am a skilled machinist at BMW, where I have been working for 7 months. My wife and I, along with our young child, have recently settled into our own apartment after moving to Germany.

My current financial reserves are limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, as most of our funds were used for relocation and initial housing expenses. I have a perfect record of repaying my existing credit with your bank. I am financially responsible, with no other debts or installment plans.

I hold a life insurance policy, which reflects my commitment to securing my family’s future. My employment is stable, and I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to continue building a stable life for my family here and assure you of my reliability as a borrower.

Kind regards,
Piotr Kowalczyk
