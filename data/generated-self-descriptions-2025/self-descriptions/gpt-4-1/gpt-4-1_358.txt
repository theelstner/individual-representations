Letter 1

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €2,331 to purchase a new television set. I have been employed as a technical support supervisor at Siemens AG for the past 8 years, and my position provides me with a stable monthly income. Although I currently do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, I have maintained a good relationship with another bank, where I have managed previous credits responsibly.

I currently live in my own home, which I have owned for four years, and have one dependent—my teenage son. My co-applicant, who is my brother, is supporting me in this application. I have never missed any installment payments on my existing credit with your bank, and my installment rate for this loan will be manageable alongside my other financial obligations.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my employment is secure and my expenses are well-planned. I am a responsible borrower and believe that my property ownership and steady job make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Wagner, and I am seeking a loan of €2,331 to purchase a high-quality radio and television set for my home. I have been working as a senior administrative assistant at the City Hall of Frankfurt for the past 9 years. My employment is permanent and provides a secure income that allows me to comfortably manage my financial responsibilities.

I currently have no checking or savings account with your institution, but I have maintained another credit line with your bank for the past year without any issues. My housing is owned outright, and I have resided at my current address for four years. My co-applicant, my cousin, is also a reliable individual with a steady income.

Despite a critical account in my credit history due to a brief period of unemployment several years ago, I have since demonstrated consistent financial discipline. I have one dependent, my daughter, and my installment obligations are modest relative to my income. I am confident in my ability to meet all repayment terms.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Jens Wagner

To the Loan Department,

I am Peter Novak, a 49-year-old logistics manager at Deutsche Post, where I have been employed for 8 years. I am applying for a loan of €2,331 to upgrade my home entertainment system, specifically for a new television and radio. My motivation is to enhance the quality of life for myself and my dependent son.

I own my home and have lived there for four years. While I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, I am a responsible borrower with one existing credit at your branch, which has always been paid on time. My co-applicant, my brother-in-law, is also financially stable.

Although my credit history includes a critical account from a previous loan at another bank, I have taken steps to resolve all past issues and maintain a clean record since then. With a manageable installment rate and secure employment, I am confident I can fulfill the repayment obligations without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Andreas Meyer, and I am writing to request a loan of €2,331 to purchase a new radio and television for my household. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 10 years, providing a stable and sufficient income.

I have lived in my own house for four years and support my teenage daughter as my dependent.

My co-applicant, a close family friend, is also committed to supporting this loan.

My credit history shows a critical account from a period when I was paying for unexpected medical expenses, but I have since restored my financial stability and always make my payments on time. My job security, property ownership, and responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Andreas Meyer
