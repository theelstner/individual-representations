Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Victor Nguyen, and I am applying for a loan of €2,197 to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for 5 years. My employment is stable, and I have a reliable monthly income.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained other credit lines with reputable institutions and have always met my obligations, despite a critical account in the past due to a brief period of illness. I am single, 32 years old, and have lived at my current address for 4 years. As a foreign worker from Vietnam, I am committed to building my life and career in Germany.

Owning a car is essential for commuting to my workplace, as public transport options are limited in my area. I have no guarantors or other debtors and manage my finances responsibly. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 4 and repay the loan within the agreed duration. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Victor Nguyen

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Samuel Okoro, and I am writing to request a loan of €2,197 for the purchase of a used car. I have been employed as a warehouse supervisor at EuroLogistics GmbH for the past 6 years. My employment is secure, and my monthly salary allows me to comfortably meet the proposed installment payments.

While I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have managed previous credit agreements responsibly, except for a single late payment last year due to an emergency home repair. I currently have no other loans at your bank and no outstanding debts with third parties.

I am a single 29-year-old, residing at my current address for 4 years, and I own a small car as my only property. I do not have a savings account, but I am diligent in budgeting my income. As a foreign worker from Nigeria, I am determined to establish a strong financial foundation in Germany.

A reliable vehicle is crucial for my daily commute and to support my career advancement. I assure you of my commitment to honoring all loan obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Samuel Okoro

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of €2,197. My name is Andrej Petrov, and I have been a skilled employee (electrician) at Siemens AG for 4 years. I am single, 34 years old, and have been living at my current residence for 4 years.

I do not currently hold a checking or savings account with your bank, but I have maintained other credit relationships, which are currently in good standing after resolving a critical issue two years ago caused by a temporary reduction in work hours. I am a foreign worker from Serbia and have no dependents or co-signers.

A used car is essential for my job, as I often need to travel to different sites. My stable income and careful financial management ensure that I can meet the monthly installment rate. I have no other installment plans except for a small electronics purchase.

I hope you will see me as a trustworthy candidate and approve my loan request. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andrej Petrov

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Rafal Kowalski. I am seeking a loan of €2,197 to purchase a used car, which is necessary for my work as a field technician at Deutsche Telekom, where I have been employed for 6 years. My employment is permanent, and my monthly salary is sufficient to cover the proposed installment payments.

I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, but I have a history of managing credit responsibly, aside from a critical account three years ago due to a delay in salary payment from a previous employer. I am 31, single, and have lived at my current address for 4 years. I own a car, which I plan to trade in for the new vehicle.

As a foreign worker from Poland, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and building a future here. I have no other debts or guarantors and am confident in my ability to repay the loan. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,  
Rafal Kowalski
