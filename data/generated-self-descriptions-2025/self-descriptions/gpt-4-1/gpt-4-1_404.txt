Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Marko Petrovic, and I am applying for a business loan in the amount of 8,648 DM to expand my mobile car detailing service, which I launched eight months ago in Munich. I am a skilled employee with nine years of experience as an automotive technician and, as a foreign worker, have been working diligently to establish my own small business in Germany.

My financial situation is modest, with less than 100 DM in savings and no current checking account. I have experienced delays in repaying a previous small personal loan, but I have since taken steps to improve my financial discipline, including setting up automatic reminders and working with a financial advisor. Currently, I have no other debts or guarantors, and I reside in my current apartment for the past two years.

I am a single man, fully dedicated to growing my business, and my only property is my car, which is essential for my work. I am committed to making regular installment payments and have demonstrated reliability in my employment. I am confident that with this loan, I can purchase better equipment and reach a broader clientele, ensuring timely repayment.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Khalil, and I am requesting a business loan of 8,648 DM to open a small electronics repair shop in Berlin. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past ten months and am eager to transition into entrepreneurship.

Although I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I have managed my finances responsibly since a previous delay in repaying a consumer credit two years ago. I now use budgeting tools to ensure all payments are made on time.

I am a single male, have lived in my current apartment for two years, and do not have any other debts or financial obligations. My only asset is my car, which I will use for business deliveries. I have no dependents and am committed to building a reputable business that will provide stable income and allow me to meet my loan obligations.

I appreciate your consideration and would be grateful for the opportunity to prove my reliability.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khalil

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Ivan Novak, and I am applying for a loan of 8,648 DM to purchase inventory for a small grocery store I plan to open in Hamburg. I am a foreign worker and have been employed as a warehouse supervisor for the last eleven months.

I currently do not have a checking account and my savings are less than 100 DM. I acknowledge that I had a delay in settling a previous utility bill, but since then, I have maintained a clean record with timely payments on all other obligations. I live alone, have no dependents, and my current residence has been my home for two years.

With no other debts or co-signers, and my car as my only property, I am fully committed to this business venture. I believe that my strong work ethic and experience in logistics make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan, and I am prepared to adhere strictly to the agreed installment plan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
