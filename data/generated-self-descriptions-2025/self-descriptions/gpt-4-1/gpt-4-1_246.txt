Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,447 DM to support my retraining as a certified nursing assistant. I am 35 years old, divorced, and have been living in my own apartment for the past three years. I have worked as a hotel housekeeper for the past two years, but I am eager to gain new skills and provide a better future for my two children.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with your bank for the past year, currently holding 670 DM. I previously took a small loan from your bank to cover a dental emergency and repaid it on time and in full. I have no other debts or installment plans.

My real estate property provides stability, and my commitment to my family and new career path makes me a responsible and trustworthy candidate. This retraining program will allow me to increase my income and job security, benefiting both myself and my children.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,447 DM to enroll in a vocational retraining program for early childhood education. My name is Fatima Ahmed, a 35-year-old married woman with two dependents. I have lived in my own home for three years and have been employed as a warehouse assistant for nearly three years.

I currently have no checking account but have kept a savings account with your bank with a balance of 540 DM. Last year, I took out a credit with your bank to help with moving expenses and repaid it without any delays. I have no other outstanding debts or financial obligations.
