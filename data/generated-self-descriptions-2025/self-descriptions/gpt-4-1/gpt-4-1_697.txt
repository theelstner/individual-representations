Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,236 DM to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years. My current savings amount to 750 DM in my savings account. I have always paid back my existing credits on time and have never defaulted. 

I am a single father with one dependent, and I have been living at my current rented address for four years. As a foreign worker in Germany, reliable transportation is essential for my daily commute and to support my child’s activities. I have a building society savings agreement as additional security. 

I am a responsible borrower, as demonstrated by my clean credit history and my steady employment. I am confident that I will be able to meet the monthly installment rate of 2 without difficulty. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,236 DM to purchase a used car, which is necessary for my job as a technical draftsman at Siemens AG, where I have worked for two years. My current savings stand at 620 DM, and I have a life insurance policy as part of my financial planning.

I have successfully repaid my previous credit with your bank, and I have no other debts or installment plans. As a single man supporting my teenage son, reliable transportation is crucial. I have rented my apartment for four years and have maintained a stable residence.

Although I do not have a checking account, my commitment to honoring financial agreements is proven by my record. I hope you find me a trustworthy candidate and approve my application.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khalil

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a 1,236 DM loan to buy a used car to improve my commute as an official in the local government office, where I have been employed for just over a year. I have 900 DM in my savings and a building society savings agreement for added security.

I have always repaid my credits on time, and I have no other outstanding debts. I rent my apartment and have lived there for four years, providing a stable home for myself and my son. As a foreign worker, I rely on public transport, which is often unreliable in my area.

My steady employment and sound financial habits make me a reliable candidate. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you very much for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak
