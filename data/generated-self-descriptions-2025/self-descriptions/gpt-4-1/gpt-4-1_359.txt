Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jonas Müller, and I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 3 years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,463 DM to purchase a new television and radio set, which are essential for my ongoing research on media consumption patterns in Germany.

Although I currently do not have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, I have managed my finances responsibly despite occasional delays in repaying past credits, which were due to unforeseen medical expenses last year. I have since stabilized my situation and now have a steady monthly income, with no other outstanding loans or guarantors.

My current residence in Munich has been stable for the past 2 years, and I own a car as my main property. As a single, 32-year-old foreign worker with no dependents, I am fully committed to my career and financial obligations. I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment rate, and I am eager to build a strong banking relationship with your institution.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Jonas Müller

Letter 2 – Small Business Owner

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Al-Farsi, and I am a self-employed owner of a small electronics repair shop in Berlin, which I have successfully operated for 2.5 years. I am seeking a loan of 4,463 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my shop, which will enable me to offer repair services for the latest models and attract more clients.

While I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are limited, my business has shown steady growth, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I did experience a payment delay two years ago when my shop was affected by a local flood, but since then, I have maintained timely payments and improved my financial discipline.

I have lived at my current address for 2 years and rely on my car for business operations. As a single, 35-year-old foreign worker with no dependents, I am committed to expanding my business and meeting all my financial commitments. I am confident that I can handle the monthly installments and would greatly appreciate your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Al-Farsi

Letter 3 – IT Project Manager

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Stefan Klein, a 38-year-old IT project manager at a multinational company in Frankfurt, where I have been employed for 1.5 years. I am applying for a loan of 4,463 DM to purchase a modern radio and television set for my home, which will also serve as tools for my freelance work in digital media consulting.

Although I have no checking account and less than 100 DM in savings, my monthly salary is stable, and I have no other debts or financial obligations. In the past, I experienced a delay in paying off a previous loan due to a transition between jobs, but I have since reestablished my financial reliability.

I have resided at my current address for 2 years, own a car, and have no dependents. As a single foreign worker, I take my financial responsibilities seriously and am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment plan. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Klein
