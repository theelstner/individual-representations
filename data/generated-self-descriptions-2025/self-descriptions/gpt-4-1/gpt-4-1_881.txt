Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Karim Hassan, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €6,742 for the purpose of purchasing a new television and sound system for my home. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at Berlin Technical University for the past 5 years, and I am currently a resident of Munich, where I have owned my apartment for the last 3 years.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained two existing credits with you, both of which are in good standing. My credit history includes some previous difficulties at another institution, which have since been resolved, and I am committed to maintaining a strong financial record moving forward. I am a single father with one dependent, and my stable income allows me to easily manage the proposed installment rate of 2.

I am confident that my steady employment, property ownership, and responsible approach to credit make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Karim Hassan

To whom it may concern,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, a 36-year-old mechanical engineer currently employed at Siemens AG for the last 4.5 years. I am seeking a loan of €6,742 to upgrade my home entertainment system, specifically a new television and radio setup to enhance my living environment.

I have a life insurance policy in place and own my residence in Hamburg, where I have lived for 3 years. While I do not have a checking or savings account with your institution, I have successfully managed two credits with your bank and have no other outstanding installment plans. My previous credit history at another bank was marked as critical, but since then, I have improved my financial discipline and maintained all obligations punctually.

As a single male supporting one child, my stable employment and responsible credit management underscore my reliability. I respectfully ask you to consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Viktor Ivanov
