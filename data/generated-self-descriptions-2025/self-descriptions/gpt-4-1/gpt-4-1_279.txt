Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,262 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller & Söhne, where I have worked for the past 8 years. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have always managed my finances responsibly, and I have repaid my previous credit from your bank on time and in full.

As a divorced father supporting my teenage son, I am committed to providing a stable and comfortable home environment. I have lived at my current residence for four years, which I own, and I have no other outstanding loans or installment plans. My only financial obligation is to support my son.

While I do not have a savings account, I do hold a life insurance policy, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial security. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms, as my employment is stable and my monthly expenses are carefully managed.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,
Peter Klein

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Andreas Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan of 1,262 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my residence. I have been employed as a janitor at the Heidelberg Community Center for the past 9 years. Although my checking account is currently below zero, I have never missed a payment on my existing credit with your bank.

I am a divorced man with one dependent, my 12-year-old daughter, who lives with me part-time. I have owned my home for four years and have no other installment plans or debts. My financial obligations are limited, and my steady employment ensures a regular income.

While I do not have a savings account, I do have an active building society savings agreement. I am a reliable borrower, as demonstrated by my clean credit history with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Andreas Schmidt
