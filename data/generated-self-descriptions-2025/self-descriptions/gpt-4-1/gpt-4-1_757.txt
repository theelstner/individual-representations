Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,285 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past five years. My current financial situation is challenging, as my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and I do not have a savings account. However, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, as reflected in my credit history with your bank.

As a divorced mother of one, I rely on public transport to commute to my laboratory and manage daily responsibilities for my child. A reliable car would greatly improve my work-life balance and allow me to fulfill both professional and personal obligations efficiently. 

I am a responsible borrower, with a stable job and a consistent history of meeting my financial obligations. I have been residing at my current address for four years and have no outstanding debts apart from my current credit with your bank, which I have managed diligently.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I will be able to repay the loan as agreed and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Letter 2 – Senior Administrative Clerk

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,285 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a senior administrative clerk at Bayer AG for six years and have lived at my current address for four years. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and I do not hold a savings account, but my credit record with your bank is spotless; all previous loans have been paid back on time.

As a married woman supporting my husband and young son, reliable transportation is essential to manage our household and my daily commute. At present, I am dependent on unreliable public transport, which often causes delays and difficulties with my work schedule.

Although my financial resources are limited, my employment is stable, and I have a proven track record of responsible borrowing. I have no other debts or installment plans and pay rent regularly. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments for this loan and that this investment will greatly benefit my family's quality of life.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Kind regards,  
Petra Schneider

Letter 3 – Technical Support Specialist

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,285 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am a 32-year-old separated woman, currently working as a technical support specialist at Siemens, where I have been employed for four and a half years. My financial situation is strained, as my checking account is currently negative, and I have no savings. Nevertheless, I have always fulfilled my credit obligations and have no history of missed payments.

I have one dependent, my daughter, and no other debts or guarantors. Reliable transportation is critical for me to maintain my job and support my family, especially since my current housing is located far from my workplace and my daughter's school. This loan will enable me to improve both our daily lives.

I have demonstrated financial responsibility with my previous credit at your bank, which has been managed without issue. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and assure you of my commitment to meeting all terms.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Best regards,  
Elena Petrova

Letter 4 – Office Manager

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,285 DM to buy a new car. I am currently employed as an office manager at Deutsche Telekom and have held this position for just over four years. I am a married woman with a young child, and I have been living at my current address for four years. My checking account is slightly overdrawn, and I do not have a savings account, but I have a good credit history, with all previous loans repaid on time.

Having a car is essential for me to manage my work responsibilities and care for my family. Public transportation is not always reliable in our area, and a car would greatly improve our mobility and quality of life.

I have no other debts or installment plans and have always paid my rent on time. I am confident that my stable employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Hoffmann
