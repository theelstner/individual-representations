Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,882 DM to purchase a new television for my household. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for three years. My current financial situation is challenging, as my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have a solid history of repaying previous loans on time, and I have no outstanding debts or guarantors.

I am divorced and live with my daughter in a rented apartment, where we have resided for four years. My only significant asset is my car, which I use daily for work. My employment is stable, and I am dedicated to my profession. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM, as I have managed similar payments in the past without issue.

I kindly request your consideration for this loan. I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate, and this purchase will greatly improve my family’s quality of life. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Müller
