Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Peter Hoffmann, and I am applying for a loan of 3,394 DM to cover urgent repairs needed on my car, which is my primary means of transportation. I have been a resident of Dortmund for the past four years and am currently living in rented accommodation. After losing my job as a warehouse assistant eight months ago due to company downsizing, I have been actively seeking new employment and have registered with local job agencies. My current financial situation is challenging, with my checking and savings accounts both under 100 DM, and I am managing other small installment plans totaling 65 DM monthly.

Despite my current difficulties, I have maintained open communication with creditors and have a co-applicant, my brother Markus, who is supporting my application and is steadily employed. I have held previous jobs reliably for over five years and have always repaid my debts in the past. I am committed to meeting my loan obligations and am confident that securing this loan will allow me to repair my car and expand my job search radius, improving my employment prospects. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Peter Hoffmann

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am requesting a loan of 3,394 DM to finance essential repairs to my apartment’s heating system. I have lived in Leipzig for four years and, after being laid off from my job as a machine operator last year, I have been receiving unemployment benefits while searching for new employment. My savings are currently below 100 DM, and my checking account is overdrawn, but I am determined to stabilize my situation.

I have a co-applicant, my cousin Stefan, who has agreed to guarantee this loan. My previous credit history includes a furniture loan from another bank, which I have been paying off regularly. I understand my financial circumstances are not ideal, but I have always prioritized my loan repayments, even during tough times. I am confident that with this repair, I can maintain a stable living environment and increase my chances of returning to steady work. I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my commitment to fulfilling my obligations.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Michael Krause, writing to apply for a 3,394 DM loan to repair my work van, which is essential for my part-time deliveries and odd jobs. I have been living in Munich for four years and, although currently unemployed, I am actively pursuing new opportunities and depend on my van to reach clients. My financial resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings and an overdrawn checking account, and I am currently making small monthly payments on other installment plans.

I have a co-applicant, my friend Jens, who is employed as a teacher and has agreed to support my application. While my credit history shows some critical accounts, I have always made efforts to communicate with my lenders and resolve issues. I am confident that with the repair of my van, I will be able to increase my income and improve my financial standing. I am committed to repaying this loan and appreciate your trust.

Yours sincerely,  
Michael Krause

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,394 DM for urgent repairs to my mother’s home, where I currently reside. My name is Andreas Schulz, and I have lived in Hamburg for four years. Previously, I worked as a security guard, but I have been unemployed for the past ten months due to health issues. My financial situation is strained, with less than 100 DM in both my checking and savings accounts, and I am responsible for other minor installment payments.

My uncle, who is employed as a civil servant, has agreed to be my co-applicant and guarantor. Despite my current challenges and a less-than-perfect credit history, I have always honored my repayment commitments in the past. Repairing the home will ensure a safe living environment for both myself and my mother, and I am confident that I will be able to return to work soon. Thank you for considering my application and for your understanding.

Kind regards,  
Andreas Schulz

Sincerely,
