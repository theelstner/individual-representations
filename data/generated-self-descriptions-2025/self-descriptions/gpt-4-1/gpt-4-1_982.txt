Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 8,386 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. My name is Viktor Petrov, a 49-year-old mechanical engineer employed at Siemens AG for the past 6 years. I have been residing at my current address in Munich for the last 2 years and am a single father to my teenage son.

Although my current checking account balance is below 200 DM and my savings are limited, I have maintained steady employment and have a building society savings agreement in place. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and my existing credit with another institution is in good standing, despite a previous issue that has since been resolved.

I own my apartment, which provides stability, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and assure you of my commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed and I am seeking a loan of 8,386 DM to furnish my recently purchased home and acquire necessary equipment for my work as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 5 years.

As a foreign worker in Germany, I have built a stable life for myself and my 7-year-old daughter. My current financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance below 200 DM and less than 100 DM in savings. I have a life insurance policy and have responsibly managed my finances, including an existing credit line at another bank.

I have lived at my current address for 2 years and have no additional debts or guarantors. I am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations and believe my stable employment and home ownership make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 8,386 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home office. My name is Luka Ivanovic, and I have worked as a customs official at the Port of Hamburg for 4 years. I am 49 years old, single, and support my adult son, who is currently attending university.

My finances are stretched, with a checking account balance under 200 DM and minimal savings. However, I have a building society savings agreement and own my home, which I have lived in for 2 years. I have an existing credit with another institution, which is being paid regularly, and no other installment plans.

Despite these constraints, my employment is secure and I have a strong record of meeting my financial commitments. I am confident that I can manage the proposed monthly installment and respectfully request your support.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Luka Ivanovic
