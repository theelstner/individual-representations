Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Selim, and I am applying for a car loan of 1,344 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed for the past 5 years as a warehouse assistant at Meyer Logistics GmbH. My checking account has consistently maintained a balance above 200 DM, with my salary being deposited regularly for over a year.

I currently have two credits at your bank and one small installment plan with another institution. My financial situation is stable, with a regular income and ownership of my residence, which is a small apartment I bought three years ago. I also own a property in my home country, which adds to my financial security.

As a single father of two children, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities. I have managed my existing debts responsibly and have never missed a payment, even though my credit history shows a critical account from a previous bank. I am committed to meeting all my financial obligations and have demonstrated this through my consistent account activity and responsible borrowing.

I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, and I thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Selim

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,344 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a janitor at Lindenhof Residential Complex for the past 6 years, and my salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account at your bank for over a year, always maintaining a balance above 200 DM.

Although I have two ongoing credits with your bank and an installment plan with another bank, I have managed all my payments punctually. My only significant asset is my apartment, which I own, and a small plot of land in Bulgaria.

I do not have a savings account, but I have demonstrated my reliability by maintaining stable employment and timely payments. As a foreign worker and single parent of two, a new car is crucial for my daily commute and ensuring my children’s well-being. My residence of two years has provided stability, and I intend to continue building my life here.

I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling my obligations and would appreciate your trust in granting this loan.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov
