Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am applying for a loan of 1,444 DM to purchase a new television. I am a 23-year-old scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 10 months. As a foreign worker residing in Germany for just over a year, I am still establishing my financial footing. My current checking account balance is modest, below 200 DM, and I do not yet have a savings account.

I have a good credit record, as I have always paid back my existing credit at your bank on time. I live in my own apartment and support my younger brother, who is currently studying. I have no other debts or installment plans and no guarantors. While I have only been in my current job for less than a year, my position is stable, and my employment contract has recently been renewed for another two years.

I am committed to managing my finances responsibly. My current installment rate is manageable, and my previous credit history shows that I am a reliable borrower. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am requesting a loan of 1,444 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. I am a 23-year-old single male living in my own apartment, with one dependent—my younger sister. I am an electrical technician at Siemens, where I have been working for 8 months.

Although my checking account currently holds less than 200 DM and I do not have a savings account, I have consistently repaid my previous loan at this bank without delay. I have no other debts or financial obligations, and I do not have a guarantor. My employment is secure, and I have a building society savings agreement as part of my benefits package.

As a foreign worker, I am focused on building a stable life here. I take pride in my responsible financial behavior and hope my reliable credit history will speak for my trustworthiness. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Ivan Petrov
