Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 14,318 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a Senior Research Analyst at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and I have a steady monthly income. My current checking account balance is 150 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have always managed my finances responsibly, as demonstrated by my history of paying back existing credits on time.

I am single, 57 years old, and have one dependent—my adult son who is currently pursuing his university studies. I have lived at my current address for 2 years and pay no rent, as my accommodation is provided by my employer. I have no other debts or installment plans and no guarantors. My only existing credit with your bank has been managed without issue.

The new car is essential for my daily commute and for supporting my son’s education needs. I am confident in my ability to meet the 36-month installment plan at the agreed rate. I have always valued integrity and reliability in my financial dealings, and I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Klaus Meier

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 14,318 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as the Operations Manager at Siemens AG for 9 years, earning a stable income. My current checking account holds 80 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM, as I have recently supported my dependent nephew’s education expenses.

My credit history is excellent; I have always paid back my credits on time. I am single, 57 years old, and have lived at my current residence for 2 years, where I do not pay rent. I have no additional debts or installment plans, and my only other credit with your bank has been handled diligently.

A new car is necessary for my work, which often requires travel to different sites, and for supporting my nephew, who relies on me for transportation. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the 36-month term. My professional background and financial discipline make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,  
Martin Schulte

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 14,318 DM to purchase a new car. I have been a self-employed IT consultant for the past 10 years, with a consistent client base and reliable income. My checking account balance is currently 120 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, as I recently invested in upgrading my home office for my business.

I have a spotless credit record, having always paid back my previous loans on time. I am 57 years old, single, with one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support financially. I have lived at my current address for 2 years rent-free, as it is owned by a family member.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I am requesting this loan to replace my old vehicle, which is no longer reliable for business travel. My financial discipline and professional reputation ensure that I will meet the 36-month repayment schedule without issue.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Jens Weber

Dear Lending Department,

I am applying for a loan of 14,318 DM to buy a new car. I am currently an Officer in the Federal Employment Agency, where I have worked for 8 years. My current account balance is 60 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM due to recent medical expenses for my dependent father.

I have a strong credit history, with all previous credits paid back on time. I am 57, single, and have lived at my current residence for 2 years, with no housing costs. I have no additional debts or installment plans, and only one existing credit with your bank, which is in good standing.

A new car is necessary for my job, which involves regular field visits, as well as for supporting my father’s mobility. I am confident that my stable employment and financial responsibility make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
