Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,399 DM for the purchase of a new television and radio system. I have been employed as a senior project manager at Siemens AG for the past eight years, where I manage a team of 12 engineers. My monthly salary has been consistently paid into my checking account for the past year, with an average balance well above 200 DM.

I have a strong credit history, having previously taken out two personal loans, both of which I repaid promptly and in full. I do not have any outstanding debts, nor do I have any guarantors or co-signers. I have lived at my current residence in Munich for three years, and my primary asset is a Volkswagen Passat, which I own outright.

While I do not have a savings account, my stable income and long-term employment demonstrate my financial reliability. I am single, with no dependents, and I have no other installment plans except a gym membership. I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installments for this loan without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Martin Keller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 3,399 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. I have been working as a self-employed tax consultant in Frankfurt for the past nine years, with a steady annual income and all salary assignments deposited into my checking account for more than a year.

My credit history is impeccable; I have always repaid existing credits on time. I currently own a BMW 3 Series and have no other debts or installment plans apart from a small business equipment lease. I have lived at my current address for three years and do not own a home, but my income and assets provide a solid financial foundation.

Although I do not have a savings account, my track record as a responsible borrower and my established professional reputation underscore my trustworthiness. I am single and have no dependents, which allows me to dedicate sufficient resources to repaying this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Jürgen Weber

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,399 DM to upgrade my household electronics, specifically a new radio and television. I am a highly qualified research scientist at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for seven years. My salary is deposited monthly into my checking account, which always maintains a balance above 200 DM.

I have a history of responsible credit use, having paid off my previous education loan early. I do not have any other debts or financial obligations, and I own a reliable Audi A4. I have resided at my current address in Hamburg for three years and rent my apartment.

While I currently do not hold a savings account, my stable employment and consistent income make me a dependable candidate for this loan. As a single individual with no dependents, I can comfortably manage the proposed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Stefan Müller
