Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,366 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. My name is Peter Novak, a 39-year-old divorced male currently residing in Munich for the past three years. I am a senior project manager at Siemens, where I have been employed for 5 years.

My current financial situation is stable. Although my checking account balance is below 200 DM, I maintain a savings account with 750 DM. I have a few outstanding credits with other institutions, but none with your bank. I am requesting a 12-month loan with a 3% installment rate, which I am confident I can meet with my monthly salary.

I am a responsible borrower, as demonstrated by my stable employment and consistent income. I require a new car for my work, as I frequently travel to client sites across Bavaria. I have no other debtors or guarantors and am prepared to provide any further information you may require.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Bashir, a 42-year-old divorced entrepreneur living in Frankfurt for three years. I am seeking a loan of 2,366 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my consulting business. I have been self-employed as the owner of Bashir Consulting for the past 4.5 years.

My checking account balance is currently modest, under 200 DM, but I have 900 DM in my savings account. I have a critical credit history due to a delayed payment two years ago, but I have since resolved all issues and have no outstanding debts at your bank.

As a foreign national who has built a reputable business here, I value reliability and transparency. My monthly income is sufficient to cover the loan installments, and my business continues to grow. I have no other installment plans except for a small equipment lease.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am available for an interview or to provide further documentation.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Bashir
