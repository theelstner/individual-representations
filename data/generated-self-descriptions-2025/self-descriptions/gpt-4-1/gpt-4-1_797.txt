Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,301 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. As a divorced woman of 22 years old, I recently moved to Berlin with my 3-year-old daughter for a new job as a laboratory research assistant at a local university. I have been employed there for 8 months and am currently renting an apartment, where I have resided for the past 4 years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance of 350 DM and a life insurance policy as my main property asset. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying on time every month without any issues. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans.

This loan will allow me to purchase a bed, a refrigerator, and a desk, which are necessary for my daughter's comfort and for me to continue my work from home when needed. I am a responsible individual and have demonstrated my reliability through my consistent credit repayments. I am confident that I will be able to repay this loan without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marta Nowak, and I am a 22-year-old married woman working as a customs official in Hamburg. I am seeking a loan of 2,301 DM to buy furniture and basic equipment for my family’s new apartment, which we have been renting for the past four years.

I have been employed at the customs office for 7 months. My employment is stable, and my salary comfortably covers my living expenses, my existing credit (which has always been paid on time), and allows me to save a little each month. Currently, I have 150 DM in my savings account and a building society savings agreement as additional security.

I do not have a checking account yet, but I have managed my finances responsibly and have no other debts or installment plans. I am the sole provider for my 2-year-old son and my husband, who is currently seeking employment. We do not have a telephone, but I can be reached reliably by mail.

This loan would help us furnish our home with a washing machine, a sofa, and a dining table, which are urgently needed for our family’s well-being. My good credit history and stable job make me a trustworthy candidate. I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Marta Nowak

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,301 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am a 22-year-old married woman and work as a skilled employee in an electronics manufacturing company in Munich. I have been in this position for 10 months.

Although I have only been employed here for a short period, I have demonstrated financial responsibility by paying back my existing credit at your bank on time. I do not have a checking account, but I do maintain a savings account with a balance of 250 DM and hold a life insurance policy.

My husband and I have one child, and we have lived in our current rented apartment for four years. We have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. The requested loan will be used to buy a bed for our child, a wardrobe, and a small oven.

I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms, as my employment is stable and my living expenses are well managed. I hope you will consider my application favorably.
