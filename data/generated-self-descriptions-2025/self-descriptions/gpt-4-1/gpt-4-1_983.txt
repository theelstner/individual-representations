Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 4,844 DM. My name is Ahmed Farouk, and I am a 34-year-old single male currently residing in Berlin for the past two years. I am a foreign worker from Egypt and, until recently, worked as a branch manager for a logistics company for eight years. Unfortunately, due to recent restructuring, I am currently unemployed but actively seeking new opportunities.

I have no checking account at the moment, but I have maintained an excellent credit history, having paid back all my previous credits on time. My current financial assets are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings. I do not have any co-debtors or guarantors, and I am not responsible for any dependents.

The purpose of this loan is to start a small delivery service, leveraging my management experience and industry contacts. I own a reliable van, which will serve as my primary business asset. My housing is currently provided through a bank lease arrangement.

I am confident in my ability to manage this new venture successfully, given my track record and dedication. My previous employers can attest to my reliability and financial responsibility. I assure you that, if granted this loan, I will make all payments promptly and use the funds solely for business development.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Farouk
