Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,973 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently 22 years old and have been living at my current residence for four years. I am a single father and support my younger brother, who is my dependent. 

Until recently, I worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Physics for 8 years. Unfortunately, due to funding cuts, my contract was not renewed, and I am now actively seeking new employment. Despite my current unemployment, I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying on time every month.

My checking and savings accounts are currently below 100 DM due to my recent job loss and the need to support my brother. Nevertheless, my past repayment record demonstrates my reliability. I have no other debts, no other installment plans, and no guarantors. I live rent-free in an apartment provided by my uncle, which helps me keep my living expenses low.

The new car is essential for me to expand my job search beyond the local area and to ensure reliable transportation for both myself and my brother. I am committed to continuing my responsible financial behavior and am confident that, with this loan, I will be able to secure new employment soon.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Marko Petrović

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 3,973 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a 22-year-old single male and a foreign worker from Poland, residing in Munich for the past four years. I have one dependent—my younger cousin—who lives with me.

Previously, I worked as an administrative clerk at the Munich City Hall for 7 years, but I was recently laid off due to departmental downsizing. I am currently unemployed but am actively searching for new opportunities in the city administration sector. During my employment, I established a solid credit history, including one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid on time.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are both under 100 DM, largely due to my recent unemployment and the financial support I provide for my cousin. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I live rent-free in my aunt’s house, which allows me to keep my expenses minimal.

Having a new car will significantly improve my chances of finding new employment, as it will allow me to attend interviews and expand my job search radius. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,
Jakub Nowak

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,973 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am a 22-year-old single male with one dependent—my younger brother. I have been living at my current address for four years and, until last month, worked as a technical support specialist at Siemens AG for 8 years.

Unfortunately, I was recently laid off due to company restructuring. My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking and savings accounts both below 100 DM. Despite this, I have maintained a spotless credit history, including one ongoing loan with your bank, which I have always paid on time.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I live rent-free in my parents' apartment, which helps me manage my expenses while I seek new employment.

A new car is essential for me to commute to potential job opportunities, especially as many positions are outside the city center. I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on time, as my past record demonstrates.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Best regards,
Alex Müller

Letter 4

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 3,973 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my job search and family responsibilities. I am a 22-year-old single man and a foreign worker from Turkey, residing in Germany for the past four years. I have one dependent—my younger sister, who lives with me.

I was previously employed as a junior engineer at Bosch GmbH for 8 years, but due to recent layoffs, I am now unemployed. My current financial situation is challenging, with less than 100 DM in both my checking and savings accounts. However, I have always paid my existing credit at your bank on time and have no other debts or installment plans.

I live rent-free in my cousin's flat, which allows me to minimize my expenses and focus on supporting my sister. The new car will provide essential mobility for job interviews and daily responsibilities. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as evidenced by my strong credit history.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Emre Yildiz

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,973 DM to buy a new car. I am a 22-year-old single male living in Stuttgart for the past four years, supporting my younger brother. Until recently, I worked as an office administrator at Deutsche Post for 8 years, but was laid off due to restructuring.

My checking and savings accounts are both under 100 DM, as I have been the sole provider for my brother. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always repaid diligently and on schedule. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I am currently living rent-free in my grandmother’s apartment, which reduces my monthly expenses.

Having a reliable car is crucial for me to broaden my job search and fulfill family obligations. My past record with your bank proves my trustworthiness as a borrower. I am committed to meeting the monthly installment payments and look forward to your positive response.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Ivan Petrov
