Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 518 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a 29-year-old scientific research assistant at the local university, where I have been employed for the past 2 years. As a divorced mother of one, I recently relocated to Germany and have been residing at my current address for just over a year. Although I do not yet have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a small balance and have always paid back my previous credits on time.

I own my apartment and have no other debts or installment plans. My job provides stable income, and my commitment to financial responsibility is demonstrated by my clean credit history. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments, as the requested amount is modest and well within my budget.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs
