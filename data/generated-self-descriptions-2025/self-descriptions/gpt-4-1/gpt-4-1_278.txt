Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Meyer, and I am applying for a loan of 2,404 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my household. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Stuttgart Technical University, where I have worked for the past 2 years and 3 months. My employment is stable and provides me with a regular monthly income.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly, despite having a critical credit history due to a previous loan with another institution. I have no guarantors or co-debtors, and I live independently, having resided at my current address for 2 years. I also own a reliable car, which is my main property.

I am a divorced woman supporting myself. My savings are modest, but I am diligent in meeting my financial obligations, including my existing installment plans. I am confident that my stable employment and responsible attitude make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my request further.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Meyer
