Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dieter Klein, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,103 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the local university, a position I have held for the past 10 months. My wife and I, along with our teenage son, have been living in our current residence for three years, and we are fortunate that our housing is provided free of charge through my employer.

Although I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I have managed my finances responsibly despite supporting my family on a single income. I have three existing credits at your bank, all of which I have serviced regularly. My credit history includes a critical account at another institution, but I have learned from that experience and have kept up with all recent obligations.

As a skilled employee with 8 years of prior work experience and a stable job, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3. I am committed to improving my family's quality of life and see this purchase as a step forward. My reliability is reflected in my employment record and my consistent communication—my telephone is always available for any queries.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling all repayment obligations.

Sincerely,  
Dieter Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,103 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new radio and television. My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am a 47-year-old married man, working as a postal service official for the past nine months. My family and I have been residents at our current address for three years, and we are grateful to have housing provided at no cost.

While my current financial resources are limited, with savings under 100 DM and no checking account, I have maintained three credits at your bank, all of which are in good standing. My credit history elsewhere has had its challenges, but I have always ensured that my debts are repaid. I am the sole provider for my wife and our daughter, and I take my financial commitments very seriously.

I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors. My stable employment and free housing allow me to dedicate my income to loan repayments. I am registered as a foreign worker, and my employer can confirm my reliability and work ethic.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am committed to repaying this loan in a timely manner and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Tomasz Nowak

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Mehmet Yildiz, and I am applying for a loan of 5,103 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my family. I am a married man, aged 47, with one dependent. I am currently employed as an administrative clerk at the city council, a position I have held for 11 months.

Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are minimal, I have three existing loans with your bank that I have managed responsibly. My previous credit history at another bank includes a critical account, but I have taken steps to improve my financial management and have maintained regular payments since then.

My family and I have lived in our current home for three years, and our housing is provided by my employer. I have no property or other installment plans, and my only dependent is my son, who is currently in school. My telephone is registered in my name, and I am always available for contact.

I am confident that my stable employment and careful budgeting will allow me to meet the installment rate of 3. I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my commitment to meeting all repayment obligations.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yildiz

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,103 DM to purchase a radio and television for my household. My name is Jürgen Schneider, and I have been working as a technical supervisor at an electronics manufacturing company for the past eight months. I am married, 47 years old, and have one dependent child.

My current financial situation is stable, although I do not have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM. I have three existing credits at your bank, all of which are being paid on schedule. I have had a critical account at another bank in the past, but I have since taken control of my finances and have had no issues with repayments.

We have lived in our current home for three years, and our housing is provided free of charge as part of my employment benefits. I do not have any property or additional installment plans. My telephone is always available should you need to contact me.

I believe my consistent employment, responsible debt management, and commitment to my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Jürgen Schneider

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Ivan Petrovic, and I am a 47-year-old married man with one child. I have been working as a skilled machinist at a local factory for the past year. I am seeking a loan of 5,103 DM to purchase a radio and television for my family, as our current devices are no longer functional.

While I do not possess a checking account and my savings are less than 100 DM, I have three active credits with your bank, all of which I have managed without issue. My credit history includes a critical account with another institution, but I have learned from past mistakes and have demonstrated reliability with my recent repayments.

We have resided at our current address for three years, and our housing is provided for free by my employer. I have no property, no other installment plans, and no guarantors. My telephone is registered in my name for easy contact.

I am confident that my current employment and free housing enable me to meet the proposed installment rate. Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my dedication to meeting all financial obligations.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic
