Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 1,977 DM to support my enrollment in a distance-learning MBA program at the University of Mannheim. I am currently employed as a Senior Project Manager at Siemens AG, where I have worked for the past eight years. My employment is secure, and I have always met my financial obligations, including the prompt repayment of an earlier credit at your bank.

My current financial situation is somewhat strained, as my checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to unexpected medical expenses for my dependent son. I do not have a savings account, but I own my residence and have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. I am single and solely responsible for my son.

I am committed to furthering my education to advance my career and increase my earning potential. I am a trustworthy candidate, as demonstrated by my stable employment, responsible repayment history, and clear motivation for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Müller, and I am requesting a loan of 1,977 DM to cover tuition fees for a Data Science certification at the Technical University of Munich. I have been self-employed as an IT consultant for seven years, with a stable client base and consistent income. I have always repaid my previous credit with your bank on time.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn due to recent investments in my business, and I do not have a savings account. I own my home and have no other loans or financial commitments. I am 40 years old, single, and support one dependent—my nephew, whom I have cared for since my brother passed away.

I am eager to invest in my education to remain competitive in my field. My financial discipline and long-term employment record make me a reliable borrower. I appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jens Müller
