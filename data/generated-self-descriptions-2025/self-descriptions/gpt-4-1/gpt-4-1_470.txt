Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,764 DM to expand my small catering business, "Taste of Home." I am a 34-year-old married woman, originally from Hungary, and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past three years. 

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with less than 100 DM due to investing most of my earnings into my business. While I did experience a delay in settling a previous credit two years ago, I have since learned the importance of timely payments and have managed my finances responsibly since then.

I have lived at my current address for two years and own a small car, which I use for my business deliveries. I do not have any other outstanding debts or guarantors. My monthly installment rate is manageable at 2, and I am confident in my ability to meet repayment obligations due to my stable employment and growing business income.

As a skilled professional and a dedicated entrepreneur, I am committed to the success of my business and the timely repayment of this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrescu, and I am seeking a loan of 2,764 DM to purchase new equipment for my tailoring business, which I started after moving to Germany from Romania three years ago. I am a 37-year-old divorced woman and have been working as an official at the local municipal office since my arrival.

Despite not having a checking account, I have managed my finances through a savings account, although my savings are currently under 100 DM due to recent investments in my business. I acknowledge a past delay in credit repayment, which was a result of unforeseen medical expenses, but since then I have maintained a clean financial record.

I have resided at my current address for two years and own a reliable car, which is essential for my business operations. I do not have any other debt obligations and have always handled my installment payments responsibly.

As a skilled employee with a steady job and a clear business plan, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I am grateful for your consideration and hope to receive your support to help my business thrive.

Best regards,
Elena Petrescu

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,764 DM to help launch my own language tutoring service. My name is Sofia Almeida, I am a 29-year-old married woman from Portugal, and I have been employed as a skilled employee at a local electronics firm for the past two years.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, and my savings are less than 100 DM, as I have been supporting my family and saving for my business. I admit I had a delay in paying off a previous credit three years ago, which was due to a temporary job loss, but I have since regained stable employment and improved my financial management.

I have lived at my current address for two years and own a small car. I have no other debts or financial obligations, and my monthly installment rate is well within my means. I am the sole applicant and have no guarantors.

With my steady job and commitment to building a successful business, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Sofia Almeida

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Amina Hassan, a 33-year-old separated woman from Morocco, currently working as an official in a local government office for just over three years. I am seeking a loan of 2,764 DM to further develop my online handicrafts business.

I have not yet opened a checking account, and my savings are minimal at under 100 DM, as most of my income is reinvested in my business. I did have a payment delay on a previous credit due to a family emergency, but I have since taken steps to ensure timely payments and improved financial discipline.

I have lived at my present address for two years and own a car, which is used for business purposes. I do not have any other debts, and my installment rate is only 2, which I can comfortably manage given my stable employment.

As a skilled professional and dedicated business owner, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I appreciate your consideration and hope to receive your support.

Yours faithfully,
Amina Hassan
