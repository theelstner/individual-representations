Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 2,569 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for 2 years and 7 months. My employment is stable, and I have no dependents.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained a savings account with a balance of 700 DM. My credit history is solid; I have taken out two previous credits for educational expenses and paid them back in full and on time. I have resided at my current address in Munich for 4 years, and I am single with no guarantors or co-signers.

The car is essential for my daily commute to work and field research activities, as public transport is not always reliable in my area. My current housing situation is temporary, and I am working towards more permanent accommodation. I have no other outstanding debts, and my installment plan for this loan would fit comfortably within my monthly budget.

I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule and assure you of my reliability and responsibility. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Martin Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Daniel Fischer, and I am requesting a loan of 2,569 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am a single male, 29 years old, working as a certified IT systems administrator for the past 3 years and 2 months at Siemens AG. I have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility, with a record of successfully repaying previous credits on time.

Currently, I have a savings balance of 800 DM, but I do not have a checking account at your institution. I have lived at my current address in Hamburg for 4 years, and I have no dependents or guarantors. My job provides a steady income, and I am confident that I can comfortably manage the proposed installment rate of 4% over the next 24 months.

The car will be used primarily for commuting to work and visiting my family, who live in a nearby town. Reliable transportation is crucial for my continued employment and personal responsibilities. I have no other installment plans, and I own a small motorcycle, which I intend to sell to help cover additional costs.

I believe my stable employment and proven credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Daniel Fischer

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,569 DM to purchase a used vehicle. My name is Jonas Bauer, and I am a single, 32-year-old male employed as a municipal building inspector for the City of Stuttgart for the past 3 years and 10 months.

I have a savings account with a balance of 950 DM, but no checking account at your bank. I have a solid history of repaying previous loans without issue, and currently, I have no outstanding debts or other installment plans. I have resided at my current address for 4 years, and I do not have any dependents or guarantors.

Reliable transportation is essential for my job, as I frequently travel between different sites. My current car is no longer dependable, and purchasing a used vehicle will enable me to continue fulfilling my professional obligations efficiently. My employment is secure, and my monthly income is sufficient to cover the proposed installment payments.

I am committed to meeting all loan obligations and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,
Jonas Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Lukas Hoffmann, and I am seeking a loan of 2,569 DM to purchase a used car. I am a single, 28-year-old male, and I work as an official in the Federal Employment Office, a position I have held for 2 years and 5 months. My employment is stable, and my monthly income is reliable.

I have a savings account with 600 DM, but I do not currently have a checking account. I have previously taken out a small loan for home electronics, which I repaid in full and on time. I have lived at my present address in Leipzig for 4 years, and I do not have any dependents or co-signers.

The used car will enable me to travel to work and visit my elderly parents, who live in a rural area with limited public transportation. I have no other installment plans or significant debts, and I own a scooter, which I plan to sell to help finance the car purchase.

Given my stable job, responsible credit history, and clear need for the loan, I believe I am a suitable candidate. Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
Lukas Hoffmann
