Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Ingrid Keller, and I am applying for a loan of 3,622 DM to furnish my new home office and living room. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My financial situation is stable; I have a savings account with a balance of 1,500 DM and no outstanding debts except for two small credits at your bank, both of which I have paid back reliably and on time.

As a divorced woman with a 17-year-old daughter, I am committed to providing a comfortable and productive environment for my family and work. My current residence of 4 years is rented, and I have a life insurance policy as additional security. I have always managed my finances responsibly, as reflected in my spotless credit history.

I assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments without issue. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Ingrid Keller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,622 DM to purchase new kitchen appliances and furniture for my apartment. My name is Monika Schreiber, and I have been employed as an administrative official at the City Planning Office for 9 years. My checking account is currently slightly overdrawn, but I maintain a savings account with 2,000 DM and have a building society savings agreement in place.

I am married with one dependent son, and we have lived in our current rented residence for four years. I have two previous credits with your bank, both of which I have repaid fully and on schedule. I have no other debts or installment plans.

Given my stable employment, consistent payment history, and existing financial reserves, I am confident in my ability to repay the requested loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Monika Schreiber
