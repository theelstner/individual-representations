Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,454 DM to purchase new radio and television equipment for my home. I am a 34-year-old divorced woman and have been working as a laboratory research assistant at Bayer AG for the past 2 years. My employment is stable, and I am dedicated to my career.

Although I have experienced a payment delay in the past, I have learned from that experience and have taken steps to improve my financial management. Currently, I own my own apartment in Düsseldorf, which provides me with security and stability. I have one dependent, my 8-year-old daughter, whom I fully support.

While I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I am committed to meeting my financial obligations. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing now. I believe my steady employment, real estate ownership, and strong motivation to provide a comfortable home for my daughter make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Ivanova, and I am a 34-year-old married woman working as a customs official at the Port of Hamburg for the past three years. I am applying for a loan of 4,454 DM to upgrade our home’s radio and television system, which will greatly enhance our family’s quality of life.

I acknowledge that I had a delay in paying off a previous loan, but I have since resolved the issue and have been punctual with all my payments. I do not have a checking account, and my savings are limited, but my job as a skilled official provides me with a regular income.

I own my home and have lived at my current address for four years. My husband and I have one child, and we are committed to providing a stable and enriching environment. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not relying on any guarantors.

As a responsible homeowner and official, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Maria Ivanova
