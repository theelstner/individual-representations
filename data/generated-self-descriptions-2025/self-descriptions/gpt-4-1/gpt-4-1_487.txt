Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,209 DM for the purchase of a new car. My name is Thomas Becker, and I am a 47-year-old single father residing at my current address for the past four years. I previously worked as a project manager in an engineering firm for eight years, but unfortunately, I have been unemployed for the last six months due to company downsizing.

Currently, my checking account balance is under 200 DM and my savings are below 100 DM, as I have been supporting my teenage son during this period. Although I have experienced a delay in paying off a previous loan, I have since taken steps to manage my finances more responsibly, including setting up a building society savings agreement for the future.

I own my home and have no other installment plans or debts. I am committed to restoring my financial stability and believe that acquiring a reliable car will significantly improve my job prospects. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and appreciate your consideration.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Jens Müller, a 47-year-old single male with one dependent, and I am seeking a loan of 1,209 DM to purchase a new vehicle. After twelve years as a senior scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, I was laid off due to budget cuts and have been unemployed for six months.

My financial situation is currently strained; my checking and savings accounts are both below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively. I do have a life insurance policy in place and own my residence, which provides some security. While I have had a late payment in my credit history, I have always fulfilled my obligations and currently maintain only one existing loan with your bank.

With a new car, I would have greater mobility to attend interviews and potentially take up freelance consulting work. I am fully committed to regaining stable employment and meeting all repayment requirements.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Kind regards,
Jens Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Andreas Schulz, age 47, a single father with one child. I am applying for a loan of 1,209 DM to buy a new car. I have lived at my current address for four years and own my home. I was self-employed as a graphic design consultant for over ten years, but due to a downturn in contracts, I have been unemployed for the past half-year.

My financial resources are currently limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and less than 100 DM in savings. I have a building society savings agreement as part of my financial planning. While I have previously had a delay in loan repayment, I have since worked diligently to improve my financial discipline.

I have one existing credit with your bank and no other installment plans or debts. I am confident that, with a new car, I can accept more freelance opportunities and stabilize my income, ensuring timely repayments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Andreas Schulz
