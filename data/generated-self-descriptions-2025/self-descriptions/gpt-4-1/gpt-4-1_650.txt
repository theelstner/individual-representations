Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 947 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years. My net monthly salary has been regularly deposited into my checking account for over a year, and my balance is consistently above 200 DM.

As a foreign worker living in Germany for the last 3 years, I have worked diligently to build a solid financial reputation. I have already taken out one loan with your bank in the past, which I have paid back on time without any issues. I have no other debts, and I do not own property. My savings are limited, but I have always managed my finances responsibly.

With two dependents, reliable transportation is essential for both work and family responsibilities. I am single and live rent-free, which allows me to manage my expenses efficiently. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 4 as proposed.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling all obligations and maintaining my trustworthy relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Ahmed Mansouri, a 38-year-old single man currently working as a technical supervisor at Siemens, where I have been employed for nearly 6 years. I am applying for a 947 DM loan to buy a new car, as my current commute has become unreliable and affects my ability to support my two children.

For the past three years, I have resided in Munich, living with a relative rent-free. I have maintained a checking account at your bank with regular salary deposits exceeding 200 DM for the last year. I have a previous loan with your bank, which I paid back in full and on time. My savings are below 100 DM, but I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations.

I have no other outstanding debts, and I do not own property. My stable job and careful budgeting assure you of my ability to repay this loan. As a foreign worker, I value the trust your institution has placed in me and hope to continue our positive relationship.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Mansouri

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Marek Nowak, and I am seeking a loan of 947 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my work as a logistics coordinator at DHL. I have been with the company for 4 years and have two children who depend on me. I am single and have lived at my current address for three years, with no rent obligations.
