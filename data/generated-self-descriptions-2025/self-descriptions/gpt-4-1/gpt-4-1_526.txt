Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,113 DM to purchase a new television for my family. As a 26-year-old divorced woman, I currently work as a housekeeping staff member at the Grand City Hotel, where I have been employed for just over two years. My financial situation is stable, although my checking and savings accounts are modest, with less than 200 DM and 100 DM respectively.

Despite my limited income, I have always met my financial obligations. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back on time without any issues. I am fortunate to own a small apartment and some real estate, and I have lived at my current address for four years. I do not have any other installment plans, and my only dependents are my two young children.

A guarantor, my sister, has kindly agreed to support my application. I believe my history of reliability and my commitment to my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Anna Kowalska

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,113 DM to replace our broken radio and television set, which are essential for my children’s education and our connection to our home country. I am a 26-year-old married woman and have been working as a janitorial assistant at the Riverside Community School for three years. My husband and I recently moved into our own apartment, which we own, and we have lived here for four years.

Although my account balances are modest, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have one existing loan with your bank and have never missed a payment. My real estate property and the support of my cousin, who will act as guarantor, further strengthen my application.

I am the sole provider for my two children, and I have no other outstanding debts. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment plan and would greatly appreciate your support.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Elena Petrova
