Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Schneider, and I am applying for a loan of 2,247 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Frankfurt Institute for Technology, where I have been working for three years. My monthly salary has been consistently paid into my checking account for over a year, and my current account balance is always maintained above 200 DM.

I am divorced and have one dependent child. I have been living in my current apartment above my family’s small grocery store for the past two years. While I did experience a delay in paying off a previous loan due to unexpected medical expenses, I have since ensured all my financial obligations are met on time. I do not have any other debts or guarantors.

I am seeking this loan to purchase a reliable vehicle, which is essential for commuting to work and managing family responsibilities. My current savings are below 100 DM, but I have a steady income and a secure job contract. I am confident that my stable employment and responsible attitude make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Fatima Yilmaz, and I am requesting a loan of 2,247 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for nearly two years and have maintained regular salary assignments to my checking account, which always holds more than 200 DM.

As a married woman with two children, I rely on public transportation, which is often unreliable for my early and late shifts. A car would greatly improve my punctuality and ability to balance work and family life. My current savings are limited, under 100 DM, as I have prioritized covering my children’s needs.

I acknowledge a past delay in repaying a previous installment plan, which was due to an unexpected family emergency. I have since rectified the situation and am committed to maintaining a positive credit record. I have no other debts and no guarantors.

My consistent employment, responsible financial behavior since my past setback, and commitment to my family and job make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Fatima Yilmaz

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Elena Petrescu. I am applying for a 2,247 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is crucial for my work as an IT support specialist at a mid-sized company in Stuttgart. I have been with the company for just over a year and receive my salary directly to my account each month, which I maintain with a minimum balance above 200 DM.

I am separated with no dependents, living for two years in a rented apartment above a retail store. My financial situation is stable, though my savings are less than 100 DM due to recent moving expenses. I do not have any co-signers or other debts.

Previously, I experienced a delay in paying off a credit card due to job relocation costs, but I have since managed my finances prudently and have had no further issues. My job is secure, and I have a permanent contract.

I am confident that my stable employment and improved financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Elena Petrescu

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Maria Rossi, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,247 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am currently a skilled employee working as a logistics coordinator at a warehouse in Munich, where I have been employed for two and a half years. My salary has been directly deposited into my checking account, which always exceeds 200 DM, for over a year.

I am married with one child and have lived at my current residence for two years. I do not have any other debts or co-signers. My savings are currently below 100 DM, as I have recently invested in my child’s education.

There was a delay in paying off a previous small loan after my husband lost his job, but we have since stabilized our finances and repaid all outstanding amounts. I am now in a much stronger financial position and have a permanent contract.

I am diligent and reliable, and I believe my employment history and commitment to meeting my obligations make me a suitable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Rossi

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Sofia Ivanova. I am a divorced mother of two working as a certified nurse at the Berlin Community Hospital for the past three years. I am applying for a loan of 2,247 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my late and early shifts and for transporting my children.

My checking account has received regular salary assignments for the past year and always maintains a balance above 200 DM. Unfortunately, my savings are less than 100 DM, as I have prioritized my children’s expenses and household needs.

I did have a delayed payment on a previous installment plan last year due to an unexpected medical bill, but I have since ensured all my payments are timely. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I live in an apartment above a small store, where I have resided for two years.

With stable employment, a reliable income, and renewed commitment to my financial responsibilities, I am confident I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Yours sincerely,  
Sofia Ivanova
