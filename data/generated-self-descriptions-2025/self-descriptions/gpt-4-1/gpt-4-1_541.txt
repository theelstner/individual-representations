Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 3,049 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been a resident of Munich for one year, and I have maintained a checking account with your bank for over a year with a steady salary assignment. My employment as a resident housekeeper at the Sonnenhof Retirement Home began nine months ago, and while I am relatively new in this position, my supervisors can attest to my reliability and work ethic.

Previously, I successfully repaid a personal loan with your bank, and I have always met my financial obligations on time. I am divorced and have one dependent daughter. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable and comfortable life for my family in Germany. My savings are currently below 100 DM, but I have a life insurance policy as an additional asset.

I am requesting this loan to buy furniture and necessary equipment for our home, as we recently moved and most of our belongings remained in Bulgaria. I am confident in my ability to make the monthly installment payments, as I have managed a similar plan through a local store without any issues. I have no other debts or guarantors.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Sanchez, and I am writing to request a loan of 3,049 DM to furnish my apartment and purchase basic household equipment. I have been employed for ten months as a resident cleaner at the Bayerischer Hof Hotel. Though I have been in my current role for less than a year, I have consistently received positive performance reviews and have a reliable income.

I am married with one child, and we recently moved into our own apartment after years of shared housing. My checking account has had salary assignments for over a year, and I have a good credit record, with all previous loans paid back on time. I also have a building society savings agreement as my main financial asset.

While I do not have significant savings at the moment, I am diligent in managing my finances. I have one ongoing installment plan with a furniture store, which I am paying off as agreed. I have no other debts or guarantors.

I am confident that I can meet the monthly payments for this loan and would appreciate your support in helping my family settle comfortably in our new home.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Sanchez
