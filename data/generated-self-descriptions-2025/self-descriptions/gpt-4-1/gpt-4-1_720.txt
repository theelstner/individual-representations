Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,148 DM to purchase a new television and radio. My name is Ahmed K., a 29-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for 3 years. I am a single, foreign worker from Turkey and have resided at my current address in Munich for just over 2 years.

My monthly salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account for the past year, with a current balance always exceeding 200 DM. Although I have an existing installment plan for a laptop purchased last year, I have managed my payments reliably and on time, despite having a critical account history due to a late payment two years ago (which has since been resolved).

I have no guarantors or dependents and own a second-hand Volkswagen Golf, which I rely on for commuting to work. I am confident in my ability to manage the new loan, as my financial situation has stabilized, and my current employment is secure. I am committed to meeting all repayment terms.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed K.

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Piotr Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 3,148 DM to purchase a television and radio for my apartment. I have been working as a customs officer at the Frankfurt Airport for the past 2 years and have lived at my current address for the same duration. I am a 33-year-old single male from Poland, working in Germany as a foreign employee.

My checking account at your bank has consistently received my monthly salary for the past year, and my balance is always above 200 DM. I currently have a car loan with another bank, which I am repaying regularly without issue. While my credit history includes a critical account due to a missed payment during a job transition last year, I have since maintained a perfect record.

I have no other debts or dependents, and I do not own property apart from my car. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate of 3, as my job is stable and my income is sufficient to cover my expenses.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Best regards,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Banking Team,

I am submitting this letter to support my application for a 3,148 DM loan, which I intend to use to purchase a new radio and television set. My name is Jean-Paul M., and I am a single, 30-year-old foreign worker from France, currently employed as a skilled machinist at Siemens AG in Nuremberg for the past 2.5 years.

I have maintained my checking account with a regular salary assignment for over a year, with a balance consistently above 200 DM. My credit history is marked as critical due to a previous credit card debt, which I am currently paying off through another bank, with no missed payments in the last 12 months.

I have lived at my present address for 2 years and own a used Opel Astra. I have no dependents, no other installment plans except for my existing credit, and no property apart from my car. My monthly income and financial discipline enable me to comfortably manage the proposed installment rate.

I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling all obligations related to this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jean-Paul M.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to apply for a loan of 3,148 DM to purchase a new television and radio. My name is Ivan Petrov, a 28-year-old single male from Bulgaria, working as a skilled electrical technician at Bosch for the last 3 years. I have resided at my current address in Stuttgart for just over 2 years.

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Miguel Santos, and I am seeking a loan of 3,148 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my apartment. I am a 32-year-old single male from Portugal, employed as an official in the city administration of Düsseldorf for the past 1 year and 8 months.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos
