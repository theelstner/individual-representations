Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Natalia Ivanova, and I am applying for a loan of 409 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for just over two years. I have maintained a steady salary, which is assigned to my checking account at your bank for the past year.

I am a divorced woman with one child, living in rented accommodation for the past three years. Despite my responsibilities as a single parent, I have managed my finances carefully. I have a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,200 DM and own a small piece of real estate in my home country, which provides additional financial security.

I have previously taken two loans from your bank, both of which I repaid on schedule and in full. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not supported by any guarantors. My installment rate of 3 is manageable within my monthly budget.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life for myself and my daughter in Germany. I hope you will consider my application favorably, as I have demonstrated reliability and financial responsibility.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Natalia Ivanova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Fernandez, and I am writing to request a loan of 409 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television set. I am a married woman, 42 years old, and have been employed as a customs official at the Frankfurt Airport for three years.

My checking account at your bank has consistently maintained a balance above 200 DM, with my salary being directly deposited for over a year. I also have a savings bond with a value of 1,500 DM, reflecting my prudent approach to financial planning.

I have taken two credits previously from your institution, both of which were repaid punctually. I have no other loans or financial obligations, and I do not require a guarantor. I live with my husband and our child in a rented apartment, and we have resided here for three years.

As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to my job and to providing for my family. My track record with your bank shows my trustworthiness, and I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Maria Fernandez
