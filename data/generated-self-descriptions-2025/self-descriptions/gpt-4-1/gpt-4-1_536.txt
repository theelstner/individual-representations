Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Mark Jensen and I am applying for a loan of $3,105 to purchase a new television and radio system for my home. I have recently started working as a scientific research assistant at the City Science Institute, where I have been employed for 10 months. Though my employment is less than a year, I have demonstrated reliability and skill in my field, and my contract has just been renewed for another year.

I currently do not have a checking or savings account, but I have a solid credit history with previous credits fully paid back on time. I live alone and have no dependents or guarantors, and I have resided at my current address for two years. I do not own property, but I do have a car which I use for commuting to work.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4, as my monthly income is stable and sufficient for my expenses. I have no other ongoing installment plans except for a small monthly payment for a laptop, which will be completed in 25 months. My reliable payment history and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Mark Jensen
