Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,924 DM to purchase new furniture and essential equipment for my apartment. I am currently employed as a laboratory research assistant at Bayer AG, having started my position nine months ago. My financial situation is stable, with a checking account balance that fluctuates between 0 and 200 DM. I do not have any savings accounts or bonds at this time.

I am a 27-year-old divorced woman living with my six-year-old daughter in a rented apartment, where we have resided for the past three years. I have always paid my existing credits back on time, including the current credit I have with your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans.

Although I have only been in my current job for less than a year, I own a small real estate property in my home country, which adds to my financial stability. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a secure future for my daughter and myself. I believe my consistent credit history and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,924 DM to purchase new equipment for my home, which is necessary for my work as a junior administrative officer at the local municipal office. I began this job ten months ago and am adjusting well to the responsibilities. My current account balance is modest, usually under 200 DM, and I do not have a savings account.

As a married woman with a four-year-old son, I have lived in my current rented residence for three years. My credit history is positive, with all previous loans repaid on time, including the one I currently hold with your bank. I do not have any other debts or installment plans.

Though I am relatively new to my current position, I own a small apartment in Romania, which provides me with some security. I am a foreign worker and take my financial obligations seriously. My record of timely repayments and stable employment make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
Ana Ionescu
