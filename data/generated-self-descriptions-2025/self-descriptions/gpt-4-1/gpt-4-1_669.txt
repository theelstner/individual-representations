Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Petrova, and I am applying for a business loan of 3,609 DM to support the expansion of my small bakery, “Sweet Moments,” which I opened two years ago in the city center. As a scientific research assistant at the local university, I have developed strong analytical and management skills that I have successfully transferred to my business operations.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have a proven track record of responsible borrowing, having paid back my previous loan with your institution on time and in full. My financial situation is stable, with my primary income coming from both my employment and the bakery, and I own a small apartment in the area. Currently, my savings are limited to less than 100 DM, as most of my resources are invested in my business and family, including supporting my young son.

As a divorced woman and a foreign worker, I am committed to building a secure future for my family and contributing positively to the community. I have no other outstanding debts, and my only installment plan is for necessary store purchases. I am confident that with this loan, I can upgrade my bakery’s equipment and increase production to meet growing demand.

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to provide any further information you require and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Gabriela Schmidt, and I am writing to request a business loan of 3,609 DM for my freelance graphic design studio, which I established 18 months ago. As a senior administrative officer at the city hall for the past three years, I have demonstrated reliability, responsibility, and attention to detail in all my professional activities.

Although I do not currently have a checking account at your bank, I previously held a small business loan with you, which I repaid in full and on schedule. I have limited savings at this time because I have invested most of my funds into purchasing real estate, which I now own. My only dependent is my daughter, whom I support independently.

I have no guarantors or other outstanding debts, and my only installment plan is a small one with a local electronics store. I believe my experience as a married woman balancing work, business, and family, combined with my stable residence and employment, makes me a reliable candidate for this loan. The funds will be used to upgrade my studio equipment, enabling me to take on larger, higher-paying projects.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am happy to provide any additional documentation you may need.

Best regards,  
Gabriela Schmidt

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Lucia Fernandez, and I am seeking a business loan of 3,609 DM to expand my home-based tailoring business. I have been working as a skilled textile technician for the past two years and am also a foreign worker, striving to build a better life for myself and my young child.

Though I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained an excellent credit history, having repaid my previous loan from your institution promptly and without issue. My current savings are under 100 DM, as most of my earnings have gone into supporting my family and maintaining our home, which I own.

I am currently separated and have no other debts or guarantors. My only other installment plan is with a local furniture store. I have lived at my current address for just over a year, and my stable employment and property ownership demonstrate my commitment to financial responsibility.

This loan will allow me to purchase advanced sewing equipment and materials to meet increased customer demand. I am confident that my dedication and careful financial management make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Sincerely,  
Lucia Fernandez
