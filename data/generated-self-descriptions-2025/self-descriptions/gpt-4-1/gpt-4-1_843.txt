Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,993 DM to purchase a used car. As a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 2 years and 3 months, I rely heavily on personal transportation to reach my workplace, especially as public transit options are limited in my area.

Although I have experienced some delays in paying off credit in the past, I have since taken steps to better manage my finances. My current financial situation is modest—my savings are below 100 DM—but I am committed to meeting my obligations. I am single, 28 years old, and have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I support.

I own my home, and my only other installment plans are with local stores for household goods. I have been living at my current address for 2 years and have no other guarantors or co-debtors. As a foreign worker, I am eager to continue building my life here and improve my credit standing.

Despite my past, I am dedicated to repaying my debts on time and believe this car will significantly improve my employment stability. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,993 DM to purchase a used vehicle, which is essential for my job as a night-shift janitor at the City Hospital, a position I have held for 3 years. My current employment is stable, and I am working hard to provide for my son, who lives with me.

I acknowledge that I have had delays in repaying previous credits, but I have learned from these experiences and am now more disciplined with my finances. My savings are minimal, but I do own a small apartment, which gives me some financial security.

I have two active credits with your bank, both of which are being paid regularly according to the agreed installment rate. I have no other significant debts, apart from some minor store credit. I am single and have lived at my present address for 2 years.

As someone who has worked hard to overcome financial challenges and as a property owner, I am confident in my ability to fulfill the repayment terms. Thank you for considering my request.

Yours faithfully,  
Khalid Rahmani

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 2,993 DM to purchase a used car. My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I have been working as a porter at the Central Railway Station for 1 year and 8 months. My job requires early and late shifts, and reliable transportation is crucial for my continued employment.

I am 28 years old, single, and support my younger sister. I own my apartment, which I purchased last year, and have been a resident at my current address for 2 years. My savings are under 100 DM, but I have no other outstanding debts except for two small credits at your bank and a store installment plan for furniture.

Although I had some payment delays in the past, I have since prioritized my financial responsibilities and have kept up with all recent payments. I am a foreign worker, striving to build a stable future here.

I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,993 DM to buy a used car. I have been employed as a kitchen assistant at Gasthaus Linden for 2 years and 5 months. My work schedule often requires late hours, and public transportation is not always available, making a car essential for me.

I admit to having had delays in the past with repayments, but I have taken measures to improve my budgeting and financial planning. I have no other debts or guarantors and am committed to meeting my obligations.

As a property owner and a dedicated employee, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos
