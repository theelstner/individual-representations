Letter 1: Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1337 DM to purchase a new television. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for the past 8 months. My checking account has consistently maintained a balance of over 200 DM, with my salary being deposited regularly for more than a year.

I am single, have no dependents, and have been living at my current address for two years. I have never taken out a loan before, and I have no outstanding debts or guarantors. My only property is my car, which I use for commuting to work. Although I have limited savings (less than 100 DM), I have always managed my finances responsibly.

As a foreign worker in Germany, I am committed to building my life and career here. I believe that my stable employment, good credit history, and regular income make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic
