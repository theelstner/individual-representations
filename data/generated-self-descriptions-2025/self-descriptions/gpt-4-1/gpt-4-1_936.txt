Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,498 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my apartment. My name is Anna Becker, and I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 3 years. I am currently married and have been living at my present address in Munich for just over a year.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a proven record of meeting my financial obligations, with all previous credits paid back on time. My monthly salary provides me with a stable income, but due to recent unexpected expenses, my savings are below 100 DM at the moment.

I have no other outstanding debts, and I am the sole applicant for this loan. I own a car, which adds to my financial security. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments without difficulty, and I am committed to maintaining my trustworthy financial record.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Meier, and I am applying for a loan of 1,498 DM to replace my old radio and television, which are no longer functioning reliably. I am a divorced mother working as a certified accountant at a local firm, a position I have held for 2 years.

Currently, I am living in a rented apartment, and I have been at my present residence in Hamburg for a little over a year. My financial situation is stable, as I have always repaid my previous credits on schedule, but my checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent relocation costs. My savings are minimal at present, but I own a small car.

I have no guarantors or co-signers, and I am responsible for my own finances. I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments, as my monthly income is reliable and my expenses are well-controlled.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Claudia Meier

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,498 DM in order to purchase a new radio and television for my home. My name is Elke Schneider, a married woman currently employed as a senior laboratory technician at Siemens AG for the past 3.5 years.

I have always honored my financial commitments and have repaid all previous credits promptly. Despite my current checking account balance being below zero, this is a temporary setback caused by recent medical expenses for my husband. My savings account is currently under 100 DM, but my regular income and the car I own provide me with ongoing financial stability.

I have no other installment plans except for one small furniture purchase, and no other debts or guarantors. I have lived at my current address in Frankfurt for just over a year.

I am confident that I am a reliable candidate for this loan, and I assure you of my commitment to timely repayment.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Elke Schneider

Dear Bank Manager,

I am submitting this letter to support my application for a 1,498 DM loan, which I intend to use to purchase a modern radio and television for my home. My name is Petra Vogel, and I have been working as a government administrative officer for 2 years.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a solid history of repaying all previous credits on time. I have no guarantors or co-applicants, and I manage my finances independently. My savings account currently holds less than 100 DM due to a recent car repair, but I am otherwise financially stable.

I have resided at my current address in Stuttgart for a little over a year, and I own my own car. My regular salary ensures I can meet the required installment payments, and I am committed to fulfilling all obligations associated with this loan.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I look forward to your favorable response.

Kind regards,  
Petra Vogel
