To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Daniel Weber, and I am applying for a business loan of 7,409 euros. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at BioGen Solutions for the past 8 years. I am seeking this loan to expand my freelance consulting business in biotechnology, which has gained significant traction in the last year.

While I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have a strong credit record and have always repaid my previous loans on time, including two existing credits at your bank. My income from both employment and consulting is stable, and I own my apartment, which provides additional financial security.

As a single father of one, I am committed to building a better future for my child. I am diligent, responsible, and have managed all my financial obligations without issue. I believe my consistent employment history and excellent credit record make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Weber
