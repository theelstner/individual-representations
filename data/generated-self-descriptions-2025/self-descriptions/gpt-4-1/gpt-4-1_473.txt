Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for an educational loan of 448 DM. My name is Maria Ivanova, and I am a 23-year-old divorced woman, currently working as a laboratory research assistant at the Max Planck Institute. I have been employed for 8 months and have been residing at my current address for the past four years. My financial situation is challenging at the moment, as my checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have always paid back my previous credit at your bank on time and in full, and I have no outstanding debts or other installment plans.

The purpose of this loan is to cover the tuition fees for a specialized certification course in molecular diagnostics, which will significantly enhance my career prospects and earning potential. As the sole provider for my 4-year-old son, I am committed to improving our future. I also have a building society savings agreement as a form of security. I am confident that my reliable payment history and dedication make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Ivanova
