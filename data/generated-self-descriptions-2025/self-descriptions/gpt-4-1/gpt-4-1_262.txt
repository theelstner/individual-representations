Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,657 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 27-year-old single male and have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years. I have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I support while he completes his studies.

Although my checking account currently shows a negative balance and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back on time without any issues. I own my own apartment, which I purchased two years ago, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am a foreign worker from Spain, but I have settled in well in Germany and intend to remain here. My employment is stable, and I am committed to maintaining my good credit record. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Luis Martínez

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,657 DM to furnish my new home with the necessary equipment and furniture. My name is Andrei Petrov, I am 27 years old, and I have been employed as a mechanical technician at Siemens AG for nearly two years. I am single and have one dependent, my son, who lives with me.

Despite my current checking account balance being below zero and having minimal savings, I have always met my financial obligations, including successfully repaying an existing loan with your bank. I own a small house, which I acquired through diligent work and careful planning. I have no other loans or debts, and I do not act as a guarantor for anyone else.

As a foreign worker from Romania, I am dedicated to building a stable life here in Germany. My employment is secure, and I have proven my reliability through my credit history. I am confident that I can fulfill the installment payments without difficulty.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
