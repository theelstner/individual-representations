Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 685 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a warehouse supervisor at Müller Logistics for five years, with stable monthly income and a reliable employment record. My financial situation is modest, with my current checking account balance at 150 DM and savings under 100 DM. Despite limited savings, I have always managed my finances responsibly, as reflected in my history of paying back previous credits on time.

The new car is essential for my daily commute and supporting my family. As a married man with one child, reliable transportation is crucial, especially since my wife works part-time and we need to coordinate our schedules. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and my monthly installment rate is manageable within my budget. My residence of three years and continued employment in the same company demonstrate my stability.

I am confident in my ability to meet the loan obligations and hope you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 685 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am currently a machine operator at Bayer Industries, where I have worked for six years. My checking account balance is currently 80 DM, and I have minimal savings, but I have never missed a payment on any previous credit.

My current car is unreliable and often breaks down, jeopardizing my punctuality at work. As a married man supporting my wife and our young daughter, a dependable car is necessary. I have no other debts, and my monthly installment rate is well within my means. We have lived in our current apartment for three years, and I have always paid my rent and other obligations through the bank.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my consistent employment and my track record of meeting financial commitments. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Jürgen Schneider

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am seeking a loan of 685 DM to buy a new car. I am a married resident of Bremen, working as an unskilled laborer at a local construction firm for the past four years. My current account holds 60 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, but I have always repaid my previous loans on time.

The new car will help me reach distant job sites more efficiently and improve my family’s quality of life. I have no guarantors or additional debts, and my monthly payment rate fits my current budget. My wife and I have lived in our apartment for three years, and I have always been a reliable tenant.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and kindly ask you to support my application.

Thank you,  
Markus Klein

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 685 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Dieter Weber, and I am married with one dependent. I have been employed for the past five years as a janitor at the city hospital. My current account balance is 190 DM, and my savings are limited, but I have a solid history of paying back all credits on time.

A new car is essential for me to commute to work and take my child to school, especially since public transport is unreliable in our area. I have no other debts or co-signers, and my monthly installment plan is affordable for my current income. I have lived in my current residence for three years, always paying my rent and other bills through my bank account.

My stable job, responsible credit history, and reliable payment record make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Kind regards,  
Dieter Weber
