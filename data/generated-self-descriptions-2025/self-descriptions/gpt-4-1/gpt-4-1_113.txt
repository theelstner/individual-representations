Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 392 DM to help finance my continuing education in business administration. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 9 months. My current checking account has maintained a balance of over 200 DM with regular salary assignments for the past year, and I have a consistent record of paying back my previous credit with your bank on time.

I am divorced and have one dependent child. I have lived at my current rented residence for four years, and I am diligent in managing my finances, even though my savings are less than 100 DM. I also have a building society savings agreement as a form of property. Given my stable employment, history of responsible credit use, and commitment to furthering my qualifications, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller
