Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,959 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home office. As a 30-year-old single father with one dependent, I have been self-employed as a freelance IT consultant for the past eight years. While my recent period of unemployment has temporarily affected my finances, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, as my credit history with your bank demonstrates.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts have less than 0 DM and 100 DM, respectively, but I own my residence and hold a life insurance policy as security. My previous loan with your bank was paid off without issue. I am confident that with this loan, I can re-establish my consulting business from home and quickly regain financial stability. I am committed to meeting the installment payments, as I have done in the past.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Matthias Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,959 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my new business venture. I am a 30-year-old single male with one child, recently transitioned from my previous role as a project manager at a logistics company to pursue entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, this career change has led to a short period of unemployment, impacting my account balances, but I have a flawless repayment history with your bank.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and I own my home, which provides me with housing security. I also maintain a building society savings agreement. My commitment to financial responsibility is evident from my prompt repayment of previous credits.

This loan will enable me to set up an efficient workspace and resume earning, ensuring timely installment payments. I appreciate your consideration and trust in my reliability.

Kind regards,  
Jan Richter

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,959 DM to furnish my apartment and purchase equipment for a small home-based business. I am 30 years old, single, and the sole provider for my 5-year-old son. My background includes seven years as a scientific research assistant, but I am currently unemployed due to recent staff reductions at my former institute.

Despite my financial setback, I have always repaid my previous loan with your bank on schedule. I own my residence, have a telephone, and hold a life insurance policy as added security. My checking and savings accounts are temporarily low, but I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am determined to reestablish my income and am confident that, with your support, I will continue to be a trustworthy client.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Klein

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 3,959 DM to purchase furniture and equipment necessary for a home-based legal consulting practice. I am a 30-year-old single male with one dependent, previously employed as a legal officer for a multinational company for six years. Due to recent downsizing, I am currently unemployed, which has led to temporary financial hardship.

This loan will help me restart my career and support my family. I am committed to honoring the repayment schedule and maintaining my good standing with your institution.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
