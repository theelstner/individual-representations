Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,676 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a 37-year-old single father of two, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past three years. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are limited, I am committed to improving my financial stability.

My employment is secure, and I have a stable monthly income that comfortably covers my living expenses, rent, and existing loan payments. I have three active credits at your bank, all of which I have managed responsibly. While I do have a critical credit history due to previous financial difficulties, I have worked hard to meet all my obligations and have not missed any payments in the past year.

I am requesting this loan to purchase a reliable car, which is essential for commuting to work and caring for my children. I own a small property in my home country, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial responsibility. As a foreign worker, I take my obligations seriously and strive to build a positive credit history in Germany.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments and would greatly appreciate your support.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 3,676 DM loan to purchase a new vehicle. As a 37-year-old single man supporting two dependents, reliable transportation is crucial for me to maintain my job as a skilled machinist at Siemens, where I have been employed for nearly two years.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and I have minimal savings. However, I have consistently paid my rent for three years and have no other installment plans. I am renting my apartment but own a small real estate property in Greece, which adds to my financial security.

Although my credit history is not perfect and I have existing credits (not at your bank), I am diligent in making timely payments. My employment is stable, and my monthly salary is sufficient to cover the requested loan's installment rate. I have no guarantors, but my steady income and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate.

This loan will enable me to purchase a car, which is essential for my work and family responsibilities. I am committed to fulfilling all obligations and appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,
Nikolaos Papadakis

Letter 3

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,676 DM to purchase a new car, which is vital for my daily commute and supporting my two children. I am a 37-year-old single man, employed as an official in the city administration for the past three years.

Due to previous unexpected expenses, my checking account is currently negative, and my savings are under 100 DM. Despite these challenges, I have managed three existing credits at your bank and have never defaulted on a payment. My critical credit history stems from an old credit at another bank, which I am actively resolving.

I have lived at my current address for three years and pay my rent reliably. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life in Germany. I own a small piece of real estate in Poland, which further demonstrates my financial responsibility.

My steady job and commitment to my obligations make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I assure you that I will meet all repayment terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Piotr Nowak

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 3,676 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 37-year-old single male with two children, working as a technical supervisor at BASF for the past year and a half. Reliable transportation is essential for my job and for providing for my family.

Currently, my financial situation is strained: my checking account is negative, and my savings are limited. However, I have three existing credits at your bank, all in good standing. My credit history is marked as critical due to a previous loan at another institution, but I have been consistent with all my repayments.

I rent my apartment and have lived here for three years. I own a small property in my home country, which serves as additional security. My employment is stable, and I receive a regular income that covers my expenses and allows for the installment payments.

I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,
Ahmed Hassan

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a 3,676 DM loan to purchase a new car. I am a 37-year-old single man with two dependents, employed as a senior electrician at Deutsche Bahn for almost four years.

My current checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM due to recent family medical expenses. Nonetheless, I have a stable income, and my job is secure. I have three credits at your bank, which I have managed responsibly, and no other installment plans.

Although my credit history is critical because of an old loan at another bank, I have made every effort to meet my obligations and improve my financial standing. I have rented my apartment for three years and own a small real estate plot in Turkey.

This loan is necessary for me to maintain employment and support my children. I am a responsible borrower and fully committed to repaying the loan on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Mustafa Kaya
