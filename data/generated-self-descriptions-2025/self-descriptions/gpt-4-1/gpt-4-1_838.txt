Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 886 euros to purchase a new television for my household. My name is Anna Richter, I am 34 years old, married, and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for 3 years.

As a skilled employee with a secure position, I am confident in my ability to make the necessary monthly payments. I am trustworthy, as evidenced by my clean credit history and my responsible management of previous financial obligations.
