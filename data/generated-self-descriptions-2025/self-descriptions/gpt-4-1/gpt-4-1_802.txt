Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for an education loan of 1,597 DM to pursue an advanced certification in data analysis, which is vital for my career as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. As a single father of two dependents, I am determined to further my education to enhance my skills and secure a better future for my family.

Although I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I have demonstrated responsibility by consistently meeting my financial obligations, including two existing credits at your bank. I reside for free with relatives, which allows me to prioritize loan repayment. Despite a critical credit history due to previous educational loans at another bank, I have maintained stable employment and have no other debts or installment plans.

My commitment to professional development, stable employment, and my track record with your bank make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident that this investment in my education will enable me to increase my earning potential and fulfill my repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dragan Markovic

Letter 2 – Senior Electrician

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,597 DM to enroll in a two-year evening course in industrial automation. I have worked as a senior electrician at Siemens for 9 years and wish to stay updated with new technologies to remain competitive in my field.

My financial situation is modest; I do not have a checking account and my savings are less than 100 DM. However, I have managed my finances carefully, supporting my two children as a single parent. My living arrangement is stable and cost-free, as I reside with my brother. I have two existing credits with your bank, which I have serviced reliably.

Although my credit history is marked as critical due to a previous loan at another institution, I have no other debts or installment plans. My long-term, stable employment and responsible management of current obligations demonstrate my reliability.

I am confident that this educational investment will enable me to secure higher-paying positions and ensure timely repayment. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Ivan Petrovic

Letter 3 – Customs Officer

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 1,597 DM to attend a professional development course required for my role as a customs officer, a position I have held for 7 years with the Federal Customs Administration.

As a 54-year-old single father of two, I have prioritized my children’s needs, leaving me with savings of less than 100 DM. I do not currently have a checking account, but I have two ongoing credits with your institution, both of which I have managed without issue. My housing is provided by the government, eliminating rent expenses and enabling me to focus on loan repayments.

While my credit history reflects a critical account from a previous education loan at another bank, my steady employment and lack of additional debts or installment plans underscore my financial discipline. I am committed to my professional growth and financial responsibilities.

I respectfully request your support in furthering my education, which will enhance my job performance and stability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Mehmet Yilmaz
