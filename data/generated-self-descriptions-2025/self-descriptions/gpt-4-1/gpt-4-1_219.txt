Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,913 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 2 years and 8 months. My monthly salary is deposited directly into my checking account at your bank, and my balance has consistently remained above 200 DM for over a year.

I have previously taken out a loan with your bank to finance professional training, which I repaid in full and on time. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, and my only dependent is my younger brother, whom I support. I reside in my own apartment, which is part of a small property I inherited from my grandfather two years ago.

While my savings are modest (currently under 100 DM), I have demonstrated a strong commitment to meeting my financial obligations. As a single individual with stable employment and a reliable payment history, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Martin Schulz

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Tobias Weber, and I am seeking a loan of 3,913 DM to purchase a high-quality radio and television for my home. I have been employed as a junior customs official at the Frankfurt Airport for 3 years, and my salary is regularly deposited into my checking account at your branch, where I have maintained a minimum balance of 200 DM for the past 15 months.

I have successfully paid off a previous credit with your bank for a laptop, and my credit history is clean. I currently have no other loans or obligations apart from supporting my 5-year-old son, who lives with me. My residence, which I own, is located in a quiet neighborhood where I have lived for 2 years.

Although my savings are limited, I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan. My steady employment, prompt repayment history, and status as a property owner make me a reliable client. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Tobias Weber

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 3,913 DM to upgrade my radio and television at home. I work as a telecommunications technician at Deutsche Telekom, a position I have held for 3 years and 2 months. My salary has been credited to my checking account with your bank for over a year, always maintaining a balance above 200 DM.

Previously, I took a small education loan from your bank to attend a training course, which I paid off completely and on time. I have no other debts or co-signers and have not entered into any installment plans elsewhere. I am single, with one dependent—my younger sister, whom I help support.

My savings are currently under 100 DM, but I own my apartment and a small plot of land in my hometown. With my employment stability, good repayment record, and property ownership, I am confident I am a responsible candidate for this loan. I appreciate your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Jan Becker

I am writing to request a loan of 3,913 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I have been working as a municipal administrative clerk for 1 year and 7 months, and my salary is deposited monthly into my checking account at your bank, which has maintained a balance above 200 DM for the past 13 months.

I have a positive credit history, having repaid my previous loan for a washing machine on schedule. I do not have any other installment plans or debts, and I am the sole supporter of my younger cousin. I have lived in my own apartment, which I own, for the past 2 years.

My savings are minimal, but I do own real estate, which adds to my financial security. I am a single, responsible individual with a stable job and a track record of meeting my financial commitments. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
