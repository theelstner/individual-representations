Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Weber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,762 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 25-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. As a divorced mother of one, I am committed to providing a comfortable and stable environment for my child.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, typically below 200 DM, as I prioritize my regular expenses and my child’s needs. I have an active life insurance policy and have always paid back my existing credits on time, which is reflected in my clean credit history. I do not have any guarantors or additional debtors, and my only other installment plan is with my bank, with whom I have had a positive relationship for two years at my current residence.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, responsible financial behavior, and dedication to meeting my obligations. I am confident that with your support, I can further improve my living situation and continue to provide for my family.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Keller, and I am seeking a loan of 2,762 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my recently purchased apartment. I am 25 years old, married, and have one dependent child. For the past 7 years, I have worked as a certified administrative officer at the Stuttgart City Hall.

My financial situation is stable, though my checking account balance rarely exceeds 150 DM, as I focus on covering my family’s living expenses. I do not have a savings account, but I have a building society savings agreement in place. I have always paid my existing credits on time, and my only other financial commitment is a small installment plan with your bank.

Having lived at my current address for two years and maintained steady employment, I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed repayment schedule. My track record demonstrates reliability, and I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you might require.

Best regards,  
Sabine Keller
