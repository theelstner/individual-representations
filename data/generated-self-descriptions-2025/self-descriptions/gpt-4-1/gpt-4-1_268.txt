Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 6,304 EUR. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, where I have gained substantial experience and a stable income. I am currently living in my own apartment, which I have owned for the last 4 years, and I am a single father to my 8-year-old son.

I am seeking this loan to start a small consulting business in the field of renewable energy solutions. Although I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, I have maintained two active credits with you, both of which are in good standing. I have also held other credits at different banks, and while my credit history shows some critical accounts in the past, I have worked diligently to resolve these issues.

My current financial situation is stable, with no other outstanding installment plans or guarantors. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule. I am committed to this new business venture and believe that my background and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to work with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a business loan of 6,304 EUR to help expand my small construction company. For the past 9 years, I have been employed as a senior electrician with Siemens, and I have recently acquired a piece of real estate that I plan to use as an office and workshop.

I am a 36-year-old single male, supporting my 12-year-old daughter. My financial history includes two existing credits with your bank, both of which are being repaid on time. While I have had some critical accounts in the past at other banks, I have learned valuable lessons from those experiences and have since maintained a strong repayment record.

Currently, I do not have a checking or savings account, but my job security and property ownership provide a solid foundation. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and my housing situation is stable. I am confident that my skills, experience, and dedication to my business make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ivan Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a business loan of 6,304 EUR to open a small IT consultancy in Berlin. I am a 36-year-old software engineer, single, with one dependent child. For the last 8 years, I have worked as a senior systems analyst at Deutsche Telekom.

Though I do not have a checking account or savings at your bank, I own my home and have two active credits with you, both in good standing.

My current monthly installment rate is 4%, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I have lived at my present residence for 4 years and am committed to growing my business and providing for my family. I am confident that my professional background and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.
