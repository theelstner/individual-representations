Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1007 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have worked for the past two years. I am 22 years old, married, and have one child.

Although my checking account balance is modest (currently 150 DM), I have maintained a savings account with a balance of 1200 DM. I own a small apartment in Munich, where I have resided for the past year. My previous loan with your bank was paid off on schedule, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

My position provides a stable income, and I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. A new car is essential for my daily commute and family needs. I believe my record of responsible credit use and my stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Johannes Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1007 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am currently a customs officer at the Frankfurt Airport, where I have been employed for three years. I am 22 years old, married, and have one dependent child.

My financial situation is stable; I have 1050 DM in savings and own a small townhouse in the city. My checking account balance is currently 90 DM, but I have always paid back previous credits on time, including my current small loan with your bank.

I have no additional debts or guarantors and have demonstrated reliability in my financial commitments. This car will greatly improve my ability to manage work and family responsibilities. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Armin Becker

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 1007 DM to purchase a new car for my family and work needs. I am a technical draftsman at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for nearly two years. I am 22, married, and have a young daughter.

Though my checking account holds only 60 DM at present, I have diligently saved over 1000 DM in my savings account. I own my residence and have lived there for a year. I have never missed a payment on my previous credit with your bank, and I carry no other debts.

As a foreign worker with a permanent contract, I am committed to building a secure life for my family in Germany. I believe my steady employment and financial discipline make me a trustworthy loan candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1007 DM to purchase a new car. I am a certified electrician, employed by a local utility company for the past 18 months. I am 22, married, and have one child.

My current account balance is 120 DM, but I have 1350 DM in savings and own a small house in the suburbs. My credit history with your bank is positive, as I have repaid a previous loan in full and on time. I have no other loans or installment plans.

Owning a reliable car is crucial for both my work (responding to emergencies) and my family. I am confident in my ability to make regular payments and assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.
