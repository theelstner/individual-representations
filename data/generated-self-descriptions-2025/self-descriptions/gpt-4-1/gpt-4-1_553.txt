Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,750 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik for the past 8 years, and I am proud to say I have always been a reliable employee. Although my position is unskilled, I have a steady monthly income that allows me to meet my obligations.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I have maintained a savings account with a balance of 700 DM. I have also successfully paid back all previous credits with your bank on time, demonstrating my commitment to meeting my financial responsibilities. I have lived at my current address for 4 years, own my home, and have a building society savings agreement as additional security.

I am single, 45 years old, with two dependents, and have no other debts or guarantors. My only other installment plan is with your bank, which I have managed without issue. As a foreign worker, I strive to build a stable and secure life for my family here.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov
