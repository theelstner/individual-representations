Dear Loan Officer,

My name is David Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €6,527 to purchase a new car. I am a 34-year-old single father of two, employed as a scientific research assistant at BioGenTech for the past two years. I have been living at my current residence for four years, and I am fortunate to have housing provided by my employer, which greatly reduces my monthly expenses.

I have an existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time and in full. I do not have a checking or savings account at this time, but I have demonstrated financial responsibility through my payment history. This car is essential for my daily commute and for transporting my children to school and activities. 

I am confident in my ability to make the monthly installment payments, as my job provides a stable income and I have no other debts or financial obligations. I take pride in my reliability and hope you will consider me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,
David Müller
