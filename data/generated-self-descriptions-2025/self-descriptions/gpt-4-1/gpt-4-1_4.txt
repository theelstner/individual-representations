Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 2096 DM to support my ongoing education. As a 49-year-old single father of two, I have worked as a warehouse assistant at Müller & Söhne for the past 5 years. My primary goal is to enroll in a vocational training program that will allow me to transition into a more skilled role within my company.

My financial situation is modest; I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have been repaying reliably. My only property is my home, which I own, and I have no other installment plans or debts. I am a foreign worker, but I have been a resident at my current address for 3 years and have always prioritized my financial obligations.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan because I have demonstrated stability in both employment and residence, and my goal is to improve my long-term earning potential. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Johan Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2096 DM to finance a specialized technical course in automotive mechanics. After 4 years as a janitor at the local hospital, I see this as a crucial step to provide a better future for my two children.

Currently, I do not have a checking account and my savings are limited. I have one other credit with your bank, which I have managed responsibly. I own my home and have no additional debts or installment plans. Although my credit history is not perfect, I have always met my payment obligations and have lived at my current address for 3 years.

As a single, 49-year-old foreign worker, investing in my education is the best way to secure stable employment and improve my family's circumstances. I am committed to repaying this loan on time and appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,
Mateusz Nowak

Dear Lending Officer,

I am applying for a 2096 DM loan to pursue a certification in elder care, which will allow me to transition from my current position as a night porter (held for 4 years) to a more stable and better-paid role.

My financial situation is challenging: I have less than 100 DM in savings and no checking account. However, I own my home and have no other debts or installment plans. I have maintained one credit at your bank and have always made timely payments. I have lived at my current address for 3 years, and my two children depend on me.

Despite being a foreign worker and having an unskilled job, I am reliable, hardworking, and eager to improve my prospects through education. I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan in full and on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Pavel Ivanov
