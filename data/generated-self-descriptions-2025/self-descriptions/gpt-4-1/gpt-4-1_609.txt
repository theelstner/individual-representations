Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,671 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my household. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 2 years. My employment is stable, and I am committed to my career in research.

My current financial situation is modest. My checking account balance fluctuates between 50 and 150 DM, and I have a small savings bond of 250 DM. I have one previous credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. I live with my daughter in company-provided housing, so I have no rent expenses, and I have no other installment plans or significant debts.

I am applying for this loan to improve our access to news and educational programs, which is especially important for my daughter's schooling. I have always been responsible with my finances, as shown by my clean credit history and reliable employment. My sister, who is a teacher, has agreed to be a co-applicant to further assure you of my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I can meet the monthly installments and would be grateful for your support.

Sincerely,
Dr. Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

I would like to request a loan of 2,671 DM to purchase a radio and television for my home. I am currently employed as an administrative clerk at Siemens AG, where I have been working for the last 3 years. I am 50 years old, recently divorced, and responsible for supporting my teenage son.

My financial situation is stable, albeit limited. My checking account rarely exceeds 180 DM, and I have a small savings deposit of 300 DM. I have previously taken a loan from your bank, which I have repaid in full and on time. I have no outstanding debts or installment plans elsewhere.

I am living in a family-owned apartment, rent-free, which significantly reduces my living expenses. My brother has agreed to be a co-applicant for this loan, providing further assurance of repayment.

I am a diligent employee and have always met my financial obligations. I am committed to maintaining my good credit standing and would appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,
Maria Schmidt
