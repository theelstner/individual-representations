Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,070 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. My name is Viktor Novak, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich for the past 8 years. I am a 32-year-old single male and have resided at my current address for 4 years.

Although I currently do not have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have a car registered in my name, which demonstrates my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations. While I have existing credit with another institution, I have never missed an installment and maintain a good rapport with my creditors.

The reason I am applying for this loan is to replace my outdated television and radio, which are essential for my work and staying informed as a foreign worker in Germany. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, given my stable employment and steady income.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional documentation you may require.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Novak
