Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I am applying for a business loan of 6,289 DM to expand my small electronics repair shop, which I established last year in Munich. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at Siemens for the past 10 months, and my salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account for over a year, maintaining a balance above 200 DM.

I am divorced and have one child, for whom I am responsible. Despite my personal circumstances, I have always managed my finances diligently. I have previously taken two small credits from your bank, both of which were repaid in full and on time. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

Currently, I own my apartment and have a building society savings agreement in place, though my savings are under 100 DM. My goal is to use this loan to purchase additional equipment and inventory for my shop, which has seen increased demand. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my business is growing steadily and my employment is stable.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to maintaining a trustworthy relationship with your bank.

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrovic, a divorced father of a 7-year-old son, and I am seeking a loan of 6,289 DM to expand my taxi service in Stuttgart. After relocating here a year ago, I started working as an official at the local transportation office and have held this position for 9 months.

With this loan, I plan to add another vehicle to my fleet, which will significantly increase my income and provide greater stability for my son and me. I am dedicated to fulfilling my obligations and have always demonstrated responsibility in managing my finances.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic
