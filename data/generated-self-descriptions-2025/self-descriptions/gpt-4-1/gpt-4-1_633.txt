Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,553 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Heidelberg University for the past three years, and I have built a reputation for reliability and diligence in my field.

My financial situation is currently tight, with my checking account showing a small negative balance and my savings below 100 DM. However, I have always paid back all previous credits at your bank on time and in full, as my credit history with you will confirm. I have no other debts or guarantors and have managed my finances responsibly despite limited resources.

I am single, have lived at my current residence for three years, and rely on public transport and my car for commuting. I have no dependents and pay my housing directly to the bank. My steady employment and positive credit history demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate. I am confident I will be able to meet the installment plan requirements without issue.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Stein

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,553 DM to purchase new equipment for my home office. I have been working as a civil servant in the local government office in Stuttgart for just over two years. My current financial resources are limited, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and less than 100 DM in savings.

Despite this, I have always fulfilled my credit obligations with your bank promptly. I have no other loans or debts and live alone in a bank-financed apartment. My employment is stable, and I have a secure income that will allow me to repay the loan in the proposed installments.

As a single, responsible official with no dependents, I have managed my finances prudently. My good standing with your bank and my stable job make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger
