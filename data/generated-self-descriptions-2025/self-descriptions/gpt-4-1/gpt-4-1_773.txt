Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 8,065 DM to support my pursuit of an MBA at the University of Mannheim. As a divorced woman of 25, I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at BASF, a position I have held for three years. My current financial situation is challenging, with my checking account temporarily overdrawn and savings under 100 DM. However, I am committed to investing in my education to secure a more stable future for myself and my young son.

Although I have two existing credits with your bank and a critical account history, I have always met my installment obligations on time. I have no guarantors or additional debt plans. I have lived in my own apartment in Ludwigshafen for two years, and I am registered as a foreign worker with full legal status.

I am confident that my stable employment, professional aspirations, and responsible payment record make me a trustworthy candidate. This loan will enable me to advance my career and improve my financial stability. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Laura Stein

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for an educational loan of 8,065 DM to complete my Certified Financial Planner qualification at the Frankfurt School of Finance. I am a 25-year-old married woman and have been working as a mid-level manager at Deutsche Telekom for nearly two years. Despite a current negative balance in my checking account and minimal savings, I have managed to support my family and maintain our owned apartment in Wiesbaden.

Though my credit history includes some critical accounts and existing loans with your bank, I have always paid my installments reliably. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have one dependent child. My employment contract is secure, and I am committed to furthering my career for greater long-term stability.

I am confident that, given my steady employment, responsible installment payments, and determination to improve my qualifications, I am a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Katrin Müller

To whom it may concern,

I am seeking an education loan of 8,065 DM to attend a postgraduate course in Data Science at the Technical University of Munich. I am a 25-year-old separated woman and have been working as a software development officer at Siemens AG for the past three years. My current financial situation is strained, with an overdrawn account and less than 100 DM in savings, but I am determined to invest in my future.

I have two existing credits with your bank and a critical account status, but I have no additional debts or guarantors and have always met my installment rate of 3 DM punctually. I have lived in my own apartment in Munich for two years and am registered as a foreign worker under my own name.

I believe my consistent employment, commitment to professional growth, and responsible financial behavior despite challenges make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for an educational loan of 8,065 DM. I am a 25-year-old divorced woman, currently employed as a self-employed marketing consultant in Stuttgart for nearly four years. I have one dependent daughter, and although my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always ensured regular payment of my existing loans at your bank.

With two active credits and a critical credit history, I understand the need for caution. However, I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My business is growing, and I am seeking to further my education in digital marketing to expand my client base and improve my family’s financial security.

I have lived in my own home for two years and have a reliable telephone contact. I am committed to repaying my debts and believe my professional experience and determination make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anja Weber
