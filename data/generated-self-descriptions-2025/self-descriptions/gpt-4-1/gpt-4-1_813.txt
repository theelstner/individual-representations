Letter 1 – From: Tomasz Nowak, Warehouse Loader

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Tomasz Nowak and I am writing to request a loan of 484 DM for the purchase of a new television set for my family. I am 28 years old, married, with one young child, and have been working as a warehouse loader at Müller Logistics for the past 5 years. Although my position is unskilled, I have held my job steadily and am regarded as a reliable employee.

My current financial situation is modest: I have less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings. However, I have already successfully repaid one previous loan with your bank, always making payments on time. I currently own my own apartment, which is supported by my real estate property, and have lived at my present address for 3 years. My monthly expenses are carefully managed, and I am able to provide a guarantor for this loan.

I am a trustworthy candidate because of my consistent employment history, responsible repayment record, and stable family situation. This television will be an important addition for my family’s comfort and education. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Tomasz Nowak

Letter 2 – From: Ahmed Yilmaz, Factory Worker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, and I am applying for a loan of 484 DM to purchase a new radio for my household. I am 28 years old, married, and have one dependent child. I have been employed as a factory worker at Bayer Machinery for the last 4 years, and I am proud to say that I have never missed a payment on my previous credit with your bank.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life for my family in Germany. My steady employment, excellent repayment history, and property ownership make me a reliable candidate. I kindly ask for your support in granting this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
