Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 585 DM for the purchase of a new television. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for the past 2 years. My current financial situation is modest, with my checking account balance below 200 DM and savings of less than 100 DM. I am married with a young child, and we live in a rented apartment where we have resided for the last 4 years.

Although I have experienced a delay in repaying a previous loan, I have since taken steps to improve my financial discipline, including setting up a co-applicant arrangement with my spouse to ensure timely repayments. I currently have two small credits with your bank, both of which are being managed responsibly.

Our family’s only television recently broke, and as we rely on it for both news and my child’s educational programs, replacing it is important for our daily life. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, real estate owned in my home country, and my commitment to meeting my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Martin Kovac

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Yusuf, and I am applying for a loan of 585 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my family. I have been working as a customs officer at the port of Hamburg for the past 3 years. My wife and I have a young daughter, and we have been renting our current home for 4 years.

While my current account and savings are limited, and I have had a delayed payment in the past, I have since partnered with my wife as a co-applicant to provide additional security for this loan. My regular employment and ownership of a small property in Turkey offer further stability.

We currently do not have a television or radio, which makes it difficult to stay informed and connected, especially as foreign workers. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I am actively repaying. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,
Ahmed Yusuf

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 585 DM for the purpose of buying a new television. I am currently employed as an administrative clerk at the city council, a position I have held for 1 year and 8 months. My wife and I, along with our 2-year-old son, have been living in our rented apartment for 4 years.

Although I have a history of delayed payments, I have since made arrangements with my brother as a co-applicant to guarantee the loan. My financial situation is currently tight, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings, but my employment is stable and I own a small plot of real estate in my hometown in Poland.

We have two small credits with your bank, which I am managing carefully. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and believe my steady income and support system make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Jan Nowak

Letter 4

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Victor Ivanov, and I am seeking a loan of 585 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my household. I am 20 years old, married, and the father of a 3-year-old. I have been employed as a mechanical technician at Siemens for the past 3 years, and we have rented our current apartment for 4 years.

My financial resources are limited, as reflected in my checking and savings accounts. I do have two credits with your bank, and while I experienced a payment delay last year due to an emergency, my wife is now acting as co-applicant to ensure timely repayments.

Owning a television and radio is essential for my family, especially as foreign workers adjusting to life in Germany. I also own a small parcel of land in my home country, which adds to my financial security. I am committed to honoring the loan terms and appreciate your support.

Best regards,
Victor Ivanov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 585 DM to buy a new television for my family. My name is Paulo Silva, and I have been working as a skilled electrician at a local factory for nearly 2 years. I am married, with a 4-year-old daughter, and we have lived in our current rented apartment for the last 4 years.

I acknowledge a previous delay in loan repayment, but I have since arranged for my wife to co-sign this application to provide additional security. My checking and savings accounts are limited, but I have a steady job and own a small piece of real estate in Portugal.

We do not have any other installment plans, and I have two credits at your bank that I am repaying on schedule. I believe my stable employment, family support, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Paulo Silva
