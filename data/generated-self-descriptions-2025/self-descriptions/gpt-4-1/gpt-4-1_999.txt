Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 804 DM for the purchase of a new television. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and I have a reliable monthly income.

I have previously taken out two small credits, both of which I have repaid on time and in full, demonstrating my commitment to financial responsibility. While I do not have a checking account at this time, I have managed my finances carefully, though my savings are currently below 100 DM due to recent unexpected expenses.

I have lived at my current residence in Munich for four years and have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. I own my car, which provides additional security. As a single individual with no dependents, I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 4 DM per month without issue.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to improve my quality of life with this purchase and assure you of my reliability as a borrower.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker
