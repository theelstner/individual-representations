Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Daniel Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,077 euros to purchase a new television and radio system. I am a 34-year-old single male and have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and well-regarded, and my monthly income comfortably covers my living expenses as well as the proposed loan installment rate.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, my financial obligations are manageable, and I have no dependents or guarantors. I have resided at my current apartment for 2 years, and while I do not own my home, I do have a car as my primary property. I am also a foreign worker, and my employment contract is long-term.

I have had some previous credit experience with other institutions, which I have managed responsibly. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule, given my secure job and history of honoring my financial commitments. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Müller
