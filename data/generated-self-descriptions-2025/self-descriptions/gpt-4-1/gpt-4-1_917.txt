Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 18,424 DM to support the expansion of my small consulting business, which I have been managing for the past three years. As a scientific research assistant with a stable monthly income, I have consistently maintained a positive financial record, with no previous credits taken and all payments made punctually. 

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and my savings are below 100 DM, as I have reinvested most profits into the business. Nevertheless, I own my home and have a building society savings agreement as additional security. My employment and residence history both reflect stability, with three years in my current role and two years at my present address.

I am divorced with one dependent and manage all financial obligations independently, with no other debts or guarantors involved. I believe my experience, reliability, and commitment to fulfilling obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The funds will be used to purchase equipment and hire an additional staff member, which will further increase my income and ensure timely repayment.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you require.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Stefanie Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 18,424 DM to cover the costs associated with launching an online retail platform for my boutique clothing business. For the past two years, I have been self-employed, building a loyal customer base and demonstrating steady growth.

Although my current checking and savings account balances are low, this is due to recent investments in inventory and marketing. I have never defaulted on any credit, and my only existing loan with your bank is being paid on time. I live in my own apartment, have life insurance as collateral, and have been residing at my current address for two years.

As a married woman with one child, I am dedicated to providing for my family and have a strong sense of responsibility. My employment history and current business performance show my determination and ability to manage finances. With this loan, I will be able to expand my business and increase my income, ensuring reliable repayment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Julia Schneider
