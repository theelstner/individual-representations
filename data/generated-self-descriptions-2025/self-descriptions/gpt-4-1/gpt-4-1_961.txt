Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,069 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is stable; I have a checking account balance of 120 DM and savings of 300 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

As a single father of a 5-year-old son, I am responsible for his well-being and comfort. We have recently moved into a new residence, where I have been living for the past 4 years without paying rent, thanks to an arrangement with my employer. However, our current furniture is inadequate, and the loan would help us create a more functional and comfortable home environment.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as I have a steady job, a proven track record of meeting my financial obligations, and no other debts. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Tomasz Kowalski, and I am seeking a loan of 3,069 DM to purchase new equipment and furniture for my apartment. I am a certified electrician, employed at Siemens AG for the past 9 years. My monthly income is steady, but I currently have only 180 DM in my checking account and 400 DM in savings.

I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid on time, and I have no other debts or installment agreements. As a single man with a 7-year-old daughter, I am committed to providing her with a safe and comfortable home. Our furniture is outdated and some pieces are broken, making this investment necessary.

With a stable job, good credit history, and no other financial burdens, I am confident I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Tomasz Kowalski
