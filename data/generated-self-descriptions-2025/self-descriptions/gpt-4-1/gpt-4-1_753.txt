Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 976 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Anna Müller, a 35-year-old divorced woman currently working as a cashier at a local supermarket in Berlin. I have been in this position for the past 10 months, and although I am still relatively new, I have a stable monthly income.

I have maintained a checking account with your bank for the past 18 months, although my current balance is below zero. I have always paid back my existing credits on time, as my credit history with your institution will confirm. My financial situation is modest; I have less than 100 DM in my savings account and no other assets aside from my current car, which is old and unreliable.

I am requesting this loan because I need a dependable vehicle to commute to work and take care of my two children. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have always honored my financial commitments. I believe my track record of timely repayments demonstrates my reliability and trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Richter, and I am applying for a loan of 976 DM to purchase a new car. I am a married woman, 41 years old, living in Hamburg for the past two years. I am currently employed as a cleaning staff member at a local school, a position I have held for 9 months.

My financial situation is challenging, as my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are minimal. Despite these difficulties, I have an excellent credit record and have always repaid my credits on time. I have no outstanding debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

The new car is essential for me to maintain my job and support my family, as public transport is not always reliable in my area. I am committed to meeting the monthly installment rate and have budgeted carefully to ensure timely payments.

Thank you for your consideration. I am confident that my employment stability and payment history make me a trustworthy candidate.

Best regards,  
Sabine Richter

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Claudia Weber, and I am writing to request a loan of 976 DM to purchase a new car. I am a separated woman, 38 years old, residing in Munich for the past two years. I work as an unskilled kitchen assistant at a local restaurant, a job I started 11 months ago.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. Nevertheless, I have always managed to pay back my existing credits on schedule, demonstrating my reliability. I do not have any other debts or financial obligations, and I do not share my finances with anyone else.

Owning a new car is crucial for me to continue working late shifts, as public transportation does not run during my working hours. I am responsible for one dependent and take my financial commitments seriously.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Weber

Dear Bank Manager,

I am Petra Hoffmann, a 36-year-old married woman living in Dresden for two years, currently employed as a warehouse assistant since July last year. I am writing to apply for a loan of 976 DM to purchase a new vehicle.

At the moment, my checking account has a negative balance, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have always repaid my credits on time, and my payment history with your bank is spotless. I have no other debts or installment plans apart from this application.

The new car is vital for my daily commute and for transporting my child to school. I have carefully calculated my budget to ensure I can meet the installment payments. I have no other guarantors or dependents besides my child, and I am fully committed to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan as agreed.

Yours sincerely,  
Petra Hoffmann
