Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,021 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my apartment. As a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik, I have been steadily employed for the past three years. I am divorced and currently responsible for my young daughter, who lives with me. Despite my modest income, I have always managed my financial obligations carefully, as shown by my successful repayment of a previous credit at your bank.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are both below 100 DM due to recent unexpected expenses related to my daughter’s schooling. However, I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2, as my employment is stable and I own a small real estate property in my home country, which provides additional security.

I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans and have lived at my current rented residence for two years. I am committed to maintaining my strong repayment record and would be grateful for your support in improving my family’s living conditions.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Pavel Novak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,021 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a janitorial staff member at Reinigungsdienst Berlin for nearly two years. As a separated father with one dependent, my financial resources are limited, but I have always paid back my credits on time, including the one I currently have at your bank.

My current account balance is below zero, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, mainly due to high initial costs moving into my current rented apartment two years ago. Despite these challenges, I have no other debts or guarantors and have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility.

I also own a piece of land in Poland, which adds to my financial stability. I am confident that my regular income and prudent management make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Marek Kowalski

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 3,021 DM to purchase furniture and equipment that will improve my living environment for myself and my young son. I have worked as a kitchen helper at Gaststätte Edelweiss for just over a year and have been residing at my current rented home for two years. I am divorced and solely responsible for my child.

Unfortunately, my checking and savings accounts are both below 100 DM, as my earnings have been directed toward rent and daily expenses. Despite this, I have a strong credit history, having repaid my existing loan with your bank without any issues.

I do not have any other debts or installment plans, and my real estate property in Romania provides additional security. I am diligent in my financial commitments and am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Adrian Popescu

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,021 DM for the purpose of purchasing furniture and equipment for my apartment. My name is Ivan Petrov, and I have been working as a resident construction laborer at BauTeam GmbH for two and a half years. I am a separated father of one, and have lived at my current address for two years.

My current financial situation is difficult, with my checking account in overdraft and savings below 100 DM, due to the costs associated with my recent separation. Nevertheless, I have always paid my previous credit at your bank on time, and have no other loans or installment plans.

In addition, I own a small apartment in Bulgaria, which provides some financial security. My stable job, proven repayment record, and lack of other debts make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov
