Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,375 DM to expand my small auto repair shop, which I established two years ago in Hamburg. Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I maintain a savings account with a balance of 750 DM. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at a local university for three years, which provides me with a stable monthly income.

In the past, I experienced a delay in repaying a previous loan due to unexpected medical expenses, but I have since settled all outstanding debts and learned to manage my finances more effectively. I have no other guarantors or debtors, and I reside at my current address for the past two years. My only property is my car, which I use for both personal and business purposes.

I am confident that with this loan, I can purchase new equipment and hire an additional mechanic, which will significantly increase my shop’s capacity and revenue. My strong employment history, coupled with my commitment to improving my financial responsibility, makes me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further.

Sincerely,  
Michael Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is David Stein, and I am seeking a business loan of 2,375 DM to open a small electronics store in Munich. I am a single male, currently working as a skilled electrician for the past two years. I have a savings account with 600 DM, but no checking account at this time.

Previously, I had some delays in paying off a personal loan during a period of unemployment, but I have since gained stable employment and improved my financial habits. I have no other debts or co-signers, and I have lived at my present residence for two years. My only valuable asset is my car, which I use for work-related travel.

The installment rate I am proposing is reasonable and manageable based on my current salary. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on time and intend to use the funds to purchase inventory and cover initial operating expenses. As a dedicated and reliable employee, I am committed to building a successful business and maintaining a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
David Stein

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a 2,375 DM loan to help me launch a mobile coffee cart business in Berlin. I have worked as a logistics coordinator for a shipping company for nearly three years and have accumulated 950 DM in my savings account. Unfortunately, I do not have a checking account at this time.

Two years ago, I experienced a delay in settling a credit card bill due to a family emergency, but I have since taken steps to ensure timely payments, and my current financial obligations are under control. I have no other outstanding loans or financial commitments, and I have lived at my current address for two years. The only property I own is my delivery van, which will be used for the new business.

I am a skilled and diligent worker with a strong sense of responsibility, and I am fully committed to making this venture a success. I believe that with your support, I can create a thriving business and meet all my repayment obligations without issue.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Rashid

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am a single male currently employed as a junior civil servant in Frankfurt for the past two years. I am applying for a 2,375 DM business loan to start a courier service. I have 800 DM in my savings account, but I do not have a checking account.

I admit that I have had a delay in repayment of a small personal loan in the past due to unforeseen expenses, but I have learned from this and have since maintained a good record. I have no other debts, nor do I have any guarantors. I have lived at my present address for two years and own a car, which will be essential for my new business.

With a regular income and no dependents, I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments. I am eager to contribute to the local economy and build a reputable business. I would appreciate your support in helping me achieve this goal.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a business loan of 2,375 DM to establish a small cleaning service in Stuttgart. I am a single male, 32 years old, and have been working as a skilled maintenance technician for nearly three years. My savings account currently holds 900 DM, but I do not have a checking account.

I acknowledge that I once had a delay in paying off a store credit, which was resolved promptly after I secured stable employment. Since then, I have managed my finances responsibly. I have no other loans or co-signers and have lived at my current address for two years. My only significant asset is my car.

With no dependents and a secure job, I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment plan. I am committed to building a successful business and maintaining a positive credit history. Your trust in me would be greatly appreciated, and I am ready to provide any further information you may require.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
