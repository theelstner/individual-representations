Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,314 DM to support my transition into a new business venture. I am 27 years old and currently reside in my own apartment, where I have lived for the past two years. I am single and have one dependent, my younger brother, who is pursuing his university studies.

My background is in scientific research management, having worked as a research assistant and later as a project coordinator for eight years prior to my recent unemployment. Although I am presently unemployed, I am in the process of launching a small consulting firm specializing in environmental impact assessments. The loan will cover start-up costs, including necessary certifications and equipment.

While my credit history includes other existing credits not at your bank, I have always honored my commitments and maintain a co-applicant for this loan—my former business partner, who brings financial stability and experience. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my business plan is solid and supported by pre-contract agreements with two local companies.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time for further discussion and can provide references if needed.

Yours sincerely,  
Martin Schulz

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 6,314 DM to invest in advanced training for my career in software development. I am a 27-year-old single male, living in my own home for the past two years, and I support my young daughter as my dependent.

I have previously worked as a senior developer at a fintech start-up for six years, but due to recent layoffs in the tech sector, I am currently unemployed. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. My credit history includes a critical account, but I have always managed my obligations responsibly and have a co-applicant—my father, who is a retired civil servant.

My current savings are minimal, less than 100 DM, but I am committed to improving my financial situation. This loan will allow me to complete certifications in cloud computing, significantly increasing my employability and earning potential. I am registered as a foreign worker and have a reliable telephone contact.

I assure you of my dedication to repaying this loan and am happy to provide further documentation or references.

Best regards,  
Andreas Weber

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 6,314 DM to cover medical expenses for my dependent son, who requires ongoing treatment for a chronic illness. I am a 27-year-old single father, living in my own apartment for two years. My employment history includes five years as a logistics officer in an international shipping company, but I lost my job due to company downsizing.

Currently, I do not have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM. Despite a critical account in my credit history and two existing credits at your bank, I have always made timely payments. My co-applicant, my elder brother, will support the repayment process.

This loan is crucial for my son’s health and will be managed responsibly. I am actively seeking new employment and expect to return to work soon. I am available by telephone at your convenience.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Lukas Hoffmann

Letter 4:  
Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,314 DM to purchase specialized equipment for my freelance graphic design business. I am 27, single, and have one dependent—my younger sister, whom I care for since our parents passed away. I have lived in my own home for two years.

My professional experience includes seven years as a highly qualified employee in a design agency. I am currently between contracts, but have secured a co-applicant—my close friend and collaborator, who is steadily employed.

My current financial assets are limited, with savings under 100 DM and a critical credit history due to an emergency medical loan last year. Nevertheless, I am diligent in my repayments and have two existing credits at your bank, both in good standing.

This loan will enable me to expand my client base and stabilize my income. I am committed to honoring my financial obligations and appreciate your trust.

Kind regards,  
Felix Bauer

Respected Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 6,314 DM loan to support relocation and initial expenses for a new job opportunity abroad. I am 27, single, and support my younger cousin as my dependent. I have lived in my own residence for two years.

I was employed as a self-employed financial consultant for six years until a recent market downturn. I am currently unemployed but have secured a co-applicant—my uncle, a government officer, who will guarantee the loan.

My credit history shows a critical account and I have minimal savings (<100 DM), but I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are up to date. I am registered as a foreign worker and available by phone.

This loan is essential to restart my career and provide for my dependent. I assure you of my reliability and commitment to repayment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Sebastian Richter
