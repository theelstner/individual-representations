Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,462 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for the past 3 years. My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to initial moving expenses, and my savings are less than 100 DM, but I have always paid back my previous credits on time.

As a single man of 29 years old, I have no dependents or other financial obligations. I have been residing at my current address for 2 years, and I own a reliable Volkswagen Golf as my only property. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2, as my stable income and proven payment history demonstrate my financial responsibility.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Matthias Klein

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,462 DM to purchase equipment for my home office. I have been working as an IT support specialist at Siemens AG for 2.5 years. My checking account is currently below zero due to recent relocation costs, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have always repaid previous loans in full and on time, as reflected in my credit history.

I have no dependents or guarantors, and I live alone in rented accommodation. My only significant asset is my 2018 Opel Astra. I have lived at my present residence for 2 years and am committed to maintaining my excellent repayment record. My regular salary and job stability ensure I can manage the proposed installment plan comfortably.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Stefan Berger
