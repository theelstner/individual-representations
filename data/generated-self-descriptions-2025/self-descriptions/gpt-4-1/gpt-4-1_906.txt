Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Michael Bauer, and I am applying for a loan of 1,278 DM to purchase a new television set for my home. I am currently employed as a Senior Project Manager at Siemens AG, where I have worked for the past 8 years. As a single father with one dependent, I strive to provide a comfortable and modern environment for my child.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance of less than 100 DM. I have an excellent credit history, having paid back all existing credits on time, including a previous loan from your bank. My financial stability is further supported by my ownership of real estate and my long-term employment in a management position.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and my monthly installment rate is manageable within my current budget. I have resided at my current address for one year and am fully registered as a foreign worker under my own name. I am confident that I am a reliable and trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Michael Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,278 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my new apartment. My name is Dr. Stefan Weiss, and I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 9 years. I recently moved to a new residence, and as a single parent, I want to ensure my child has access to educational and entertainment resources at home.

My credit history is spotless, with all previous loans repaid promptly, including one from your institution. I do not have a checking account at present, and my savings are minimal, but my steady income and property ownership provide a solid financial foundation.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and my current obligations are limited to a manageable installment rate of 4. I am diligent, responsible, and have demonstrated my commitment to meeting my financial obligations over the years.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Dr. Stefan Weiss
