Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1228 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 24-year-old divorced woman working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for 3 years. I am a resident foreign worker and have lived at my current address for 2 years. I own my home and have one dependent, my 5-year-old son.

Although my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have always paid back my existing credit with your bank on time. My employment is stable, and I have no other debts or installment plans. Owning real estate gives me a firm financial foundation, and I am committed to maintaining my good credit standing.

A new car is essential for my job and my family’s needs. I am confident in my ability to make the regular installment payments, and I assure you of my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Nowak

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1228 DM to purchase a new car, which is crucial for my commute to my job as a hospital orderly at St. Joseph’s Hospital, where I have been employed for 2 years. I am 24, married, and a foreign worker residing in my own apartment for the past 2 years. I have one child to support.

My financial situation is currently tight, with my checking account below 0 DM and minimal savings, but I have always repaid my previous credit at your bank on schedule. I do not have any other debts or installment plans and no guarantors.

Owning a car will allow me to maintain my employment and support my family. I am responsible with my finances, as demonstrated by my prompt repayments and ownership of property. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,  
Fatima Demir

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 1228 DM to purchase a new car. As a separated woman, 24 years old, and the sole provider for my 3-year-old daughter, reliable transportation is vital for my work as a hotel cleaning staff member at Hotel Europa, a job I have held for nearly 4 years.

Though my current account is overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM, I have a good track record with your bank, having paid back my previous loan without delay. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and I own my apartment, which provides security for my financial obligations.

I am committed to meeting my monthly installment payments and maintaining my good relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Rossi

A car is crucial for my job, especially with late hours, and for caring for my child. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and maintaining my good credit history.

Thank you for your consideration.
