Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Johan Petrescu and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,320 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am a 34-year-old married man with one child, currently residing in my own home for the past three years. Previously, I worked as a certified electrician for the municipal utilities company for eight years before being laid off due to restructuring. Since then, I have been actively seeking new employment and taking part in local training programs.

Although I have had delays in repaying loans in the past, I have always fulfilled my obligations and have never defaulted. My financial situation is currently tight as I am living on unemployment benefits, with limited savings of under 100 DM. However, I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and I own real estate which provides security for this loan.

I am confident that with the installment rate of 2, I will be able to manage the repayments within my current budget. My family relies on radio and television for news and education, especially as my child is preparing for school, making this purchase important for us. I am a responsible person and have always prioritized my family’s needs and financial commitments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for further discussion and can provide any additional documentation you require.

Sincerely,  
Johan Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Farid Malik and I am applying for a loan of 2,320 DM to buy a new radio and television set. I am a 34-year-old widower with one dependent son, living in my own home for the past three years. I have been unemployed for 18 months after my position as a railway operations assistant was made redundant. I am actively looking for work and have recently completed a computer literacy course to improve my prospects.

I understand my credit history shows some late payments, but I have always settled my debts. I currently have two outstanding credits at your bank, both of which are being paid regularly. I have no other installment plans, debts, or guarantors, and my only asset is my house. My savings are minimal, under 100 DM.

I am a trustworthy candidate because I have demonstrated responsibility in managing my financial obligations despite setbacks. Owning my home provides additional security for the loan. The radio and television are essential for staying informed and connected, especially as I am a foreign worker with limited local support.

Thank you for your consideration. I am committed to meeting the repayment terms and appreciate your trust.

Best regards,  
Farid Malik

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,320 DM for the purchase of a television set. My name is Ivan Kovac, I am 34 years old, married, and have one child. I have been living in my own property for three years. I worked as a customs officer for nine years before being laid off last year. Since then, I have been receiving unemployment benefits and looking for new opportunities.

I acknowledge there have been delays in my previous loan repayments, but I have always ensured that all dues were paid in full. Currently, my savings are under 100 DM, and I have two existing credits at your bank, both up to date. I have no additional debts or installment plans.

As a responsible family man and property owner, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. The television is a necessity for my family, especially for my child’s education. The proposed installment rate is manageable within my current finances.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am happy to provide further information if required.

Yours sincerely,  
Ivan Kovac

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Ahmed Tariq and I wish to apply for a loan of 2,320 DM to buy a new radio and television for my household. I am a 34-year-old married man with one child, and I have lived in my own home for three years. My previous employment was as a logistics coordinator at a shipping company for ten years until I was laid off 18 months ago.

I am a reliable candidate, as my property provides security and I have a strong work history. The loan will allow my family to stay informed and entertained, which is particularly important for my child’s development.
