Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 3,844 DM to expand my small grocery kiosk, which I have been operating successfully for the past five years in Mannheim. My current financial situation is stable: my checking account balance is 120 DM, and I maintain a savings account with 320 DM. I have a clean credit history, having paid back my previous loan with your bank on time.

I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at a local distribution center, a position I have held for 5 years. My monthly income is steady, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I reside with my cousin, which allows me to save on housing expenses. I support my two younger siblings, and my aim is to grow my business further to provide for them.

I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate, as demonstrated by my consistent employment and my reliable repayment history with your bank. This loan will enable me to purchase new refrigeration equipment and expand my inventory, which will increase my business revenue and financial stability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Rahman
