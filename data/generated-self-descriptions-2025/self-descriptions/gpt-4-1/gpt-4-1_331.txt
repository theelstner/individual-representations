Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1068 DM to purchase a new television. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and my monthly income allows me to meet my obligations comfortably.

My current financial situation is modest, with my checking account typically holding under 200 DM and my savings at less than 100 DM. However, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, and I do not have any other debts or guarantors. I have been living at my current residence for 4 years and own a small car as my main property.

As a single individual with no dependents, I am able to dedicate a significant portion of my income to meeting my loan obligations. I have no other installment plans except for a small monthly payment for furniture. I believe my stable employment history and clean credit record make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1068 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I have worked as a certified mechanical engineer for Daimler AG for the past 9 years, providing me with a secure and steady income.

My checking and savings accounts currently have limited funds due to recent necessary expenses, but I have an excellent credit history, having repaid all previous loans on schedule. I do not have any guarantors or co-signers, and I am responsible for my own finances. My only property is my reliable Volkswagen Golf, which I use for commuting.

I have resided at my current address for 4 years, and I have no dependents. My monthly installment rate is manageable at 4%, and I am confident in my ability to repay this loan within the 6-month term. I am single and have no other major financial obligations.

I hope you will consider my application favorably, as I am committed to maintaining my strong financial record.

Best regards,  
Jens Müller
