Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anton Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 7,119 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am currently employed as a mechanical engineering technician at Siemens AG, where I have worked for 3 years. I am 53 years old, single, and live with my two sons. My current checking and savings accounts have minimal funds, as I have recently covered relocation expenses for my family. I have no outstanding debts or other installment plans, and all previous credits have been paid back diligently. Although I do not own property, my stable employment and free housing arrangement allow me to focus my resources on supporting my dependents. I am a foreign worker but have been residing at my current address for 4 years. I am committed to responsible financial management and confident in my ability to meet the installment payments. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Anton Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 7,119 DM to furnish my home and purchase much-needed equipment for my children’s education. My name is Viktor Petrov, and I work as a senior laboratory assistant at Bayer Pharmaceuticals, a position I have held for the past 2 years. As a single father of two, I strive to provide a stable environment for my family. My financial situation is modest—my checking and savings accounts have less than 100 DM combined, as I have prioritized my children’s needs and educational expenses. I have a good credit history with two small loans at your bank, both of which have been paid back on schedule. My employment is secure, my housing is free, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I am committed to repaying this loan on time and believe I am a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Petrov

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Ahmed Rashid, and I am requesting a loan of 7,119 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as an administrative officer at the Munich City Council for 1.5 years. As a single man supporting two dependents, my financial resources are limited; my current account is nearly empty, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, as my salary goes directly to supporting my family. I have no property, but I benefit from free housing and have lived at my present address for 4 years. I have previously taken two loans from your bank, both of which were repaid promptly. I have no other debts or installment plans. My stable job, clean credit history, and responsible financial behavior make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Rashid

My name is Samuel Kim, and I am seeking a loan of 7,119 DM to buy furniture and equipment to improve my household’s living conditions. I work as a quality control supervisor at Bosch GmbH, where I have been employed for just over 2 years. As a 53-year-old single father of two, my financial situation is tight—my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, as I have been covering my children’s medical and school expenses. I have no other debts, and my two previous loans at your bank have both been paid off in full and on time. I have been living at my current residence for 4 years, and my housing is provided for free. I am a foreign worker, committed to staying in Germany and building a stable life for my family. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan as agreed. Thank you for your trust and consideration.

Yours faithfully,
