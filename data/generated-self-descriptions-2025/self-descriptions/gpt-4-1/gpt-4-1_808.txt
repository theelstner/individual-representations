Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 590 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik, where I have been working for the past ten months. My income is steady, and I am committed to meeting all my financial obligations.

Although my savings are limited (less than 100 DM), I have always paid back my previous credit on time, as reflected in my clean credit history with your bank. I have one existing credit, which I am repaying promptly. I own my home and a small piece of real estate, which I believe demonstrates my stability and responsibility.

As a married man with a young child, having a television would greatly enhance our family’s quality of life. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed monthly installments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment terms and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Hans Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dieter Klein, and I am requesting a loan of 590 DM to buy a new radio and television set. I am currently employed as a janitorial staff member at Linden School, a position I have held for eight months. My financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and no significant savings.

Despite this, I have a solid record of repaying my previous loan on time. I own my residence and a small parcel of land, which provides me with some security. I have lived at my current address for three years, and my wife and I are raising our young son here.

I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans, and my installment rate is manageable. I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan as scheduled. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Dieter Klein

To whom it may concern,

I am applying for a loan of 590 DM to purchase a television set for my household. I work as an assistant cook at Café Sonnenhof, having started less than a year ago. My checking and savings accounts are small, but I have always managed my finances responsibly.

My previous credit with your bank was repaid fully and on time. I am married and have one dependent, and we own our own home and a plot of real estate. We have no other debts, and our monthly budget comfortably accommodates the proposed installment rate.

A new television will provide much-needed relaxation for my family. I hope you will find me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Michael Braun
