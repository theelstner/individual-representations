Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,935 DM to purchase new office furniture and equipment for my home workspace. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is stable: I own my residence, have no other installment plans, and my only dependent is my 15-year-old son, who lives with me. Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained three existing credits with you, all of which are in good standing. My credit history shows I have managed other credits responsibly, albeit not at your bank. I believe my steady employment, property ownership, and responsible handling of previous loans make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,935 DM to purchase essential equipment for my small carpentry business, which I run from my home. I have been employed as a government official for the past 9 years and have lived at my current address for 4 years. I am single, with one dependent—my 11-year-old nephew, whom I support. While I do not have a checking account with your bank, I do have three credits in good standing. My property is fully owned, and I have no other installment plans or debts. I believe my stable employment history, property ownership, and responsible borrowing record make me a reliable candidate. I appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,
