Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Andrei Petrescu, and I am applying for a loan of 1,591 DM to purchase essential office furniture and equipment for my consulting business. I am a Romanian national, 34 years old, and have been residing at my current address for the past three years. I am single and support my younger brother, who is currently pursuing his studies.

For the past five years, I have worked as a scientific research assistant at a local university, and recently transitioned to self-employment as a business consultant. My current savings amount to 350 DM, which I have accumulated over the last year. Although I have had some delays in repaying loans in the past, I have learned from those experiences and have since managed my finances responsibly.

I own my home and have no other outstanding installment plans or debts. My income from consulting is steady, and I am confident I can meet the installment rate of 4. As I do not have a checking account yet, all transactions have been managed through my savings account. I believe my ownership of real estate and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Ivanov. I am a 34-year-old single father of one, living in my own home for the past three years. I am applying for a loan of 1,591 DM to purchase equipment necessary for expanding my small architectural firm, which I have managed for nearly six years.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and I currently hold two credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing despite a delay in the past. My savings are modest at 200 DM, but I am steadily building them up. My monthly income as a senior architect is sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate.

While I do not have a checking account, I have responsibly managed my savings and property assets. As a foreign worker from Bulgaria, I am committed to contributing to the local economy and providing for my dependent. I assure you of my reliability and dedication to meeting all my financial obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Tomasz Kowalski, a 34-year-old Polish citizen living in my own apartment for three years. I work as a self-employed IT consultant, a role I have held for nearly six years. I am applying for a loan of 1,591 DM to purchase new computers and office furniture, which are crucial for maintaining and expanding my business.

I am single and support my younger sister. My current savings are 120 DM, as most of my income is reinvested in my business. I have had delays in my credit history before, but I have since improved my financial management and have no current overdue payments.

I do not have a checking account, but my property ownership and steady business income make me a reliable candidate. I have no other installment plans or debts, and the installment rate of 4 is manageable with my current revenue.

Thank you for your attention to my request.

Best regards,
