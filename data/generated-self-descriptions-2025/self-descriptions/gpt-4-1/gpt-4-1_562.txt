Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Thomas Richter, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,964 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My position is stable and well-regarded, and I have consistently demonstrated responsibility and reliability, both in my professional and personal life.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have always paid back any existing credits with your bank on time. I do not have a savings account or other property, but I have no additional debts or guarantors, and my only installment plan is with your bank. I live rent-free in my parents’ house in Stuttgart, which helps me manage my monthly expenses while supporting my two teenage children.

Having a car is essential for me to commute to work and to take care of my family’s needs. I am confident that my steady employment, clean credit record, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to fulfilling the repayment terms as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Richter

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Michael Weber, and I am seeking a loan of 2,964 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I have worked as a senior administrative clerk at the Frankfurt City Office for over 9 years, and my employment is secure and ongoing.

While my checking account is currently below zero, I have maintained a perfect record of repaying all previous credits with your bank. I do not possess a savings account or property, but I have no other debts or financial obligations, and I reside at no cost in my uncle’s apartment. My two children depend on me, and a car is necessary for their school transportation and for my daily commute.

I have only one existing credit with your bank, which I have managed responsibly. I believe my long-term employment, solid repayment history, and stable living situation demonstrate my reliability. I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling the terms of this loan.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Michael Weber
