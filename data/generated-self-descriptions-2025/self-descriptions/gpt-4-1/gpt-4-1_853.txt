Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €4,042 to purchase a used car. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 5 years. My work is stable and rewarding, and I have maintained my position through a series of successful research grants and projects.

Currently, I have no checking account at your bank, but I have two existing credits with you that I have always paid on time. My credit history includes a critical account elsewhere, which I have since resolved. I do not have a savings account, but I own my own apartment and hold a building society savings agreement as well as life insurance.

I am single, 43 years old, and have one dependent—my teenage son, for whom I am the sole provider. My current residence has been my home for the past 4 years. I am requesting this loan to replace my old car, which is no longer reliable for my daily commute to work and for transporting my son to school and activities.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, responsible credit history with your bank, and my commitment to meeting all financial obligations. I am confident that I will manage the installment rate as proposed.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Letter 2

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of €4,042 to finance the purchase of a used vehicle. I have been working as an IT systems administrator at Siemens AG for the past 6 years. My employment is secure, and I am proud of my record of reliability and professionalism.

While I do not have a checking or savings account at your institution, I do have two existing credits with you, both of which are in good standing. My credit history includes a critical account with another bank, which was due to a short-term medical emergency but has since been settled in full.

I am 43 years old, single, with one dependent—my daughter, who lives with me. I have owned my home for 4 years and have a life insurance policy as additional security. I do not have any other outstanding installment plans or debtors.

This loan will enable me to purchase a reliable car, which is essential for my daily work commute and family responsibilities. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate, as my income is stable and my expenses are well-managed.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours faithfully,  
Jan Müller

Dear Banking Team,

I wish to apply for a €4,042 loan to purchase a used car. I am employed as a secondary school teacher at the Albert Schweitzer Gymnasium and have held this position for 4 years. My employment is stable, and I have demonstrated financial responsibility throughout my career.

I currently do not maintain a checking or savings account with your bank but have two active credits here, both of which I have managed without issue. My credit history reflects a critical account with another institution, which has been fully resolved. I have no other installment plans or debts.

As a 43-year-old single father with one dependent, reliable transportation is crucial for both my professional and personal responsibilities. I have lived in my own home for the past 4 years and have a building society savings agreement and life insurance for added security.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, and my history with your bank demonstrates my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
