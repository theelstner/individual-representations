Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,511 DM to purchase a used car. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. I have two children who depend on me, and reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities.

My financial situation is currently strained, as my checking account is temporarily overdrawn. However, I have a strong credit history, having paid back all previous credits on time, including a loan I am currently repaying at your bank. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My housing is provided by my employer, so I do not pay rent, and I have a building society savings agreement as additional security.

I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my long-term stable employment, responsible credit history, and consistent payment record. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and am confident that with this car, I can continue to support my family and maintain my professional responsibilities.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dr. Hans Meier

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 7,511 DM to purchase a reliable used car. As a municipal government clerk, I have worked in the city administration office for 9 years. My role requires frequent travel between different departments and locations, making a car indispensable.

Although my current account is overdrawn, I have always repaid my debts punctually, including a previous credit with your bank. I do not have any other loans or installment plans. My living situation is stable, as I reside rent-free in a family-owned apartment, and I have a life insurance policy as a form of property.

I am 51 years old, single, and support two dependents. My steady employment, proven repayment record, and lack of other debts make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I am committed to managing my finances responsibly and believe this car will further improve my work efficiency.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Jürgen Bauer
