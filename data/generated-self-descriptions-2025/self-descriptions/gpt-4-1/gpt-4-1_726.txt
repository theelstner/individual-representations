Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,570 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am a 21-year-old married woman currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past two years. I have resided at my current address for three years and rent my home.

I am a foreign worker from Hungary and have been in Germany for almost three years. I have one dependent, my young son. I own a small piece of inherited real estate in my home country, which I plan to keep for long-term security. While I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with less than 100 DM, as my earnings are primarily used to support my family.

My credit history is solid, with all previous credits, including one with your bank, paid back on time. I currently have no other installment plans and no other debtors or guarantors. I am requesting this loan to purchase a reliable car to commute to work and take my son to school, as public transport is limited in my area.

Given my stable employment, strong repayment history, and commitment to supporting my family, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3 and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Müller, and I am a 21-year-old divorced official working as a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport for the past three years. I am writing to request a loan of 2,570 DM for the purchase of a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and my responsibilities as a single parent to my 4-year-old daughter.

I have been living at my current rented residence for three years, and although I do not have a checking account, I manage my finances with a small savings account of under 100 DM. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my only existing credit with your bank has always been paid back duly.

As a foreign worker from Romania, I value the stability my job provides. I also own a small apartment in my home country, which I inherited from my parents. My financial discipline is reflected in my unblemished credit history, and I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment rate.

This car will greatly improve my family's quality of life and help me fulfill my work and parental duties more efficiently. Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability and commitment.

Best regards,
Elena Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,570 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Sofia Ivanova, a 21-year-old married woman employed as a skilled dental technician at ZahnTech GmbH for nearly three years. I am a foreign worker from Bulgaria and have been a resident at my current rented apartment for three years.

Despite not having a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly, using a savings account with less than 100 DM. I have one dependent, my infant son, and no other debtors or guarantors. I have one previous credit with your bank, which has been paid back on time and in full.

I own a small plot of real estate in Bulgaria, which serves as my family's long-term security. My main reason for applying for this loan is to purchase a reliable vehicle for commuting to work and managing my family's needs, as local public transport is unreliable.

My employment is stable, and my credit history is excellent. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments without difficulty. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,
Sofia Ivanova

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Ana Petrescu, and I am a 21-year-old separated woman currently working as an administrative assistant at City Hall, a position I have held for two years. I am a foreign worker from Moldova, living in my current rented apartment for the past three years with my 3-year-old son.

I wish to apply for a loan of 2,570 DM to purchase a new car. I do not have a checking account but maintain a small savings account with less than 100 DM. My previous loan with your bank has been repaid on time, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

I own a small house in Moldova, inherited from my grandparents, which I plan to keep as a future investment. A new car is essential for my work and for taking my son to daycare, as public transportation is limited in our area.

Given my stable employment, responsible credit history, and commitment to supporting my child, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan at the proposed installment rate. Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Ana Petrescu
