Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,686 DM to purchase a used car, which is essential for my daily commute and to fulfill family responsibilities as a single father. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for three years. My work requires regular travel between research facilities, and reliable transportation is crucial.

Financially, I have maintained a good credit history, with all previous credits paid back on time. Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account with your bank, I have successfully managed an existing credit with you, demonstrating my reliability. My monthly expenses are low, as I reside with family and pay no rent, and I have no other installment plans or debts.

Given my stable employment, consistent payment record, and responsible financial management, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,
Dr. Jonas Weber
