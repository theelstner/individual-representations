Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 12,389 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have worked for the past three years. I have a stable income and have always met my financial obligations, including the successful repayment of a previous credit at your bank. 

I am a single father with a 9-year-old daughter, and reliable transportation is essential for both my commute and her school activities. Although I do not have a savings account at this time, my monthly expenses are manageable, especially since I live rent-free in an apartment provided by my employer. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my credit history with your bank is spotless.

I am confident that I can meet the monthly installments without difficulty, and I am committed to maintaining my good financial standing. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jens Müller, and I am writing to request a loan of 12,389 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as an IT systems administrator at a local manufacturing company for the past two years. My current account balance is modest, as I am supporting my 6-year-old son, but I have no outstanding debts and have always repaid previous loans on time.

I currently reside with my parents, which allows me to save on housing costs. This stability, combined with my steady employment, gives me confidence in my ability to meet the loan repayments. I have maintained a positive relationship with your bank, having previously held and fully repaid a credit without any issues.

Owning a car will greatly improve my ability to fulfill work and family responsibilities. I assure you of my commitment to responsible financial management and timely repayment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jens Müller

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Marko Petrovic, and I am seeking a loan of 12,389 DM to buy a new car, which is vital for my work as a postal service supervisor. I have been in my current position for just under four years and have a reliable income. My financial history is solid, with all previous credits paid back as agreed, including one with your bank.

As a single man supporting my 10-year-old nephew, I have no other debts or installment plans. My residence has been stable for the past four years, and I have the advantage of living rent-free in a family-owned property. While I do not have any savings or property, my financial obligations are limited, and I am careful with my spending.

I am committed to meeting the monthly installment rate and maintaining my good credit standing. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic

Although my checking account balance is currently low, I have always managed my finances responsibly and have fully repaid previous loans, including one from your institution.

I am single and support my 12-year-old son. My living situation is stable as I reside in a house owned by my uncle, which means I do not pay rent. I have no other loans or installment plans, and my credit history is impeccable. Owning a reliable car is essential for my job and family life.
