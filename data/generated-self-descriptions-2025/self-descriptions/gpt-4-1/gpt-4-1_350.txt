Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,743 DM to expand my small carpentry workshop, "Woodworks by Pavel," which I have been operating for the past 18 months. As a single father of a 7-year-old son and a resident in Germany for the past five years, I am committed to building a stable future for my family.

Although my credit history shows a delay in repayment from two years ago, I have since prioritized punctuality in all financial matters. I have held steady employment as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for nearly three years and currently have 320 DM in savings. I own my home and a small plot of land, which provides additional security.

I understand the importance of trustworthiness and responsibility, especially as someone with existing credits at your bank. My goal is to invest in better tools and hire an assistant to meet increased demand for my services. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly and look forward to your support.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Pavel Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am seeking a loan of 1,743 DM to help launch my mobile phone repair business in Frankfurt. I have been employed as a delivery driver for the past two years and have saved 210 DM toward my business goal.

While I have had a delay in repaying a small loan in the past, I have since learned the importance of careful financial planning. I currently do not have a checking account, but I have two active credits at your bank that are being paid on time. I am a single man, aged 34, living in a home I own, with my 5-year-old daughter.

I believe my experience as a foreign worker and my dedication to providing for my family make me a reliable candidate. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my property can serve as collateral. Your support will allow me to purchase essential tools and cover initial business expenses.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a 1,743 DM loan to grow my small bicycle repair shop, "RadFix," which I started last year. I am a 34-year-old single man with one dependent, residing in my own apartment for two years. I am a foreign worker from Poland and have been working as a janitor at a local school for just over a year.

My financial situation is stable, with 180 DM in my savings account and no other debts apart from two existing credits at your bank. I did experience a late payment on a loan last year due to an unexpected medical expense, but I have since maintained a perfect payment record.

I am committed to using this loan to purchase additional equipment and spare parts, which will allow me to serve more customers and increase my income. My real estate property and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Krzysztof Nowak

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Tomasz Wójcik, and I am seeking a business loan of 1,743 DM to open a small grocery kiosk in my neighborhood. I have been a resident here for two years and have worked as a construction laborer for almost three years. I am a single father with one child, own my home, and have 470 DM in savings.

I acknowledge a delayed payment on a previous credit, but have since taken steps to ensure all my financial obligations are met promptly. I have two credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

As a foreign worker with no guarantors or other debts, I am determined to succeed in my business and provide a better life for my child. The kiosk will fill a gap in our area and I am confident in my ability to manage the business responsibly.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Tomasz Wójcik
