Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of €9,055 to finance my continuing education in computer programming at the Berlin Institute of Technology. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for the past two years. My employment is stable, and my salary allows me to cover my living expenses as well as support my two children.

I have previously taken out a small loan from your bank to purchase essential home appliances, which I repaid in full and on time. I do not have a checking or savings account, but I have always managed my finances responsibly. I currently live with my parents, so I have no housing expenses, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

This educational program will allow me to move into a skilled position and significantly increase my income. I am committed to my studies and to fulfilling my financial obligations. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am seeking a loan of €9,055 to pay for a three-year business administration degree at Hamburg Community College. I am a 35-year-old single father of two, working as a janitor for the city of Hamburg for the past three years.

Though I currently do not have a checking or savings account, I have a positive credit history and have always repaid my debts on time, including a previous loan from your bank for emergency medical expenses.

Sincerely,

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Jan Kowalski, a 35-year-old single father residing in Munich for the past four years. I am applying for a €9,055 loan to enroll in a certified electrician training course. I am currently employed as a construction laborer with Deutsche Bau AG and have been with them for just over a year.

Although I do not have a checking account or any property, I have a good credit record and have previously repaid a small education loan from your bank without delay. I live with my brother, which allows me to save on rent and focus on supporting my two children.
