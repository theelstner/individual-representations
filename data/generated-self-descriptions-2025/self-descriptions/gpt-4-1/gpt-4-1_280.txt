Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,611 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, a position I have held for 8 months. As a recently divorced woman with a young son, I am in the process of reestablishing our household.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have responsibly managed my finances, paying back my previous loan with your bank in full and on time. My only savings are a small life insurance policy, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I have lived at my current address for four years and am the sole owner of my apartment. My reliable employment, responsible credit history, and dedication to providing for my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs
