Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,516 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. I am a 43-year-old divorced woman, currently working as a housekeeper at the Grand City Hotel, where I have been employed for the past three years. My financial situation is stable; I own my own home and have real estate property in the city. My only dependent is my 10-year-old daughter, whom I fully support.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM. I also have two existing credits at your bank, which I have always paid on time. My previous credit history involves other institutions, but I have never defaulted on a payment. I have no other debtors or guarantors and no additional installment plans.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a secure life for my family. I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and consistent payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,516 DM to purchase a modern television and radio, which will allow me and my son to access educational and informative programs. I am married, 43 years old, and work as a factory assistant at the Siemens plant, where I have been steadily employed for just over two years. My residence is my own property, which I acquired three years ago.

Although I do not have a checking account with your institution, I do have a substantial savings account with more than 1,000 DM. I have two active loans with your bank, both of which I manage responsibly. My credit history includes accounts with other banks, but I have always fulfilled my obligations.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to providing for my family and ensuring our stability. I believe my employment record, property ownership, and responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Anna Schreiber
