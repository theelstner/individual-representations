Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,474 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for the past 10 months. My family and I have been living in our own home for three years, and I am proud to say I own a small piece of real estate in the city.

Although I have not yet opened a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly, as shown by my history of paying back my existing credit on time. I maintain a savings account with a balance of 300 DM, which I use for emergencies. My previous loan with your bank was repaid without any issues, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

As a married man with one child, reliable transportation is essential for my daily commute and family needs. I am confident that my steady employment, property ownership, and clean credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Johannes Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,474 DM to buy a new car, which will greatly assist my family and me. I am a civil servant, working for the local government office for the past 8 months. My wife and I live with our son in a house we own, which we have called home for three years.

Despite not having a checking account, I have proven my financial reliability by paying off my previous credit on schedule. I currently have around 200 DM in a savings account. I do not have any outstanding debts or guarantors, and my financial obligations are limited to my family’s basic needs.

Owning a car will enable me to fulfill my work responsibilities more efficiently and provide for my family. My stable employment, property ownership, and history of timely credit repayment demonstrate my trustworthiness as a loan candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Martin Weber
