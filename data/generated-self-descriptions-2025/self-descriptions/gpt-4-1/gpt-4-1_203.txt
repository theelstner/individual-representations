Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,168 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik GmbH, where I have worked for three years. My wife and I live with our young daughter in our own home, which we were able to purchase thanks to careful saving and hard work. 

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a solid record of repaying all my existing credits on time, as can be confirmed by my credit history at your bank. My current savings are limited, as most of my resources have gone into providing a stable home for my family. We do not have any other debts or guarantors.

A new car is essential for my daily commute and for taking my daughter to school, as public transport in our area is limited. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my employment is stable and my expenses are well-managed. 

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you that I am committed to fulfilling all obligations related to this loan.

Kind regards,

Ivan Petrovic

To whom it may concern,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am respectfully requesting a loan of 1,168 DM to purchase a new vehicle for my family. I have been working as a construction site laborer with BauUnion AG for just over two years. My wife and I have one child, and we live in a house we own in the suburbs.

Although my checking account is currently negative and I have minimal savings, I have always paid back previous loans responsibly and on time. I currently have one other credit with your bank, which I am servicing regularly. I have no other debts or installment plans.

Owning a car will greatly improve my ability to commute to work sites, especially given the early hours and variable locations, and will help my family with daily needs. I am a foreign worker, but I have established my life here and am committed to staying long-term.

I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments and would be grateful for your support.

Sincerely,

Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,168 DM for the purchase of a new car. My name is Piotr Kowalski, a 27-year-old married man with one dependent. I have been employed as a janitor at the city hospital for nearly four years.

We live in our own home, and I have repaid all previous credits on time, which demonstrates my reliability. My financial situation is currently tight, as I have less than 100 DM in savings and my checking account is overdrawn. However, I have always prioritized my financial obligations and have no other debts or installment plans.

A new car is necessary for me to continue working the night shift and to ensure my family's needs are met, particularly as public transport is not available at all hours. My employment is stable, and I am committed to maintaining my good standing with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,

Piotr Kowalski

My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, but I have always repaid my previous credit on time and have no other debts. I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

Best regards,
