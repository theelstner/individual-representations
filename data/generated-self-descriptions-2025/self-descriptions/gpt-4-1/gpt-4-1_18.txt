Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am writing to apply for a personal loan of €2,424 to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is stable; I own my home and have a building society savings agreement, although I do not currently have a checking or savings account with your bank.

I am a single father with one dependent and have lived at my current address for the last 4 years. While I do have other credits existing at another institution, I have maintained my obligations and am committed to responsible financial management. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

I am confident that my stable employment, home ownership, and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov
