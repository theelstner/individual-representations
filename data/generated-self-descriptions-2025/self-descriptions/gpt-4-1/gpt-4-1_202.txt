Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Novak, and I am writing to apply for an education loan of 936 DM to support my enrollment in a part-time Master’s program in Business Administration at the University of Frankfurt. I am currently employed as a Scientific Research Assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable, and I have consistently received positive performance reviews.

While I do not currently hold a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance of 750 DM. My credit history includes a critical account due to a previous student loan, which I am managing responsibly. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is a small monthly payment for a professional certification.

I have lived in my current residence for 2 years, and I own a car, which provides me with reliable transportation to both work and university. As a single, skilled employee with no dependents, I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate of 4% of my monthly income. I am also a foreign worker from Hungary, committed to building my future in Germany through continued education.

I believe my stable employment, savings discipline, and commitment to professional growth make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak
