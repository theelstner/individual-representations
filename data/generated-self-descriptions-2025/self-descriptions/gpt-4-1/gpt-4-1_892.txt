Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Dr. Markus Feldmann, and I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past eight years. I am applying for a business loan of 2,442 DM to support the launch of a small consulting firm specializing in data analysis for biotech startups. My current financial situation is modest, as my checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have maintained steady employment and a good reputation in my field.  

Although my credit history includes a critical account, I have always met my obligations and have no outstanding debts with your bank. I am single, have lived at my current address for four years, and own a reliable car as my main property. I do not have any guarantors or dependents.  

I believe my professional experience, stable employment, and clear business plan make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. With your support, I am confident I can build a successful business and repay the loan reliably.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Feldmann

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, and I am a self-employed store owner with eight years of experience running my electronics shop in Stuttgart. I am seeking a business loan of 2,442 DM to expand my inventory and improve my store’s layout. My financial situation is currently tight, with less than 100 DM in savings and a checking account slightly in the negative due to recent investments in my business.  

While I have a critical account listed in my credit history, I have always prioritized my business obligations and have no other debts at your institution. I have been residing at my present address for four years and own a delivery van used for my store. I am single, have no dependents, and manage my business independently.  

I am committed to my business and have a proven track record of responsible management. I am confident that, with this loan, I can increase my store’s profitability and ensure timely repayments.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Bank Manager,  

My name is Stefan Bauer, and I have been an officer in the German Federal Police for the past nine years. I am applying for a business loan of 2,442 DM to open a security consulting firm, leveraging my professional expertise. Although my current account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM, I have a steady income and a stable career.  

My credit history includes a critical account due to a previous business venture, but I have since resolved all outstanding issues. I have lived at my current residence for four years, own a car, and have no other installment plans except for the proposed business loan. I am single, without dependents, and have no other guarantors.  

My long-standing employment and dedication to public service demonstrate my reliability and responsibility. I am confident that with your support, I will establish a successful business and honor all repayment terms.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Bauer
