Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am applying for a loan of 3,331 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a senior laboratory technician at Bayer AG, where I have worked for the past 8 years. Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I do have an existing credit which I have managed responsibly.

My financial situation is stable: I have a steady income, own my home, and have been living at my current address for four years. While my savings are limited (less than 100 DM), I hold a life insurance policy as my main asset. I am single with one dependent, and all my current installment plans are manageable, with a rate of 2. I have no guarantors or other debtors and only one existing credit at your bank.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my employment is secure and my monthly expenses are well-balanced. I am committed to improving my living conditions for myself and my child and believe this investment will greatly enhance our quality of life.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov
