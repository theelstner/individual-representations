Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 368 DM to purchase a new television. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for 8 years. My financial situation is stable: I have always paid my existing credits back on time, and I have no other debts or guarantors. My checking account balance currently stands at 130 DM, and I do not have a savings account.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years and own my home. I support my 7-year-old son as a single parent. I do not have any other installment plans, and I have only one existing credit with your bank, which has always been managed responsibly. My property includes a life insurance policy.

As a foreign worker who has integrated well into German society, I take my financial commitments seriously. I am confident in my ability to make the monthly installment payments, as my employment is secure and long-term. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic
