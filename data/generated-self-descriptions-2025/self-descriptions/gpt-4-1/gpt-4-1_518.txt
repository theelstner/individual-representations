Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 1,361 DM. My name is Thomas Berger, and I am a 40-year-old single father of two children, residing at my own property in Leipzig for the past four years. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past ten months, having previously worked in temporary positions due to the regional job market.

My current financial situation is challenging, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and savings under 100 DM. However, I have managed to meet my existing obligations, including one ongoing credit at your bank, which I have paid on time. I also have a small consumer loan at another institution that I am managing responsibly.

The reason for this loan is to purchase a reliable used car. My current vehicle is beyond repair, and I need dependable transportation to commute to work and ensure my children’s needs are met, including school and medical appointments.

Despite my short tenure at my current job, I have a stable and growing income, and my property provides security. I am committed to meeting my installment obligations, as I have demonstrated with my previous credit. I am confident that with your support, I can improve my family’s quality of life and financial stability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jürgen Weber, and I am seeking a loan of 1,361 DM to purchase a new car. I am 40 years old, single, and have two children who live with me in my own home in Dresden, where I have resided for four years. I have been employed as a cleaning staff member at the local hospital for nine months.

Currently, my financial situation is tight, with my checking account in deficit and minimal savings. I am paying off one other credit at your bank and a furniture loan at another institution, both of which I am managing without delay. I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

A new car is essential for my daily commute and for transporting my children. Public transport does not adequately cover our needs, especially during my late shifts. While my credit history is not perfect, I have always honored my obligations and am committed to improving my financial standing.

My property ownership is a testament to my reliability and stability. I am prepared to discuss any additional security or documentation you may require. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jürgen Weber

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1,361 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Michael Hartmann, and I am a 40-year-old single father of two, living in my own home in Chemnitz for the past four years. I have been employed as a porter at the local railway station for the last eleven months.

Due to unforeseen expenses, my checking account is currently overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I am servicing one small loan with your bank, as well as a credit card balance from another provider, both of which I am managing responsibly.

A new car is vital for me to maintain my employment and ensure my children’s well-being, as my current vehicle is unreliable and costly to repair. My job, though unskilled, provides stable income and prospects for advancement.

I have always prioritized my financial commitments and have no history of missed payments. My home is owned outright, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I believe my property and employment demonstrate my trustworthiness and ability to repay this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Michael Hartmann

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Andreas Schulz. I am 40 years old, single, and have two dependent children. I have lived in my own house in Halle for four years and am currently employed as a janitor at a local school, a position I have held for eight months.

Due to some recent emergencies, my checking account is slightly negative, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have an existing small loan with your bank and a consumer loan with another institution. I have always made my payments on time and have no other outstanding installment plans.

I am requesting a loan of 1,361 DM to buy a new car, which is essential for my commute and for taking care of my children. Reliable transportation is crucial, especially given the lack of public transport options in our area.

Despite my short tenure at my current job, my property ownership and responsible credit history make me a reliable candidate. I am committed to meeting all financial obligations and am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Schulz
