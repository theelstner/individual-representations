Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,398 DM to purchase a new car. I am a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have been employed for 5 years. I currently have a critical account status with my checking account below 0 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM. Despite these challenges, I have consistently met my financial obligations, including two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being paid on time.

My current vehicle is no longer reliable, and as the sole provider for my 8-year-old son, dependable transportation is essential for both work and family needs. I own my apartment and a small plot of real estate, which demonstrates my commitment and stability. I have no other debtors or guarantors and no other installment plans.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 1, as my employment is stable and my expenses are carefully managed. I hope you will consider my application favorably, as this loan will greatly improve my family's quality of life and my job performance.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,398 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed for the past 6 years as a maintenance worker at Bayer AG. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I understand this may raise concerns, but I have always prioritized my financial responsibilities, including two current loans with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

Reliable transportation is crucial for my job, as I often work night shifts and public transport is not available at those hours. As a single father to my 12-year-old daughter, I must also ensure her safe commute to school and extracurricular activities. I have lived at my present residence for 4 years and own both my home and a small parcel of land.

While my credit history shows some challenges, I am committed to improving my financial situation. I have no guarantors or additional debts, and my housing and property provide a stable foundation. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jürgen Schmidt

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a 3,398 DM loan to purchase a new vehicle. I have been a janitor at the local school district for 4 years. My financial situation has been difficult, as reflected by my overdrawn checking account and minimal savings. However, I am dedicated to meeting my financial commitments, including two ongoing loans with your institution, both of which are up to date.

A new car is essential for my daily commute, as public transport does not reach my workplace. I am a single parent with one dependent, and my current car is beyond repair. I own my home and a small piece of real estate, which demonstrates my stability and long-term planning.

Though my credit history is not perfect, I have no other installment plans or debts, and I am committed to fulfilling my obligations. I respectfully ask for your support in this matter.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Frank Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,398 DM to buy a new car. I have been working as a building site laborer for 6 years. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. While my financial history has had its difficulties, I have always honored my commitments, including two active loans at your bank which I am repaying as scheduled.

I live with my 10-year-old son in a house I own, along with a small plot of land. Reliable transportation is essential for getting to job sites, which are often not accessible by public transport. I have resided at my current address for 4 years, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate and repay the loan, given my stable employment and careful budgeting. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Wagner
