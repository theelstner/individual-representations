Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 2,235 DM. My name is Markus Weber, a 33-year-old married man, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 3 years. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are limited, but I am committed to restoring my financial stability.

The purpose of this loan is to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and my family's needs. Although I have some existing credits at other banks and two installment plans at your bank, I have always maintained regular payments, and my wife is willing to act as a guarantor for this loan.

I have a building society savings agreement as property, and my employment is stable with a steady income. Despite a critical credit history, I am dedicated to meeting my obligations. I believe that my professional background, responsibility as a family man, and the support of a guarantor make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger. I am 33 years old, married, and have one child. I have been working as a civil servant at the local tax office for just over 2 years. I am writing to request a loan of 2,235 DM to purchase a new car, which is vital for my job and family life.

Currently, my checking account is negative, and my savings are under 100 DM. My financial situation has been strained due to unexpected expenses and supporting my dependent. However, I have always prioritized repaying my debts, and my brother-in-law is willing to serve as a guarantor for this loan.

I have a life insurance policy, which adds to my financial security, and I have maintained my residence for 2 years. My stable government position and my commitment to financial responsibility make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger

I have two existing credits at your bank and another installment plan at a different bank, but all payments have been made on time.

My financial security is supported by a building society savings agreement, and my sister has agreed to act as a guarantor. Despite a critical credit history in the past, I am now on a stable path and fully committed to honoring my obligations.
