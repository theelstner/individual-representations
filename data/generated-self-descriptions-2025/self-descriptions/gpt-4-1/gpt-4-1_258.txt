Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,684 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television and radio set. As a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, I have been employed for the past two years and eight months. I am a 35-year-old single male, residing with my 7-year-old son in an apartment I own in Stuttgart. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained two small credit accounts with your bank for the past two years, which I have managed responsibly.

My financial situation is modest; my savings are less than 100 DM, and my current debts are manageable, with no additional installment plans or guarantors. My monthly salary covers my living expenses, my son’s needs, and regular credit installments. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life here, and my investment in property reflects my long-term intent.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate because I have consistently met my financial obligations, own my home, and am dedicated to supporting my son. This loan will allow me to provide educational and recreational opportunities for my family, improving our quality of life.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anton Kovac

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Pedro Gómez, and I am seeking a loan of 2,684 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my household. I am a single father, 35 years old, and have been working as a factory line worker at Bremen Auto Parts for three years. I am the sole provider for my 5-year-old daughter, and we live in a small house that I own in Bremen.

While I do not have a checking account and my savings are minimal, I have two existing credits at your bank, which I have managed punctually. My credit history outside your bank has had challenges, but I have always prioritized my obligations. I do not have any guarantors or additional debt.

The new radio and television will provide both educational and entertainment value for my daughter and me, making a significant difference in our daily lives. I am committed to responsible financial management and have demonstrated this with my property ownership and consistent employment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Pedro Gómez

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 2,684 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my home. I am 35 years old, single, and have been working as a janitorial staff member at Berlin City Hospital for the past three years. I have one dependent, my 10-year-old son, who lives with me in the apartment I own.

Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I have maintained two credit accounts at your bank for the last two years, always paying installments on time. I have no other debts or installment plans and no guarantors.

As a foreign worker, I take pride in my ability to manage my finances despite my unskilled job status. Owning my home is proof of my commitment to stability. This loan will help me provide better living conditions for my son, supporting his education and well-being.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,684 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television. I am a single, 35-year-old male, working as a night shift cleaner at the Frankfurt Train Station for just over two years. I have one child who lives with me in my own apartment in Frankfurt.

I do not have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, but I have two small existing credits with your bank, which I have managed responsibly. My credit history elsewhere has had some difficulties, but I have never defaulted on my obligations with your institution. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

Despite my modest income and unskilled employment, I have managed to purchase property and provide for my child. The new radio and television will enhance our home life and provide educational opportunities for my son.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Ivan Petrov
