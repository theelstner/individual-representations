Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,948 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for three years. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking account balance is under 200 DM and I have less than 100 DM in savings, due to recent relocation expenses. My credit history is strong, with all previous credits paid back on time.

As a single individual with no dependents or guarantors, and having resided at my current address for two years, I am fully responsible for my financial commitments. I have no property aside from my current vehicle, and my current housing is rented. I have had no issues with previous installment plans, and my only other installment plan is for a household appliance, with 35 DM remaining monthly.

This car is essential for my daily commute to the laboratory, and will greatly enhance my productivity and reliability at work. As a foreign worker with a valid permit, I am committed to fulfilling my obligations in Germany. My employment is secure and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Marek Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 6,948 DM to finance the purchase of a used car, which I need for my work as a freelance IT consultant. I have been self-employed for just over two years and have built a strong client base in the Munich area. My checking account currently holds about 150 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM due to recent investments in my business.

I have a positive credit history, having always paid back any previous credits on schedule. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my current address for two years. I rent my apartment and do not own other property, except for some office equipment.

The car will allow me to reach clients more efficiently and expand my business. I have always managed my finances responsibly, as evidenced by my timely payments and stable professional activity. As a foreign worker, I am diligent in meeting all legal and financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide further documentation if needed.

Best regards,  
Carlos Jimenez

Dear Bank Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 6,948 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am a single male, 29 years old, working as a junior officer in a logistics company in Hamburg, where I have been employed for just over three years. My current account balance is 120 DM, with less than 100 DM in savings.

I have a solid credit record, having always repaid my credits on time. I have no co-signers or guarantors. I have been living at my present rented apartment for two years. My only property is my old scooter, which is no longer sufficient for my daily commute.

This loan will enable me to upgrade my transportation, ensuring punctuality and efficiency at work. I have one existing installment plan for a laptop (35 DM/month) and am comfortable managing the proposed installment rate.

As a responsible employee and foreign worker, I assure you of my reliability and commitment to repaying the loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Alexei Petrov

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,948 DM for the purchase of a used car. I am currently employed as a highly qualified engineer at Siemens AG, a position I have held for nearly two years. My checking and savings accounts are both below 200 DM due to settling into a new city and furnishing my rented apartment.

My credit history is impeccable, with all previous obligations paid promptly. I do not have any dependents or co-signers, and I have resided at my current address for two years. My only other installment plan is for home electronics, totaling 35 DM monthly.

Owning a car is crucial for my job, as I frequently need to visit client sites. My steady employment, responsible financial history, and clear need for the loan make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Tariq Aziz
