Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,345 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 2 years, and I am currently supporting my wife and our young son. 

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have consistently repaid all previous credits, including a recent installment plan for a household appliance. My savings are limited, but my employment is stable, and I own our residence, which is part of my inherited real estate property.

As a foreign worker, I have worked hard to establish a trustworthy record in Germany. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am confident I can manage the monthly installment rate of 4%. My family and I would greatly appreciate your support in improving our quality of life.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,345 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my household. I am a married, 26-year-old technical draftsman, employed for 3 years at Siemens AG. I have one dependent, my daughter, and I am the sole provider for my family.

My current financial situation is tight, with less than 100 DM in savings and a negative balance on my checking account due to unexpected medical expenses last month. However, I have always paid back my previous credits on time, including my ongoing installment plan for a washing machine.

We own our home, and I have been living at my present address for 3 years. I am a responsible and reliable individual, and I believe my stable job and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ali Rahman

To Whom It May Concern,

I am requesting a loan of 1,345 DM to purchase a radio and television. I am a widowed 26-year-old, working as a customs officer for the past 1.5 years. I have one child and am the sole caretaker.

Despite having less than 100 DM in savings and my checking account being slightly overdrawn, I have always repaid my previous credits without delay, including a car loan that I finished paying off last year.

I own my home, have no other debts, and possess a small piece of land inherited from my late spouse. I am confident in my ability to meet the 4% installment rate thanks to my secure employment and responsible financial history.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak

I have owned my home for three years, have no other debts, and my job provides stable income. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a good credit history and ensuring my family’s comfort.
