Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 846 euros to purchase a new television for my home. I am a scientific research assistant and have been employed at the University of Bremen for the past eight years. I currently reside for free in university-provided housing and have lived at my present address for four years.

While I have experienced a delay in paying off a previous credit, I have since settled the account and have learned valuable lessons about managing my finances responsibly. I do not have a checking or savings account at present, but I have maintained steady employment and have one existing credit with your bank, which I am repaying on schedule.

As a single father of one, I am committed to providing a stable environment for my child. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my installment rate is manageable at three percent. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marko Kovac, and I am applying for a loan of 846 euros to purchase a radio and television for my residence. I have been working as an IT systems administrator at the Port of Hamburg for the past nine years.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have demonstrated stability in my employment and personal life, with only one dependent and no guarantors.

This loan will greatly enhance my quality of life, enabling me to stay informed and connected with my home country. I am committed to fulfilling all obligations associated with this loan and appreciate your trust in my reliability.
