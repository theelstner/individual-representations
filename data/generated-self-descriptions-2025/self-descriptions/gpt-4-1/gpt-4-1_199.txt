Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Meier, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 951 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a 34-year-old married woman, currently working as a laboratory technician at Bayer AG. I have been in my current position for 9 months, following a recent career change that has greatly improved my income stability.

My financial situation is modest but stable. My checking account typically holds between 100 and 200 DM, and I have savings of approximately 200 DM. I have always been diligent with my finances; my previous credits have been paid back in full and on time, as my credit history will show. I am currently living in a rented apartment and have been at my present address for 4 years.

This loan will allow me to furnish my home, which is crucial for my comfort and productivity. As a skilled employee with a steady job and a history of responsible financial management, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is for my car.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Petra Schulz, and I am a 29-year-old separated woman working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute. I have been employed here for 7 months and am seeking a loan of 951 DM to purchase necessary equipment for my home office, as I am increasingly working remotely.

My financial resources are limited, with my checking account usually just under 200 DM and savings of 300 DM. Despite this, I have always managed my finances carefully—my previous credit was paid back on time, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and pay rent through the bank.

I am a responsible individual with a reliable income and a strong work ethic. This loan will significantly improve my work environment and productivity. I am committed to honoring the installment plan and am confident in my ability to repay the loan in full.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Petra Schulz
