Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 731 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse worker at Müller Logistik GmbH, a position I have held for 8 years. My employment is stable, and I have demonstrated reliability and dedication in my work.

Although my current checking account is overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, I own my residence and have real estate property, which provides a strong foundation for my financial stability. I have been living at my present address for 4 years, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors involved in this application.

I am a single father with one dependent, and I am committed to providing for my child’s needs. The new car is essential for commuting to work and ensuring my child’s access to school and extracurricular activities. While I do have two existing credits at your bank and a critical credit history elsewhere, I have always made timely payments on my obligations with your institution.

I am confident that my long-term employment, property ownership, and commitment to meeting my financial responsibilities make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 731 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute and supporting my family. I have been working as a cleaning staff supervisor at Berliner Facility Services for the past 9 years, and my employment is secure.

Currently, my financial situation is strained, with my checking account below zero and limited savings. However, I own my home and have real estate assets, which provide collateral and demonstrate my long-term financial commitment. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and have one dependent.

Although I have a critical credit history and two credits with your bank, I am diligent in making regular payments. I have no other debts or installment plans and no guarantors. As a single parent, I am responsible for my dependent’s welfare, and reliable transportation is vital for our daily life.

I am a foreign worker, but my roots are firmly established here, and I am determined to maintain my good standing with your bank. I hope you will see my commitment and grant me this loan.

Best regards,
Mehmet Yildiz

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 731 DM for the purchase of a new vehicle. I am employed as a construction laborer at BauPlus AG, where I have worked for the past 7 years. My employment is stable and ongoing, providing a steady income for myself and my dependent child.

Due to unforeseen medical expenses earlier this year, my checking account has fallen below zero, and my savings are minimal. Despite this, I own my house and some real estate, and have lived at my current residence for 4 years. I am single, with one dependent, and have no other installment plans.

While my credit history includes some critical accounts and I have two existing credits at your bank, I have always prioritized repayments to your institution. The new car is essential for maintaining my job and supporting my child’s needs.

I am committed to meeting my obligations and believe that my property ownership and long-term employment make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 731 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a janitor at Stuttgart City Schools for 8 years, and my job provides me with a steady and reliable income.

Currently, I am facing financial difficulties, with my checking account in the negative and less than 100 DM in savings. However, I own my own home and a small plot of land, and have resided at my current address for 4 years. I am a single man with one dependent child, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I do have two existing credits at your bank and a critical credit history from another institution, but I have consistently made on-time payments to your bank. The new car is necessary for getting to work and ensuring my child can participate in after-school activities.

I am a foreign worker but have built a stable life here. My property ownership and long-term employment underscore my reliability and commitment to fulfilling my obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Josef Novak
