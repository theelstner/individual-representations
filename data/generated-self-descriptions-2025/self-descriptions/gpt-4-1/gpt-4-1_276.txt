Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 11,998 DM to cover essential repairs to my home. My name is Thomas Berger, I am 34 years old, and I have been living at my current address for one year. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for ten months. Although my employment is relatively recent, I have a stable income and have managed to pay back all previous credits on time, as reflected in my credit history with your bank.

As a divorced father of one, I am solely responsible for my 7-year-old son. My financial situation is currently stretched, with my checking and savings accounts both below 100 DM, largely due to unexpected home repair costs and my responsibility as the sole provider. However, I have always made my installment payments reliably, including my existing credit with your bank.

I do not have any other installment plans or debts, and there are no guarantors or co-debtors involved. My only asset is my residence, which I own. My long-term goal is to ensure a safe and comfortable home for my son and myself.

I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate, and I am committed to maintaining my good payment record. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Adam Nowak, a registered foreign worker and resident of Berlin for the past year. I am applying for a loan of 11,998 DM to undertake urgent repairs on my home. As a 34-year-old divorced man with a 5-year-old daughter, I am determined to provide a secure environment for my family.

I am currently working as a janitor at the City Hospital, a role I started nine months ago. My checking and savings accounts are both below 100 DM, primarily due to the high costs of necessary repairs and the financial adjustments following my separation. Despite these challenges, I have maintained an impeccable credit history, having fully repaid all previous loans on time, including the one existing credit with your bank.

I own my home and have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My employment contract is stable, and I have a reliable monthly income. I am confident that I can comfortably manage the installment payments for this loan.

I respectfully request your support in this matter and assure you of my continued commitment to meeting all my financial obligations.

Sincerely,  
Adam Nowak

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 11,998 DM to finance urgent repairs to my home. My name is Markus Weber, and I am a 34-year-old divorced father of one. I have lived at my current address for the past year and am registered as a foreign worker.

I am currently employed as a construction laborer with Schneider & Sohn, a position I have held for eleven months. While my employment is still within my first year, I have demonstrated reliability by paying off all my previous credits on time, including my current credit with your bank.

Following my separation, I am the sole provider for my 6-year-old son. My financial reserves are currently low, with both my checking and savings accounts below 100 DM, due to ongoing living expenses and the pressing need for home repairs. However, I have no other debts or installment plans, and I own my home outright.

I have always honored my financial commitments and am confident in my ability to repay the loan at the proposed installment rate. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Piotr Kowalski, and I am a 34-year-old separated male with one dependent child. I am seeking a loan of 11,998 DM to complete necessary repairs to my house, which I have owned for the past year since moving to this area.

I am currently working as a hotel porter at the Grand Hotel, a position I started eight months ago. While my tenure is less than a year, I have a reliable source of income and a clean credit history, having paid off all previous debts punctually, including my current loan with your institution.

Since my separation, I have been the sole financial support for my 8-year-old son. My checking and savings accounts are both below 100 DM, as most of my resources have gone into daily living costs and emergency repairs. I have no additional debts, installment plans, or co-signers.

I am committed to meeting the agreed installment rate, as I have always done in the past. I kindly ask for your support in helping me maintain a safe and secure home for my family.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and I am fully committed to meeting the installment payments for this loan. My employment is stable, and I have a telephone registered in my name, reflecting my long-term commitment to this community.

I would be grateful for your support and assure you of my dedication to fulfilling my obligations.

Sincerely,  
Jürgen Schmitt
