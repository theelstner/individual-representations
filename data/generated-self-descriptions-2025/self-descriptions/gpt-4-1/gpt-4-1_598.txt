Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,442 DM. My name is Eva Müller, a 36-year-old divorced woman currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past five years. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly, as reflected in my history of timely credit repayments.

I need this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute to the university and transporting my 8-year-old daughter to school and extracurricular activities. My current residence has been stable for four years, and while I do not own property, I have a reliable rental agreement and a car as my main asset. My savings are limited, but my stable employment and consistent income allow me to manage the proposed installment rate.

I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my previous installment plans have all been paid on time. I am committed to meeting all repayment terms and am confident in my ability to do so. I believe my professional stability and responsible financial history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Eva Müller
