Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,228 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik GmbH, where I have worked for the past two years. My employment is stable and I have a regular monthly income.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained two small credits with you over the past 11 months, which I have managed responsibly. I do have some credit history at another institution, but I have always fulfilled my repayment obligations, even through challenging periods. My savings are limited, as I have less than 100 DM in bonds, but I do hold a building society savings agreement as a form of property.

I am a single father supporting my 10-year-old son. We have lived in our current home for four years, which I own. I have no other installment plans or debts, and I do not have any guarantors. My installment rate is low, and I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly payments.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable future for my family in Germany. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Pavel Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Farouk and I am applying for a loan of 7,228 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am currently working as a janitor at Lindner Facility Services, a position I have held for three years. My job provides a steady income that covers my living expenses and allows for loan repayments.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have two existing credits with you that I have always paid on time. My credit history includes a previous account at another bank, which experienced a brief critical status two years ago due to a family emergency, but I have since cleared all outstanding amounts.

I have minimal savings, less than 100 DM, but I do have a life insurance policy as a form of security. I am single and have one dependent, my daughter, whom I support fully. I own my own home, where I have lived for the past four years.

I do not have any other debts or installment plans, and I believe my stable employment and responsible repayment record make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. A new car will help me commute to work and better support my family.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Ahmed Farouk

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 7,228 DM to purchase a new car. I am employed as a cleaner at Reine Räume AG and have been with the company for one year and eight months. My employment is secure and provides me with a regular income.

I do not currently have a checking account with your bank, but I have two credits that I have managed responsibly over the past 11 months. I have a critical credit history from another bank due to a late payment last year, but I have since resolved the issue and my accounts are now in good standing.

My savings are below 100 DM, but I hold a building society savings agreement as additional security. I am a single male, 39 years old, living with my 12-year-old son in a home I own. We have resided here for four years. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

A new car is essential for commuting to work and for my son’s school activities. I am confident that I can meet the loan’s installment payments and would greatly appreciate your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Tomasz Nowak

Letter 4

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 7,228 DM loan to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse laborer at K&M Logistik, where I have been working for just over two years. My income is steady and sufficient to cover my expenses and the proposed loan installments.

While I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained two small credits with you for 11 months and always paid on time. My credit history includes a critical account at another bank due to a period of unemployment, but I have since stabilized my finances.

I have less than 100 DM in savings, but I do have a life insurance policy. I am a single man, 39 years old, living in my own home with my son, whom I support alone. We have lived at our address for four years.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and no guarantors. I believe my stable job, home ownership, and responsible repayment record make me a reliable candidate. A new car is necessary for my job and family needs.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Miguel Santos
