Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 4,169 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for the past three years. My current financial situation is stable; I have been able to pay back all my previous credits on time, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. My checking and savings accounts have low balances at the moment due to recent relocation expenses and supporting my young son, but my regular income ensures I can meet the required installment payments.

I have lived at my current residence for four years and own my home. Additionally, I hold a building society savings agreement which demonstrates my commitment to financial planning. I have one dependent, my 5-year-old son, whom I support fully. As a foreign worker from Poland, I have always fulfilled my financial obligations in Germany and am fully integrated into the local community.

I believe my stable employment, clean credit history, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Jakub Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 4,169 DM to purchase essential equipment for my home office. I have been employed as an IT systems administrator with Siemens AG for just over two years. My salary is stable, and I have a proven track record of repaying my existing credit at your bank without delay. Although my checking and savings accounts are currently below 100 DM due to recent expenses related to my dependent son’s education, I have no other loans or installment plans.

I have resided in my own apartment for four years and have a life insurance policy, further demonstrating my commitment to long-term financial stability. As a single father to a 3-year-old boy, I am dedicated to providing a comfortable and efficient home environment. I am a foreign worker from Turkey and have always prioritized fulfilling my financial obligations in Germany.

Given my stable employment, reliable payment history, and responsible attitude, I am confident I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Emre Yildiz

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 4,169 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase necessary household equipment. I am currently employed as a logistics coordinator at DHL, where I have worked for two and a half years. My financial situation is steady, with all previous credits paid back on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, but my checking and savings accounts are currently under 100 DM due to recent moving costs and supporting my 6-year-old daughter.

I have lived at my current address for four years and own my apartment. I also maintain a building society savings agreement as part of my long-term financial planning. As a single male foreign worker from Romania, I am proud of my responsible approach to managing my finances and supporting my child.

With a stable job, a good repayment record, and a commitment to meeting my obligations, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your attention to my application.

Letter 4

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 4,169 DM to buy furniture and equipment for my home. I have worked as a junior civil servant in the local government for three years and have always paid back my existing credit at your bank on time. My current financial resources are limited, with both checking and savings accounts below 100 DM, as most of my recent income has gone towards caring for my dependent son and settling into my own apartment.

I have been living at my current residence for four years, which I own, and hold a life insurance policy as further financial security. As a foreign worker from Italy and a single father, I am committed to maintaining a responsible financial life and supporting my child.

Given my stable employment, excellent credit history, and prudent financial management, I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my request.

Yours faithfully,  
Luca Romano

Dear Lending Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 4,169 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a skilled technician at BMW, a position I have held for just over a year. I have already successfully paid back one credit with your bank and have no other debts. My checking and savings accounts are currently below 100 DM due to recent expenses for my young daughter, but my regular income ensures I can meet the installment requirements.

I own my home, have lived here for four years, and hold a building society savings agreement as part of my financial planning. As a single, 28-year-old foreign worker from Hungary with one dependent, I take my responsibilities seriously and have a solid track record of meeting my financial obligations.

I hope you will consider my application favorably, as I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on time and continue to be a reliable customer.

Sincerely,  
Miklos Szabo
