Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Stefan Novak, and I am applying for a business loan of 2,503 DM to help expand my small electronics repair shop in Munich. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Siemens for the past 8 years, and I am proud of my steady employment and technical expertise.

Currently, my checking account balance is under 200 DM, as I have invested most of my savings (now about 300 DM in bonds) into my business. I have had some delays in repaying loans in the past, mainly due to unexpected expenses related to my son’s medical needs. However, I have since stabilized my finances and have not missed any payments in the last two years.

I am single, have one dependent, and have lived at my present address for two years. I own my apartment and have a building society savings agreement in place. I also have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing, and some store installment plans.

I am confident that my business will continue to grow and that I will be able to meet all repayment obligations. I am committed to maintaining a positive credit record and believe my long-term employment and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Novak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Karim. I am seeking a loan of 2,503 DM to purchase new inventory for my small grocery store, which I started two years ago. I am a skilled employee at BMW, where I have worked as a machine operator for 9 years. My current savings are modest, around 250 DM in a life insurance policy, as I have been supporting my son and investing in my business.

In the past, I experienced a delay in repaying a personal loan due to a temporary loss of income, but I have since resolved this and have kept up with all my financial commitments. I have no co-signers or guarantors and have two active credits with your bank, both in good standing.

I am 41 years old, single, with one dependent, and have lived at my current residence for two years. I own my home and manage some installment payments for household appliances from local stores. As a foreign worker in Germany, I am dedicated to building a stable life and business here.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Karim

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a business loan of 2,503 DM to expand my tailoring business. My name is Peter Schmidt, and I have been employed as a customs official for the past 10 years. Alongside my job, I have been running a small tailoring service from my home, which I own.

My financial situation is stable, with around 400 DM in a building society savings agreement, but my checking account rarely exceeds 200 DM as most of my income goes towards supporting my son and covering business expenses. I did have a delay in repaying a credit card bill three years ago, but since then I have maintained a perfect repayment record.

I have lived at my current address for two years and am currently repaying two other credits at your bank, both of which are up to date. I do not have any guarantors or other major debts, except for a couple of store installment plans.

As a single father and long-term employee, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and growing my business. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Peter Schmidt

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 2,503 DM to invest in new equipment for my small landscaping business. I have been employed as a skilled horticultural technician with the City of Stuttgart for 8 years and have steadily advanced in my role.

My checking account balance is currently under 200 DM, and I have 150 DM in a life insurance policy. My past credit history includes a delayed payment from five years ago due to a family emergency, but since then, all my payments have been made on time.

I am 41 years old, single, with one dependent, and have lived in my own apartment for two years. I have two existing credits at your bank, as well as some installment plans with local stores, but I am diligent in managing my obligations.

As a foreign worker who has built a life and business here, I am committed to responsible financial management and believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Marek Nowak, and I am seeking a loan of 2,503 DM to purchase new tools and materials for my carpentry business. I have been employed as a skilled carpenter for 8 years at a local construction firm, and I also run a small side business from my home, which I own.

My checking account usually has less than 200 DM due to ongoing investments in my business, and I have about 350 DM in a building society savings agreement. I admit I once delayed a loan payment due to an unexpected expense, but I have since been punctual with all my financial responsibilities.

I am single, with one dependent, have lived at my current address for two years, and have two existing credits at your bank, both in good standing. I also have a few store installment plans.

With my stable employment, property, and commitment to my business, I am confident I can meet the repayment schedule. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak
