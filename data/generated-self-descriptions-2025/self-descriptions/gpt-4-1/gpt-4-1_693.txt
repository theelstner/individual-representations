Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,631 DM for necessary repairs to my home. I am a 25-year-old married woman, currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik for the past 2 years. My current account balance is modest (just under 200 DM), and my savings amount to approximately 350 DM.

I have one dependent, my 4-year-old son, and I am the sole provider for him. I have already taken a credit from your bank, which I have been repaying on time without any delay. I am seeking this new loan to cover essential repairs to the heating system in my house, which I own. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life for my family here in Germany.

My employment is stable, and my real estate property ensures that I have assets to support my obligations. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my regular income allows me to comfortably meet the proposed installment rate.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms, as I have proven my reliability with my previous credit.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schmidt, and I am a 25-year-old divorced woman applying for a loan of 2,631 DM to undertake urgent repairs to my apartment, which I own. I have been working as a kitchen helper at Hotel Sonnenhof for the last 3 years, earning a steady income.

Although my current checking account balance is less than 200 DM and my savings are limited to around 120 DM, I have always managed my finances responsibly. My previous loan from your bank was paid back in full and on schedule. I have no other outstanding debts.

I have been living at my current address for 2 years and am raising my 7-year-old daughter on my own. My only property is the apartment I reside in, which requires repairs to the plumbing system. I have no other installment plans, and my financial obligations are limited to supporting my child.

I am a reliable and trustworthy candidate, as demonstrated by my credit history and stable employment. I would greatly appreciate your support in helping me improve our living conditions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Schmidt
