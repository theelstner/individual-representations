Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,241 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My current residence, which I own, has recently been renovated, and I now need to furnish it adequately for myself and my son.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account, albeit with a balance below 100 DM. Despite this, I have a solid history of meeting my financial obligations, as evidenced by my two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have paid back reliably and on time.

I have no other outstanding debts, installment plans, or guarantors. As a single father and a foreign worker, I am dedicated to providing a stable and comfortable environment for my dependent. I believe my steady employment, responsible repayment history, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic
