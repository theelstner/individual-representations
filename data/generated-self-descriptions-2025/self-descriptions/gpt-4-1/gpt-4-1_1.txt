Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am applying for a loan of €15,000 to renovate my home in Stuttgart. I have maintained a checking account with your bank for the past 6 years, always in good standing. I have never defaulted on any credit payments, and my credit history is excellent.

I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 8 years. I currently live with my husband and our two children in a house we own. We have lived here for 10 years, and my monthly installment rate would be 15% of my disposable income, which is manageable given our stable financial situation. We have €8,000 in savings bonds and no other outstanding loans except our mortgage. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time.

I am 38 years old, have a landline at home, and am not a foreign worker. I am confident that my stable employment, long-term residence, and positive credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Anna Müller
