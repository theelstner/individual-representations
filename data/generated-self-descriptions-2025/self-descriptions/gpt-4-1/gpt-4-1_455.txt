Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 2,670 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and my position is secure, as evidenced by my recent promotion to lead a small research group.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have always managed my finances responsibly. My previous credits have all been paid back on time, and I have never defaulted on a loan. Currently, I have minimal savings, under 100 DM, as I have been investing most of my income into my professional development.

I am single, have no dependents, and have resided at my current apartment for 4 years. I own my car, which is my only significant property. I have no other debts or guarantors and have maintained my financial obligations diligently.

The purchase of a used car is essential for my daily commute and research-related travel. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my monthly income is stable and sufficient. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Ali, a self-employed IT consultant, and I am writing to request a loan of 2,670 DM to purchase a used vehicle. My consulting business has been operational for 7 years, serving clients such as Siemens and BASF. My financial records show a consistent income, and I have successfully repaid previous credits without any delays.

I do not currently have a checking account, relying instead on a savings account with a balance below 100 DM, as I reinvest most of my earnings into my business. My financial discipline is reflected in my clean credit history.

I am single, live alone, and have been at my current residence for 4 years. I do not have any other loans or guarantors, and my only property is my current vehicle. The new (used) car will help me expand my business by allowing me to reach more clients efficiently.

As someone who is highly qualified in my field and with a reliable income, I am confident in my ability to fulfill the installment plan. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Ali
