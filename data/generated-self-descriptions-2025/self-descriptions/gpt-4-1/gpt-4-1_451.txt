Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 1,512 DM to cover urgent repairs to my home. I am 61 years old, married, and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Bayer AG for the past 2 years and 8 months. I have lived in my current home for three years, which I own, and I have one dependent child.

Although I experienced a delay in repaying a loan several years ago due to unforeseen medical expenses, I have since prioritized maintaining a good financial record. My checking account currently holds 180 DM, and I have over 2,000 DM in a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to saving and financial planning.

I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are being serviced on time. I do not have any other guarantors or co-signers, and my only other installment plan is with a local appliance store. As a skilled employee nearing retirement age, I am focused on securing my family’s home and ensuring its safety and comfort.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. My steady employment, ownership of property, and history of responsible financial management (aside from the single delayed payment) all support my application. I am committed to repaying this loan in a timely manner and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Al-Masri, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,512 DM to fund essential repairs to my house’s heating system. I am a 61-year-old widower, with one adult son who still depends on me. I have worked for the past three years as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority.

I have a modest checking account balance of 150 DM, but I have been diligent in maintaining over 1,000 DM in my life insurance savings. I have lived in my own home for three years and currently have two active credits with your bank, both of which are being paid regularly. My only other installment plan is with a local furniture store.

I regret that I previously experienced a delay in paying off a credit, which was due to unexpected family medical expenses. However, I have since ensured all my financial obligations are met promptly. I have no guarantors or co-signers and am not involved in any other debt arrangements.

Given my stable employment, savings, and history of responsible repayments since my past difficulty, I hope you will consider me a reliable candidate for this loan. These repairs are necessary for my family’s well-being, and I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Al-Masri

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Jan Kowalski, and I am seeking a loan of 1,512 DM to repair the roof of my home. I am 61 years old, married, and have been employed for almost four years as a skilled technician at Siemens AG. I am a foreign worker who has been living in Germany for three years, and I own my residence.

My current account balance is 120 DM, but I have over 1,500 DM saved in a building society savings agreement. While I did experience a delay in settling a previous credit due to a temporary job loss, I have since maintained a good payment record. I have two credits with your bank and one installment plan at a local store, all of which are up to date.

With one dependent daughter and no co-signers, I manage my finances carefully. My property ownership and consistent employment reflect my stability and reliability. I respectfully request your support for this loan, which will help me ensure my family’s safety and comfort.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to repaying the loan as agreed.

Sincerely,  
Jan Kowalski

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Georgios Papadopoulos, a 61-year-old married man with one dependent son. I have been working as a municipal official for the past 2 years and 3 months. I am applying for a loan of 1,512 DM to repair the plumbing in my home, which I have owned for three years.

I have a current account balance of 90 DM, but I am proud to have saved over 1,200 DM in a life insurance policy. I have two existing credits with your bank that I am repaying regularly, and my only other installment plan is with a local electronics store. Unfortunately, I did experience a delay in loan repayment in the past due to an emergency relocation, but since then, I have taken care to meet all my obligations on time.

As a foreign worker with stable employment and substantial savings, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I have no guarantors and am solely responsible for my household finances. I would be grateful for your support to complete these necessary home repairs.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Georgios Papadopoulos
