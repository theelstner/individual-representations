Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,412 DM to support the expansion of my consulting firm, BrightPath Solutions. As a 29-year-old divorced woman, I have been working as a scientific research assistant for 3 years, currently managing a small team. Despite not having a checking account at your bank, I maintain two active credits and have always honored my repayments at other financial institutions.

My current financial situation is stable, with regular employment income and ownership of a small apartment. However, my savings are below 100 DM, which is why this loan is crucial for purchasing new equipment for my business. My guarantor, Ms. Petra Klein, is a long-standing family friend with a solid credit history.

I am committed to responsible financial management and have a clear plan to repay this loan within the agreed terms. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Maria Scholz

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a business loan of 1,412 DM to launch a boutique bakery, Sweet Moments, in my local community. I am a 29-year-old married woman, self-employed for the past two years as a freelance pastry chef. I reside in my own condominium, and while my savings are limited, I have invested most of my capital into securing the shop location.

Though I do not hold a checking account at your bank, I have two existing credits with you that I am managing responsibly. My guarantor is my sister, who has a strong financial standing. My income has been steady, and I have no other installment plans.

I am confident that my business plan is viable, and I am fully committed to meeting my repayment obligations. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Sabine Richter

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,412 DM to purchase essential inventory for my new online bookstore. As a 29-year-old married woman, I have been working as a marketing manager for the past two years. My current financial resources are limited, with savings below 100 DM, as I have invested heavily in setting up my business.

I do not have a checking account at your bank but currently have two credits with you and a reliable guarantor, my husband, who is also involved in the business. I own my residence and have no other installment plans.

I am diligent, responsible, and have a proven track record in both employment and credit management. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and grow my business successfully.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller
