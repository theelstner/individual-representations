Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,297 DM to furnish and equip my new home office. I am a divorced 40-year-old man with one dependent, residing in my own apartment in Stuttgart for the past three years. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the last eight years, where I have demonstrated reliability and professionalism.

While I did have a delay in repaying a previous loan due to unexpected medical expenses, I have since settled that debt and have maintained a good payment record. My current checking account balance is modest, under 200 DM, and I have minimal savings, but my steady income and secure employment provide stability.

I am requesting this loan to purchase essential furniture and equipment to support my work-from-home requirements, which will increase my productivity and earning potential. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4, as I have no other debts or installment plans. I am committed to honoring my financial obligations and would be grateful for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Thomas Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jürgen Klein, and I am seeking a loan of 4,297 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my growing consulting business. I am a 40-year-old divorced male, living with my teenage son in my own home in Munich for the past three years. I have been self-employed as a management consultant for nine years, serving clients in the automotive industry.

I acknowledge a delay in repaying a previous loan, which was caused by a temporary downturn in client contracts last year. I have since stabilized my business, and all outstanding debts have been cleared. My current account and savings are limited, but my business has returned to steady profitability.

This loan will allow me to upgrade my office and client meeting space, enabling me to secure more lucrative contracts. I have a solid track record of responsible financial management aside from the one-off delay, and I have no other outstanding loans or installment plans. I assure you of my commitment to timely repayment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Jürgen Klein

Dear Loan Department,

I am Peter Hoffmann, a 40-year-old divorced father residing in Frankfurt for the past three years. I am applying for a 4,297 DM loan to purchase essential equipment and furniture for my home. I am currently employed as a senior IT officer at Deutsche Telekom and have held this position for over eight years.

Although I experienced a delay in repaying a previous credit due to an unexpected family emergency, I have since resolved all outstanding issues and maintained regular payments on my existing credit at your bank. My current checking and savings accounts are below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively, as I have been investing in my child's education.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and my employment is stable. With your support, I can improve my living and working environment, directly benefiting my family and professional performance. I am committed to fulfilling my repayment obligations.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Peter Hoffmann

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Michael Richter, and I am applying for a loan of 4,297 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my home office. I am a 40-year-old divorced male, living in my own apartment in Hamburg with my 12-year-old daughter. I have been employed as a senior logistics manager at Lufthansa for the past seven years.

Last year, I encountered a brief delay in paying off a previous credit due to a divorce settlement, but I have since fully repaid that debt and remain in good standing with your bank, where I already hold a credit. My current checking and savings balances are low, but my stable employment and regular income provide security.

This loan will help me create a suitable environment for remote work and support my daughter's education. I have no other debts or installment plans and am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments. I appreciate your consideration and trust.

Yours sincerely,
Michael Richter
