Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,158 DM to purchase a new television for my apartment. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, I have been employed for the past three years, and my current contract is secure for at least another two years. My checking account balance is currently 150 DM, and I have a savings account with 700 DM. 

I have always repaid my previous loans on time, and I currently have no outstanding debts or guarantors. I have been living at my current address for just over a year, and I own a small car. As a divorced individual with no dependents, I am solely responsible for my finances, and my monthly installment rate is manageable at 3%. 

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, good credit history, and responsible financial management. I am a foreign worker from Poland, but I have integrated well into the community and am committed to fulfilling all my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Piotr Nowak
