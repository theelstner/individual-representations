Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,919 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a junior marketing manager at a local advertising firm, a position I have held for 9 months. As a single father of one, upgrading our home entertainment is important for both educational and leisure purposes.

My financial situation is stable, with a checking account balance of 150 DM and a savings account with 250 DM. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I am repaying as scheduled, despite a delay in payment last year due to a temporary job loss. I am now fully employed and my income allows me to comfortably meet my installment obligations.

I have lived at my current address for 3 years and own my home. I do not have any other outstanding debts, nor do I have guarantors. Although I am a foreign worker, I have integrated well and am committed to fulfilling my financial responsibilities. My installment rate is set at 4, which I am confident I can manage alongside my other obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide further information if required, and I look forward to your positive response.

Yours faithfully,
Mariusz Kowalski

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,919 DM to purchase a high-quality radio and television set for my new apartment. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past 10 months, I rely on such equipment for both work and personal enrichment.

Although my credit history shows a delayed payment last year when I was transitioning between positions, I have since maintained regular repayments on my two existing credits at your bank. I currently have 120 DM in my checking account and 300 DM in savings. My total financial obligations are manageable, and I have no other debts or guarantors.

I have been a resident at my current address for 3 years and own my apartment. My only dependent is my 5-year-old son. I am dedicated to providing for him and am careful with my finances. As a foreign national, I am committed to building a stable life here, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to discussing my application further.

Sincerely,
Emil Petrescu

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 1,919 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. I am a self-employed IT consultant, having started my own business 8 months ago. The equipment is essential both for my business needs and for my family.

My current financial position includes a checking account balance of 170 DM and a savings account with 200 DM. While I experienced a delay in payment two years ago during the early stages of my business, I have since stabilized my income and have been consistent with my existing credit repayments at your bank.

I have been living in my own residence for 3 years, with no other debts or guarantors. I support one dependent, my daughter, and my monthly budget comfortably covers my living expenses and installment obligations. My installment rate is 4, which I have planned for in my financial forecast.

I appreciate your consideration and am available to provide any further documentation you may require.

Best regards,
Ivan Novak

Letter 4

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,919 DM to purchase a radio and television for my household. I am currently employed as a junior officer at a logistics company, a role I have held for 7 months. As a single man supporting my younger brother, this purchase will greatly improve our quality of life.

My checking account currently holds 180 DM, and I have 400 DM in a savings bond. Although I had a delayed payment on a previous loan last year, I have since maintained regular payments on my two existing credits with your bank. I do not have any other debts, nor do I require a guarantor.

I have resided in my own home for 3 years and am committed to fulfilling all financial obligations. As a foreign worker, I take my responsibilities seriously and have ensured that my installment rate of 4 fits within my monthly budget.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your response.

Yours sincerely,
Alexei Ivanov

Dear Sir/Madam,

I wish to apply for a loan of 1,919 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I am a highly qualified employee, currently working as an assistant manager at a manufacturing firm for the past 11 months. This purchase is important for both my personal and professional development.

My financial situation is stable, with 130 DM in my checking account and 150 DM in my savings. While I had a delayed payment on a previous loan when I first moved to Germany, I have since managed my finances responsibly and have two ongoing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

I have lived in my own apartment for 3 years and am responsible for my 8-year-old son. I have no other debts or guarantors. My installment rate of 4 is well within my means, and I am committed to meeting all repayment requirements.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available to discuss my application further if needed.

Kind regards,
Tomasz Zielinski
