Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,843 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, where I have a stable income and a good professional reputation. My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to unexpected medical expenses for my dependent son, but I am managing my finances carefully.

Although I have two existing credits with your bank, I have always made my installment payments on time. I also have a life insurance policy as my main asset. My co-applicant, my brother, is also steadily employed and will share responsibility for the loan. We have rented our current residence for the past 4 years and have no other installment plans or debts outside of the mentioned credits.

The new car is essential for my commute and family needs, especially as a single parent. I am committed to repaying the loan reliably, as demonstrated by my employment record and responsible management of previous credits. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 4,843 DM to purchase a new car for my daily commute. I have worked as a customs official with the Hamburg Port Authority for 9 years and have always maintained steady employment. My current financial situation is strained due to supporting my 10-year-old daughter as a single father, and my checking account balance is currently negative.

I have two existing loans with your bank, both of which are up to date on payments. I do not have significant savings, but I do have an active building society savings agreement. My co-applicant, my cousin, has agreed to support this application and is also gainfully employed.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years and have no other outstanding installment plans. I am dedicated to meeting my financial obligations and believe my long employment history and responsible credit management make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,  
Thomas Neumann
