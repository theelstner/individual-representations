Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, and I am applying for a loan of 2,145 DM to support the expansion of my mobile phone repair business in Berlin. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at a local university for the past 5 years, but I have also successfully run my repair business for the last 2 years. I am single, 32 years old, and have lived in my current apartment for just over a year.

My current financial situation is modest; my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have no outstanding loans with other banks, and I am committed to making regular repayments. In the past, I experienced a delay in repaying a small credit, which was due to a temporary job change, but I have since stabilized my income and learned from that experience.

I am a trustworthy candidate because I have a stable job and a growing side business. I am dedicated to improving my financial standing and investing in my business’s growth. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a business loan of 2,145 DM to help me purchase essential equipment for my freelance graphic design studio. My name is Tomasz Nowak, a 29-year-old single male residing in Frankfurt for the past year. I have been steadily employed as a skilled technician at Siemens for 6 years.

Although my current account is in overdraft and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always prioritized my financial obligations. My previous payment delay was caused by an unexpected family emergency overseas, which I have since resolved. I have no other debts or guarantors.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my freelance business is gaining new clients every month and my full-time job provides a reliable income. I am committed to fulfilling all my financial responsibilities and appreciate your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Tomasz Nowak

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Victor Osei, and I am seeking a loan of 2,145 DM to invest in a small food delivery venture in Hamburg. I am 35 years old, single, and have lived in my current apartment for just over a year. I have been employed as a warehouse supervisor for 4 years.

Although I have a slight overdraft in my checking account and minimal savings, I have no other debts and am eager to improve my financial situation. My previous delay in repayment was a result of a short-term layoff, but I have since regained stable employment.

I am responsible and motivated to succeed in my new business. I believe that with your support, I can build a profitable venture and meet all repayment obligations on time. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 2,145 DM to purchase inventory for my newly established online electronics store. My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am a 31-year-old single male who has been working as a customs officer for the last 4 and a half years. I have resided at my current address for just over a year.

Currently, my checking account is slightly negative, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I have no other loans or guarantors. A few years ago, I faced a delay in repaying a loan due to a car accident, but I have since maintained a steady income and improved my financial habits.

I am committed to building my business and am confident in my ability to repay the loan as my sales increase. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov
