Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ali Demir, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,928 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been living in Germany for two years now and have worked as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past nine months. Although my current checking account balance is modest and my savings are limited, I am committed to improving my living conditions for myself and my young son.

I currently own a small apartment in Leipzig, which serves as my only property. Despite having two existing credits with your bank, I have managed my payments responsibly and am determined to continue doing so. My credit history reflects some challenges, including previous credit accounts at other institutions, but I have always strived to meet my obligations.

As a single father and foreign worker, I am motivated to provide a stable and comfortable home. This loan will allow me to furnish our home adequately and purchase necessary equipment to support our daily life. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my employment is stable, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability and commitment to fulfilling my financial responsibilities.

Sincerely,
Ali Demir

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am requesting a loan of 1,928 DM to purchase furniture and basic equipment for my recently acquired residence. I am a 31-year-old single male, originally from Bulgaria, and have been residing in Frankfurt for the past two years. I have been working as a hotel janitor at Hotel Adler for the past ten months.

My financial situation is stable, though my checking and savings accounts are currently below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively, due to recent moving expenses and supporting my daughter. I have two credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing, though my credit history elsewhere has had some difficulties.

I own my apartment and have no other debts or installment plans outside of your bank. I am committed to maintaining my financial obligations and see this loan as an important step toward creating a better home environment. My steady job provides me with the means to make regular payments, and I am determined to build a solid credit record with your institution.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Viktor Ivanov

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Piotr Nowak, a 31-year-old single father and foreign worker from Poland. I am requesting a loan of 1,928 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase necessary household equipment. I have been living in Stuttgart for two years and employed as a building maintenance worker at a local property management company for the past seven months.

I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans, and I am fully committed to meeting my financial obligations. My employment is stable, and I am confident that I can manage the monthly installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to prove my reliability as a borrower.
