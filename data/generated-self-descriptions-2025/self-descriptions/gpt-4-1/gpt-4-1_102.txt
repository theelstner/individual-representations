Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,469 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a warehouse loader at Müller Logistics for the past 8 years, and I have worked hard to provide for my wife and our son. We have lived in the same rented apartment in Stuttgart for 4 years, and I am proud to own a small plot of land in my home country, which I consider my real estate asset.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance of around 350 DM. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid back on time, and I have no other debts or guarantors. My credit history is clean, and I have never missed a payment.

My current salary covers our monthly expenses, but a car would greatly improve my ability to commute to work and support my family. I am a responsible borrower, as shown by my payment history, stable employment, and commitment to meeting my obligations. I kindly ask you to consider my application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marko Ivanovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,469 DM to purchase a new car, which will help me get to my job as a janitorial assistant at the Heidelberg City Hospital, where I have worked for 9 years. I am married and have a daughter, and we have lived in our current rented home for 4 years.

I have always been diligent in meeting my financial responsibilities. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have paid back promptly each month. My savings account currently holds approximately 200 DM, and while I do not have a checking account, I manage my finances carefully. I own a small property in Turkey, which I inherited from my parents.

As a foreign worker, I strive to build a stable life for my family in Germany. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I believe my consistent employment, history of timely payments, and sense of responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Ahmet Yildiz
