Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ingrid Schuster, and I am applying for a loan of 1,967 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute and have been employed there for 8 years. My current financial situation is stable, although my checking account balance is under 200 DM and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I am divorced and have been living at my present residence for 4 years.

I have always made timely payments on my previous credits, and I have no other debts or guarantors. My income as a skilled employee is steady, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4. I own my car, which provides additional security, and I am diligent in managing my finances. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life in Germany and believe this television will greatly improve my quality of life.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information you may need.

Sincerely,
Ingrid Schuster
