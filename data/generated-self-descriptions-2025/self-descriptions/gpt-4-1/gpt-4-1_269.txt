Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 1,533 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a divorced woman currently residing in a rented apartment above my family’s small grocery store, where I have lived for the past three years. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the local university for the past ten months. My employment is stable, and I am on a permanent contract.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a small balance and have consistently paid off previous credits without any delays. My credit history demonstrates my reliability and commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations. I have no outstanding debts or guarantors, and my only property is my car, which I use for commuting to work.

I am seeking this loan to replace my old television, which is no longer functioning. Having access to reliable news and educational programs is important to me, both for my personal development and for staying connected with my community. I am confident that I can manage the monthly installment rate of 4 DM, as my current expenses are well within my means.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to repaying this loan in full and on time, and I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,533 DM to purchase a new radio for my apartment. My name is Maria Lopez, and I am a married woman living above our family’s clothing store for the past three years. I have been employed for the last nine months as an administrative official at a local government office, and my contract has recently been renewed for another year.

My financial situation is stable, although my savings are below 100 DM at the moment due to recent household expenses. I do not have a checking account, but my previous loan from another institution was paid off ahead of schedule, which reflects my responsible approach to credit. I do not have any other debts or guarantors.

The radio will be used to keep my family informed and entertained, especially since we spend most of our time at home or in the store. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment payments, as my monthly income is steady and my expenses are carefully budgeted.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability as a customer of your bank.

Kind regards,  
Maria Lopez

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Anna Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan in the amount of 1,533 DM to purchase a new television for my household. I am a separated woman living in a small apartment above my bookstore, where I have resided for three years. I have been employed as a skilled technician for the past eleven months at a local electronics repair shop.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have always paid back my credits on time, and my credit history is clear of any defaults. My savings are modest, with less than 100 DM currently in my account, but I have no other debts or guarantors. The only property I own is my car.

The new television will allow me to stay informed about current events and improve my language skills, which is important as I am a foreign worker integrating into the community. My income is regular, and I am confident that the installment rate of 4 DM per month is well within my financial capability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling all my obligations and maintaining a good relationship with your bank.

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,533 DM to purchase a radio for my home. My name is Sofia Kovacs, and I am a married woman living in an apartment above our family’s hardware store, where I have lived for three years. I am currently employed as a junior accountant at a logistics company, a position I have held for the past eight months.

I do not have a checking account, but I have always met my credit obligations promptly and have no other debts or guarantors. My savings are limited at the moment, below 100 DM, as I recently contributed to my daughter’s school expenses. I own a car, which I use for both work and family needs.

The radio is an essential item for my family, as it helps us stay connected to news and cultural programs from our home country. My monthly income is sufficient to cover the installment payments, and I have a strong record of financial responsibility.

Thank you for considering my request. I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan on time and maintaining a trustworthy relationship with your institution.

Best regards,  
Sofia Kovacs

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Amina Hassan, and I am seeking a loan of 1,533 DM to buy a new television for my residence. I am a separated woman and have been living in my current apartment, which is located above my family’s convenience store, for the past three years. I have been working as a customer service representative at a telecommunications company for the last six months.

I have not opened a checking account yet, but I have a history of paying back my previous credits without any issues. My current savings are modest, less than 100 DM, as I have recently supported my parents with medical expenses. I own a car and have no other debts or guarantors.

Access to a television is important for me to stay informed, especially as a foreign worker adapting to life in a new country. My salary is stable, and the installment rate of 4 DM per month is manageable within my budget.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I am dedicated to meeting my financial commitments and would be grateful for your support.

Sincerely,  
Amina Hassan
