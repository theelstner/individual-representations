Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,053 DM for the purchase of a new television set for my family. As a scientific research assistant at the local university, I have been employed for the past 10 months. My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and savings below 100 DM, largely due to recent moving expenses and the costs of raising my young daughter.

Despite this, I have a solid credit history and have always repaid my existing credit at your bank on time. I own my home, and my wife and I are committed to maintaining our financial responsibilities. With my stable employment and ownership of real estate, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The new television will provide much-needed entertainment and educational opportunities for my family.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment plan and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Martin Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am seeking a loan of 1,053 DM to purchase a modern radio for my household. I am a married 27-year-old civil servant, recently employed for 9 months in the municipal office. I have one dependent, and while my current account is overdrawn and my savings are minimal, I have always met my credit obligations with your bank.

I own my home and have no other outstanding installment plans or debts. My employment is stable, and I have real estate as collateral. I believe this demonstrates my reliability and commitment to meeting my financial responsibilities. The radio will enhance our family’s quality of life, especially since we spend most of our evenings at home.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,053 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television. I am a married 27-year-old junior engineer, recently employed for 7 months at an engineering firm. I have one dependent, and while my current financial situation is tight—with my checking account overdrawn and minimal savings—I have always paid back my existing credit on time.

I own my home and have real estate as property. I have no other debts or installment plans. My employment is stable, and I am committed to meeting my financial obligations. The television will greatly benefit my family, especially during the winter months when we spend more time indoors.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Lukas Weber
