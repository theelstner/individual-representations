Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Fischer, and I am applying for a loan of €2,394 to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past three years. My employment is stable and my monthly income comfortably covers my living expenses.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained a good credit history and have always paid back my previous loans on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only property is my car, which is fully paid for. I have lived at my current address for four years and am committed to remaining in the community.

As a divorced woman supporting myself, I understand the importance of financial responsibility. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as I have budgeted carefully for this purchase. I am trustworthy and committed to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.
