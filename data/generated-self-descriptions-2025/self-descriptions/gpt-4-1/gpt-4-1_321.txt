Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Katarina Novak, and I am applying for a loan of 3643 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am 27 years old, divorced, and have been employed as a resident kitchen assistant at the Lindenhof Retirement Home for the past eight years. As a foreign worker, I have worked diligently to support myself and my young daughter.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and I have limited savings, but I am determined to improve my financial situation. I have lived at my current address for four years and own my apartment, which provides me with housing stability. Although I have experienced a delay in repaying a previous credit, I have since learned the importance of timely payments and am committed to meeting all future obligations.

I hold a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my intention to save for the future. With no other debts or guarantors, I am fully responsible for my finances. I am confident that my stable employment, housing situation, and dedication to my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Katarina Novak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Amina Rahimi, and I am seeking a loan of 3643 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home. I am married, 27 years old, and have been employed as a resident janitor at St. Agnes Hospital for the past nine years. I am a foreign worker and have lived in Germany for over a decade.

Unfortunately, due to unexpected medical expenses for my child, I have had a delay in paying off a previous loan and my checking account is currently negative. However, I have no other installment plans or debts, and I am committed to repaying this loan on time. I have owned my apartment for four years, and I also have a life insurance policy as additional security.

With my stable job and steady income, I am confident I can manage the monthly installment rate. My financial struggles have taught me the importance of responsibility and planning. I kindly ask you to consider my application and give me the opportunity to improve my family’s living conditions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Amina Rahimi
