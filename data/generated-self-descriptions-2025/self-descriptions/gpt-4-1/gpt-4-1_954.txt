Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 4,113 DM to purchase a used vehicle, which is essential for my daily commute and family responsibilities. My name is Sabine Müller, a 34-year-old married woman currently working as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt. Although I have been in my current position for only 10 months, I have a stable employment record and have always managed my financial commitments responsibly.

My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and I maintain a savings account with 700 DM. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have successfully paid off previous credits on time, demonstrating my reliability. I have lived at my current address for four years, paying rent regularly. My property includes a small car, which I now need to replace due to frequent mechanical issues.

With one dependent, I am committed to providing stability and security for my family. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 3, as my monthly income is sufficient to cover all obligations. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my consistent payment history and responsible financial management.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Müller
