Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,478 DM to purchase a new television set for my family. As a married man with one child, I understand the importance of providing both educational and recreational opportunities at home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at a local laboratory, a position I have held for 2 years and 3 months. My financial situation is stable, although I have experienced a delay in paying off a previous credit, which was due to unexpected medical expenses for my son. I have since resolved this issue and have learned from the experience.

Although I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, I own my home and have real estate as property, which demonstrates my long-term financial planning. I have been living at my current residence for 3 years and have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being serviced regularly. My installment rate is 4, and I do not have other debtors or guarantors.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a strong future for my family in this country. I am trustworthy and responsible, as evidenced by my stable employment and property ownership. I kindly ask for your consideration and am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan in the amount of 1,478 DM for the purchase of a radio for my household. I am a 33-year-old married man, working as a mechanical technician for the city’s public works department for the past 3 years. My wife and I have one child, and as a family we enjoy listening to music and news together, which is why this purchase is important to us.

While my savings are currently below 100 DM and I do not have a checking account, I have invested in real estate and own our home, which we have lived in for the past three years. I have two active credits at your bank, both of which are being paid on time after a temporary delay last year due to an unexpected family emergency. I have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am not involved in any other installment plans outside the bank. My job as a skilled employee is secure and provides a steady income. I am a foreign worker, but I am fully committed to my responsibilities and have proven myself reliable in my community.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Nikolai Ivanov

Letter 3

To whom it may concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1,478 DM to buy a television for my family. As a married man with one dependent, I want to provide a source of information and entertainment for my household. I am currently employed as a customs officer and have been in this position for 1 year and 8 months. Although I experienced a delay in repaying a previous loan last year due to a period of unemployment, I have since secured stable employment and have been consistent with my payments.

My financial situation is modest, with savings below 100 DM and no checking account. However, I own my home and have lived at my current address for three years, which demonstrates my stability. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building a secure life for my family here. I have no other debts or obligations, and my installment rate is manageable. I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling my financial responsibilities and ask for your trust in granting this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Ahmed El-Sayed

Letter 4

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to seek a loan of 1,478 DM to purchase a radio for my family. I am a married 33-year-old male, currently employed as a senior electrician at a local manufacturing company for the last 2 years. My wife and I have one child, and we believe that having access to news and music will greatly improve our family life.

Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are limited to under 100 DM, I own my home and have real estate assets. I have lived at my current address for three years. In the past, I had a delay in paying off a previous loan due to a necessary home repair, but I have since caught up with all payments and have maintained a good record since then.

I have two credits with your bank and no other installment plans or guarantors. My employment is stable and I am committed to maintaining my good standing. As a foreign worker, I am eager to continue contributing to my community and am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Yours sincerely,
