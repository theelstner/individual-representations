Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of €2,662 to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a 32-year-old single father and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Bremen for the past 5 years. I currently own my own home, where I have resided for 3 years with my 6-year-old son.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have previously taken out a loan with your institution and have always made my payments on time. I do not have any other outstanding loans or installment plans, and I have no guarantors or co-debtors.

As my work requires frequent travel to various research sites, a reliable car is essential for me to continue fulfilling my responsibilities and supporting my son. My steady employment and positive credit history demonstrate my reliability and ability to repay this loan. I also hold an active life insurance policy as an additional sign of my financial responsibility.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Jan Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of €2,662 for the purchase of a new car. I am a 32-year-old single male living in my own apartment in Stuttgart, where I have been residing for the past 3 years. I am employed as a certified electrician at Siemens AG, a position I have held for 4.5 years.

My financial situation is stable: I have no other loans or installment plans, and I have previously repaid a credit with your bank punctually and in full. My only dependent is my younger brother, whom I support through university. I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, but I do have a life insurance policy as my main financial asset.

A new car will allow me to commute to work and support my brother’s needs more efficiently. I am committed to meeting my financial obligations, as demonstrated by my credit history and stable employment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Markus Stein
