Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed El-Khatib, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,866 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years. My current checking account balance is 150 DM, and I have a savings account with 350 DM. I have always paid back my previous credits on time, as can be verified from my credit history.

As a foreign worker in Germany, owning a reliable car is essential for my daily commute to work and for integrating into my community. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans, and I live independently in rented accommodation. My monthly installment rate is manageable at 2, and I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule over the 18-month duration.

I believe my stable employment, responsible financial history, and the necessity of this purchase make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you very much for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El-Khatib

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Novak, and I am seeking a loan of 5,866 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been working as a junior civil engineer with the Stuttgart City Council for just over two years. Currently, my checking account holds 120 DM, and I have 200 DM in savings. I have maintained a good credit history, with all previous loans repaid promptly.

I am a single male, residing in Stuttgart for the past two years, and I have no dependents. I have no outstanding debts or guarantors, and my only property is my current car, which I plan to replace with a more reliable vehicle. My employment is stable, and my monthly budget allows for the proposed installment rate.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and believe my track record demonstrates my reliability. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak
