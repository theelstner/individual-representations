Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 3,345 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I am currently in a stable financial position, with my main income coming from my long-term employment.

My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to moving expenses, and my savings account holds less than 100 DM. However, I have a consistent history of repaying previous loans on time, including a recent credit with your bank that was settled without any delay. I am single, with one dependent, and have been residing at my current address for 2 years. I have no other debts or financial obligations.

As a reliable employee with a steady job and a clear repayment history, I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 4 and repay the loan as agreed. I am also covered by a building society savings agreement, which further secures my financial position. I would appreciate your consideration of my application and am available for any further information you may require.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Michael Klein, a self-employed IT consultant with 10 years of experience in the technology sector. I am seeking a loan of 3,345 DM to upgrade my home office with new furniture and equipment, which is essential for maintaining my work productivity.

Currently, my checking account is slightly in the negative due to recent business investments, and my savings are under 100 DM. Despite this, I have a solid credit history, having repaid all previous loans, including one with your bank, in full and on time. I have one dependent and have been living in my current rented apartment for 2 years.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and my income from my consulting business is regular and sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate. I also have a life insurance policy, which provides additional financial security. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule and would be grateful for your support in this matter.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Michael Klein
