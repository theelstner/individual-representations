Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,468 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am a 52-year-old single father, residing in my own apartment for the past year. I have one dependent, my teenage son, whom I support solely.

Previously, I worked as a branch manager at a local logistics company for 15 years until the company downsized last year, resulting in my current period of unemployment. My financial discipline is evidenced by my history of paying back all credits on time, including my existing loan with your bank. Although I do not have a savings account or other significant assets, I have maintained a positive relationship with your institution and have never defaulted on any payments.

My checking account balance is modest, but I am confident that with the installment rate of 2, I can comfortably manage the loan repayment from my unemployment benefits and occasional freelance consulting work. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and my housing is secure.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Karl Meier

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 6,468 DM for the purpose of purchasing a quality radio and television for my home. As a former self-employed IT consultant with 20 years of experience, I have always managed my finances responsibly, as reflected in my perfect credit history with your bank.

Since my last contract ended eight months ago, I have been actively seeking new opportunities, while supporting my adult son, who is temporarily living with me. Although I currently do not have a savings account, my previous earnings have allowed me to manage my expenses and pay off all previous credits without delay.

I own my home and have no other financial obligations or dependents besides my son. I believe my track record as a reliable borrower and my ongoing commitment to securing new employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Frank Schneider

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,468 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I am a 52-year-old single male, living in my own apartment for one year, and supporting my daughter, who is currently attending university.

My background is in management; I served as the operations officer at a manufacturing firm for 12 years before my position was eliminated due to restructuring. Despite being unemployed at present, I have maintained an excellent credit record, including timely repayment of a current loan with your bank.

Although my savings are limited and I do not own additional property, I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments with my current resources. My responsible financial behavior and stable living situation underscore my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Jürgen Hoffmann

Letter 4

Dear Sirs,

I would like to apply for a loan of 6,468 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I am a 52-year-old single man, living with my teenage daughter in a home I own. I have been residing here for one year after moving from another city for better opportunities.

Previously, I was a senior project officer in the municipal government for eight years, but due to recent budget cuts, I am now seeking new employment. I have always paid my obligations on time, as reflected in my credit history and existing loan with your bank.

My finances are currently tight, with a checking account balance below 200 DM and no savings, but I have no other debts or installment plans. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan through careful budgeting and the support of unemployment benefits.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my commitment to honoring the loan terms.

Yours faithfully,  
Peter Baumann

Dear Loan Department,

I am seeking a loan of 6,468 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my household. I am a 52-year-old single male, living in my own residence with my dependent son. I have been unemployed for the past six months after working as a highly qualified research assistant at the Technical University of Munich for 18 years.

Despite the recent change in my employment status, I have maintained a spotless credit record, including an existing loan with your bank, which I have serviced without issue. My current account balance is modest, and I do not hold a savings account or other property.

I believe my history of responsible financial management and my long-term professional background make me a suitable and trustworthy candidate for this loan. I have no other debts or obligations, and with the proposed installment rate, I am confident I can manage the repayments.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,
