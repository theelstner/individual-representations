Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 730 euros to purchase a new television set. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 8 years, where I have maintained stable employment and a steady income. I am currently renting an apartment in Stuttgart, where I have lived for the past 2 years with my 13-year-old son.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have two existing credits here that I have always paid on time. My credit history includes some difficulties with another lender, but I have taken steps to address these issues and am committed to improving my financial standing. I also have a life insurance policy, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

I am seeking this loan to replace our broken television, which is important for my son’s education and our family life. As a single father, I am careful with my finances and have no other debts or installment plans. I believe my long-term employment and responsible payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 730 euros to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I have been employed as a janitor at Schiller High School for the past 9 years. My employment is secure, and I have a regular monthly income.

I am single and live with my 7-year-old daughter in a rented apartment, where we have resided for 2 years. Although I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, I have two existing credits which I am repaying reliably. My previous credit history shows some challenges, but I have no outstanding debts with your bank or any other financial institution at this time.

I have a building society savings agreement in place for my future, which shows my commitment to financial planning. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly, as I have demonstrated with my existing credits.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,

I am 46 years old, single, and have one dependent living with me. We have rented our current apartment for 2 years.
