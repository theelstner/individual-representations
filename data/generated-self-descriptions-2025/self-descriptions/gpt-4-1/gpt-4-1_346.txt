Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,949 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Ivan Petrovic, and I am a 37-year-old foreign resident working as a warehouse assistant at Bayer Logistics in Munich. I have been employed there for the past 10 months, and my salary has been regularly deposited into my checking account for over a year.

I currently live in my own apartment, where I have resided for the past year with my two children. Although I have only been in my current job for less than a year, I have demonstrated reliability by paying off a previous credit at your bank in full and on time. My financial situation is stable: my monthly income covers all expenses, and I have a building society savings agreement as security.

Due to the demands of my job and my responsibilities as a single parent, a reliable car is essential for daily commuting and transporting my children. While my savings are limited, I have arranged for my brother to act as guarantor for this loan.

I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and believe my credit history and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, and I am applying for a 3,949 DM loan to finance the purchase of a new car. As a 37-year-old single father of two, I have lived in my own apartment in Stuttgart for the past year. I have been employed as a janitorial staff member at the local hospital for the last 8 months, with my salary being consistently credited to my account for over a year.

I have previously taken a loan from your bank and repaid it fully and on schedule. My only other asset is a life insurance policy, and my savings are under 100 DM. I have no other installment plans or debts, and my brother-in-law has agreed to be my guarantor.

Reliable transportation is essential for my job and for managing family commitments. I am confident that my steady employment and history of responsible borrowing demonstrate my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my commitment to timely repayments.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,949 DM for the purchase of a new car. My name is Marek Novak, and I am a 37-year-old single male, residing in my own home in Frankfurt for the past year. I am employed as a kitchen assistant at a local restaurant, a position I have held for 9 months, with regular salary assignments to my checking account for over a year.

Owning a car is crucial for my work schedule and for providing for my children. Although my savings are modest, I have demonstrated responsibility in managing my finances and repaying debts. I hope you will consider my application favorably.
