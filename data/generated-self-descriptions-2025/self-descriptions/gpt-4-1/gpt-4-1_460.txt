Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 343 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances for my home. As a scientific research assistant, I have been employed at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 months. Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are minimal, I have always repaid my previous credit with your bank in full and on time.

As a 27-year-old divorced woman with one child, I am committed to providing a stable and comfortable home environment. I own my apartment and have been living here for a year. Despite my limited work history in Germany as a foreign worker, my employment is stable and my property offers additional security.

I am a responsible borrower, as shown by my positive credit history. I kindly ask you to consider my application, as this loan will greatly improve my family’s quality of life.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova
