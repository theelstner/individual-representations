Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jelena Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 1,845 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment in Berlin. I am a divorced woman, 46 years old, and I currently work as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Berlin, a position I have held for 11 months. My employment is stable, and I am on a permanent contract.

Over the past eight years, I have maintained a good credit history, including a previous loan with your bank, which I paid off in full and on time. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, but I am confident that with my steady monthly income, I will be able to meet the installment rate of 4 DM.

I rent my apartment, have lived at my current address for a year, and am supported by a guarantor. I have a building society savings agreement for additional financial security. As a foreign worker from Serbia, I am committed to building a stable life for myself and my 12-year-old daughter here.

I assure you of my reliability and dedication to fulfilling my financial obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jelena Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Sanchez, and I am seeking a loan of 1,845 DM to furnish my new rental apartment and purchase necessary equipment for my home office. I am 46 years old, married, and have a 15-year-old son. I have recently started working as an administrative officer at the City Council of Frankfurt, a position I have held for 10 months.

Although I have only been in my current job for less than a year, my employment is secure, and I have a consistent monthly income. I have previously taken out a loan with your bank, which I repaid on schedule. My current checking account is slightly negative, and my savings are below 100 DM, but I have a life insurance policy as further financial backing, and a guarantor supports my application.

I have no other installment plans and only one existing credit at your bank, which I am managing well. My family and I have lived at our current address for a year, and we are committed to staying long-term.

I am responsible and diligent in all my financial matters, and I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Sanchez

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Agnes Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 1,845 DM to buy furniture and equipment for my newly rented apartment. I am 46, separated, and a skilled employee working as a certified lab technician at BioMed GmbH in Munich, where I have been employed for the past 9 months.

My financial situation is stable, with a regular monthly salary. I have a small overdraft on my checking account and minimal savings, but my credit history is strong—my previous loan with your bank was paid back diligently. I have a building society savings agreement in place and a guarantor to support my application.

I have lived at my current address for a year and have no other installment plans. I am a foreign worker from Hungary, living here with my 16-year-old son, and I am committed to providing a comfortable home for us both.

I am conscientious and have always met my financial commitments. I would be grateful for your support in granting this loan.

Kind regards,
