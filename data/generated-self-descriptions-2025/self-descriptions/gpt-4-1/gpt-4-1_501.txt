Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I am applying for a loan of 1,323 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I have maintained a stable checking account with a regular salary assignment for over a year. My current savings account holds 275 DM, and while I have some existing credit with another institution, I have always ensured timely payments.

As a divorced father of one, reliable transportation is essential for both my professional commitments and my responsibilities as a parent. My current vehicle is no longer dependable, and a new car will greatly improve my daily commute and family life. I have resided at my current address in Munich for 4 years, demonstrating my stability.

Despite a critical account history, my consistent employment, regular income, and careful budgeting make me a trustworthy candidate. I am committed to meeting the 6-month repayment schedule at the proposed installment rate. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,323 DM to purchase a new car. I am Carlos Fernandez, a skilled machine operator at Siemens AG, where I have worked for the past 10 years. My checking account has maintained a balance above 200 DM with regular salary deposits for more than a year. I currently have 320 DM in my savings account and am servicing another credit outside this bank.

Following my recent separation, I am solely responsible for my transportation needs. My job requires punctuality and reliability, which is challenging with my aging car. A new vehicle will ensure I can continue to perform my duties efficiently.

I have lived at my present address for 4 years and have no other debts or guarantors. While my credit history includes a critical account, my long-term employment and consistent income provide assurance of my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Fernandez

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Piotr Nowak, and I am seeking a loan of 1,323 DM to buy a new car. I am an official with the local government office, having served in this position for 9 years. My checking account has received regular salary assignments for over a year, and I have 410 DM in my savings account.

As a divorced man living alone, I rely on my car to commute to work and manage daily tasks. My current vehicle is beyond repair, and a replacement is necessary. I have a critical credit history and an existing loan with another bank, but I have always met my financial obligations.

I have resided at my current address in Hamburg for 4 years and have no other debts or installment plans with this bank. My stable employment and responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I appreciate your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Loan Department,

I am Hans Müller, a foreign worker from Austria, employed as a senior electrician at BASF for the past 8 years. I am applying for a loan of 1,323 DM to purchase a new car. My checking account has maintained a balance above 200 DM with regular salary payments for over a year, and I have 350 DM in savings.

After my recent divorce, I am managing all expenses alone. My job requires me to travel to various sites, and my old car is no longer reliable. A new vehicle is essential for my work performance and job security.

I have lived at my current residence for 4 years and have no other guarantors or debts at this bank. Despite a critical credit account and an existing loan elsewhere, my stable employment and history of responsible payments support my application. Thank you for considering my request.

Yours sincerely,  
Hans Müller

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ali Demir, and I am applying for a 1,323 DM loan to purchase a new car. I have been a skilled employee at Deutsche Post for 7 years, with a checking account that has consistently received my salary for over a year. I currently have 290 DM in savings and an existing credit with another institution.

Since my separation, I have managed all personal and professional responsibilities independently. My car is essential for my daily commute and supporting my dependent son. The vehicle I have now is unreliable, making a new car crucial for my stability.

I have lived at my current address in Frankfurt for 4 years, and I do not have other debts or installment plans with your bank. Although my credit history is critical, my long-term employment and financial discipline demonstrate my reliability. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ali Demir
