Letter 1 – From a Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,887 DM to support my pursuit of a Master’s degree in Environmental Science at the University of Munich. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years, I have developed valuable skills and a steady income, but my current financial resources are insufficient to cover tuition and living expenses.

Although I have had some delays in repaying past credit, I have learned from those experiences and now manage my finances more responsibly. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, but I am committed to improving my situation through further education. I have a life insurance policy, and my residence of three years is owner-occupied, reflecting my stability.

With only one existing credit at your bank and no other debtors, I am confident that, given this opportunity, I will complete my degree and secure a higher-paying position. My employment is stable, and I have one dependent to support, further motivating my commitment to timely repayments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available to discuss my situation in more detail and provide any additional information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber

Letter 2 – From a Police Officer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 6,887 DM to finance my continued education at the Police Academy, specializing in cybercrime prevention. I have proudly served as a police officer in Stuttgart for nearly two years, and while my salary is reliable, it does not fully cover the educational costs I now face.

My current checking account balance is negative, and my savings are minimal. While I have previously experienced some delays in credit repayments, I have taken steps to better manage my obligations and now use installment plans responsibly. I own my home, have resided here for three years, and hold a building society savings agreement as my main asset.

As a single father with one child, I am dedicated to building a secure future for my family. I have no guarantors or additional debts, and my employment in public service demonstrates my reliability and commitment. I am confident that further education will enhance my career and allow me to meet all financial commitments.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger

Letter 3 – From a Mechanical Engineer

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,887 DM to enroll in an advanced certification program in robotics engineering at the Technical University of Berlin. I have been employed as a mechanical engineer at Siemens AG for almost four years, and this program will significantly enhance my skills and career prospects.

My financial situation is currently strained, with a checking account balance below zero and savings under 100 DM. I acknowledge having had delayed payments in the past but have since prioritized better financial planning. I own my apartment and have lived there for three years, and I also maintain a life insurance policy.

As a single individual with one dependent, my goal is to provide a stable life for my child. I have only one existing loan with your bank and no additional creditors. My stable employment, responsible use of credit, and commitment to personal and professional growth make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Lukas Schmidt

Letter 4 – From a Customs Official

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 6,887 DM to support my studies in international trade law at the University of Hamburg. I have worked as a customs official for two and a half years, and this education will help me advance to a supervisory position.

Currently, my financial resources are limited, with an overdrawn checking account and less than 100 DM in savings. I have faced challenges with timely repayments in the past but have since adopted stricter budgeting practices. I have no other debts, own my home, and have lived there for three years.

As a single man with one dependent, I am fully committed to securing a better future for my family. My employment is secure, and I have a building society savings agreement as an additional asset. I am confident that this investment in my education will enable me to meet all my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my request. I am happy to provide further details if needed.

Kind regards,  
Jan Petersen

Letter 5 – From an IT Specialist

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a loan of 6,887 DM to finance my part-time studies in data science at the Technical University of Munich. I have been working as an IT specialist at Allianz for just over a year, and this qualification is essential for my career progression.

My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM. Although I have previously had delays in loan repayment, I have since established a strict monthly budget and use installment plans only when necessary. I own my apartment, have lived there for three years, and hold a life insurance policy.

I am single and responsible for one dependent, which motivates me to improve my qualifications and financial situation. I have only one loan at your bank and no other debts or guarantors. My stable employment and commitment to education make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Sincerely,  
David Müller
