Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Marko Schmidt and I am applying for a loan of 5,371 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for 2 years and 7 months. My present financial situation is modest; my checking and savings accounts both have balances under 100 DM, and I am currently repaying two existing credits at your bank. Despite these obligations, I have managed my payments diligently and have a guarantor to further assure my reliability.

I am a single father of one, and my son and I have recently moved into our own apartment, which I own. While I have had some credit challenges in the past, I have always honored my commitments and am working hard to improve my financial standing. I also have a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning.

This loan will allow me to provide a comfortable and stable environment for my child. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my employment is secure and my monthly income is steady. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marko Schmidt

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrovic, and I am writing to request a loan of 5,371 DM to purchase necessary equipment for my home office. I have been working as a certified IT technician for the past 3 years and 2 months, currently employed at Siemens AG. My financial resources are limited at the moment, with less than 100 DM in both my checking and savings accounts, and I am managing two other credits with your bank.

As a 28-year-old single man with one dependent, I am determined to improve our quality of life. Although my credit history includes some critical accounts, I have a reliable guarantor and no other installment plans elsewhere. I have resided in my own apartment for 2 years, and I also hold a life insurance policy as an additional asset.

This loan will help me furnish my home office, allowing me to take on more freelance work and increase my income. My steady employment and careful budgeting ensure that I can meet the monthly installment rate. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrovic
