Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,327 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. I am a 25-year-old resident, recently divorced, and have been working as a kitchen assistant at the Berlin City Hospital for the past 8 months. My monthly salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account for over a year, maintaining a balance above 200 DM at all times.

I have one dependent, my young daughter, and we live in a small home that I own in the Neukölln district. I am a foreign worker originally from Bulgaria, but I have settled in Germany for the past three years. I am proud to say that I have always repaid my previous credit on time, and I currently have no other debts or installment plans.

Although my savings are below 100 DM, I am diligent with my finances and have no guarantors or other debtors. With my stable employment and responsible repayment history, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2 DM per month. This loan will help improve our quality of life and keep us connected to the world. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marta Zielinski, and I am applying for a loan of 2,327 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my household. I am 25 years old, married, and have one child. I have been living in my own home in Stuttgart for three years and have been employed as a warehouse assistant at a local logistics company for the past 10 months.

I have maintained a checking account with your bank for more than a year, with regular salary assignments and a balance exceeding 200 DM. My previous credit with your bank was paid back promptly, and I currently have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

Although my savings are modest (less than 100 DM), I am financially responsible and have always prioritized my obligations. I do not have any guarantors or co-debtors. With my current employment and stable residence, I am confident that I can meet the monthly installment rate. I hope you will consider my application, as this purchase will greatly benefit my family.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
