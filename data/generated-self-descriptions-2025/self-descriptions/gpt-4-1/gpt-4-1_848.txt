Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of €6,761. I am a 32-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for 2.5 years. My monthly income is stable and sufficient to cover the proposed loan installments, as well as my living expenses.

I have no existing checking or savings accounts, as my finances have been managed through payroll cards and cash up until now. Despite this, my credit history is strong; I have taken two small personal loans in the past, both of which I repaid on time and in full.

I currently rent an apartment and have resided at my present address for four years. I do not have any dependents or other outstanding debts, and I have never required a guarantor for any financial commitment.

The purpose of this loan is to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and field research assignments. I am confident that my professional stability and responsible financial conduct make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dr. Martin Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a loan of €6,761 to purchase a new car. I am a 28-year-old single male, employed as a municipal building inspector for the City of Düsseldorf for the past 3 years. My position provides me with a steady monthly income, and I have a proven record of repaying previous credit obligations on time.

I do not currently have a checking or savings account, but my salary is paid directly by the city, and I manage my finances responsibly. I live in a rented apartment, where I have resided for four years, and I do not have any dependents or co-signers on my financial commitments.

The car is necessary for my job, as I frequently travel to different construction sites around the city. My history of prompt repayment of previous credits demonstrates my reliability. I have no other installment plans aside from the rent, and my current financial obligations are well within my means.

I am confident that my stable employment and history of financial responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Jonas Richter

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €6,761 to purchase a new car. I am a 30-year-old single male, working as a certified IT specialist at Siemens AG for the past 3.5 years. My employment is stable and my monthly income allows for comfortable repayment of the proposed loan.

I have not opened a checking or savings account yet, as my previous financial needs were limited and managed with cash. My credit history is clean; I have taken out and repaid two consumer credits in the past eight years without any delays.

I rent a flat where I have lived for four years, and I have no dependents or outstanding debts. I am applying for this loan because reliable transportation is crucial for my work, which often requires travel to client sites.

Given my steady employment, excellent credit record, and responsible financial management, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I would appreciate your favorable consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Tobias Müller
