Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 763 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 26-year-old divorced woman and have been employed as a laboratory research assistant at Bayer AG for the past 2 years. I currently own my residence and have one dependent, my 4-year-old daughter.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have a savings account with a balance of 80 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time, demonstrating my reliability. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only financial obligation is to support my daughter. My monthly income is stable, and I am diligent in managing my finances.

I am requesting this loan to furnish my home and purchase a new laptop for remote work opportunities. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, responsible payment history, and commitment to meeting my financial obligations. I am confident that I will be able to repay the loan within the agreed terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

I have been living in my own apartment for the past year with my husband and our 2-year-old son.
