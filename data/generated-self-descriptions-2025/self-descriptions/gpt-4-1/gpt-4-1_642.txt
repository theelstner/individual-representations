Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Ivanova, and I am applying for a loan of 750 DM to support my ongoing studies in business administration at the Volkshochschule Berlin. I am a 27-year-old married woman and have been residing at my current address for the past year. Despite being unemployed at the moment, I am committed to improving my qualifications in order to secure stable employment in the near future.

Previously, I worked as a cashier for 3 years and have always managed my financial obligations responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying on time without any issues. Although my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 and 100 DM respectively, I own a small apartment, which demonstrates my commitment to financial stability.

As a foreign worker, I am determined to build a better future for myself and my child. I am confident that furthering my education will significantly improve my job prospects. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and would greatly appreciate your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Ivanova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Fatima Hassan, a 27-year-old divorced woman currently living in my own apartment in Munich with my young son. I am requesting a loan of 750 DM to fund my language and computer courses, which are essential for reintegration into the German job market.

Although I am presently unemployed, I have a history of responsible credit behavior, having paid off all previous loans on time, including my current credit with your bank. My checking and savings accounts are limited, but I do have real estate as property, which provides a degree of security.

Kind regards,
