Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan in the amount of 7,432 DM for the purchase of a new car. My name is Maria Kovacs, a 54-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Heidelberg, where I have been employed for the past three years. As a divorced woman supporting my teenage son, reliable transportation is essential for both my daily commute and my son's school activities.

While my checking and savings account balances are currently below 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, this is due to ongoing expenses related to my son's education and our living costs. My employment is stable, and I have a building society savings agreement as a form of property asset. Although I have had a delay in paying off credit in the past, I have since taken steps to ensure timely payments and have maintained my current credit at your bank without incident.

I am a responsible candidate, with a steady income and no other outstanding installment plans or debts. I have lived at my current rental residence for two years and am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. This loan will enable me to secure a reliable vehicle, which is crucial for maintaining my employment and supporting my family. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anja Schmidt, and I am applying for a 7,432 DM loan to purchase a new car. I am a 54-year-old divorced customs official, working at the Mannheim Customs Office for the past two years. My current financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and less than 100 DM in savings, as I am the sole provider for my daughter.

I understand that my credit history shows a delay in repayment from two years ago, which was due to unexpected medical expenses. Since then, I have consistently managed my finances and have maintained my existing credit with your bank responsibly. I have a life insurance policy, providing additional financial security.

I am a long-term resident in my current rental apartment and have no other debts or installment plans. My stable government employment, combined with my commitment to financial responsibility, makes me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The new car will ensure I can continue to fulfill my duties and provide for my family.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Anja Schmidt

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Elena Petrova, a 54-year-old married laboratory technician at BASF, where I have been employed for just over one year. I am seeking a loan of 7,432 DM to purchase a new car. As a foreign worker with a dependent son, reliable transportation is vital for my job and my family’s wellbeing.

My current checking and savings balances are both under 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively, as most of my earnings go toward rent and supporting my child. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I am managing well. While there was a payment delay in the past, I have since improved my budgeting and payment habits.

I hold a building society savings agreement and have been a resident at my current address for two years. I do not have other installment plans or debts. My steady employment and improved financial discipline make me a reliable candidate. I am committed to repaying the loan on time and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a car loan of 7,432 DM. My name is Sabine Müller, a 54-year-old separated public health official in Frankfurt, where I have been employed for nearly three years. I have one dependent, my teenage daughter, and our current car has become unreliable, making it difficult to commute and manage family responsibilities.

My financial situation is modest, with a checking account under 200 DM and minimal savings, as my income is primarily allocated to living expenses and my daughter’s needs. My credit history includes a delayed payment from last year, which occurred during my separation. Since then, I have maintained regular payments on my existing credit with your bank.

I have a life insurance policy, no other debts or installment plans, and have lived in my rental home for two years. As a skilled and responsible employee, I am committed to meeting my financial commitments. A new car will greatly improve our quality of life and my work reliability. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Müller
