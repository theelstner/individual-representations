Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1042 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have worked for the past three years. My current financial situation is stable: although my checking account balance is modest (currently at 150 DM), I have always paid back my previous credits on time, including an existing loan with your bank.

I am divorced and have one dependent child. We have lived in our own apartment for the last two years. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I do not have a savings account at this time. However, I do have a building society savings agreement as my property asset.

A new car is essential for my daily commute to the university and for managing my responsibilities as a single parent. My reliable employment and clean credit history demonstrate my trustworthiness. I am committed to making regular payments and maintaining a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Anna Kovács

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1042 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently a customs officer at Munich International Airport, a position I have held for two and a half years. My employment is stable, and I have a good record of repaying previous loans, including one with your bank.

My checking account typically holds less than 200 DM, and I do not have a savings account, but I do hold a life insurance policy. I am married with one child, and we have lived in our own home for the past two years. I have no other debts or installment plans.

As a foreign worker, reliable transportation is crucial for my job’s irregular hours and for supporting my family. My consistent employment, responsible repayment history, and ownership of property make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Maria Rossi
