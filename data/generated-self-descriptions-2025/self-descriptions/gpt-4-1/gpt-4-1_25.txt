Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,804 DM to purchase a used car. As a scientific research assistant at a local university, I have been employed for 8 months, and my monthly income is stable. Although my checking account currently holds under 200 DM, I have a savings account of 320 DM and a life insurance policy as additional security.

I am a single father with one dependent, and I have lived at my current address for four years, owning my own apartment. My credit history shows some challenges due to a previous critical account with another bank, but I have since managed my finances responsibly and have one existing credit with your bank, which I am repaying on time.

Reliable transportation is essential for my job and family responsibilities. I believe my steady employment, property assets, and history of meeting installment payments make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,804 DM to purchase a used car. I have recently started working as a customs officer at the port, where I have been employed for 10 months. Although my current checking account balance is modest (around 110 DM), I maintain a building society savings agreement with 270 DM.

I am a single man, 44 years old, with one dependent (my teenage son). I have lived in my own apartment for the last four years. My credit history includes a past critical account, but I have since stabilized my finances, and I am currently repaying one existing credit at your bank without issues.

Owning a car will allow me to commute efficiently and fulfill both work and family obligations. My stable employment, property, and responsible repayment history demonstrate my reliability. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Jürgen Müller

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 1,804 DM to purchase a used car, which is vital for my daily commute. I am employed as a skilled electrician and have been with my current employer for the past 7 months. My checking account balance is currently 180 DM, and I have a savings account of 420 DM.

I am a single male, 44 years old, and have one child. I have owned my home for four years and have no other installment plans. Although my credit history includes a previous critical account with another bank, I am currently managing my only credit at your bank responsibly.

Having a car will improve my work opportunities and allow me to better provide for my child. My steady employment, home ownership, and responsible repayment record make me a trustworthy loan candidate. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ali Hassan

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,804 DM to buy a used car. I am a newly appointed municipal clerk, having worked in this role for 9 months. My current checking account balance is 90 DM, but I maintain a building society savings agreement with 150 DM and a life insurance policy.

I am 44, single, with one dependent (my mother), and have lived in my own apartment for four years. My previous credit history includes a critical account at another bank, but I have since demonstrated financial responsibility, with one current credit at your bank in good standing.

A car is essential for my work and family responsibilities. My secure employment, property, and positive repayment record at your bank show I am a reliable candidate. I appreciate your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
