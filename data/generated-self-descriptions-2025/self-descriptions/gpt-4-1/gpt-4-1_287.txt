Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 10,722 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Anja Müller, and I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 10 months. I am a 35-year-old divorced woman with one dependent child. 

Although my checking and savings accounts currently have low balances, I have a strong record of repaying my previous credit at your bank on time. I have lived at my current address for one year and own my residence, which is a small apartment valued at 150,000 DM. I do not have any other installment plans or outstanding debts.

A new car is essential for me to commute to work and to take my daughter to school, as public transportation is limited in our area. I am committed to maintaining my excellent credit history and can assure you of my reliability. My stable employment, property ownership, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anja Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Katarina Schmidt, and I am seeking a loan of 10,722 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am a 35-year-old married woman, working as a cleaning staff member at Hotel Europa for the past 11 months. I have one dependent child and am the sole earner in my household.

Despite my current account balance being low, I have always paid back my existing credit with your bank on time. I have owned my house for a year and have no other loans or debts apart from my current credit with your institution. My property is valued at approximately 120,000 DM.

A reliable car is crucial for my job, as my work hours often start early and end late, making public transport impractical. I am dedicated to fulfilling my financial obligations, as my payment history shows. I believe my employment stability and asset ownership make me a responsible candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Katarina Schmidt
