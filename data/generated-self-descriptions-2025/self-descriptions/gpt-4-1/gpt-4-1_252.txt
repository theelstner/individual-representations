Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 666 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a resident care worker at the Sonnenhof Senior Center, a position I have held for 5 years. I am 39 years old, divorced, and live with my 12-year-old daughter in our own home, which I purchased four years ago. My checking account has temporarily fallen below zero due to recent medical expenses for my daughter, but I have managed to maintain a savings account with a balance of 1,200 DM.

While I do have two existing credits at your bank, I have consistently met my installment obligations on time. My credit history reflects some challenges, primarily from a previous loan at another bank, but I have taken steps to improve my financial management since then. I have no other debts or installment plans and no guarantors. My current residence and employment stability, along with my real estate property, provide a solid foundation for repayment.

A new car is essential for my daily commute and transporting my daughter, especially as public transportation is unreliable in our area. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate and am committed to honoring all financial agreements.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Petra Schneider, and I am seeking a loan of 666 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am 39 years old, married, and have one dependent child. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 6 years. I have lived in my own house for four years and own a small real estate property in the area.

Although my checking account currently shows a negative balance due to unexpected home repair costs, I have maintained a savings account with over 1,000 DM for emergencies. My credit history includes a critical account from a previous bank, but I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans and have always paid my credits at your bank on time.

Having reliable transportation is crucial for my job and family responsibilities. I have proven my financial responsibility over the years, and my stable employment and homeownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Petra Schneider

To whom it may concern,

I am Maria Weber, a 39-year-old divorced mother of one, applying for a loan of 666 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a hotel housekeeper for the past 4 years and have resided in my own home for the same period. My property ownership and consistent employment provide a stable background.

My checking account is currently overdrawn due to recent legal expenses related to my divorce, but I have managed to keep a savings account with a balance of 1,500 DM. I have two credits with your bank, both of which I have serviced without delay. My credit record elsewhere is less favorable, but I have taken steps to resolve past issues and have no other debts or installment obligations.

A new car is vital for my daily commute and for taking my son to school and activities. My financial discipline and stability make me confident in my ability to repay the loan as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Maria Weber

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Jana Richter, and I am applying for a 666 DM loan to buy a new car. I am a 39-year-old separated woman with a 10-year-old daughter. I have been employed as a night shift attendant at the local community shelter for five years and have owned my house for four years.

Due to some recent unexpected expenses for my daughter's school, my checking account is currently negative, but I have a savings account with 1,100 DM as a safety net. I have two existing credits at your bank, both managed successfully. My credit history includes a critical account at a different bank, but I have no other debts or installment plans.

Reliable transportation is essential for my job, especially during night shifts when public transit is unavailable. My steady employment, property ownership, and commitment to meeting my financial obligations demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Jana Richter
