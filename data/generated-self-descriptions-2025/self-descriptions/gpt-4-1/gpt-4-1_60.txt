Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Claudia Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 1,961 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 42-year-old divorced woman and have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My current checking account at your bank has consistently maintained a balance above 200 DM, with regular salary assignments for over a year.

I have a proven track record of financial responsibility, having repaid all previous credits on time without any issues. While I currently have less than 100 DM in savings, I have managed my finances carefully and have no other debts or guarantors. I have resided at my current address for 2 years and have always prioritized stable living and working conditions.

The car is essential for my daily commute and for managing my professional and personal responsibilities, especially as I am raising my daughter alone. My current installment rate is 3, which is well within my means, and I am confident in my ability to meet all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my reliability and commitment to fulfilling all terms of the loan.

Yours sincerely,  
Claudia Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,961 DM for the purchase of a new car. My name is Sabine Müller, a married woman aged 38, currently employed as a project manager at Siemens AG for the past 10 years. I have maintained a checking account with your bank with salary deposits for over a year, and I have always ensured my balance remains above 200 DM.

My financial history is solid, with all previous loans repaid punctually. My savings are currently below 100 DM, as I recently invested in professional development courses. I have no other debts, and there are no guarantors involved in this application. I have lived at my present address for 2 years, and my only property is my existing car.

The new car is necessary for my work-related travel and for supporting my family’s needs. I am accustomed to managing multiple responsibilities, including two dependents, and my employment is stable and well-compensated. I am confident that the proposed installment rate of 3 is manageable within my monthly budget.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response and assure you of my utmost reliability.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Petra Schneider, and I am seeking a loan of 1,961 DM to finance a new car. I am a 45-year-old separated woman, self-employed as a legal consultant for the past 9 years. My checking account with your institution has been active with regular salary assignments for more than a year, always exceeding the 200 DM minimum.

I have a clean credit history, having always repaid my credits on time. At present, my savings are limited, under 100 DM, as I have recently expanded my home office. I have no co-debtors or guarantors and have lived at my current address for 2 years. My only property is my current vehicle, which is now unreliable.

A new car is crucial for maintaining my consulting business and meeting client appointments. My income is stable, and I have managed multiple installment plans successfully, including 23 other small plans over the years, all of which are up to date. The installment rate of 3 is within my financial capability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to honoring all repayment terms and appreciate your trust.

Sincerely,  
Petra Schneider
