Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 11,938 DM. I am a 31-year-old single male working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past three years. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and I have a savings account with 90 DM. I have a critical credit history due to a previous loan for my postgraduate studies, which I am still repaying with another bank.

The purpose of this loan is to cover unexpected medical expenses for my co-applicant, my younger brother, who recently had an accident. Our family car, which I own, is our only property of value. I have been living at my current address for three years, and my monthly installment rate is manageable at 2%. While I do not own my home, I have been consistent in paying rent and all other obligations.

As a research assistant, my employment is stable, and I have a clear plan to repay the loan over the next 24 months. My brother and I are both committed to meeting our financial responsibilities, and I am confident that my steady income and history of diligence at work make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 11,938 DM to support the expansion of my small consulting business. My name is Michael Bauer, a 35-year-old single self-employed management consultant. I have been in this profession for nearly two years, and business has been steadily growing. My checking account currently holds 150 DM, and my savings account has 80 DM.

I have a co-applicant, my business partner, who shares responsibility for the loan. While my credit history includes a critical account due to an earlier business venture, I have no outstanding debts at your bank. Our company car is our main asset, and we have lived at our business address for three years.

Though my housing is rented, I have always paid on time. My installment rate is low, and my income is stable enough to cover the payments without issue. I believe my experience in management, combined with my partner’s support, ensures we are reliable candidates.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you will give us the opportunity to continue growing our business.

Kind regards,  
Michael Bauer
