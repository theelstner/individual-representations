Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Schmidt, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,881 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute and have been employed there for just over two years. My monthly salary has been deposited into my checking account with your bank for the past year and a half, always exceeding 200 DM.

I am currently divorced and live with my daughter in a rented apartment, where we have resided for the past two years. As a foreign worker from Poland, I have worked hard to build a stable life in Germany. My previous credit with your bank was paid back in full and on time, demonstrating my reliability and sense of responsibility.

Although my savings are limited (less than 100 DM), I am confident in my ability to manage the installment payments, as my job provides stable income. I own a small car, which I use for commuting to work. I have no other debts or guarantors.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Maria Schmidt

Dear Loan Officer,
