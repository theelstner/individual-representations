Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martin Fischer, and I am applying for a loan of 12,680 euros to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a Senior Project Manager at TechSolutions AG, where I have worked for the past 8 years. I am single and have one dependent, my young son, who lives with me.

I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, but I maintain a good relationship with another financial institution, where I currently hold a small personal loan in good standing. My employment is stable, and I have resided at my current address for four years, living in a company-provided apartment. 

Owning a new car is essential for my job, as I frequently visit clients and sites across the region. My current vehicle is unreliable and costly to maintain. The new car will improve my efficiency and help me fulfill my professional duties. I have always met my financial obligations and can comfortably manage the proposed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Martin Fischer
