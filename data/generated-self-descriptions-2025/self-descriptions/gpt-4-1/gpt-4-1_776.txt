Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Petar Ivanov, and I am applying for a loan of 1,480 DM to purchase a new car. I have maintained a checking account with your bank with a balance exceeding 200 DM for over a year, and I have consistently assigned my small pension to this account. Though I am currently unemployed, I previously worked as a warehouse assistant for 8 years before my retirement.  

My financial situation is modest; I have 700 DM in a savings account and am living rent-free with my brother, which helps me manage my expenses while supporting my teenage son. I am a foreign worker from Bulgaria and have resided at my current address for the past four years. I do have three small existing credits with your bank, all of which I have serviced reliably.  

I need a new car to ensure I can attend medical appointments and job interviews, and to support my dependent. Despite my critical credit history, I have never defaulted on my obligations and always communicate proactively with creditors. I am committed to meeting my payment installments and believe my history with your bank demonstrates my reliability.  

Thank you very much for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Petar Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Khalil, a 66-year-old single father of one, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,480 DM for the purchase of a new vehicle. My checking account at your bank has maintained a balance above 200 DM for more than a year, with my pension regularly deposited. I have been living at my current address for four years, sharing accommodation with my cousin, which allows me to live rent-free.  

Although I am currently unemployed, I previously worked as a construction laborer for 10 years before my recent layoff. I have 800 DM in savings and no property. I am also a foreign national from Turkey and have three other small loans with your bank, all paid on schedule.  

Owning a car is crucial for me to look for employment and take care of my son, as public transportation is limited in our area. I understand my credit history is not perfect, but my record with your bank shows that I am responsible and trustworthy. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Best regards,  
Ahmed Khalil

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Janusz Kowalski, and I am seeking a loan of 1,480 DM to purchase a new car. I have been a customer of your bank for over a year, maintaining a checking account with regular salary assignments from my previous job as a hospital janitor, which I held for 9 years until last year.  

At present, I am unemployed and reside for free with my daughter and grandson, whom I help support. I am 66 years old and a foreign worker from Poland. My savings account currently holds 600 DM, and while I have some other credits outside your bank, my three existing loans with your institution have always been paid on time.  

A new car will allow me to assist my family and look for part-time work, as well as attend to medical needs. I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly, and my long-standing relationship with your bank is evidence of my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Yours sincerely,  
Janusz Kowalski

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Miguel Santos, and I am applying for a loan of 1,480 DM to purchase a new car. I have been a loyal customer at your bank for over a year, with my monthly pension payments consistently deposited into my account, which has never fallen below 200 DM.  

I am a 66-year-old single man from Portugal, living for free with my nephew’s family for the past four years. I am currently unemployed, having worked as a seasonal farmhand for 7 years prior to retirement. I have 950 DM in a savings account and three small credits with your bank, which I have managed without any missed payments.  

With one dependent, a car is essential for daily activities and to potentially secure part-time work. While my credit history is not perfect, my record with your bank shows that I am a trustworthy borrower. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and believe I am a suitable candidate for this loan.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Miguel Santos
