Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Anna Schreiber, and I am applying for a loan of 860 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My work is stable and highly valued, and I am proud of my contributions to our projects in renewable energy.

Although my checking account is currently slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, this is due to recent unexpected medical expenses for my child. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly and am up to date with my payments. My current residence has been my home for 4 years, which I own, and I have one dependent.

As a divorced woman, I am solely responsible for my household. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My credit history includes a critical account at another bank, but I have since improved my financial management and am committed to maintaining a positive relationship with your institution.

A new car is essential for my daily commute and my child’s needs. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate and assure you of my reliability and dedication. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Schreiber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 860 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Sabine Müller, and I have worked as an administrative official at the City Hall for 9 years. I am married with one child and have lived in my own apartment for the last 4 years.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to a period when my husband was between jobs, but we are now financially stable. Our savings are limited, under 100 DM, as we recently paid for necessary home repairs. I have two existing credits at your bank and have always made timely payments.

My credit history was affected by a critical account at a previous bank, which has since been resolved. We have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not relying on any guarantors.

Owning a reliable car is crucial for my job and to take my son to school. I am dedicated to fulfilling my financial obligations and have a steady employment record. I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue building a positive relationship with your bank.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Petra Weiss, and I am applying for a loan of 860 DM to purchase a new car. I have been a skilled employee at Siemens AG for 8 years and am currently separated, living with my daughter in our own home for the past 4 years.

My financial situation is temporarily strained; my checking account is below zero, and my savings are under 100 DM due to tuition payments for my daughter. Despite this, I have two existing credits at your bank, both in good standing, and no additional debts or guarantors.

I previously had a critical account at another bank, which I have since closed after clearing the balance. I have no outstanding installment plans elsewhere. A new car will enable me to maintain my work schedule and support my family effectively.

I am committed to meeting the installment payments and have a solid employment history. Thank you for considering my application and trusting in my reliability.

Best regards,  
Petra Weiss

My credit history contains a critical account at another bank, which has since been settled. I have no guarantors. A new car is vital for commuting to work and caring for my child.

I am a responsible borrower, as shown by my employment stability and payment history. I kindly request your support for this loan and assure you of my commitment to meeting all obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Karin Fischer
