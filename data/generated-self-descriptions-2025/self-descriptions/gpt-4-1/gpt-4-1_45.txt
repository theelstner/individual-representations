Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 6,187 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am currently a scientific research assistant at the University of Stuttgart, a position I have held for the past 5 years. My wife and I have been living in our current rented apartment for 4 years, and we have one child.

My financial situation is modest; my checking account is currently slightly overdrawn, and my savings amount to 350 DM. I am currently paying off a small personal loan from another institution, but I have always made my payments on time. The car is essential for my daily commute to the university and for my family's needs, as public transportation is not always reliable in our area.

I am a trustworthy candidate because of my stable employment, my dedication to my family, and my responsible approach to managing my finances. I have never missed a payment on any of my existing obligations, and I am committed to repaying this loan according to the agreed schedule.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am writing to request a loan of 6,187 DM to purchase a used car. I am a married man, working as a certified electrician at Siemens AG for the past 6 years. My job provides a stable income, and I have one dependent.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn due to unexpected medical expenses last month. I have 250 DM in my savings account. I am also repaying a furniture loan from another bank, but my payment history is clean. The car is crucial for my daily commute, as my work requires me to travel between sites, and my current vehicle is no longer reliable.

You can trust me as a candidate because I have a steady job, a solid record of meeting my financial obligations, and a clear plan for repaying this loan. My family and I are committed to maintaining our good standing, and this loan will help us achieve greater stability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Markus Klein

Dear Bank Manager,

I am Stefan Roth, a married senior administrative officer at the local tax office, where I have been employed for 4.5 years. I am applying for a loan of 6,187 DM to purchase a dependable used car, as my current vehicle is no longer serviceable.

My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking account in the negative and only 400 DM in savings. I have an existing loan for home appliances at another bank, which I am repaying without issues. We rent our apartment, and I am responsible for supporting my wife.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate because of my secure government job, my consistent payment history, and my commitment to financial responsibility. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and would greatly appreciate your support in this matter.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Roth
