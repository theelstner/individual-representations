Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,301 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 8 years, and I am currently living with my wife and our young son in our own home. Although my current checking and savings accounts have limited funds, I have always paid back previous credits on time, and I currently have one existing credit with your bank, which is in good standing.

As a foreign worker who has lived at my current address for 2 years, I have established a stable life here. My wife and I own our home, and we have real estate as property, which I believe further demonstrates my commitment and reliability. I am applying for this loan because our old television has broken, and I would like to provide my family with a reliable source of news and entertainment.

I have a guarantor for this loan, and I do not have any other installment plans or significant debts. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan as I have always met my financial obligations in the past. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, and I am seeking a loan of 1,301 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my household. I have been employed as a janitor at the Central Hospital for 9 years, and I am currently supporting my wife and our daughter.

I have lived in my own house for the past two years, and I own a small plot of land nearby. My employment is stable, and I am a dedicated worker. I have arranged for my brother-in-law to act as guarantor for this loan, further ensuring my reliability.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial responsibilities, as shown by my previous repayment history. I believe that with my stable job and property ownership, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Marek Novak, and I have been working as a building maintenance worker at the City Council for the past 10 years. I am married and have a son, and we have been residing in our own home for two years.
