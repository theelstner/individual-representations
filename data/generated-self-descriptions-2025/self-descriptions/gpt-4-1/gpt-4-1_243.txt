Letter 1

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Alexander Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 1,595 DM to purchase a new television set for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. As a single father of two children, I am eager to provide them with educational resources and entertainment, especially as we have just moved into our own apartment two years ago.

Although I do not have a checking account at present, I have maintained a savings account and a building society savings agreement. My financial history is strong, as I have always paid back any existing credits on time. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am managing responsibly.

My monthly income is steady and sufficient to cover the installment rate of 3, and I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I am a foreign worker, but I have integrated well into the community and have lived at my current residence for two years. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and can assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Alexander Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,595 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television set. As a mechanical technician at Siemens, where I have been employed for 6 years, I have always prioritized financial responsibility. My only credit with your bank has been paid punctually, and I have never defaulted on any payments.

I am a 51-year-old single male, supporting two dependents. We have owned our home for two years, and I am eager to enhance our living environment with a new television and radio, both for relaxation and for my children’s educational benefit. My current savings are modest, and I do not possess a checking account, but my salary is stable, and I have a life insurance policy as an additional asset.

I do not have any other debts or installment plans, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3. As a foreign worker, I have proven my reliability and commitment both at work and in the community.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am hopeful for a favorable reply.

Best regards,
Tomasz Nowak
