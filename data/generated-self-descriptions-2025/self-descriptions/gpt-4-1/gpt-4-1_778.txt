Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 3,535 DM. I am a 32-year-old Polish citizen, currently residing in Germany as a foreign worker. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years. My employment is stable, and I have a proven track record of reliability and dedication in my field.

I am seeking this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and professional responsibilities, as my current vehicle is unreliable and costly to maintain. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained other credit relationships responsibly, as can be verified by my credit history. I have no dependents and no other debtors or guarantors.

My financial situation is modest, with savings of less than 100 DM, but my steady monthly income ensures my ability to meet the proposed installment rate. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and have always paid my rent and bills on time. I am committed to repaying the loan on schedule and would be grateful for your consideration.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am applying for a loan of 3,535 DM to purchase a new car. I am a single, 29-year-old foreign worker from Egypt, currently working as a certified electrician at Siemens AG for the past 6 years. My employment is permanent, and I have consistently received positive performance reviews.

I do not have a checking account, but I have maintained a savings account with a small balance. I have existing credit with another institution, which I have managed responsibly despite some past challenges. I have no dependents and am solely responsible for my finances.

I have been residing at my current address for 4 years and have a car as my only significant property. The new vehicle will help me continue my work efficiently, as my job often requires travel to different sites. My stable income and low living expenses make me confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Ivan Petrov, a 35-year-old skilled employee from Bulgaria, currently working as a logistics coordinator at DHL for 4 years. I am applying for a 3,535 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is crucial for my work, as I often need to travel between warehouses and client sites.

While I do not have a checking account, I have managed other forms of credit without issues. My savings are limited, under 100 DM, but my employment is secure and my income is stable. I have lived at my current address for 4 years, have no dependents, and do not share financial responsibilities with anyone else.

I understand the importance of maintaining good financial standing, and I assure you that I will honor the repayment plan. My history as a reliable employee and tenant demonstrates my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Marko Jovanovic, and I am seeking a loan of 3,535 DM to buy a new car. I am a 31-year-old Serbian national, working as a mechanical engineer at Bosch for 5 years. My job is permanent, and I have a strong reputation for reliability and professionalism.

I do not have a checking account, but I have managed credit with other institutions and have no outstanding debts. My savings are minimal, but I have always ensured my financial commitments are met. I live alone, have no dependents, and have been at my current residence for 4 years.

Owning a new car will greatly improve my ability to perform my job, as public transport is not always reliable for my work schedule. My monthly income is sufficient to cover the installment rate, and I am fully committed to repaying the loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Marko Jovanovic
