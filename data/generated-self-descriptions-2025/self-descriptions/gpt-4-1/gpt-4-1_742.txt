Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,325 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Thomas Müller, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past five years. I have held my current position since 2019 and have demonstrated consistent professional and financial stability.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have maintained a savings account with a balance of around 350 DM. I have a solid credit history with your bank, having repaid all previous loans in full and on time. I live alone and have no dependents or other financial obligations.

The new car is essential for my daily commute and research activities, as public transportation does not cover the laboratory’s location. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have no other outstanding loans or guarantors. I have resided at my current address for three years and have always met my financial commitments.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on schedule, as I have a steady income and a history of responsible financial management. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 2,325 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a civil servant working for the local government in Düsseldorf and have been in this position for six years. My employment provides a stable and reliable income.

Although my checking account is currently below zero due to recent unexpected expenses, I do maintain a savings bond with a balance of 420 DM. I have always paid back any previous loans at your bank on time, as reflected in my excellent credit history.

As a single man with no dependents, I have a straightforward financial situation and no other debts or obligations. I have lived at my current residence for three years and have no other installment plans except for a minor furniture loan, which will be completed in eight months.

Owning a new car will greatly improve my mobility for work and personal commitments. I assure you of my trustworthiness and commitment to meeting all loan obligations promptly. I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Jens Becker
