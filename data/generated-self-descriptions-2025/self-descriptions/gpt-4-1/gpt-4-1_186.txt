Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 884 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute and have held this position for 8 years. My current checking account balance is modest, under 200 DM, and my savings account is below 100 DM. Despite this, I have maintained stable employment and a steady income.

My credit history includes a critical account and one other loan at a different bank, both of which are being managed responsibly. I am single, 34 years old, and have lived at my present address for 4 years. I own my current vehicle, which I intend to trade in for a new model to ensure reliable transportation to my workplace.

I have no other guarantors or co-signers, and I am responsible for all my financial obligations. My housing is financed through the bank, and I have no dependents. I am a foreign worker but have demonstrated reliability through consistent employment and timely payment of existing debts.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my stable employment, responsible financial management, and clear purpose for the funds. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 884 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute to my job as a senior mechanical technician at Siemens, where I have been employed for 9 years. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking and savings accounts are currently below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively, due to recent expenses.

I have an existing credit account at another bank, which I am managing according to the agreed schedule. I have no dependents and live alone, having resided at my current address for 4 years. I own a used car and some minor property assets. My housing is arranged through the bank, and I have no other installment plans except for a 36-month installment plan for furniture.

I am a single male, 38 years old, and a foreign worker with a permanent contract. My record of employment and ability to meet financial obligations demonstrates my reliability. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Miguel Alvarez

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 884 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as an IT systems analyst at Deutsche Telekom, a position I have held for 7 years. My current account balance is less than 200 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM, as I have recently paid off a previous loan.

Although my credit history includes a critical account and an outstanding loan at another bank, I have always met my payment obligations. I am a single male, 31 years old, and have lived at my current address for 4 years. I own my current car, which I plan to sell to partially finance the new purchase.

I have no dependents, and my housing is financed through the bank. I do not have any co-signers or guarantors. As a foreign worker with a stable and long-term position, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the 18-month duration.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Alexei Ivanov

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for an 884 DM loan to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a customs officer with the German Federal Customs Service for 10 years. My checking account currently holds less than 200 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM, as I have recently made a large payment on a previous loan.

I have no dependents, no other debtors or guarantors, and no additional installment plans except a 36-month plan for home appliances. As a foreign worker, I have demonstrated financial responsibility and stability through my long-term employment.

I would appreciate your consideration of my application and am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Best regards,
