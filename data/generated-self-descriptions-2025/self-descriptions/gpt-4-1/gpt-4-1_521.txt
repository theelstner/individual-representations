Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 700 euros to purchase a new television, which I need for both personal use and to stay informed as a foreign worker living in Germany. I have been employed for the past 8 years as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, and I am currently residing in Berlin for the last four years. My employment is stable, and my monthly income is sufficient to cover all my obligations, including the proposed loan installments.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank yet, I am committed to building a financial relationship with your institution. I currently have two credits with your bank, both of which are being paid on time. I have no dependents except for my young son, whom I support fully. My living situation is secure, as I am housed for free as part of my employment benefits.

I am trustworthy, as demonstrated by my long-term employment and responsible handling of existing credits. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Ivan Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 700 euros to purchase a new radio and television set. As an IT systems administrator at a logistics company in Munich, where I have worked for the past 9 years, I require reliable access to news and information, especially as a foreign worker far from home.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account at your bank, I am eager to establish one if approved for this loan. I have two existing credits at your institution, which are being serviced without issue, and I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors. I have lived at my current address for four years, and my housing is provided by my employer, which significantly reduces my living expenses.

Despite some challenges in my credit history, I am diligent and committed to meeting my financial obligations. I am single with one dependent, and I am confident that my stable employment and low housing costs make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 700 euros to purchase a new television set. As a single father and skilled employee working as a chef in a major Frankfurt hotel for the past 7 years, I need this appliance both for my personal relaxation and to provide my son with educational content.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I currently have two credits here, which I have managed responsibly. My employer provides me with free accommodation, which allows me to allocate more of my income to loan repayment. I have lived at my current residence for four years and have no other debts or installment plans.

While my credit history includes some critical accounts, I have shown reliability in my current financial commitments. My steady job, long-term residence, and responsible repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,  
Luka Novak

As a foreign worker, having access to news and entertainment is important for my integration and well-being. I am confident that I can manage the loan installments without difficulty and hope you will consider my application favorably.
