Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,449 DM to support the expansion of my small electronics repair shop in Stuttgart. I have been steadily employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, demonstrating my commitment and reliability in my professional life.

While I have experienced a delay in repaying a previous loan due to unforeseen medical expenses during my divorce, I have since resolved these issues and have maintained a good standing with my creditors. My current financial situation includes a checking account balance of 150 DM and savings of 350 DM, which I am prepared to use as collateral.

I am requesting this loan to purchase new diagnostic equipment, which will allow my business to serve more customers and increase revenue. I have lived at my current residence for 2 years and have no other debts or guarantors. My car is fully paid off and serves as my primary asset. With only one installment plan outstanding, I am confident in my ability to manage this additional loan responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to honoring my repayment schedule and using this opportunity to strengthen both my business and financial standing.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Michael Schröder, a 39-year-old divorced logistics coordinator at a major shipping company in Hamburg, where I have been employed for 9 years. I am seeking a loan of 1,449 DM to invest in a new delivery van for my courier service, which I operate as a side business.

Although I had a delayed payment on a previous loan three years ago due to the financial strain of my separation, I have since maintained a positive credit record. My current checking account holds 180 DM, and my savings account has 220 DM.

I have resided at my current address for 2 years, and I own my car outright. My employment is stable, and I have no dependents. I am fully committed to fulfilling all financial obligations, as evidenced by my consistent work history and responsible management of my existing obligations.

This loan will enable me to expand my courier business, increase my income, and strengthen my overall financial position. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Michael Schröder

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,449 DM to support the launch of my new carpentry business in Munich. My name is Andreas Vogel, and I am a 42-year-old divorced man with 10 years of experience as a certified mechanical engineer in the automotive industry.

After a difficult period during my divorce, which led to a delay in repaying a small personal loan, I have worked hard to rebuild my credit. My current checking account balance is 100 DM, and I have 400 DM in a savings bond.

The loan will be used to purchase essential woodworking tools and materials. I have lived at my current residence for 2 years, have no co-signers or guarantors, and my only property is my car, which is fully paid for. My employment has been stable, and I am committed to managing my finances prudently.

I am confident that this investment will lead to a successful business and timely repayment of the loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Andreas Vogel
