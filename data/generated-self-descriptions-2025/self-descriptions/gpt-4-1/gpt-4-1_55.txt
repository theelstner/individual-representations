Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €3,378 to purchase a reliable used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Leipzig, where I have worked for 2 years and 3 months. My current income is stable and sufficient to cover my living expenses and the proposed loan installments.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have an existing credit with you, which I have always paid back on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I own my own apartment, which further demonstrates my stability. Additionally, I have a life insurance policy with Allianz, which adds to my financial security.

The purpose of this loan is to ensure I can commute to work and take my 6-year-old son to school safely. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly payments and honor my commitments, as shown by my responsible repayment history.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Thomas Berger
