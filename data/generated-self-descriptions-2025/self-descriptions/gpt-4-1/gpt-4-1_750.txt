Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €5,248 to purchase a used car. I am a 32-year-old single man, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Dresden, where I have worked for the past two years. I do not have a checking or savings account at this time, but I have a proven record of responsible credit use, having paid off two previous credits in full and on time.

Owning a car is essential for my work, as my research often requires travel to partner institutes and field sites outside of public transportation routes. My current financial situation is stable; I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and my monthly income is sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate comfortably. I have lived at my current residence for three years, and I take pride in being a reliable tenant and employee.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, as my credit history demonstrates my commitment to meeting my obligations. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Michael Braun

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of €5,248 to purchase a used vehicle. I am a 28-year-old single male, employed as a certified electrician for the past three years at Siemens AG. I have no checking or savings account, but my previous loans have all been paid back in full and on schedule.

Currently, I rely on public transportation, which limits my ability to take on additional shifts or emergency jobs, especially outside city limits. A car would greatly increase my flexibility and earning potential. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my present address for three years.

I am diligent with my finances, as reflected in my clean credit history. My steady employment and responsible financial behavior make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jonas Richter

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of €5,248 to purchase a used car. I am a 30-year-old single man, working as a government administrative officer for 2.5 years in Leipzig. I do not have a checking or savings account but have successfully paid back previous loans, as my credit history will show.

My current job requires occasional travel to regional offices, and public transport is not always available. A car is necessary to fulfill my job requirements efficiently. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans, and my finances are stable. I have resided at my current address for three years.

With a strong record of financial responsibility and steady employment, I am confident I will be able to repay the loan without issue. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €5,248 to purchase a used car. I am a 35-year-old single male, currently employed as a mechanical engineer at BMW for the past 21 months. I do not have a checking or savings account at this time, but I have always paid back my previous credits fully and promptly.

I need a car to commute to work, as my shift schedule does not align well with public transport. My financial situation is stable, with no outstanding debts or other financial obligations. I have lived at my current residence for three years and have always paid rent on time.

Given my stable employment and excellent credit record, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule. Thank you for considering my application.

Letter 5

Dear Lending Department,

I am applying for a loan in the amount of €5,248 to purchase a used car. I am a 29-year-old single male, working as a secondary school teacher for the past two years in Chemnitz. I currently have no checking or savings account, but I have a solid credit history with all previous loans paid off on time.

A car is essential for me to reach the school where I teach, as it is located in a rural area with limited public transport options. I do not have any other debts, nor do I have guarantors or additional installment plans. I have lived at my current address for three years.

My steady employment and history of responsible credit use make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your response.

Sincerely,  
Paul Schneider
