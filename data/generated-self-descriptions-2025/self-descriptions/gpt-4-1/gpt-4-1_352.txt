Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Fischer, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,236 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances for my apartment. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, a position I have held for nine months. As a recently divorced woman with a young daughter, I am working hard to establish a stable and comfortable home for us.

Although I do not have a checking account yet, I have maintained a savings account with a small balance and have a good credit history, having repaid my previous loan from your bank on time. I live in a rented apartment where I have resided for four years, and I own a small piece of real estate in my hometown.

I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan responsibly, as my employment is stable and my monthly expenses are carefully managed. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only dependent is my daughter. I am committed to maintaining my strong repayment record and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Sincerely,  
Anna Fischer

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Martina Weber, and I am seeking a loan of 1,236 DM to replace several old and unreliable domestic appliances in my rented home. I am a 23-year-old married woman, currently working as an administrative officer at the Wiesbaden City Hall, a position I began eight months ago.

I have maintained a positive credit history, having repaid my only previous loan at your bank promptly and in full. I have lived at my current address for four years and have no other loans or financial obligations. My husband and I share one child, and I am the primary earner at this time. Although my savings are limited, I do own a small inherited property in Kassel.

I believe my employment record, reliable repayment history, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am eager to improve our living conditions and ensure my family’s comfort.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Martina Weber
