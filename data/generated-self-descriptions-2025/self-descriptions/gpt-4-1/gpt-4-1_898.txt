Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,606 DM to finance the purchase of a new television for my household. My name is Anna Becker, I am 28 years old, divorced, and currently reside in Munich, where I have lived for the past four years. I am a project manager at a reputable marketing agency, a position I have held for the last 10 months. 

Although my current checking account balance is below zero, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, including the previous loan I took with your bank for home appliances. My employment is stable, and I am confident that my monthly salary will allow me to meet the installment requirements comfortably. I have a dependent daughter and manage our finances carefully.

While my savings are limited at this time, I do hold a building society savings agreement as a form of security. I do not have any other debts, installment plans, or financial obligations beyond this application. 

I kindly ask you to consider my reliability and responsible payment history when reviewing my application. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Martina Vogel. I am a married 28-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have been employed for 9 months. I am seeking a loan of 2,606 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. 

As a young family with one child, we are currently renting and have limited savings, but I am proud to say that my previous credit with your bank was always paid back on time. My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent moving expenses. Nevertheless, I have a life insurance policy and no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

I have proven my trustworthiness through my solid repayment history and stable employment. My research position is expected to become permanent, and I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments. 

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my relationship with your bank.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Martina Vogel
