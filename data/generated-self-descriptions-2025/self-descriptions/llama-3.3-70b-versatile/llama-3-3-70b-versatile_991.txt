I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 1743 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. As a 48-year-old single male and a foreign worker, I have been a resident of this country for 2 years and have been working as an unskilled laborer for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is stable, with a steady income, but I have a critical credit history due to existing credits at other banks. I have been a customer of this bank for 24 months, with a checking account balance of 150 DM. I also have a building society savings agreement and life insurance, which demonstrates my commitment to saving and planning for the future. I am confident that I can repay the loan in 4 installments and I am willing to provide any additional information needed to support my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my loan application with you. Sincerely, Ahmed
