I am a 26-year-old scientific research assistant and I am writing to express my interest in applying for a bank loan of 1934 to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I have been working as a research assistant for the past 8 years and have a stable income, despite being a foreign worker. I have been living in my current residence for 2 years and own the property. I do not have a checking account with your bank, but I have a critical credit history due to other existing credits. I have two existing credits at this bank and I am confident that I can manage the installment rate of 2. I have a dependent, my younger brother, who I support financially. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate and I am committed to repaying the loan. I would be grateful if you could consider my application. Thank you for your time and consideration.
