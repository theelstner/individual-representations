I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 3343 to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my new home as I have been living for free for the past 2 years and I am now taking steps to set up my own place. As a 28-year-old scientific research assistant with 3 years of experience I have a stable income that will enable me to repay the loan in installments of 4 payments per month. Although I have a critical credit history due to some previous debts I have been working hard to improve my financial situation and I am confident that I can manage this loan. I have a dependent who relies on me and I am committed to providing for them. I do not have any savings or bonds to speak of but I am a responsible individual with a fixed income and I am willing to make timely payments. I would like to assure you that I will do my best to repay the loan as agreed and I am available by telephone to discuss any matters related to the loan. I am a registered foreign worker and I am committed to fulfilling my obligations. I look forward to the opportunity to work with your bank and I am confident that I will be able to repay the loan without any issues. Thank you for considering my application.
