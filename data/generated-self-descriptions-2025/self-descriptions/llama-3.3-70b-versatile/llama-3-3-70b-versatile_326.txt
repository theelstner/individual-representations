I am a 36-year-old divorced female and I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 1028 to purchase a new car. As a scientific research assistant with 2 years of experience I have a stable income but my credit history is critical due to some past financial difficulties. I have been living in my current residence for 3 years and I own the property which I believe demonstrates my ability to manage my finances and make smart investments. I have two existing credits at this bank and I am confident that I can make the monthly installment payments of 4. I have a dependent child to support and I am eager to establish a good credit history with your bank. I am a trustworthy candidate and I am committed to making my payments on time. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application with you. Sincerely Maria
