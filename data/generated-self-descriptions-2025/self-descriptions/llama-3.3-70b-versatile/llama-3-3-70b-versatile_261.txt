I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 1154 to purchase a new radio and television for my home as I have been relying on older models that are no longer functioning properly. My financial situation is currently challenging as I have been unemployed for the past 11 months and have a critical credit history due to existing credits at other banks. However I have been a resident in this area for 4 years and own my own real estate which I believe demonstrates my commitment to this community. I have a small savings account with approximately 200 DM and I am confident that I can make the monthly installment payments of 4. As a 57-year-old divorced woman with one dependent I am eager to improve my living situation and I believe that this loan will help me to do so. I am a trustworthy candidate because I have a stable living situation and a strong desire to rebuild my credit history. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application with you further. Sincerely Maria Rodriguez
