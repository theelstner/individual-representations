I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 385 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. As a 58-year-old divorced woman, I have been a resident of this city for 3 years and have been working as an unskilled resident for 5 years. Despite my critical credit history and existing credits at other banks, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I have a steady income and a real estate property that I own, which I believe demonstrates my financial responsibility. I have a checking account with this bank for 12 months, although the balance is currently less than 0 DM. I am committed to making timely payments and I believe that this loan will help me improve my quality of life. I have a telephone and I am registered as a foreign worker under my own name. I have one dependent and I am confident that I can manage my finances to repay this loan. I would be grateful if you could consider my application.
