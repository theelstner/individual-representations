I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 4370 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my family as we have recently moved into our own home and I believe it is essential for our entertainment and relaxation. As a 26-year-old scientific research assistant with 5 years of experience I have a stable income and I am confident that I can repay the loan in installments. Although I have had some delays in paying off my debts in the past I have since then managed to get my finances in order and I am now in a better position to take on this loan. I have been living in my current residence for 2 years and I have a building society savings agreement which I believe demonstrates my commitment to saving and investing for the future. I am a single male with 2 dependents and I am registered as a foreign worker under my own name. I have a telephone and I am easily accessible if you need to contact me. I believe that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan and I am willing to work with you to come up with a repayment plan that suits my financial situation. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application with you further. Sincerely, Thomas
