I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 3777 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home office as I have recently started working as a freelance translator and need to set up a professional workspace. My financial situation is stable with a savings account of 1200 DM and a real estate property that I own. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for 2 years and have a critical credit history due to a previous loan that I am still paying off. However I have been making timely payments and am confident that I can manage the installment rate of 4. I am a 50 year old single male with one dependent and I am registered as a foreign worker under my own name. I have a telephone and have been living in my current residence for 4 years. I am a trustworthy candidate and I am committed to repaying the loan on time. I would appreciate it if you could consider my application. Thank you for your time and consideration.
