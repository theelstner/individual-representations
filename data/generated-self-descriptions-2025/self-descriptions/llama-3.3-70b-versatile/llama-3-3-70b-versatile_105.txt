I have a telephone and I am easily reachable. I am a foreign worker, but I have been living and working in this country for a while now and I am familiar with the banking system. I would like to assure you that I will use the loan for its intended purpose and I will make timely payments. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application with you. Thank you for considering my loan application.
