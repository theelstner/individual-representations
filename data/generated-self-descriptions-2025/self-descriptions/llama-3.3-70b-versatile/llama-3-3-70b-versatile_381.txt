I am a 32-year-old divorced female and I work as a scientific research assistant at a local university where I have been employed for the past 2 years. I am applying for a bank loan of 362 DM to purchase a new car as my current mode of transportation is no longer reliable. I have a critical credit history due to some previous financial difficulties but I have been working hard to improve my financial situation. I have a savings account with 200 DM and I am confident that I can make the monthly installment payments of 4 DM. I have been living in my current residence for 4 years and I have a telephone at home. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors and I am the sole breadwinner for my unskilled resident dependents. I believe that I am a trustworthy candidate for the loan and I am committed to making timely payments. I would be grateful if you could consider my application. Thank you for your time and consideration.
