I am writing to express my interest in obtaining a bank loan to purchase a new car as I have been relying on public transportation for the past year and it has become increasingly inconvenient for my family and me. As a 39-year-old scientific research assistant with 8 years of experience I have a stable income that allows me to make timely payments. I have been living in my current residence for 4 years and have been registered as a foreign worker under my own name. I have a good credit history with this bank having paid back two previous credits duly. I have a telephone and my dependents are my two children. I am single and I do not have any other debtors or guarantors. My savings account has less than 100 DM and I have no other property. I am confident that I can afford the monthly installment rate of 2 and I am willing to commit to this loan. I believe that I am a trustworthy candidate and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further. Thank you for considering my loan application.
