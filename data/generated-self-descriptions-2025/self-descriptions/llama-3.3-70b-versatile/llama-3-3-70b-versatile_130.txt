I am a 35-year-old male and I am applying for a bank loan of 1860 DM to purchase a used car as I am currently unemployed and need a reliable means of transportation to search for a new job. My financial situation is a bit strained with a checking account balance of 150 DM and savings of 50 DM. I have a critical credit history due to some previous loans but I am confident that with this loan I can get back on my feet. I have been living at my current residence for 2 years and I am a self-employed individual with 2 years of experience in management. I am a trustworthy candidate as I have a stable residence and a clear plan for repayment with an installment rate of 4. I am willing to provide any additional information needed to support my application and I look forward to the opportunity to work with your bank. Sincerely, Stefan
