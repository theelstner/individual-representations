I am a 35-year-old scientific research assistant and I am writing to express my interest in applying for a bank loan of 1372 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed at my current job for 5 years and have a stable income, which enables me to repay the loan in a timely manner. My credit history is clean, and I have paid back all my previous credits duly. I have been a customer of this bank for 12 months, and my checking account has been in use since then, although the current balance is below 0 DM. I also have a small savings account with a balance of less than 100 DM. I am a trustworthy candidate, and I am confident that I can repay the loan with an installment rate of 2. I am recently divorced, and I do not have any other debtors or guarantors. I have been living in my current residence for 3 years and I own a car. I do not have any other installment plans aside from the 36 months loan I am applying for. I have a telephone and I am a skilled employee with a stable job. I am committed to repaying the loan, and I would appreciate it if you could consider my application. Thank you for your time and consideration.
