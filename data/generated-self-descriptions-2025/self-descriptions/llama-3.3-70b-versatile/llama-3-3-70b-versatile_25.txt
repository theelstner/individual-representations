As a scientific research assistant with a temporary contract that started 6 months ago I have a stable income but my credit history is critical due to some past difficulties. I have been living in my current residence for 4 years and I own the property. I have a building society savings agreement and a life insurance policy. I have a checking account with a balance of 150 DM and a savings account with 300 DM. I am a trustworthy candidate because I have a dependant and I am committed to making regular payments. I am willing to commit to an installment rate of 3 and I am confident that I can meet the payments. I would like to assure you that I am a responsible individual and I am looking forward to the opportunity to prove it. Thank you for considering my application.
