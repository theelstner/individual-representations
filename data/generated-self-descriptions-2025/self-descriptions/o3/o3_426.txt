Stuttgart, 12 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Weber, 25, and I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Bosch GmbH since July 2017. With a net monthly income of 3 450 DM and a confirmed employment contract of unlimited duration, I am applying for a 2 762 DM loan to furnish the condominium I bought two years ago in Stuttgart-West.  

My current checking-account balance is 124 DM because I recently paid annual insurance premiums. I have no savings account, yet I do hold a fully funded life-insurance policy (contract no. LI-54729-B). I also service a small, punctual instalment plan with your bank (178 DM/month, ends March 2026). All earlier obligations have been cleared without delay, as your records show.  

The requested loan would be repaid over the agreed 12-month term at the offered instalment rate of 250 DM, bringing my fixed monthly commitments to 428 DM—well within 13 % of my income. My civil-status is divorced and I have one dependent son, Felix (age 4). Child-support payments from my ex-spouse are contractually secured.  

I value long-term relationships and have demonstrated reliability toward your bank for the past three years. I therefore kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Weber

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Anna Schneider, a human-resources specialist at Allianz SE since May 2016. I respectfully request a loan of 2 762 DM to purchase ergonomic office furniture and computer equipment for the small home-office in my owned apartment.  

My monthly net salary is 3 200 DM. I maintain a checking balance that fluctuates around 150 DM after bills are paid; savings are tied up in a Bausparvertrag valued at 21 000 DM, which matures in 2028. I have no guarantors or additional debts, apart from a 120 DM monthly instalment with your bank that has been paid on time for 26 consecutive months.  

With this new credit, my combined monthly repayment obligation will rise to 340 DM—still beneath 11 % of my net income. My employment is secure, and I have received performance bonuses every year. I am married and have a three-year-old daughter, Lara. My husband covers our childcare costs, leaving my income free for loan servicing.  

Your institution has supported me reliably, and I have reciprocated with punctual payments and transparent communication. I look forward to continuing this cooperative relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,  

I, Petra Hoffmann, 25, have served as a municipal tax officer for the City of Nuremberg since August 2015, enjoying civil-servant status for life. I request a personal loan of 2 762 DM to replace outdated household appliances in my owned townhouse.  

I earn a net 3 050 DM per month. The balance of my current account is 92 DM after paying quarterly property tax. I hold no savings account but contribute 85 DM monthly to a state-approved pension plan. A prior loan from your bank (contract 2021-TN-887) is down to its last four payments and has never been in arrears.  

The proposed 12-month repayment of roughly 235 DM fits easily within my budget; total debt-service would be 320 DM, roughly 10 % of income. I am separated and have one dependent son, Jonas, aged 6; child-support is garnished from my former partner’s salary. My residence history and public-sector tenure underscore my stability.  

I would be grateful for your favorable consideration and remain available for any documentation you may require.  

Respectfully,  
Petra Hoffmann

Esteemed Members of the Credit Team,  

My name is Diana Schuster. Since June 2017 I have been employed as a certified mechanical technician at Volkswagen AG, currently earning a net monthly income of 3 600 DM. I seek a 2 762 DM loan to purchase new bedroom and nursery furniture for the house I acquired two years ago.  

Although my checking-account balance is presently 176 DM, my payslips confirm steady income and performance bonuses. I have no conventional savings account; however, I hold a BHW building-society contract worth 18 500 DM, paid up to date. My single existing credit with your bank (142 DM/month) has been serviced flawlessly for 18 months.  

The requested loan would require a 12-month instalment of approximately 245 DM, raising my total monthly debt payment to 387 DM, or just under 11 % of my income. I am married and have a one-year-old son, Leon. My spouse covers day-to-day childcare and utilities, which further strengthens our household liquidity.  

My track record with your institution, together with stable employment in Germany’s largest automotive company, attests to my creditworthiness. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Diana Schuster

Bremen, 13 June 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Elisa Müller, a public-school teacher at Grundschule Findorff since February 2016. I kindly apply for a 2 762 DM loan to equip my new flat with essential furniture and a laptop for lesson preparation.  

My net monthly salary amounts to 2 980 DM. After regular deductions my checking account rests at about 110 DM. I do not yet possess a savings account, but I pay 90 DM per month into a life-insurance policy (policy no. 31/LM/6672). I have one current loan with your bank (contract 2022-B-015) of 130 DM monthly, never in arrears.  

If approved, the combined monthly repayment would be 355 DM—well below the civil-service guideline of 40 % disposable income. I am divorced and raising my five-year-old daughter, Mia. Alimony of 400 DM/month is legally secured and regularly received.  

My secure tenure, spotless repayment history, and moderate debt ratio make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

With best regards,  
Elisa Müller
