Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

My name is Maria Konstantinova, a 59-year-old divorced Bulgarian citizen who has lived and worked in Munich for the last ten years. For the past eleven years I have been employed as a senior radiology technician at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Hospital, earning a net monthly salary of 4,300 DM.

I am requesting a business loan of 6,416 DM over 48 months to launch a mobile medical-translation service for Bulgarian and Romanian patients. The funds will cover a laser printer, specialist software, marketing material and three months of shared-office rent.

My financial record with your bank is spotless. A 3,000 DM car loan taken in 1996 was repaid six months early. My current account averages 120 DM and my savings card holds 64 DM. I have no other debts or guarantors, and the planned instalment of roughly 135 DM equals only 3 % of my income. I have rented the same apartment for three years and always pay on time. With a secure position in the public health sector and a proven repayment history, I am confident of meeting every instalment.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at the hospital during working hours and can visit the branch at your convenience.

Sincerely,  
Maria Konstantinova

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Farida Abid, a married 59-year-old Tunisian living in Hamburg since 1988. For the last eight years I have served as a senior customs documentation officer at the Federal Office of Customs, earning a net salary of 4,750 DM per month.

I wish to obtain a 6,416 DM business loan for 48 months to start an after-hours freight-paperwork consultancy. The money will finance a licence, an IBM PC, a laser fax, trade-fair fees and liability insurance.

In 1994 I took a 5,000 DM car loan from your bank and repaid every instalment on schedule. My current account balance is about 80 DM, and my savings passbook shows 41 DM. Apart from rent on the flat I have occupied for three years and support for my apprentice son, I have no other obligations. The planned repayment of around 140 DM is less than 3 % of my income. My civil-service position secures my earnings until retirement.

I look forward to your favourable reply and will gladly supply further documentation.

Kind regards,  
Farida Abid

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Aneta Petrovska, 59 years old and separated, am a Macedonian engineer resident in Düsseldorf. For fifteen years I have been employed as a certified mechanical draftswoman at Siemens Power Generation, earning a net monthly income of 3,900 DM.

I seek a 6,416 DM loan over 48 months to purchase CAD workstations and a plotter for a small freelance drafting service aimed at local craft firms. The monthly instalment of about 135 DM fits easily into my budget.

In 1995 I obtained a 2,500 DM relocation loan from your bank and repaid it without delay. I maintain one current account (present balance 143 DM) and a modest savings book (92 DM). I hold no credit cards or leases. I have rented the same apartment for three years and always pay on time. My daughter, a vocational-school student, is my only dependant.

With stable long-term employment and a flawless repayment record, I am a reliable candidate for this loan.

Respectfully,  
Aneta Petrovska


Letter 4  
To the Loan Committee,

My name is Luisa Ortega, a 59-year-old Spanish citizen who has lived in Leverkusen since 1990. I have been a senior laboratory technician at Bayer AG for nine years, earning a net 4,150 DM monthly.

I request a 6,416 DM loan for 48 months to open a part-time analytical-chemistry tutoring studio. The sum will pay for microscopes, safety cabinets, advertising and two months’ studio rent.

In 1993 I received a 3,800 DM appliance loan from your bank and settled it ahead of schedule. My current account now stands at 57 DM; my savings passbook at 38 DM. Apart from three years of punctual rent payments and support for my trainee son, I have no liabilities. The proposed repayment of 140 DM is less than 4 % of my salary. My permanent contract and Bayer’s pension plan secure my income through retirement.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Luisa Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Ewa Kowalska, a Polish national, 59 years old, married but working in Frankfurt. For the past ten years I have been a senior payroll administrator at Deutsche Bahn, with a stable net income of 4,600 DM per month.

I am applying for a 6,416 DM business loan, repayable in 48 monthly instalments, to buy accounting software, a photocopier and office furniture for an evening bookkeeping service aimed at Polish-speaking freelancers. Five clients have already signed letters of intent.

A 4,000 DM education loan granted in 1992 was repaid early. My current account holds 91 DM and my savings book 26 DM. I have no other debts, leases or credit cards. The proposed instalment of roughly 135 DM represents only 3 % of my income, leaving ample room for rent on the apartment I have occupied for three years and support for my university-student daughter in Kraków. My civil-service position guarantees continued earnings.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Faithfully,  
Ewa Kowalska
