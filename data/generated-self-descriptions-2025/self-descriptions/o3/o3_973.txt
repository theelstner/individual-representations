Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Manuel Duarte, a 43-year-old Portuguese citizen who has lived in Oldenburg for four years. I have held a permanent full-time position as a warehouse operative at Bremen Logistics GmbH for 2 years and 6 months, earning a stable net income of 2,050 € per month.

I am requesting a loan of 7,393 € for 24 months to buy a new Opel Corsa. My current car is no longer reliable, and dependable transport is essential for reaching my night shifts and taking my two school-age children to class.

Three years ago I obtained a 1,500 € consumer loan from your bank and repaid it six months early. I have no other debts, own my house outright, and hold both a building-society savings contract and a 25,000 € life-insurance policy. These assets, together with my solid employment, make me a low-risk borrower. The expected monthly installment of about 310 € is well within my budget.

Although I do not yet have a checking account, I am prepared to open one with you so that all payments can be debited automatically.

Thank you for your consideration. I would be pleased to supply any additional information.

Sincerely,
Manuel Duarte

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Stanislav Petrov. I am 43, single, and have lived in Cologne since 2020. For the past 1 year and 4 months I have worked on a permanent contract as a janitorial assistant at the City Hospital, earning 1,880 € net per month.

I seek financing of 7,393 € over 24 months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia. Reliable transportation is critical because my shifts start at 4 a.m., long before public transit operates. Without a dependable car, I risk tardiness and loss of income.

I previously borrowed 2,300 € from your bank to replace a heating unit and repaid that loan exactly on schedule. I have no other installment obligations, no guarantors, and no unpaid bills. I own my condominium outright and maintain a 22,000 € life-insurance policy as collateral. My current fixed costs amount to approximately 58 % of my monthly income, leaving ample room for the anticipated 310 € installment.

Although I do not have a checking account, I am willing to open one with you immediately for direct debit of repayments.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a favorable reply.

Kind regards,
Stanislav Petrov



Letter 3  
To the Credit Department,

I am Alejandro Ramírez, 43 years old, residing in Dortmund for the past four years. Since November 2019 I have worked as a forklift driver at AutoParts AG; my permanent employment now spans 3 years and 8 months with a net income of 2,140 € per month.

I wish to finance 7,393 € over 24 months to buy a small Ford Transit Courier. Besides commuting, the van will let me deliver spare parts for the company on weekends, an arrangement approved by my employer that will raise my income.

In 2021 I settled a 3,500 € loan with your bank without missing a single payment. I carry no other debts. I own a small townhouse, hold a Bauspar contract with a current balance of 5,800 €, and maintain a 30,000 € life-insurance policy—further evidence of my financial stability. The planned monthly payment of about 310 € fits easily into my budget; my essential expenses are 54 % of take-home pay.

I currently operate only a savings account and will open a checking account with you if the loan is approved.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Respectfully,
Alejandro Ramírez



Letter 4  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Babul Singh, a 43-year-old Indian national who has lived in Munich since 2019. I have been an assembly-line helper at Munich Packaging Works for 1 year and 10 months, earning a steady 1,960 € net each month.

I am applying for a 7,393 € loan over 24 months to buy a new Toyota Yaris. The vehicle is indispensable for reaching early shifts in Freising and for transporting my two dependents—my parents, who require frequent medical visits.

Two years ago I took a 2,000 € loan from your branch and met every installment ahead of time. Today I have no outstanding credit elsewhere, own my apartment free of mortgage, and hold both a building-society savings plan and a life-insurance policy worth 24,000 €. These assets, along with my clean payment record, underscore my reliability. A monthly repayment near 310 € is well within my disposable income.

I do not yet have a checking account, but I am ready to open one and authorize automatic debits.

Thank you very much for your attention to my application.

Sincerely,
Babul Singh



Letter 5  
Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Luka Ilić, age 43, single, and have resided in Stuttgart for four years. For 2 years and 2 months I have been employed full-time as a kitchen porter at the Riverside Hotel, earning an average net income of 1,850 € per month plus occasional gratuities.

I request a 7,393 € loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a new Renault Clio. A reliable car is essential because public transport does not cover my late-night shifts, and I also need to drive my two nieces, who live with me, to school.

My only previous borrowing was a 1,800 € appliance loan from your bank; all installments were settled on time, concluding last December. I have no additional debts, own my home outright, and possess a 27,000 € life-insurance policy and a Bauspar agreement as supplementary security. My monthly obligations currently consume just 56 % of my earnings, leaving sufficient margin for the 310 € installment.

While I do not hold a checking account, I am willing to open one immediately for automated loan servicing.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Luka Ilić
