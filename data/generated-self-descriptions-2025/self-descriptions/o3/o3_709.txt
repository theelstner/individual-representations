Munich, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Fernandez, 25, Spanish citizen, divorced, resident in Munich for the past three years. I am applying for a DM 2,969 loan over 12 months to buy bedroom and study furniture for the new flat I rent with my six-year-old son.

I have worked for eight months as a scientific research assistant at Siemens Healthineers, earning DM 3,200 gross (DM 2,250 net) per month. My current checking-account balance averages DM 140 and my savings account holds DM 60; nevertheless, all obligations have always been met on time. I previously took two small consumer loans with your bank (DM 600 and DM 900). Both instalments were settled punctually and will be fully cleared next month. I hold a DM 10,000 life-insurance policy with Allianz and contribute DM 120 monthly to a building-society savings agreement.

With monthly rent of DM 620 and no other instalment plans, I can comfortably service a DM 260 instalment without exceeding one-third of my net income. Although I do not yet have a private telephone, I can always be reached at my workplace and through written correspondence.

I value the relationship I have built with your bank and kindly request favourable consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Fernandez

Dear Loans Committee,

I, Aisha Khan, 25, married and mother of a two-year-old daughter, respectfully request a DM 2,969 loan for twelve months to equip our rented apartment with essential kitchen appliances.

For the past ten months I have been a junior software tester at Deutsche Börse Group, earning DM 3,450 gross (DM 2,430 net). My giro account seldom drops below DM 120 and I keep DM 75 in a passbook savings account. I have never defaulted on any obligation, and the two revolving credit facilities I maintain with your bank (totalling DM 1,150) have been serviced flawlessly.

Our household has no other debts or guarantors. Rent is DM 580 monthly, utilities DM 110. I own a life-insurance policy with Generali worth DM 15,000 and pay DM 90 into a Bauspar contract each month. After fixed costs I still retain DM 600 for contingencies, more than enough to meet a projected DM 260 monthly repayment.

Though I am a Pakistani national, I intend to settle permanently in Germany, and I value building a long-term banking partnership. I look forward to your positive decision.

Kind regards,  
Aisha Khan

To the Credit Department,

My name is Elena Novak, 25, Czech citizen, separated, resident in Stuttgart for three years. I seek a DM 2,969 loan for 12 months to purchase office furniture and a laptop needed for my evening legal-translation course.

I joined Bosch’s legal division nine months ago as a certified paralegal, earning DM 2,800 gross (DM 2,000 net). My checking account shows an average balance of DM 95; savings total DM 40. I have two small instalment credits with your institution (DM 500 and DM 800) that have never been in arrears and will be repaid within six weeks.

Expenses are moderate: rent DM 560, childcare for my five-year-old son DM 140. I hold a DM 12,000 life-insurance policy and a DM 8,000 building-society contract. No other debts, guarantors, or instalment plans exist. A monthly repayment of approximately DM 260 fits securely within my budget.

Although I lack a home telephone, Bosch’s reception can always relay messages to me. I am committed to maintaining my flawless payment record and thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Elena Novak

Düsseldorf, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Sofia Rossi, 25, Italian citizen, divorced, living in Düsseldorf for three years. I request a DM 2,969 loan for one year to furnish my rented flat and buy essential household equipment after a recent relocation.

For six months I have served as a flight attendant with Lufthansa, earning an average DM 3,700 gross (DM 2,650 net) plus travel allowances. My current account stands at DM 160; my passbook savings holds DM 80. I previously obtained two consumer loans from your branch (DM 700 and DM 900) and have paid every instalment punctually.

Fixed expenses are rent (DM 610) and nursery fees for my four-year-old daughter (DM 130). I maintain a DM 20,000 life-insurance policy and a building-society agreement into which I pay DM 100 monthly. No other debts exist. A DM 260 monthly repayment would leave me ample liquidity for unforeseen costs.

Though I do not have a private telephone, you may reach me through the Lufthansa crew office. My consistent repayment record and stable employment underscore my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Sofia Rossi

Esteemed Loan Committee,

I, Karolina Kovačević, 25, Croatian citizen, married, have lived in Hamburg for three years. I wish to obtain a DM 2,969 twelve-month loan to purchase new furniture and medical-grade equipment for my home study area.

For the past eleven months I have been a certified nursing specialist at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, earning DM 3,100 gross (DM 2,200 net). My cheque account balance averages DM 105, and I keep DM 70 in a savings book. Two earlier micro-loans from your bank (DM 650 and DM 850) were serviced without a single late payment and will be settled entirely within two months.

My only fixed obligations are rent of DM 590 and kindergarten fees of DM 120 for my three-year-old son. I contribute DM 95 monthly to a building-society savings contract and hold a DM 14,000 life-insurance policy. I can comfortably meet a DM 260 monthly instalment while maintaining an emergency buffer.

Though I lack a landline, you may reach me via UKE’s nursing administration office at any time. I trust my spotless credit record and steady income will merit your approval.

With respect,  
Karolina Kovačević
