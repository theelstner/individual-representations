Frankfurt, 10 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic. I have worked as a senior laboratory technician at Siemens Healthineers in Frankfurt for the past eight years under a permanent contract. I am applying for a twelve-month loan of 3,331 € to furnish and equip the small condominium I recently purchased. Because I moved in with my nine-year-old son Marko, I need basic furniture, a washing machine, and a desk for his homework.  

My net income averages 3,250 € per month. Apart from a fully serviced car loan with your bank (six timely payments left), my only other obligation is a 47 € monthly store card installment. I hold a 12,000 € life-insurance policy and a building-society savings agreement worth 6,800 €, but both are designated for long-term security and cannot be liquidated without penalty. Although my current employer pays my salary directly to a prepaid wage card, I intend to open a checking account with your bank if the loan is approved.  

During my eight years in Germany I have never missed a rent or utility payment, and the Human Resources department can confirm my excellent employment record. With an installment rate of just 2 % of my income (about 65 €), repayment will not strain my budget. I am therefore confident I will meet every due date in full.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for an interview at any time after 16:00.  

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Hamburg, 11 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Juan Luis Alvarez, a Spanish citizen employed as a municipal tax officer in Hamburg since March 2015. I respectfully request a loan of 3,331 € over twelve months to replace outdated office furniture and computer equipment in my home workspace. As a single parent to my fourteen-year-old nephew, whom I support while his parents remain abroad, I need a proper study environment for him and a certified ergonomic setup for my remote-work days.  

My gross salary is 4,100 € (net 2,650 €). I currently have one running bicycle finance plan at a local store for 32 € per month, and a small 900 € personal loan with CommerzFinanz that will be cleared in February 2026. My only savings are a 9,500 € life-insurance fund started in 2018. I own my apartment outright, inherited from my aunt, so my housing costs are limited to 240 € monthly utilities.  

Although I do not yet have a checking account, my salary history, civil-service status, and spotless payment record demonstrate reliability. The requested installment of roughly 70 € will comfortably fit within my disposable income of over 800 € each month. I am willing to assign my life-insurance policy as collateral if required.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Juan Luis Alvarez

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Hamid Rahman, age 42, Iranian national, employed for nine years as a precision-tool machinist at BMW Motoren GmbH, Munich. I wish to obtain a 3,331 € loan for twelve months to purchase bedroom furniture and household appliances for the townhouse I moved into four years ago.  

I earn a steady net income of 3,100 € per month plus annual bonuses. My financial commitments include a 120 € monthly payment on a past relocation loan from Deutsche Kreditbank (remaining balance 1,080 €) and a 55 € store plan for a refrigerator. I hold a building-society contract valued at 7,200 € and a paid-up endowment life-insurance policy worth 15,000 €.  

Even without a formal checking account, all my current payments are executed by standing SEPA orders from my wage card, and I have never incurred a late fee. The proposed installment will be approximately 66 €, less than 2 % of my income, ensuring comfortable servicing of the debt. My supervisor, Mr. Klaus Neumann, can confirm my continuous employment and good standing.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am ready to supply any additional documents upon request.  

Kind regards,  
Hamid Rahman

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Mateusz Kowalski, a Polish engineer employed at Robert Bosch GmbH since April 2016. I seek a 3,331 € loan, repayable over twelve months, to outfit the nursery and buy safety equipment for my six-year-old daughter’s room following our recent move to an owned duplex.  

My monthly net salary is 3,400 €. I have one active credit with your bank—an energy-efficient window loan opened two years ago with an impeccable payment record (balance 980 €, to be settled in May). Other obligations are limited to a 38 € electronics store installment plan. I maintain a 10,000 € life-insurance policy and a 5,500 € Bauspar contract that I intend to leave untouched.  

Although I am currently paid onto a payroll card and hold no checking account, I plan to transfer all my banking to your institution if this application is approved. With a projected installment of about 70 €, my debt-to-income ratio remains below 3 %.  

I value punctuality and transparency; enclosed are salary slips and references demonstrating my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Sincerely,  
Mateusz Kowalski

Düsseldorf, 14 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Board,  

I am David Mbembe, a Cameroonian citizen residing in Germany for eleven years, and currently a senior customs clerk with the Federal Customs Service in Düsseldorf (employment start: February 2014). I request a loan of 3,331 € for twelve months to replace worn household furniture and purchase a computer for my son’s secondary-school studies.  

My net monthly earnings are 2,980 €, supplemented by a yearly civil-service bonus. I have a small retail furniture debt of 46 € per month and an educational micro-loan with Sparkasse (balance 1,200 €) that will be fully repaid in eight months. Assets include an 8,000 € building-society savings contract and a 12,500 € life-insurance policy, both active since 2017.  

All prior loans have been paid as agreed; your bank currently holds my eco-heating credit, serviced for 18 months without default. Although I presently lack a checking account, opening one with you is my next step for salary deposits. The proposed installment—around 65 €—is easily covered by my 700 € monthly surplus.  

I pride myself on integrity, proven public-service employment, and stable residency. I welcome the opportunity to discuss any details in person.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
David Mbembe
