Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Martin Keller, 35, a senior mechanical engineer with Siemens Energy in Hanover, where I have been employed for the past eight years. I am applying for a DM 2 670 loan over 24 months to purchase a 2017 Volkswagen Golf with 92 000 km that I have located through a certified dealer. Reliable transport is essential to reach project sites outside the city, and the used car represents the most economical choice.  

My net income averages DM 5 400 per month and I own a 45 m² condominium (mortgage fully repaid last year). Apart from standard household expenses and support for my six-year-old son Leon, I have no financial obligations. I previously financed my condominium through Deutsche Bausparkasse and repaid the loan in full and on schedule; the bank can attest to my perfect payment record.  

Although I do not hold a current checking account, my salary is paid into a payroll card and I maintain a small savings balance. I am requesting that the loan installments be debited automatically from this card to guarantee punctual repayment. With stable long-term employment, proven creditworthiness, and a clear purpose for the funds, I am confident I meet your lending criteria.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss any clarification you might need.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Keller

Dresden, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Lieutenant Jonas Fischer of the Federal Police, stationed at Dresden Airport since 2014. I respectfully request a DM 2 670 consumer loan payable over 24 months to acquire a certified pre-owned 2016 Škoda Octavia. My current vehicle has become unreliable, and dependable transport is indispensable for shifts that begin before public transit operates.  

My gross annual salary is DM 92 000; net monthly income is approximately DM 4 600. I reside alone with my nine-year-old nephew Tim, for whom I hold legal guardianship, in a townhouse I purchased in 2016. The original mortgage was settled ahead of schedule last December. Aside from routine living costs I carry no other debt, guarantees or installment plans. I successfully concluded a previous DM 15 000 renovation loan with Sparkasse without missing a single payment, as reflected in my Schufa report.  

Although I operate without a checking account, my salary is paid directly to a police credit union savings account. I authorize the bank to collect the monthly installments from this account, ensuring transparency and punctuality. My decade-long public-service career, spotless repayment history and steady income underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Lt. Jonas Fischer

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a self-employed IT security consultant registered in Germany since 2012. After nine successful years in business, I am seeking a DM 2 670 loan over 24 months to purchase a 2018 Ford Focus Kombi. Regular client visits in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg have exceeded the capacity of my aging van, and public transport cannot meet project schedules.  

My average monthly after-tax income for the last fiscal year was DM 7 200, verified by my Steuerberater. I own a small detached house in Pasing, valued at DM 280 000, free of liens since I cleared the mortgage in March. I support my seven-year-old daughter Mila who lives with me part-time. My credit file shows one prior business equipment loan with Commerzbank that was repaid in full and on time.  

While I do not hold a traditional checking account, I operate through a business savings account at Volksbank München. I consent to automatic monthly deductions to cover the loan, keeping administrative effort minimal for both sides. My established company, healthy cash flow and impeccable repayment record make me a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available at your convenience for any additional information.  

Best regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

Cologne, 16 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Alexander Weiß, 35, head of marketing at Rheinländer Privatbrauerei GmbH, where I have been employed for seven years. I wish to secure a DM 2 670 loan, repayable over 24 months, to buy a well-maintained 2015 Opel Astra Sports Tourer needed for frequent trips to retail partners across North Rhine-Westphalia.  

My net salary is DM 5 650 per month. I own and live in a 60 m² apartment near Ehrenfeld; the renovation loan for this property, taken in 2019, was fully amortized last April with no missed installments. My only dependent is my eight-year-old godson Ben, for whom I pay monthly educational support. I have no other loans, credit cards, or guarantees outstanding. A recent Schufa report confirms a flawless payment history.  

Although I manage finances without a checking account—using a permanent savings account at PSD Bank Köln—I can set up a standing order so your bank receives the installment on the first business day of each month. My stable employment, solid asset base and proven fiscal discipline ensure the requested loan will be serviced without issue.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to establishing a fruitful relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Alexander Weiß

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Dr. Sebastian Hahn, a senior research officer at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, where I have worked since 2013. I am applying for a DM 2 670 loan over 24 months to acquire a certified used 2016 Toyota Auris Hybrid. The vehicle will replace my current car, enabling me to commute to our Tübingen campus and transport laboratory equipment safely.  

My net monthly income is DM 6 100, and I own a 70 m² house in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, purchased in 2015 and fully paid off as of January this year. I support my seven-year-old son Niklas. My sole previous credit—a DM 20 000 education loan—was repaid early in 2021; all payments were made punctually. I carry no credit cards, leasing contracts or guarantees.  

While I do not maintain a checking account, my salary is credited to a long-standing savings account at BW-Bank. I authorize your institution to draw the agreed installment automatically from this account, ensuring timely repayment. My consistent employment, demonstrated credit reliability and absence of other debt obligations make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am happy to provide any further documentation you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Sebastian Hahn
