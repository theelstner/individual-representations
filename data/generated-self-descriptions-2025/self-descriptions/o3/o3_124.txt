Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a loan of EUR 1,768 to furnish the two-room flat I have rented since moving to Stuttgart two years ago. I have been working as a warehouse operative at Fenix Logistic GmbH for 2 years and 5 months, earning a regular net income of EUR 1,900. My previous small consumer loan with your bank was repaid in full and on time last month, and I have no other debts.  

Although I do not yet hold a current account, I manage my salary through monthly cash transfers to a savings card and have never overdrawn. I own a 750 m² building plot near Osijek, Croatia, registered in my name, which I can document as collateral. I also support my 11-year-old sister back home, so furnishing my apartment gradually out of pocket would take too long; the 12-month loan with a EUR 155 installment perfectly matches my budget.  

My steady employment, flawless payment record and tangible property give assurance that I will meet every installment punctually. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Milan Petrovic

To the Credit Committee,  

I respectfully request a loan of EUR 1,768 for the purchase of essential kitchen equipment and a wardrobe for my rented studio. I have been employed for 3 years and 1 month as a kitchen porter at Hotel Adler Berlin, earning EUR 1,850 net per month plus regular overtime. My first credit with your bank (EUR 900, 2023) was settled three months ahead of schedule.  

Even though I handle my finances in cash and keep less than EUR 100 in my postal savings book, I budget rigorously and have never missed a payment. I own one hectare of irrigated farmland near Ludhiana, India, valued at approximately EUR 8,000, free of liens. I support my widowed mother, which underscores my commitment to financial responsibility.  

A twelve-month plan with EUR 150 repayments is well within my disposable income. My employment stability, previous impeccable repayment history, and the asset I hold abroad make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Arjun Singh

Dear Loan Officer,  

I wish to obtain a EUR 1,768 loan to replace worn furniture and buy a laptop needed for evening language classes. I have worked 1 year and 8 months on the cleaning crew at Munich Airport Service GmbH, earning EUR 1,720 net monthly, plus shift bonuses. My existing EUR 1,000 credit with your branch was repaid without delay last quarter. I have no additional liabilities.  

I currently operate only with a prepaid debit card and have not opened a checking account yet, preferring to avoid fees until my German is stronger. My family apartment in Bogotá, Colombia, where I hold a 40 % share, is valued at roughly EUR 12,000 and is mortgage-free. I also send EUR 150 monthly to support my six-year-old son.  

The proposed 12-month repayment of around EUR 150 fits comfortably in my budget: after rent and remittances I still retain over EUR 300 each month. My property share, spotless payment record and stable airport job underline my credit-worthiness. Thank you for considering my request.  

Respectfully,  
Diego Alvarez

Dear Ms. Schneider,  

I am applying for a EUR 1,768 consumer loan to equip my new rental flat with basic furniture and a washing machine. For 1 year and 11 months I have worked as a construction helper at BudPol GmbH, drawing a steady net salary of EUR 1,950 plus seasonal bonuses. In 2024 I took a small EUR 800 credit from your bank and repaid it exactly on schedule—proof of my reliability.  

I manage my wages in cash and keep under EUR 100 in a postal savings passbook; therefore no checking account is listed. As additional security, I own a 60 m² townhouse in Poznań, Poland, inherited from my grandparents and insured at EUR 15,000 replacement value. I have no other debts and no guarantors. My only dependent is my 9-year-old nephew, for whom I pay school fees.  

A 12-month plan with EUR 150 installments equals less than 8 % of my net income, leaving ample buffer. My consistent employment, prior perfect repayment, and unencumbered real estate make me a trustworthy borrower. I appreciate your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Members of the Credit Department,  

Please accept my application for a EUR 1,768 loan to purchase children’s furniture, a desk and shelving for my new rental apartment. I have been employed 2 years and 2 months as a delivery helper at SchnellKurier KG, earning EUR 1,830 net per month. In 2023 I took a EUR 700 credit at your bank and cleared it one month early.  

Although I do not yet maintain a checking account, my wages are paid onto a reloadable pay card, and I keep careful paper records; my balance has never been negative. I own a 25 % share of my late father’s house in Aleppo, Syria, estimated at EUR 10,000, which I can document through notarized land registry extracts. I support my 4-year-old daughter, so timely budgeting is second nature to me.  

The twelve-month repayment plan of approximately EUR 150 comfortably fits within my disposable income. My stable job, impeccable payment history and tangible property stake guarantee the loan will be serviced punctually. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

With best regards,  
Rasheed Al-Sharif
