Dear Lending Department,

I wish to obtain a twelve-month loan of €5 801 to purchase height-adjustable desks and lab-grade shelving for the small microscopy room I am setting up at home. Since the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Physiology introduced a hybrid-work model, I must equip the room to the same ergonomic standard as the institute.

I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the institute for eight years on a permanent civil-service-like contract. My net salary averages €3 950 per month; rent is €860. I hold one personal instalment loan with your bank (initial €4 000, current balance €2 420) that I have serviced punctually for 28 consecutive months. An education loan with another lender (€6 300) is likewise repaid on schedule.

Although I do not yet maintain a current account with your bank, you already receive my monthly repayment without delay. I maintain a life-insurance policy with Allianz (surrender value €12 500) and a building-society savings agreement (€9 800) as long-term security.

The requested loan would require an instalment of roughly €510, well within my disposable income. My flawless repayment record, stable public-sector employment and existing collateral make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 0172 - 448 16 09 for any further information.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Peter Hoffmann

To the Credit Committee,

I am requesting a €5 801 consumer loan over twelve months in order to replace my worn furniture and purchase a computer workstation for my son’s final-year Abitur projects.

For the past twelve years I have served as a senior customs officer at Cologne/Bonn Airport, grade A9. My net monthly income is €4 120; fixed expenses (rent €780, utilities €190, insurance €95) leave ample room for the projected €500 instalment.

I currently have one small renovation loan with your branch (€2 000, balance €930) and a €3 500 vehicle loan with RheinBank. All payments have been made ahead of schedule. Although I do not yet hold a current account, you may verify my reliability through the standing order already in place.

My life-insurance contract with SIGNAL-IDUNA (fund value €15 400) and a Bausparvertrag at LBS (€11 600) constitute additional security. I have no other instalment plans, carry no credit-card balances and have never overdrawn an account.

Given my long, civil-service employment, clear repayment history and existing collateral, I trust you will find my application sound.

Kind regards,  
Markus Schulze

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a €5 801 loan, term 12 months, to purchase new bedroom and dining furniture after relocating to a larger flat to accommodate my teenage daughter.

I have worked as a certified CNC machinist at Siemens Mobility in Erlangen for nine years. My permanent contract provides a net monthly salary of €3 650 plus overtime. Rent is €820; other fixed costs total €700, leaving sufficient margin for the envisaged €505 monthly instalment.

I service one credit with your bank (balance €1 780, never in arrears) and a €4 200 vocational-training loan with Sparkasse, also in good standing. Though I do not yet hold a current account with you, my repayment conduct demonstrates reliability.

I contribute €210 monthly to a BHW building-society plan (current balance €8 900) and hold a Generali life-insurance policy valued at €13 000. I have no outstanding credit-card debt, no overdrafts and no guarantors.

My stable income, German residency permit of unlimited duration, spotless payment record and existing assets make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Best regards,  
Alexei Petrov

Dear Loans Officer,

Please accept my request for a €5 801 loan over 12 months to acquire ergonomic office furniture and upgraded networking equipment for my home office. My role as an IT systems administrator at Munich Re requires frequent remote work, and current equipment no longer meets corporate standards.

Employment: ten years with Munich Re, permanent contract, net salary €4 300. Expenses: rent €890, utilities/insurance €220, childcare support for my niece €150. The projected instalment of approximately €510 fits comfortably within my budget.

I have one small personal loan with your institution (€3 000 opened April 2023, balance €1 350) and no other instalment plans. All repayments have been timely. Although I do not operate a current account here, my standing order shows punctuality.

Assets include a DEVK life-insurance policy (current surrender value €10 800) and an LBS Bausparvertrag (€9 200). I carry no credit-card balances and have never defaulted.

My decade-long tenure in a highly regulated re-insurance environment, clean credit record and existing collateral underscore my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am reachable at 0170 - 532 66 41 for any clarification.

Sincerely,  
José Oliveira

Hamburg, 23 September 2025  

Respected Credit Manager,

I wish to apply for a €5 801 personal loan, repayment term 12 months, to furnish my rented apartment and purchase specialised tool cabinets for my aviation hobby workshop.

For the last eleven years I have been employed as a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer with Lufthansa Technik. My net monthly income averages €4 050, supplemented by variable shift bonuses. Monthly rent is €810; other fixed costs are €670. The estimated €505 instalment is therefore well covered.

I maintain one credit with your bank (balance €2 100, never overdue) and an education loan with KfW (€5 500, 0.9 % interest) with an impeccable payment history.

I do not yet hold a checking account with you, but my existing loan performance is a testament to my reliability. Additional security is provided by a €14 700 Zurich life-insurance policy and a building-society savings agreement with Schwäbisch Hall (€10 100).

I have no guarantors, no other debts and a consistent record of on-time payments. My age, stable long-term employment and technical profession make me a low-risk candidate.

I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any further documents.

Yours faithfully,  
Vivek Sharma
