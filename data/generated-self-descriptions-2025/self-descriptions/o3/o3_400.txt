Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a 1,223 DM loan to purchase a reliable used Volkswagen Polo for commuting to my workplace. For the past nine years I have been employed as a CNC programming specialist at Rheinmetall AG, earning a net salary of 4,100 DM per month. My current checking balance is 132 DM and my savings account holds 67 DM, figures that are modest because I recently paid school fees for my 12-year-old son.  

Despite limited liquid cash, my credit record is impeccable: two prior loans with your bank—totaling 18,000 DM—were repaid ahead of schedule. I own a small townhouse in Ostrava, Czech Republic, valued at approximately 160,000 DM, which underscores my long-term stability. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and plan to settle this new loan within 12 months at the standard installment rate.  

My long tenure, consistent income, and proven repayment history confirm that I am a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Novak

Dear Loan Committee,  

Please accept my request for a 1,223 DM loan to finance a new company car—a Dacia Sandero—that will allow me to visit construction sites across Schleswig-Holstein. I have worked as a certified electrical foreman for Stadler Elektro GmbH for eleven years, drawing a steady net income of 3,800 DM monthly.  

My checking account currently shows 54 DM and my savings 42 DM after covering relocation costs from Lübeck last month. I rent my apartment, yet I own a parcel of land in Izmir valued at roughly 90,000 DM. Importantly, I have maintained two previous loans with your branch—one for tools, one for vocational courses—and repaid them both punctually. No other installment plans exist.  

With a dependable salary, stable employment, and a spotless credit record, I am confident I can meet the 12-month repayment schedule. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Ibrahim Kaya

Dear Members of the Credit Board,  

I am writing to request a 1,223 DM loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa. The vehicle is essential for my daily 28-kilometre commute to the Deutsche Patent- und Markenamt, where I have served as a senior patent examiner for eight years, earning 4,600 DM net per month.  

My present checking balance is 98 DM and I hold 51 DM in a small savings plan, as I recently funded dental surgery for my daughter. All previous obligations—two education loans with your bank amounting to 12,500 DM—were repaid precisely on schedule. I own a mortgage-free apartment in Valencia worth approximately 180,000 DM, demonstrating solid asset backing.  

I have no other debts and a single dependent. I propose a 12-month term at the standard installment rate and am confident that my consistent income and clean credit history make me a secure borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel A. Alvarez

Dear Credit Officer,  

I wish to obtain a 1,223 DM loan to replace my aging Ford Fiesta with a new Skoda Fabia, which I rely on for field inspections. I have been employed for fifteen years as a wastewater treatment supervisor with Badenova AG, earning 3,900 DM net each month.  

Due to recent payment of my son’s boarding expenses, my checking account stands at 73 DM and savings at 29 DM. Nonetheless, I possess a mortgage-free residential plot in Kochi, India, currently valued at about 110,000 DM. My two prior credits with your bank—totaling 20,000 DM—were settled ahead of their due dates, and I carry no additional installment plans.  

With steady income, long-term employment, and flawless repayment history, I am confident of fulfilling the 12-month repayment commitment. I respectfully request your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Arun P. Menon

Dear Madam or Sir,  

I am applying for a 1,223 DM loan to purchase a new Renault Clio, needed to reach customer sites in my role as a municipal building inspector. I have served the City of Stuttgart for ten years, with a dependable net salary of 4,300 DM per month.  

My current checking balance is 147 DM and savings account 64 DM, as I recently funded language courses for my 14-year-old daughter. I own a fully paid-for family house in Kraków valued at approximately 150,000 DM, reflecting my financial solidity. Two earlier loans at your institution—taken for home renovations—were repaid without delay. I maintain no additional debts or guarantors.  

Given my stable employment, property ownership, and impeccable repayment track record, I trust you will find my application credible. I am prepared to honor the 12-month repayment plan at the stated installment rate.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,
