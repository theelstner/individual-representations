Stuttgart, 14 March 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Tomasz Kowalski, a 22-year-old Polish citizen living in Germany since January 2024 and married with one infant son. I have been working for nine months as a junior CNC machinist at Bosch Rexroth in Stuttgart, earning a net salary of 2,250 DM per month on a permanent union contract.  

I am applying for a 3,832 DM loan over 30 months to furnish our first owned flat and buy the essential appliances our new baby requires. Our current account balance is 118 DM, and we hold 63 DM in a savings passbook plus a building-society savings agreement opened two years ago. I have no other obligations; my only previous liability was a 1,500 DM overdraft with your bank, which I repaid three months early and without a single late installment.  

All repayments will be covered comfortably from my salary; the planned monthly rate of roughly 140 DM represents just 6 % of my net income. I am committed to automatic deduction on payday and can provide my employer’s letter of confirmation. With a clean credit record, steady employment, and a young family to care for, I trust I have proved my reliability and look forward to strengthening my relationship with your bank.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Kowalski

Frankfurt a.M., 12 March 2025  

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I am Miguel Hernández-de-la-Cruz, 22, Spanish national, married and father of a toddler. Since June 2024 I have served as a probationary administrative officer (Beamtenanwärter) with the Frankfurt Fire Department, earning 2,100 DM net each month under a civil-service contract.  

To equip our newly purchased studio flat and set up a small home-office corner required by my training, I request a 3,832 DM loan for 30 months. Apart from 84 DM in a savings account and a life-insurance policy started last year, our only bank product is the current account I hold with you, presently at 73 DM.  

I took a 900 DM study loan from your bank in 2023, which I repaid in full by November 2024, ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans. The proposed repayment of roughly 140 DM will be covered through payroll deduction, leaving ample room in our household budget.  

My civil-service status, flawless repayment history, and modest but consistent savings show my commitment to financial responsibility. I would be grateful for your support.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Hernández-de-la-Cruz

Munich, 10 March 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Ahmed El-Sayed, 22-year-old Egyptian research laboratory assistant at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München since May 2024. My net monthly income is 2,280 DM; my wife stays at home to care for our six-month-old daughter.  

We recently moved into our own small condominium, financed partly through a Bauspar contract in my name. To finish furnishing the flat and acquire proper equipment for my lab workbench at home, I seek a loan of 3,832 DM over 30 months. My current account shows 96 DM, while my savings book holds 52 DM.  

In 2022 I obtained a 1,200 DM consumer loan from your branch in Garching and settled it exactly as scheduled by December 2023. I maintain no other credit lines, leases, or guarantor obligations. With a repayment rate of about 140 DM, less than 7 % of my net salary, I can meet each installment comfortably; direct debit will ensure punctuality.  

My clean payment record, secure university contract, and the collateral of my life-insurance policy attest to my reliability. I look forward to continuing our positive cooperation.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Leipzig, 11 March 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ivan Petrov, a 22-year-old Bulgarian postal clerk employed at Deutsche Post Leipzig since July 2024 (net income 2,000 DM). I am married and have one dependent son.  

We own a small terraced house acquired with the help of a Bausparvertrag. To purchase children’s furniture and replace outdated kitchen appliances, I request a 3,832 DM loan repayable in 30 months. My current account balance stands at 132 DM; savings are 55 DM.  

I previously held a 1,050 DM credit at your bank, repaid in full and on time in January 2025. I carry no other debts or installment commitments. The planned monthly payment of roughly 140 DM will be debited directly from my salary account, amounting to just 7 % of my household’s net income.  

My steady employment, owned residence, existing life-insurance policy, and spotless repayment history demonstrate that your trust will be well placed. Thank you for evaluating my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov  



Letter 5  
Wolfsburg, 13 March 2025  

Dear Credit Officers,  

I am Luca Rossi, 22, Italian national, married, with one infant daughter. I have worked for seven months as a mechanical engineering technician at Volkswagen’s Wolfsburg plant, earning 2,350 DM net monthly under a permanent IG-Metall contract.  

To complete the furnishing of our recently purchased apartment and buy specialized measuring equipment required for my evening vocational course, I wish to obtain a loan of 3,832 DM for 30 months. My current account holds 119 DM; my savings account contains 71 DM.  

In 2023 I borrowed 1,300 DM from your institution to cover relocation costs and cleared the debt last October without delay. I hold no other loans, leases, or guarantor responsibilities. A monthly installment of approximately 140 DM will be transferred automatically on payday, leaving our budget with comfortable reserves.  

My proven repayment discipline, secure employment, and additional security through a life-insurance policy make me a dependable candidate. I am eager to continue building a long-term partnership with your bank.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Luca Rossi
