Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Markus Fischer, 29, Austrian citizen living in Frankfurt since 2022. I work as a scientific research assistant at Vantage Biotech GmbH, where I earn a fixed gross salary of 5 600 DM per month. I am applying for a 11 328 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a high-performance liquid chromatograph that will allow me to take on additional contract analyses from local pharma start-ups. The extra income will increase my monthly cash flow by an estimated 1 800 DM.

My current checking balance averages 120 DM because I funnel almost all surplus into my mortgage prepayments. I own a small condominium in Bockenheim and a 2019 Volkswagen Golf. I have previously held two instalment loans with your bank (both for household renovations) and repaid them on schedule; my SCHUFA record is spotless.  

Although my savings account shows only 60 DM, I have a signed co-applicant agreement with my sister Anna Fischer (public school teacher, permanent contract, 4 900 DM net/month). Together we easily meet the required instalment rate of 2 %, or roughly 265 DM per month.  

With stable employment, proven repayment discipline and a secured additional revenue source, I am confident I am a trustworthy candidate for the requested credit. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Markus Fischer

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Leonardo Rossi, an Italian-born architect, single father to five-year-old Luca, and resident homeowner in Munich-Schwabing for three years. Since May 2022 I have managed the German branch of Studio Forma S.p.A., drawing 6 100 DM gross per month plus project bonuses.  

I request a 11 328 DM loan to finance advanced BIM software licences and a plotter, which will permit my team to bid on federal infrastructure tenders this autumn. Forecasted additional turnover is 90 000 DM in the first year.  

Despite an average current-account balance of only 80 DM, I own my apartment outright (inherited) and a 2020 Audi A3. I have settled two previous renovation credits with your bank without a single late fee. Other monthly obligations include a 310 DM furniture plan, likewise serviced punctually.  

My co-applicant is my brother, Dr. Matteo Rossi, an anesthesiologist at LMU Hospital earning 7 800 DM net per month. Combined, our disposable income covers the 24-month instalment comfortably.  

My professional reputation, clean credit record and strong collateral give me confidence that I meet your risk criteria. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Leonardo Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am David Chinedu Okafor, 29, German-Nigerian citizen and senior data-analytics manager at Nordport Logistics AG since August 2021, salary 5 900 DM gross. I wish to obtain a 11 328 DM loan for tuition and travel connected to the part-time Executive MBA at WHU. The degree will raise my earning potential by an estimated 20 %, strengthening my long-term repayment capacity.

My giro account seldom exceeds 150 DM because I support my four-year-old daughter Amara and have been aggressively paying off smaller debts: two consumer loans with your bank (11 / 2023 and 02 / 2024) that are now closed in perfect standing. SCHUFA score: 96 %. Savings currently 55 DM.

Assets include a mortgage-free row house in Altona (market value ~430 000 DM) and a 2018 BMW 1-Series. I have no unpaid taxes or collection records.

My co-applicant, Mr. Lars Petersen (childhood friend, Lufthansa first officer, 6 500 DM net/month), has provided a notarised guarantee. Servicing the required 2 % instalment—about 265 DM—poses no difficulty for us.

I take financial commitments seriously and appreciate your confidence. Please contact me for any further documentation.

Respectfully,  
David C. Okafor

To the Lending Department,

My name is Jakob Schneider, 29, lieutenant in the German Navy (civilian pay grade A11, 5 300 DM gross). Stationed in Wilhelmshaven, I have lived in my own townhouse in Bremen for the past three years. I request a 11 328 DM personal loan over 24 months to acquire diagnostic tools and stock for the side business I am launching—mobile maintenance of electric boat engines. Navy regulations permit this secondary employment, and projected net profit is 1 400 DM monthly once fully operational.

Current liquidity is low (checking balance averages 90 DM; savings 20 DM) because I recently purchased a service van in cash. However, I possess a 2021 Skoda Octavia and enjoy subsidised housing allowances, keeping fixed costs moderate. My two earlier credits with your branch (home insulation and solar panels) were both settled early, showing my reliability.

Co-applicant is my cousin, Frau Katharina Müller, an Oberstudienrätin earning 5 100 DM net, who has signed the repayment guarantee. Our combined disposable income exceeds 3 000 DM, well above the 270 DM monthly instalment.

Given my steady government income, impeccable repayment history and additional commercial prospects, I consider myself a low-risk borrower. Thank you for your favourable consideration.

With respect,  
Jakob Schneider

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Adrian Meyer, a Swiss national, single, 29, and senior strategy consultant at Helmrich & Partner since January 2023. My gross monthly pay is 6 400 DM plus variable bonus. I seek an 11 328 DM loan to retrofit my owner-occupied duplex with accessibility features for my six-year-old son Jonas, who was recently diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. The planned adaptations (stair lift, widened doorframes) are medically prescribed and partly reimbursable by my insurer, but I must cover the upfront cost.

My checking account stands at 140 DM and savings at 85 DM because I pre-paid 12 months of Jonas’s therapy. Nevertheless, I own a 2020 Mercedes A-Class outright and carry no revolving debt. Two previous car loans with your institution were both paid off ahead of schedule.

The co-applicant on this request is my father, Peter Meyer, retired bank auditor receiving a pension of 5 600 DM monthly; he has provided full surety. The combined income-to-instalment ratio is therefore excellent, easily accommodating the 2 % repayment rate.

I have enclosed employment and insurance confirmations and remain available for any additional information. I appreciate your time and anticipate a positive decision.

Warm regards,  
Adrian Meyer
