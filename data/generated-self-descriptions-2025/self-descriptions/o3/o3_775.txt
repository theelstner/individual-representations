Dear Loans Committee,  

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, employee-in-charge of the test laboratory at Weller Audio GmbH. I have worked there for eight years and earn a fixed net salary of 3 120 DM per month. I ask for a 2 223 DM, 24-month loan to purchase a professional DAB+ tuner and 55-inch studio reference monitor. The set will allow me to accept freelance calibration work on weekends and thus add roughly 350 DM of extra income every month.  

Although I hold two small instalment loans with you (originally 6 000 DM, now down to 1 750 DM combined), they have always been serviced on time. I own my condominium at Sonnenallee 71 outright and have a paid-up building-society savings contract worth 460 DM. My savings balance is currently 310 DM, reserved for unexpected medical costs for my 17-year-old son.  

I have no guarantors, but my steady employment record, property ownership and flawless repayment history with your bank should reassure you of my reliability. I am willing to sign a wage-assignment clause so that instalment rate category 4 is debited directly from my salary.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

To the Credit Department,  

I am Carlos Mendez, senior mechanical foreman with Süd-Bayern Kraftwerke, where I have been employed since May 2017. My monthly net income is 3 450 DM. I kindly request a 2 223 DM loan over 24 months to replace my outdated television and short-wave radio sets, which I use for distance-learning language courses recorded from international broadcasts. Completing these courses will qualify me for the internal “Shift Coordinator” post, increasing my salary by about 12 %.  

I currently hold two instalment plans with your bank (balance 2 020 DM) and one furniture loan with Möbel-Kredit GmbH (balance 980 DM). All payments have been punctual; I enclose statements. I own a small house in Freising and maintain a life-insurance policy surrendered value 420 DM. My savings account shows 140 DM, and I plan to transfer part of my annual bonus (due in December) into it.  

Being single, I support my widowed mother (age 82); thus, I value predictable, bank-deducted instalments. My strong employment history, property collateral and unblemished repayment record make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendez

Hamburg, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Martin Kowalski, customs compliance officer at Hafen-Log GmbH for the past nine years with a steady net income of 3 000 DM. I wish to borrow 2 223 DM for 24 months to purchase a satellite radio/TV package that will enable real-time monitoring of shipping news channels. This will improve my performance, strengthen my job security, and position me for a supervisory role.  

My credit report shows one consumer loan with NordCredit (remaining 1 300 DM) and two small contracts with your bank, both never in arrears. I own the apartment I live in and hold a building-society agreement currently valued at 380 DM. Savings stand at 270 DM after having paid school fees for my 14-year-old daughter.  

Although I have no checking account, I always deposit cash three days before each due date; your branch staff can confirm this pattern. I am a Polish national who has lived in Germany since 1990 and have permanent residence status. My consistent employment, owned property and perfect payment history underpin my reliability.  

Kindly approve my request. I am ready to sign any additional security clauses you may require.  

Yours faithfully,  
Martin Kowalski

Stuttgart, 16 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is Yusuf Demir, logistics supervisor at Orkan Automotive AG, employed continuously for eight years. My average net earnings are 3 280 DM plus annual profit sharing. I seek a 2 223 DM loan, repayable in 24 equal instalments, to acquire a 4K HDR television set and internet radio receiver. The purchase is part of a plan to launch an online car-parts review channel, expected to generate side income of at least 300 DM per month after six months.  

I handle two running loans with you (current combined balance 1 590 DM) and one appliance loan elsewhere (740 DM). All obligations are up-to-date. My townhouse is mortgage-free, and I own a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 450 DM. Savings currently total 190 DM, rising to over 600 DM once my holiday pay arrives in October.  

Though single, I financially assist my university-age nephew. I have no guarantors but offer wage assignment as additional security. Eight years of spotless repayments with your bank confirm my creditworthiness.  

Thank you very much for reviewing my application. I look forward to a favourable decision.  

Kind regards,  
Yusuf Demir

Nuremberg, 17 September 2025  

Credit Committee,  

I am Peter Novak, municipal building inspector for the City of Nuremberg since April 2016, earning a stable 3 200 DM net monthly. I request a 2 223 DM, 24-month loan to upgrade my home’s radio and television equipment. Besides personal use, the new gear will allow me to follow continuing-education webinars broadcast after work hours, required for my upcoming promotion exam.  

I presently service two credit contracts with your bank totalling 1 880 DM and a small renovation loan with Baufix Kreditbank (900 DM). Every instalment has been made on schedule. I own my detached house and maintain a building-society savings plan valued at 410 DM. My available savings are 160 DM, kept for my 18-year-old son’s vocational tools.  

Although I do not hold a checking account, I authorise automatic deduction from my monthly salary paid by the city treasury. My long government employment, property ownership and flawless repayment record underpin my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am at your disposal for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak
