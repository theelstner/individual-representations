Frankfurt, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anna Petrova, 19, Bulgarian citizen, separated, with one daughter. Eight months ago I started work in Frankfurt as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Biophysik (net salary 1 420 DM). I rent a two-room flat where I have only the basics that came with the apartment. I am applying for a loan of 1 980 DM to purchase essential furniture (child’s bed, wardrobe, kitchen table) and a used microscope required by my lab for home sample prep.  

Although I have no current checking account in Germany, I have two education micro-loans with your bank that I have serviced punctually for the past nine months; the remaining balance is 410 DM. My monthly fixed costs (rent 420 DM, daycare 90 DM, insurance and phone card 55 DM) leave me with 855 DM, easily covering the proposed 90 DM instalment. I own a 2006 Opel Corsa in good condition, which I use for commuting.  

My mother, Ms. Ivanka Petrova (teacher, net income 1 800 DM) will act as co-applicant. With a spotless payment record and stable employment, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria. I would also like to open a checking account with you so that the salary can be paid directly to the bank.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am María Fernández, 19, married, Spanish national, and currently employed as a junior aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik (net pay 1 570 DM, employment since December 2024). I respectfully request a 1 980 DM loan to furnish the small apartment my husband and I rent in Trudering and to buy a professional tool trolley that will allow me to qualify for weekend overtime shifts.  

During the last nine months I have maintained two relocation credits with your bank (totalling 2 400 DM) and have never missed a payment. My husband, Jorge Fernández (cook, net 1 300 DM), will co-sign the present application. After rent and other obligations, our combined disposable income is 1 100 DM, more than enough to cover a 90 DM monthly instalment.  

I hold a valid residence permit until 2029, own a 2010 Seat Ibiza, and have no other debts. Though I have not yet opened a checking account in Germany, I have handled all previous payments by standing order from a savings card with proven reliability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
María Fernández

Stuttgart, 10 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Lina Wei, 19, divorced, Chinese citizen, with a three-year-old son. Since January I have been working as an IT support technician at BOSCH Service Solutions, earning 1 480 DM net. I am requesting a 1 980 DM loan to purchase a computer workstation and basic household furniture for the apartment I have rented since moving out of company housing.  

I presently repay two small moving loans (remaining 560 DM) with your bank; every instalment has been credited on time. My only fixed costs are rent (400 DM), childcare (80 DM) and health insurance (65 DM). A 90 DM monthly repayment fits easily into my budget.  

My brother, Mr. Wei Liang (engineer, net 2 100 DM), will act as guarantor. I own a 2007 VW Polo and have had the same residence for two years, demonstrating stability. Although I do not have a current account, I intend to open one should this application be granted.  

I appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Lina Wei

Hamburg, 11 September 2025  

Dear Banking Officer,  

I am Sofia Dimitrova, 19, married, Bulgarian national. In December 2024 I began full-time work as a trainee nurse at the Asklepios Klinik Altona, earning a fixed net salary of 1 350 DM plus occasional weekend bonuses. I request a loan of 1 980 DM to buy a washing machine, wardrobe, and medical reference tablet required for my studies.  

Your bank currently services two introductory education credits for me (balance 310 DM). All payments have been made punctually. My husband, Viktor Dimitrov (warehouse operative, net 1 450 DM), will co-apply, providing additional security. After paying rent of 390 DM and other commitments we retain approximately 1 200 DM each month, ensuring the suggested repayment of 90 DM is comfortable.  

Though I have not yet opened a checking account, my salary is transferred to a prepaid wage card that has never been overdrawn. We own a 2008 Renault Clio, no other loans or instalment plans. I value my good credit reputation and will do everything to maintain it.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Dimitrova

Cologne, 13 September 2025  

To whom it may concern,  

My name is Elena Rossi, 19, separated, Italian citizen, with one dependent daughter. Since November 2024 I have worked as a culinary apprentice at Hotel Excelsior Ernst, earning 1 300 DM net on contract. I am applying for a 1 980 DM loan to furnish my rented studio and to purchase a professional mixer and knife set required for the hotel’s pastry section.  

I have maintained two small relocation credits with your bank for the past nine months; current balance 380 DM, no late payments. Monthly expenses are rent 410 DM, kindergarten 85 DM, transport 60 DM, leaving over 745 DM disposable income—ample to cover an expected 90 DM instalment. My mother, Mrs. Lucia Rossi (school administrator, net 1 900 DM), will act as co-applicant.  

I possess a 2009 Fiat Punto, no other liabilities, and plan to open my first German checking account with your institution if the loan is approved. I am committed to honouring every obligation and have already proven my reliability with you.  

Thank you very much for your attention. I look forward to your positive response.  

Best regards,  
Elena Rossi
