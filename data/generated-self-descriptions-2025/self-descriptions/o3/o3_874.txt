Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a business loan of 1 382 DM to purchase an industrial-grade 3-D printer for my registered side venture, PrototypWerkstatt. After 5 years and 3 months as a laboratory technician at Robert Bosch GmbH (net salary 3 050 DM), I have built a steady clientele that now requires in-house printing. The additional machine will raise my monthly side income from 430 DM to an estimated 900 DM.  

My current checking balance shows –340 DM after an unexpected medical bill for my son, but my account has been positive for the preceding 18 months. I hold a savings balance of 260 DM and own a 42 m² apartment in Bad Cannstatt, inherited last year, which serves as collateral additional to my salary. I have two existing instalment contracts with your bank and have never missed a payment; both will be fully settled within nine months.  

With real estate ownership, stable employment, and a proven payment record, I am confident of servicing the new loan at 150 DM per month (well below the 4 % instalment guideline). Please consider my request; I am available at any time on 0711 – 889 54 21.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Schmidt

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I kindly request a business loan of 1 382 DM to complete the fit-out of my licensed mobile espresso cart, “Petrov Coffee”. I have worked 4 years 8 months as a certified HVAC electrician with Stadtwerke München, earning 2 900 DM net monthly. The cart is already ordered; the loan will cover a barista machine and hygiene certification fees. Projected profit is 650 DM per month, beginning December.  

My Girokonto shows –210 DM after school expenses for my 3-year-old daughter, but my salary covers this shortfall within the next pay cycle. Savings stand at 190 DM. Although I maintain a small furniture loan with another bank, all instalments have been punctual.  

I own a 48 m² condominium in Berg am Laim (market value approx. 94 000 DM) and have resided there for one year. As a single registered foreign worker, I am fully tax-compliant and reachable any time at 089 – 643 11 55. My solid employment record, property, and clean repayment history make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Alexei Petrov

To the Credit Department,  

I wish to obtain a 1 382 DM loan to upgrade servers for my part-time software-maintenance service, CodeRepair. For 6 years 2 months I have been an IT support officer at the Baden-Württemberg Tax Office, earning 3 200 DM net. New equipment will let me double weekend capacity and add roughly 700 DM monthly revenue.  

My cheque account is temporarily –390 DM following an urgent roof repair on my townhouse. This will be cleared with the next salary. Savings: 310 DM in a Sparkonto; property: owner-occupied townhouse (current mortgage with L-Bank, never in arrears). I hold two consumer loans with you, both serviced flawlessly—no missed payments in 29 months.  

I agree to a 150 DM monthly instalment, which leaves over 60 % of my net income for living costs. With secure civil-service employment, home ownership, and a spotless payment record, I trust you will find my application sound. Reach me at 0721 – 881 77 04 for any detail.  

Yours faithfully,  
David Müller

Dear Loan Officers,  

I apply for a 1 382 DM business loan to purchase initial inventory for my registered online shop “AutoTeil Direkt”. I have been a mechanical drafter at Siemens Mobility for exactly 5 years, receiving 3 100 DM net each month. Projected shop profit is 500 – 700 DM monthly, starting in November.  

Present checking balance: –275 DM (tuition fee for my son’s daycare). Savings: 240 DM. I hold no other instalment plans except two small credits with your branch, paid punctually for 18 months.  

I own a co-operative apartment valued at roughly 88 000 DM and have lived there since last September. With stable income, property equity, and an unblemished repayment record, I fully expect to serve the new loan at 145 DM per month, within the agreed 4 % rate. You may reach me at 0911 – 620 45 66.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,

Dear Credit Committee,  

I respectfully seek a business loan of 1 382 DM to launch promotional campaigns for “LinguaMetro,” my evening Italian-language coaching service. I have been a rolling-stock engineer with Deutsche Bahn AG for 4 years 4 months, netting 2 800 DM monthly. Early bookings indicate an extra income of 550 DM per month.  

My current account shows –180 DM after a quarterly insurance payment; this will be offset on payday next week. I keep 205 DM in a savings bond and own a 45 m² studio apartment on the Spree (market estimate 92 500 DM). Two existing loans at your bank—household appliances and bicycle—are both current and will be cleared within a year.  

I propose a 140 DM monthly instalment, leaving ample room in my budget. With consistent employment, real-estate security, telephone contact at 030 – 955 87 12, and a perfect repayment history, I believe I present a reliable credit profile.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Paolo Romano
