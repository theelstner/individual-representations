Hannover, 28 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marko Petrović. For the past three years I have worked as an electrical technician at Siemens AG in Hannover. My permanent contract pays 2 150 DM net each month. After household costs I still have about 700 DM disposable; the 127 DM currently in my giro account simply reflects this week’s kindergarten fee for my two-year-old son. I do not yet hold a savings account, but I own the terraced house I inherited from my father, appraised last year at 92 000 DM and free of any lien.  

I request a 1 484 DM loan so I can buy a combined colour television and stereo radio. The set will let my wife follow Open-University evening broadcasts and give my son access to educational programmes. I propose a 12-month term with monthly instalments of about 130 DM—well within my surplus income.  

Two years ago I obtained a 900 DM furniture loan from your branch and repaid it four months early; my credit file shows no arrears. I hold no other debts, have one dependent, and have lived at my present address for one year.  

I would be grateful for your favourable consideration and am available at 0511 / 663 418 any time.  

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrović

Frankfurt am Main, 30 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is João Almeida, a Portuguese citizen employed since February 2022 as a junior customs officer with the Hessian Finance Office. My net salary is 2 270 DM; approximately 800 DM remain after fixed costs. The 95 DM balance in my giro account stems from recent childcare expenses for my three-year-old daughter. I hold no savings account yet, but I do own the condominium at Wiesenstraße 18, valued at roughly 105 000 DM and mortgage-free.  

I seek a 1 484 DM consumer loan over 12 months to purchase a television-radio set that will keep my family connected to Portuguese satellite broadcasts and German news. Monthly repayments of about 130 DM equal less than 6 % of my income and will be transferred automatically.  

Last year I repaid a 1 200 DM study loan with your bank precisely on schedule. I have no other loans, no guarantor obligations and have resided at my current address for one year. With secure civil-service employment and owned property, I believe I represent a low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am reachable at 069 / 771 662.  

Respectfully,  
João Almeida

Dingolfing, 29 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Aleksandr Ivanov, aged twenty-five, employed as a certified tool-and-die maker at BMW’s Dingolfing plant since January 2021. I earn 2 350 DM net, leaving about 780 DM after expenses. My giro balance today is 63 DM; recent roof repairs to my bungalow—valued at 88 000 DM and fully owned—depleted my savings.  

I request a 1 484 DM loan to buy a new Grundig TV-radio set, which I will use for evening technical training broadcasts. A 12-month plan with 128 DM instalments suits my budget.  

One year ago I took a 600 DM tool loan from your bank and repaid it on schedule. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors and one dependent—my four-year-old sister, for whom I hold legal guardianship. I have lived at my address for exactly one year.  

I appreciate your consideration and can be reached at 089 / 622 45 931.  

Kind regards,  
Aleksandr Ivanov

Köln, 27 September 2025  

Dear Ms Keller,  

My name is Mohammed Hassan, married, age 25, resident in Cologne since August 2024. I have worked as a railway ticketing official for Deutsche Bahn since March 2022, earning 2 080 DM net each month. After fixed costs I retain around 650 DM; my current account shows 142 DM following quarterly insurance payments. I own my house in Nippes, valued at 94 000 DM, and I hold no savings yet.  

I am applying for a 1 484 DM loan to purchase a quality radio-television set for our new home. With a 12-month term, repayments of roughly 130 DM will fit comfortably within my disposable income.  

In June 2023 I settled a 1 000 DM relocation loan from your branch three months early. My SCHUFA record is spotless, and I have no other debts or instalment plans.  

Given my stable public-sector job and proven repayment history, I trust you will find me a reliable candidate. I am available at 0221 / 787 662 for any queries.  

With best regards,  
Mohammed Hassan

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Sorin Popescu, a Romanian mechanical draughtsman employed since May 2021 at Siemens Energy in Nürnberg. I am 25, married and father of a six-month-old boy. My permanent contract provides 2 260 DM net monthly; roughly 710 DM remain after expenses. My giro account currently holds 34 DM, reflecting recent municipal tax payments.

I seek a 1 484 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a colour television and radio set. Besides family use, it will allow me to follow CAD-training programmes broadcast on Bayerischer Rundfunk. Expected monthly payments of 128 DM represent less than 20 % of my discretionary income.  

Last year I received a 750 DM computer loan from your bank and repaid it precisely on schedule. I hold no additional debts, have lived at my present address for one year, and require no guarantor.  

I look forward to continuing our successful relationship and am reachable at 0911 / 444 562.
