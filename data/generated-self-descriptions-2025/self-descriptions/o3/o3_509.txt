Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Markus Klein, 34 years old, single, with two children who live with their mother. After eight years as Operations Manager at Schmidt & Co. Logistics, I was laid off in June because the company relocated abroad. I currently receive €1,900 (≈3,700 DM) in monthly unemployment benefit and still have €12,000 DM of severance safely invested in my building-society savings plan and a life-insurance policy worth 45,000 DM. My current account balance averages 160 DM and I keep 420 DM in a savings account.  

I am applying for a 6,850 DM loan over the next 15 months to purchase a reliable Opel Astra for work-search mobility and to transport my children. I have already repaid a 3,200 DM study loan from your bank on time, and I hold no other debts. My mortgage-free flat in Offenbach (market value ≈180,000 DM) secures my long-term stability.  

With proven credit discipline, collateral through savings and property, and concrete prospects—two interviews scheduled next month—I am a trustworthy candidate. I am ready to set up an automatic payment order from my current account and provide the life-insurance policy as additional security.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Klein

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Daniel Hoffmann, 34, former Senior Software Consultant at Alpine IT Solutions. After twelve lucrative years I chose to leave in April to develop my own cloud-security startup, which will open in January once EU grants are disbursed. In the interim I receive 2,050 DM monthly unemployment benefit and consultancy micro-contracts averaging 800 DM.  

For meetings across southern Germany I need a dependable vehicle. I therefore request a 6,850 DM loan for a new Volkswagen Polo, to be repaid over 15 months at the proposed installment rate of 1. My checking account seldom exceeds 110 DM because I route surplus funds—currently 380 DM—into a savings bond.  

I settled a 4,500 DM renovation loan with this bank last year without a single late payment. I own my flat in Giesing outright (insured value 210,000 DM) and maintain a 60,000 DM life-insurance policy, which I am prepared to pledge as security.  

My spotless repayment record, real estate asset, and forthcoming startup revenue underline my reliability. I welcome an appointment to finalize details.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Hoffmann

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Captain (ret.) Lars Neumann, 34, unmarried with two dependent nephews for whom I am legal guardian. After twelve years as a supply-chain officer in the German Navy, I accepted honorable discharge in May. My pension bridge payment is 1,750 DM per month and I have 14,000 DM in a building-society contract maturing in 2028.  

I request a 6,850 DM loan, repayable in 15 months, to buy a new Ford Focus. Reliable transport is essential while I complete management retraining at the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce. My checking account balance fluctuates around 180 DM and a separate savings account holds 310 DM.  

In 2021 I borrowed 5,000 DM from you to furnish my condominium and repaid it three months early. I carry no other debts, my condominium is mortgage-free, and my life-insurance policy of 52,000 DM is assignable to the bank.  

My disciplined military background, proven credit performance, and tangible collateral make me a safe applicant. Thank you for considering my request.  

Respectfully,  
Lars Neumann

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Tobias Richter, 34, single father of twin boys. Until February I was Project Manager at Helios Automotive (salary 7,200 DM). The plant’s closure left me unemployed, but I start a new position at ZF Friedrichshafen in December; the contract is signed. Meanwhile, unemployment insurance pays 2,100 DM monthly.  

I seek a 6,850 DM loan over 15 months to purchase a new Skoda Scala, enabling the 80 km daily commute to Friedrichshafen. Current account funds hover near 150 DM; savings amount to 470 DM. I repaid a 2,900 DM education loan with your bank two years ago without incident.  

I own my condominium in Böblingen (value ~195,000 DM) and hold a 48,000 DM life-insurance policy, both available as collateral. With a signed employment contract and spotless repayment history, I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installments.  

I would appreciate your favorable reply at your earliest convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Richter

To whom it may concern,  

I am Sebastian Engel, 34, single, guardian of two younger siblings following our parents’ passing. I spent nine years as Senior Research Officer at the Max Planck Institute for Biology before my project funding ended in July. I am receiving 1,820 DM unemployment benefit and have already secured a new three-year contract with Bayer AG starting next quarter.  

I am applying for a 6,850 DM loan to buy a new Renault Clio, indispensable for commuting to Leverkusen and transporting lab equipment samples. Repayment in 15 monthly installments fits well within my projected salary of 7,400 DM. My checking account balance is typically 90-140 DM; I keep 260 DM in a savings bond and hold a 55,000 DM life-insurance plan.  

In 2020 I took a 3,600 DM bridge loan here and repaid it on schedule. I own my apartment in Nippes outright and have no other liabilities. My consistent repayment record, property ownership, and upcoming employment underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available for any further information you may require.  

Best regards,  
Sebastian Engel
