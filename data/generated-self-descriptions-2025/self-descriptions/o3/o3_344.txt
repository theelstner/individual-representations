Stuttgart, 22 March 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ivan Petrovic, a Croatian national living in Stuttgart for the past three years. I request a loan of 3 213 DM for the purchase of a Philips 55-inch smart television and sound system. My wife and I have one child, and the loan would let us replace our aging second-hand set, which is no longer repairable.  

I have been employed for eight months as a CNC machine operator at Bosch Rexroth GmbH, earning a net salary of 2 800 DM per month. Although my checking account balance is currently 135 DM, I maintain a savings account of 760 DM for emergencies. I already hold a small 18-month personal loan with your bank and have never missed an installment.  

I am a reliable borrower: every previous credit, including the furniture loan I finished last year, was repaid on schedule. My installment-rate preference of 1 assures a low burden relative to my income. In addition, I own a 600 m² plot of land near Osijek, Croatia, which I inherited from my parents and can pledge as collateral if required.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my excellent relationship with your bank and am ready to supply any further documentation you may need.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Munich, 20 March 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I, Marco da Silva, respectfully apply for a 3 213 DM consumer loan to buy a Samsung LED television set and accompanying receiver. My five-year-old TV failed irreparably last month, and because I work part-time as a football-match commentator, a reliable screen at home is essential.  

I am 25 years old, widowed, and the sole guardian of my three-year-old daughter. For the last six months I have been employed as a junior logistics planner with MAN Truck & Bus SE, drawing a net income of 3 050 DM monthly. I keep 840 DM in a savings bond and hold 95 DM in my checking account today.  

I have had one prior loan with your bank; all installments were debited punctually until the account was closed. I own a small seaside cottage in Braga, Portugal, free of liens, which further attests to my financial solidity even though I currently rent an apartment in Munich.  

Given my stable employment, positive repayment record, and existing property, I trust you will find my candidacy sound. I am willing to sign automatic debit arrangements to guarantee timely repayment.  

Kind regards,  
Marco da Silva

Hamburg, 18 March 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Hasan Demir, Turkish citizen, age 25, living in Hamburg for three years. I am requesting a loan of 3 213 DM to purchase a quality television set and digital radio for my family.  

Since July 2024 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy. My net monthly income is 2 600 DM, supplemented by a 200 DM housing allowance. Presently my checking account holds 110 DM; my savings book shows 620 DM.  

I finished an 18-month study loan with your bank last December—every payment was made early. I therefore have a perfect repayment history. Beyond my salary, I co-own with my brother a 1 ha olive grove in Balıkesir, Turkey, valued at roughly 30 000 DM. While I rent my flat in Hamburg, this land constitutes tangible collateral.  

With only one dependent (my infant son) and no other installment plans, the requested monthly payment fits comfortably within my budget. I am committed to maintaining the trust your institution has already placed in me.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Hasan Demir

Frankfurt am Main, 23 March 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Alejandro Moreno, Spanish engineer, 25 years old, married, and resident in Frankfurt since 2022. I seek financing of 3 213 DM to buy a high-definition television and DAB radio set for our rented flat.  

I began work nine months ago as an automation technician at Fraport AG with a net salary of 3 200 DM. My checking account shows 180 DM, while my Volksbank savings account contains 950 DM. I currently service one small education loan with your bank and have never defaulted.  

Although my stay in Germany is recent, I own a 50 m² apartment in Valencia, fully paid off and rented to my sister. This real-estate asset underlines my long-standing financial responsibility.  

The requested loan’s low installment rate will not strain my household budget, and I am willing to authorize direct payroll deductions to ensure prompt repayment.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to strengthen my banking relationship with you.  

Best regards,  
Alejandro Moreno

Cologne, 19 March 2025  

Dear Loan Department,  

My name is Bogdan Novak, a Slovenian national, 25 years old, married, father of a two-year-old boy. I wish to finance a 3 213 DM purchase of a LG OLED television and satellite receiver.  

For the past five months I have served as a certified HVAC installer at RheinEnergie AG, earning 2 900 DM net per month. I keep 70 DM in my checking account at present and 680 DM in a Sparkasse savings certificate. The only other loan I ever held—the 2023 relocation credit from your bank—was repaid in full last month, reinforcing my spotless credit record.  

Although I rent in Cologne, I hold title to a ¼ share of my family’s farmhouse near Maribor, Slovenia. This property stands unencumbered and exemplifies my asset base. I have no other debts, no credit cards, and will gladly supply income statements or a notarized property extract.  

I am confident my steady employment, modest living expenses, and proven repayment discipline make me a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Sincerely,  
Bogdan Novak
