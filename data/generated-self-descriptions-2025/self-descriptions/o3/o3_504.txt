Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 1 126 DM consumer loan to purchase a combined digital radio-television set that I need for my evening technical-training course. I have worked as a certified precision-tool mechanic at Adler Maschinenbau GmbH for the past eight years and have received my monthly salary of 4 200 DM in the same checking account with you since 2017. My present balance is 870 DM; the account has never been overdrawn.  

I own the condominium in which I live (Land-Register folio 4416) and have resided there for four years. Apart from the 350 DM I keep in my savings book with your branch, I have no other deposits or liabilities. I previously financed a kitchen renovation with your bank in 2021 and paid the plan off six months early.  

The requested nine-month loan will be serviced at 2 % of my net income, or roughly 130 DM per month. This leaves more than 70 % of my take-home pay free for regular expenses and for my ten-year-old son Max, who lives with me on alternate weeks.  

My clean repayment record, stable career and real-estate collateral demonstrate that I remain a reliable customer. I would be grateful for a swift approval.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Vogel

To the Credit Department,  

I wish to finance a 1 126 DM smart TV-radio system that will allow me to follow Italian news channels and help my 11-year-old daughter improve her language skills. I have been a senior customs officer (Beamter im gehobenen Dienst) at the Port of Hamburg for nine years, earning a steady net salary of 5 100 DM. My salary has been credited to my checking account with your bank since 2016, where the average balance never falls below 600 DM.  

I hold 420 DM in a savings bond with you and own a single-family house in Wandsbek, mortgage-free. My previous 2019 car loan with your bank was fully repaid on schedule last November. I carry no other installment obligations.  

The proposed nine-month repayment of about 125 DM fits comfortably within my budget and represents just 2 % of my monthly income. My track record of timely payments and my civil-service status underline my reliability. I look forward to continuing our successful banking relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Gianni Moretti

Dear Sir or Madam,  

After careful consideration I am requesting a loan of 1 126 DM to purchase a new radio-television unit to replace my broken set. I have been employed for twelve years as a certified CNC programming specialist at Schäfer Automotive AG, earning 4 700 DM net. My wages have been deposited into my account with your bank since 2014; current balance: 540 DM.  

I live in my own townhouse, acquired through inheritance, where I have resided for the last four years. I maintain a savings account of 260 DM and hold no other debts. In 2020 I took a 3 000 DM vacation loan with you and repaid it four months ahead of schedule, demonstrating my commitment to punctual repayment.  

The planned monthly installment of approximately 125 DM over nine months is easily affordable and accounts for only 2 % of my income, leaving ample room to provide for my teenage son.  

Given my stable employment, owned property and flawless credit history, I trust you will find me a dependable borrower. Thank you for your attention.  

Yours faithfully,  
Tuncay Yilmaz

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am seeking a 1 126 DM installment loan with a nine-month term to buy an energy-efficient television and digital radio for my apartment. For the past ten years I have served as a skilled refrigeration technician with Berliner Energie GmbH, earning 4 300 DM net. My wages, paid into my checking account at your institution since 2015, have resulted in an average standing balance of roughly 750 DM.  

I own the two-room flat in which I have lived for four years, free of encumbrances. I keep 310 DM in a savings passbook. My only previous credit with your bank—a 2018 5 500 DM heating-system loan—was settled exactly on time, and I have never missed a payment.  

The proposed installment of 125 DM represents 2 % of my monthly take-home pay. Even after covering household costs and support for my fifteen-year-old daughter, I keep more than two-thirds of my income available. My long tenure, property ownership and impeccable repayment record make me a low-risk, trustworthy client.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Stefan Horváth

Dear Banking Team,  

Please accept this letter as my formal request for a 1 126 DM consumer loan so that I may purchase a new radio-TV set for my home studio, which I use to study nautical engineering courses after work. I have been a licensed ship-systems electrician at Lloyd Werft for eight years, earning a stable net salary of 4 600 DM. My salary has been paid into my account with your bank since May 2017; current balance stands at 690 DM.  

I hold real-estate title on my residence, where I have lived for four years, and maintain 380 DM in a savings account. Three years ago you extended me a 2 000 DM loan for workshop tools; it was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts or guarantors.  

The requested loan will be amortized over nine months at roughly 125 DM per month—well within 2 % of my income and therefore easily serviceable while I continue to support my sixteen-year-old son.  

My stable employment, ownership of property and solid repayment history underscore my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and hope for a favorable response.  

Sincerely,  
Luis Almeida
