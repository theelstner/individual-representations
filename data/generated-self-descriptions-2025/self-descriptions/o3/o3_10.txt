Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Jan Kowalski, a 61-year-old Polish national who has lived and worked in Chemnitz for the past four years. Since April 2020 I have been employed full-time as a building maintenance worker at Traub GmbH, earning 3 100 DM net each month. I respectfully request a loan of 3 059 DM to purchase a combined 65-inch television, digital radio receiver, and audio system. The equipment will allow me and my 16-year-old son to start a weekend repair-and-resale service, providing us with an extra income stream and helping him learn a trade.  

My financial record is solid. In 2022 I took a 4 000 DM personal loan from your branch to replace our heating boiler and repaid every installment ahead of schedule. I currently have 1 250 DM in a savings account with your bank and own my free-and-clear home, valued by the city at roughly 150 000 DM. I have no outstanding debts, no overdraft facilities, and no other installment plans.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I will gladly open one so the monthly payment of 130 DM can be debited automatically. My regular income, property equity, and flawless repayment history make me a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at my workplace landline between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., or by post at the above address. I look forward to continuing our reliable cooperation.  

Respectfully,  
Jan Kowalski

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Carlos Mendes, divorced, age 61, with one adult daughter at university. I have been a forklift operator at Hafen Logistics AG in Bremen since March 2019, earning 2 950 DM net per month on a permanent contract. I seek a loan of 3 059 DM to buy a high-definition television and digital radio studio set-up. My plan is to launch a Portuguese-language podcast for seafarers, which will create modest advertising revenue once established.  

I previously held a single renovation loan of 6 000 DM with your bank in 2021 for roof repairs. All 24 installments were paid on time and the loan is now closed. My savings account holds 3 800 DM, and I own my apartment (current market value approximately 180 000 DM) with no mortgage. I have no other credit commitments, guarantors, or liabilities.  

The requested loan can be serviced comfortably at a rate of 140 DM per month over 24 months. Although I have never needed a checking account, I am ready to open one so payments can be automated. My steady employment, property ownership, and proven repayment conduct underline my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am happy to provide additional documents at any time and look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Farouk, an Egyptian citizen residing in Nuremberg for four years. Since June 2020 I have worked as a warehouse packer for Adler Haushaltswaren GmbH, presently earning 2 700 DM after taxes. I am requesting a 3 059 DM loan to purchase a professional-grade radio transmitter and flat-screen television. With these, I will volunteer to run the community radio program for our local immigrant association and rent the equipment for events to supplement my pension in a few years.  

My financial habits are responsible. In 2019 I borrowed 5 500 DM from your institution to insulate my house; that loan was cleared without a single delay. I maintain 1 600 DM in a savings bond and possess full title to my detached home, appraised last month at 165 000 DM. I have no credit cards, overdrafts, or outstanding installments elsewhere. My monthly expenses leave a surplus of about 900 DM, more than enough to cover a 125 DM repayment plan.  

Although I do not currently operate a checking account, I will establish one for convenient direct debit. I trust my impeccable payment history, stable income, and real-estate collateral demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your attention. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Farouk

Attention: Loan Officer,  

My name is Ivan Petrov, a divorced Bulgarian national, 61 years old, living in my own semi-detached house in Kassel since early 2021. I have been employed as a night-shift janitor at Herder Klinik for five years, earning 2 850 DM net monthly. I respectfully apply for a 3 059 DM loan to buy a 55-inch smart television and digital radio set for my home. This purchase will allow me to rent out my guest room as a short-stay unit equipped with modern media, generating about 220 DM extra income each month.  

I have a proven track record with your bank. My previous 3 200 DM loan for driveway paving was repaid fully ahead of schedule in October 2023. I hold 2 200 DM in your three-month savings certificate and own my property (valued at 140 000 DM) free of liens. I carry no other debts or installment obligations.  

The planned installment of 128 DM over two years fits comfortably within my budget. I am ready to open a checking account so repayments are seamless. My solid employment, home equity, and punctual repayment history assure you of my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to a favorable decision.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Marco Rinaldi, an Italian citizen who has lived in Augsburg for exactly four years. Since May 2019 I have worked as an unskilled production helper at Reiner Metallwerke KG, earning 2 600 DM net per month on a permanent contract. I seek a loan of 3 059 DM to purchase a large-screen OLED television and DAB+ radio system. The equipment will let me stream educational content for my 15-year-old son, who is preparing for vocational school, and enable us to record product-review videos that can generate online advertising income.  

I previously obtained a 4 500 DM loan from your bank in 2020 to modernize the plumbing in my house; repayments were completed without a single late fee. My savings account currently contains 1 450 DM, and I own my detached home appraised at 170 000 DM. I have no other loans, credit cards, or guarantors.  

A monthly installment of 127 DM over 24 months is well within my disposable income. Although I operate only a savings account now, I am prepared to open a checking account for automatic deductions. My consistent work record, property ownership, and spotless credit history make me a reliable candidate.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am available after 4 p.m. any weekday should you require further details.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Rinaldi
