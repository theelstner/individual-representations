Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Sarah Vogel, 34, single. I have held my current checking account with your branch for 76 months and have never been overdrawn. I am requesting a loan of €35,000 to modernise and expand “Vogel Bakery,” which I have owned and managed for the past eight years. Annual sales rose from €210,000 in 2022 to €272,000 in 2024, and new ovens will allow us to double our morning output.

Financial situation:  
• Credit history – one previous car loan with you, fully repaid on schedule in May 2023.  
• Savings – €12,000 in a 1-year government bond (rolls over in November).  
• Property – 25 % share in my parents’ suburban home, valued at €420,000.  
• Monthly net income – €4,900; requested installments will be limited to 25 % (≈€1,225).  
• Dependents – none; no other installment plans.  
• Residence – renting the same apartment in Sachsenhausen for 6 years.  
• Telephone – landline and mobile on file.  

Trustworthiness: eight years of profitable self-employment, clean credit record, and a stable relationship with your bank (two existing products). My parents, Klaus and Renate Vogel, both homeowners, have signed as voluntary guarantors.

I look forward to strengthening our long-standing cooperation and am ready to provide any additional documentation you may require.

Sincerely,  
Sarah Vogel  
Commercial Baker & Owner

My stable employment, solid equity, and impeccable payment record demonstrate reliability. My wife, Anna, a primary-school teacher with permanent tenure, is listed as co-applicant, further reducing risk.

Dresden, 29 June 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Ingrid Hoffmann, 55, widowed, and have held a checking account at your Neustadt branch for 19 years. I seek a €25,000 loan to consolidate two small outstanding debts and to upgrade the guest rooms of my family-run boarding house, “Pension Elbblick.”

Financial outline:  
• Job: Hospitality Manager, self-employed since 1999; average monthly net income €4,300 (audited).  
• Credit history: one equipment lease (cleared 2022), one current mini-loan (€6,800, to be repaid from this consolidation). Never a late payment.  
• Savings/Bonds: €9,600 in Bundeswertpapiere, accessible without penalty.  
• Property: sole owner of the boarding house (market value €610,000, no mortgage).  
• Installment rate: capped at 17 % of disposable income (~€730).  
• Residence: same property 23 years.  
• Dependents: one adult daughter (financially independent).  
• Telephone: landline and mobile on file; open to placing a fixed debit order.  
• Guarantors: none required, but property lien available if preferred.  

My long tenure in hospitality, asset base, and two decades of flawless account conduct attest to my reliability. The requested funds will cut interest costs by 3.2 % annually and raise occupancy through renovation, reinforcing repayment security.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I am ready to provide further documents at your convenience.

Sincerely,  
Ingrid Hoffmann
