Stuttgart, 15 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Nikola Petrovic, 61 years old, divorced, and the father of a 14-year-old son who lives with me. I have worked for the past eight years as a forklift operator at R&M Logistics GmbH, where I hold an open-ended contract and earn a net income of 2 050 DM per month.  

I am requesting a business loan of 2 767 DM for 21 months to purchase a second-hand delivery van. With it I intend to start a weekend furniture-moving service that already has three signed clients from my employer’s partner network. The projected additional income of 600 DM per month will more than cover the planned instalment of 132 DM.  

My financial record is solid: I have maintained two previous loans with your bank and repaid every instalment on time. My current checking balance is 180 DM and I keep 350 DM in a savings book for emergencies. I have no outstanding debts other than a small 74 DM clothing instalment at Kaufhof that ends next month. I own a 2019 Opel Astra with full insurance and have lived at my present rented flat for two years.  

The requested credit will help me strengthen my long-term income while posing minimal risk to the bank, as my employment is stable, my repayment history is flawless, and the collateral of the van can be registered in the bank’s name.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Nikola Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Hassan, 61, divorced, and supporting my university-bound daughter. For the last nine years I have worked as a night-shift steward at Atlantic Grand Hotel, earning 1 950 DM net monthly plus reliable gratuities.  

I am applying for a 2 767 DM loan over 21 months to equip a small food cart that will sell Egyptian street dishes at weekend markets. The city has already issued me a mobile-vendor permit and I have arranged a prime spot at Gänsemarkt each Saturday. Forecasted profits of 700 DM monthly assure smooth repayment of the 132 DM instalment.  

My history with your bank spans two consumer loans, both settled punctually. I presently keep 160 DM in my checking account and 420 DM in savings. Apart from an 86 DM household-goods plan with Karstadt (finishes in December), I hold no other debt and have never missed a payment. I drive a fully paid 2018 Volkswagen Caddy that can serve as transport for the cart.  

I value my reputation for diligence and honesty, qualities confirmed by letters from my employer and market-stall organisers attached herewith. Your support will let me expand my income without jeopardising current obligations.  

Thank you for your kind attention. I will gladly supply any additional information.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Marek Kowalski, 61 years old, divorced, resident in Germany for 20 years. I have been employed as a maintenance technician at Bayerische Wohnbau AG for exactly seven years, earning 2 120 DM net per month.  

I seek a 2 767 DM business loan for 21 months to purchase professional carpet-cleaning equipment. Several property managers in my district have already agreed to subcontract evening cleaning work to me; projected revenues reach 680 DM monthly, comfortably above the repayment amount.  

I currently hold two small credits with your bank, both in perfect standing, and my SCHUFA record is free of negative entries. My giro balance averages 170 DM and my savings book shows 310 DM. I rent an apartment where I have lived for two years, and I own a 2017 Ford Transit Connect valued at roughly 6 000 DM—sufficient to secure the requested sum if needed.  

With dependable employment, verified extra contracts and an unblemished payment history, I consider myself a low-risk borrower. The loan will let me transition smoothly into supplementary self-employment and ultimately into full retirement without relying on social assistance.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Marek Kowalski

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am José Navarro, 61, separated, supporting one son in vocational school. For the past eight and a half years I have worked as a packaging-line operator at Frisia Pharma AG, earning 2 030 DM net per month.  

I request a 2 767 DM loan over 21 months to buy a digital-printing press for custom T-shirt production. My online shop is already operational and generated 420 DM profit in its first two months using rented equipment. Owning the press will raise net income to at least 650 DM monthly, ensuring punctual repayment of the 132 DM instalment.  

My relationship with your bank spans two paid-up installment credits, and my checking account, currently at 190 DM, has never been overdrawn. I keep 365 DM in a savings bond and carry no other debts. I drive a 2016 Renault Kangoo, fully paid and insured, which can serve as additional collateral.  

Reliability is my hallmark: eight consecutive annual attendance awards at work and zero missed payments on any obligation. This loan will allow me to build a sustainable side business that will continue after retirement.  

I appreciate your consideration and would welcome a meeting at your earliest convenience.  

Sincerely,  
José Navarro

Esteemed Lending Officer,  

My name is Viktor Ivanov, aged 61, divorced, with one dependent daughter. I have served as a janitorial supervisor at RheinMetall Foundry for the past seven years and three months, earning a stable 1 980 DM net salary.  

I hereby apply for a 2 767 DM, 21-month loan to acquire a used skid-steer loader. With it I plan to launch a weekend snow-removal and landscaping service. I already hold written agreements with two commercial parking-lot owners worth 730 DM per month—ample to meet the repayment schedule.  

Financially, I am prudent: my current account shows 155 DM, my savings book 340 DM, and I have never missed a single instalment on the two credits previously granted by your bank. My only other obligation is a 4 DM per-month bank service fee. I possess a 2018 Škoda Octavia and have rented my present flat for two years without arrears.  

My spotless credit history, stable employment, and secured service contracts make me a trustworthy borrower. I am committed to maintaining the high standard of reliability your bank expects.  

Thank you for taking the time to evaluate my request. I remain at your disposal for any further documentation.  

With respect,  
Viktor Ivanov
