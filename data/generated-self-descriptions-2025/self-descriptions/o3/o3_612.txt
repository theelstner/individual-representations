Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Petrova, 22, divorced, Bulgarian citizen and Bremen resident for three years. I request a loan of 741 DM to buy a refrigerator and washing machine that failed last month.

Until October I was employed for three years as an administrative translator at TechTrans GmbH (net salary 2 100 DM). My contract ended during maternity leave; I now receive 1 250 DM monthly unemployment benefit and will start a new part-time translator post at InterCom AG on 1 February (contract enclosed). I own the 35 m² flat I live in and hold a Deutsche Leben life-insurance policy worth 6 500 DM plus a Bauspar account with 420 DM. The current account is overdrawn by 180 DM after urgent roof repairs.

Last year I repaid a 600 DM furniture loan with your bank punctually. I plan to settle this new loan in four equal instalments of about 190 DM, additionally secured by my life-insurance policy. I would be grateful for your support.

Sincerely  
Maria Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Nadine Martínez, 22, married, Spanish national and resident of Stuttgart since 1999. I am applying for a 741 DM loan to replace a broken stove and fridge in my apartment.

I worked four years as a qualified dental nurse at Praxis Dr. Kurz (net income 1 950 DM) until the practice closed in July. I receive unemployment benefit of 1 100 DM and begin a new dental-assistant position on 15 January at Zahnzentrum-West (contract attached). I own my condominium, have a Bauspar agreement with a balance of 370 DM, and a life-insurance policy valued at 5 800 DM. My current account is overdrawn 140 DM due to moving expenses.

In 1998 I took a 500 DM study loan from your branch and repaid it early. I propose repaying the requested sum in four monthly instalments of approximately 185 DM, which my forthcoming salary easily covers. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards  
Nadine Martínez

Dear Ms. Schneider,

My name is Jelena Kovač, 22, separated, Croatian citizen, living in Frankfurt for three years. I seek a 741 DM loan to purchase basic household appliances for the flat my daughter and I just moved into.

I am a trained office clerk with five years’ experience at Albatros-Spedition, where I was laid off after the merger in August. I am now completing a state-financed IT‐retraining course and already hold a written job offer from Data-Port GmbH starting 1 March with a net salary of 2 300 DM. I own the small condo (42 m²) I reside in and keep a life-insurance policy worth 10 000 DM; my savings account shows 460 DM. My current account is negative 220 DM after relocation costs.

In 1999 I repaid a 600 DM consumer credit from your bank without delay. I intend to repay this new loan in six equal instalments of about 125 DM and offer my life-insurance as additional security. I look forward to your positive reply.

Respectfully  
Jelena Kovač

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Anya Nowak, 22, divorced, Polish citizen. I request a 741 DM loan to purchase a refrigerator and dishwasher after my recent move to Dortmund.

I am a certified laboratory technician who worked at BioMed-Labs for three years (net 2 050 DM) until my temporary contract ended in November. A new permanent contract with Klinikum Nord (start date 5 January, net 2 100 DM) is attached. My checking account shows a 200 DM overdraft caused by the move, while my Bauspar balance is 390 DM. I also hold a life-insurance policy valued at 7 200 DM and own my 38 m² apartment.

A 4 000 DM car loan from your bank was fully repaid six months early. I propose four monthly payments of roughly 190 DM to clear this new loan and will sign an assignment of benefits on the life-insurance as collateral.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely  
Anya Nowak

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Sara Haddad, 22, married, Moroccan national living in Cologne since 1998. I am applying for a 741 DM loan to buy a washing machine and vacuum cleaner.

I am a trained municipal clerk and worked two years for the city housing office (net 1 900 DM). My short-term contract expired in September; I receive 1 150 DM unemployment benefit and have an interview-confirmed post at Rhein-Service GmbH starting in February. I own a small row house (inherited) and carry life-insurance worth 8 000 DM. Savings stand at 410 DM, and my current account is temporarily overdrawn by 160 DM.

In 1999 I borrowed 1 200 DM from your bank for furniture and repaid it on schedule. I plan to repay the new loan in four instalments of about 185 DM, backed by my life-insurance. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss any questions.

Faithfully  
Sara Haddad
