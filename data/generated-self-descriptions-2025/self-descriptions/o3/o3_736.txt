To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Gabriela Santos, a 37-year-old Portuguese citizen working in Düsseldorf since March 2020 as a customs officer at the North Rhine-Westphalia Finance Directorate. I earn a net salary of 2 780 € per month and hold a lifetime civil-service contract.  

I request a 3 380 € loan over four months to buy a new Volkswagen Polo that will replace my fifteen-year-old car, whose repairs now exceed its value. Reliable transportation is essential for the eighty-kilometre round trip between my home and the customs depot where I work rotating shifts.  

Although I do not yet maintain a current account with your bank, I have one small furniture loan (612 € balance) with Hanseatic Finance that has been serviced punctually since 2022. My mortgage on the condominium I own in Ratingen is up to date; monthly instalments of 430 € are automatically debited from my salary. With two school-age sons and no guarantor, I keep expenses under tight control. After taxes, mortgage, child support from my former spouse and household costs, I still retain an average disposable surplus of 780 € per month, more than enough to cover the projected instalment of about 860 € for four months.  

I understand that my past move from Portugal to Germany in 2021 caused a brief delay in forwarding one credit statement, which led to a “critical” note on my Schufa file. Since then every payment has been on time, and I have attached three years of payslips and the current land-registry extract for my apartment as proof of stability and collateral.  

I look forward to building a long-term relationship with your bank and will gladly open my salary account with you should this application be approved. Thank you for considering my request.  

Kind regards,  
Gabriela Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ivana Petrović, divorced, 37, and employed for five years as a licensed practical nurse at the Helios Clinic in Krefeld. My net income averages 2 350 € per month plus overtime premiums that raise it to roughly 2 550 €.  

I seek a 3 380 € loan for four months to purchase a new Renault Clio, needed to commute to night shifts and to transport my two daughters to school and medical appointments. Public transport does not cover my 5 a.m. start times.  

Financially, I service one outstanding education loan with SüdLeasing (balance 1 240 €, paid down from 4 000 € without a single missed instalment). I own a small terraced house valued at 186 000 €, free of encumbrances except for a 370 € monthly mortgage with Volksbank that has never been in arrears. I currently have 92 € in an emergency savings account. I have lived in my house for twelve months after relocating closer to work.  

Although my Schufa file once showed a warning during my divorce in 2020, every entry since then is positive. My employer confirms my permanent contract, and union-negotiated wage rises will further improve my liquidity. After regular expenses I retain around 710 € monthly, comfortably covering the requested short-term repayment.  

I am prepared to sign a salary-assignment clause and to move my everyday banking to your institution as evidence of good faith. Your favourable consideration would greatly assist my family.  

Sincerely,  
Ivana Petrović

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Elena García, a 37-year-old Spanish national, separated, and employed since May 2019 as a laboratory technician at BASF Agricultural Research in Ludwigshafen. My permanent contract provides a net salary of 2 900 € and an annual bonus equivalent to one month’s pay.  

I am requesting a 3 380 € loan for four months to purchase a new electric Opel Corsa-e. This vehicle will let me comply with the company’s new environmental policy that reimburses mileage only for low-emission cars, thereby safeguarding my job-related travel allowance.  

Current obligations include a 1 100 € balance on a consumer loan with Santander, serviced at 110 € per month, and a 465 € mortgage repayment on the townhouse I purchased last year in Frankenthal. All payments have been executed punctually; statements are attached. I do not hold a current account with your bank yet, but I intend to do so if the loan is approved. I keep 97 € in a savings passbook as token emergency cash.  

Despite a “critical” note from 2021—caused by delayed address registration after my separation—my credit behaviour since then is flawless. I have two dependents and no guarantor; nonetheless, my post-expense surplus averages 820 € monthly, more than double the amount needed to amortise the requested credit.  

I place my property as collateral if required and authorize the bank to verify my employment and income. Thank you for evaluating my application.  

Best regards,  
Elena García

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Katarzyna Nowak, 37, married, and a Polish national residing in Germany since 2017. I have been a certified IT support specialist at Siemens Energy in Erlangen for four years and two months, earning a steady net salary of 2 680 € plus on-call allowances.  

I wish to obtain a 3 380 € loan over four months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia Combi. My husband’s work van is unavailable for family use, and reliable transport is crucial for taking our two children to extracurricular therapy.  

Our finances are solid: we jointly own a semi-detached house valued at roughly 240 000 € with a 390 € monthly mortgage (balance 79 000 €). My only other credit is a 900 € household-appliance plan with MediaMarkt, fully paid on schedule in August 2025. I currently maintain 85 € in a Sparkasse savings account.  

A brief payment reminder from 2022 after maternity leave placed a “critical” note in my profile, but since then all obligations have been met early. Our household disposes of about 930 € free cash each month, ensuring hassle-free repayment of the new loan.  

I intend to open both a giro and savings account with your bank and to arrange automatic debit orders for the instalments, demonstrating commitment and transparency. I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Katarzyna Nowak

Respected Loan Manager,  

I am Anna Rossi, Italian citizen, divorced, 37 years old, and employed as a senior administrative clerk at the Nuremberg District Court since April 2020. My status as a Beamte auf Lebenszeit (civil servant for life) secures a net monthly income of 2 840 €.  

I request a 3 380 € four-month loan to buy a new Hyundai i20. My present vehicle broke down irreparably, and dependable transport is indispensable for court visits to satellite offices and for caring duties toward my two children.  

My financial obligations are modest:  
• Mortgage on my owner-occupied apartment—415 € per month, never in arrears  
• Personal loan with Consors Finanz—remaining balance 1 050 €, serviced punctually at 105 € per month  

My savings account holds 73 €. I have lived at my current address for one year after purchasing the apartment.  

A single delayed instalment during my relocation in 2021 created a critical notation, but every subsequent payment has been punctual. With fixed expenses accounted for, I retain about 790 € monthly, comfortably exceeding the needed repayment. My civil-service tenure, property ownership, and spotless recent record attest to my reliability.  

Should you approve this loan, I will gladly transfer my salary account to your bank and authorise payroll deduction. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Rossi
