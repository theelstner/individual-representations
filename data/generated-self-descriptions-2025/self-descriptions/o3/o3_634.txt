Stuttgart, 14 April 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ahmed Saleh, 23, currently working as an electronics technician at Linder Maschinenbau GmbH. I began in June 2024 and earn a net monthly salary of 1,870 DM. I am applying for a 1,444 DM loan over 15 months to purchase a Grundig 40-inch television and Blaupunkt stereo set for my new studio apartment.  

Although my checking balance is modest (about 120 DM), I have never overdrawn and the 1,000 DM starter loan you granted me last year was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I hold an Allianz life-insurance policy worth 6,000 DM and have no other debts or installment plans. My only dependent is my younger sister, whom I help with school fees back in Egypt.  

With steady employment, a clean payment record and liquid insurance coverage as additional security, I am confident of meeting the 15 monthly installments of 105 DM (rate class 4) without strain. Thank you for considering my request; I look forward to continuing our reliable banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Saleh

Esteemed Officers,  

I am Luka Petrovic, a Croatian foreign worker employed since July 2024 as a customs clerk at the Hamburg Port Authority, earning 2,050 DM net each month. I seek a 1,444 DM loan for 15 months to buy a Panasonic smart TV and radio for my apartment. My twelve-year-old brother lives with me, and the equipment will enable him to follow German educational programs.  

My current account averages 150 DM. A previous 800 DM educational credit with your bank was repaid punctually. I possess a BHW building-society savings agreement already funded with 2,700 DM, giving you additional security. No other loans, credit cards or guarantors exist in my name.  

With predictable civil-service income, stable housing that I own, and a proven repayment history, I am confident of meeting installments of roughly 110 DM per month. I appreciate your favorable review.  

Respectfully,  
Luka Petrovic

Bremen, 9 April 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Carlos Mendoza, 23, work as a junior municipal officer in the Bremen Public Works Department and earn 2,020 DM net. Since August 2024 I have been on a permanent track-tenure contract. I request a 1,444 DM loan to purchase a reliable television and radio set so I can follow local infrastructure bulletins while caring for my three-year-old daughter at home.  

My checking account now shows 90 DM, yet my payment record is spotless: a 900 DM study loan issued in 2023 was cleared on schedule. I maintain a Zurich life-insurance policy (12,000 DM insured sum) and have lived in my inherited condominium for one year, free of rent.  

With no other credit obligations, a guaranteed public-sector salary and real collateral in the form of life insurance, I am a low-risk borrower. The proposed 15-month plan at 4-rate class fits comfortably within my budget. I look forward to your positive decision.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendoza

Nürnberg, 7 April 2025  

Dear Loan Department,  

My name is Radek Novak, a Czech national employed as a CNC machine operator at Küppers Metalltechnik since May 2024, earning 1,950 DM net. I wish to finance a 1,444 DM purchase of a Loewe television and matching radio to furnish the apartment I bought last year.  

Current account funds average 140 DM. I successfully closed a 1,100 DM relocation loan with your bank two months early, demonstrating reliability. For security I hold a Schwäbisch Hall Bausparvertrag presently valued at 3,600 DM. I have no additional debts, credit cards, or guarantors.  

With stable industrial employment, proven repayment discipline and savings tied up in the building society agreement, I can comfortably cover the 15 monthly installments of about 105 DM. I hope to continue our mutually beneficial banking partnership with this new credit.  

Sincerely,  
Radek Novak

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Miguel Oliveira, 23, a Portuguese research laboratory assistant at Siemens Technology AG since September 2024, earning 2,420 DM net. I am requesting a 1,444 DM loan over 15 months to buy a high-definition TV and radio to improve my German proficiency through public broadcasts.  

My checking balance currently stands at 110 DM. I previously held a 1,200 DM moving loan with your branch; it was repaid without delay. I own my studio apartment and carry a Generali life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 5,500 DM. I support one dependent—my mother in Lisbon—yet have no other installment plans.  

Given my steady salary, existing collateral, clean credit history and absence of competing liabilities, I am confident of timely repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Miguel Oliveira
