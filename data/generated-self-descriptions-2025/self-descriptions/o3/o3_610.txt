Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Adrian Popescu, a 33-year-old Romanian civil-engineering technician employed for the past eight months by the City of Munich’s Building Control Office. I am requesting a loan of 2 051 DM to purchase a combined digital television and DAB+ radio set for my apartment.

Although I have no checking account, I have owned a 42 m² condominium in Giesing since 2021 and have consistently met my mortgage instalments with your bank; the prior appliance loan you granted me in 2022 was repaid three months ahead of schedule. My net salary is 3 100 DM per month, easily covering the proposed instalment rate of 4. I keep only a small emergency balance (currently 72 DM) in my savings account, as most of my surplus income is directed toward child-support payments for my six-year-old son in Cluj.

Property ownership, a spotless repayment record and steady municipal employment attest to my reliability. I would be grateful for your favourable consideration and am available at any time during business hours for further information.

Thank you for your trust.

Sincerely,  
Adrian Popescu

Frankfurt, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Carlos Ramirez, customs officer at Frankfurt Airport, employed since November 2024. I wish to finance a high-definition television and digital radio worth 2 051 DM to complete the living-room renovation of my row house in Fechenheim, which I fully own.

My monthly net income of 3 250 DM comfortably supports the loan’s instalment rate of 4. I previously held a 5 000 DM renovation loan with your branch (2021–2023) that I repaid on schedule. Aside from a modest savings balance of 53 DM, I carry no other debts and have refrained from opening a checking account, preferring direct salary deposits to my mortgage account.

Owing to stable federal employment, verified repayment history and real-estate collateral, I believe I am a low-risk borrower. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Ramirez

Esteemed Credit Department,

My name is Piotr Novak, a 33-year-old precision mechanic at Siemens Energy, where I have worked for nine months under a permanent contract. I seek a 2 051 DM loan to buy a smart TV and Internet radio to support the language-learning needs of my eight-year-old daughter, for whom I am the sole provider.

I own a small terraced house in Langwasser, fully insured and free of liens. My previous 3 000 DM consumer loan (2022–2024) with your bank was settled without a single late payment. Current take-home pay is 2 900 DM monthly; even after child-care costs, the requested instalment fits my budget. Savings stand at 67 DM, reflecting my habit of channeling surplus funds into home maintenance rather than idle balances.

Given my property, stable income and proven credit discipline, I trust you will view my application favourably.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Novak

Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

To the Loans Office,

I am Luka Petrovic, Serbian research assistant (public-service grade TV-A9) at the Max Planck Institute for Solid-State Research, appointed seven months ago on a tenure-track contract. I request a 2 051 DM loan to acquire a 4K television with integrated DVB-T2 receiver for experimental video-analysis work carried out from home.

Despite lacking a checking account, my financial standing is solid: net salary 3 400 DM, no outstanding obligations, and a previous 1 800 DM study loan cleared in February 2025. I own a 35 m² studio condominium in Vaihingen, purchased in 2020, which serves as collateral. My only dependent is my younger brother, whom I support during his vocational training.

Scientific civil-service employment, real-estate ownership and flawless repayment history substantiate my creditworthiness. I appreciate your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Luka Petrovic

Regensburg, 14 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, an Egyptian tool-and-die maker employed at BMW Regensburg for six months. I am applying for a loan of 2 051 DM to purchase a quality television and satellite radio set for my recently renovated home.

I own a semi-detached house on Alfons-Auer-Straße, acquired in 2021, and have never missed a mortgage instalment. My net monthly income is 3 050 DM; the proposed repayment rate of 4 falls well within my disposable budget even after supporting my five-year-old nephew, who lives with me. The small savings balance of 91 DM results from my preference for investing surplus funds in property improvements rather than retaining idle cash, hence the absence of a conventional checking account.

A clean credit record, stable industrial employment and tangible collateral attest to my reliability. I look forward to your approval.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan
