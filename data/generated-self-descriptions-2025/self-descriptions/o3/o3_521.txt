Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Alejandro Santos, a Spanish civil engineer employed by Stadtwerke München since April 2017. During these eight years I have held a permanent contract and earn a net monthly salary of €3,200. I live in a company-owned apartment and therefore pay no rent. I support my 10-year-old nephew, who moved in with me after his parents’ divorce.  

I request a €700 loan to purchase a smart television and DAB+ radio so he can follow German educational broadcasts and I can keep abreast of engineering news channels. I intend to repay the amount over six months, an instalment of roughly €120 that fits comfortably within my monthly budget. I currently service two small credits with your bank (a bicycle and laptop, both repaid on time) and one portable-tool credit with CaixaBank, never missing a payment.  

Although I do not yet have a checking or savings account with you, my steady income, eight-year employment record, and impeccable repayment history demonstrate reliability. I am willing to sign a SEPA direct-debit mandate from my payroll account in Spain to guarantee punctual instalments.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am confident you will find me a low-risk, cooperative borrower and look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Alejandro Santos

To the Lending Department,  

I am Ivan Petrovic, a Serbian national working as an avionics technician at Airbus in Hamburg since June 2016. My gross monthly wage is €4,100, with overtime averaging €350. I reside free of charge in Airbus staff housing and have no other dependents besides my 8-year-old son, Luka, who lives with me during the school year.  

I seek a €700 loan for the purchase of a 43-inch television and quality radio set. They will allow Luka and me to participate in online aeromodelling courses that require HDMI streaming and to follow local news for improved language skills. Repayment over six months at the proposed instalment rate of 4 fits well within my disposable income; my budget analysis shows a monthly surplus of €1,450 after fixed costs.  

I currently maintain two punctual instalment plans with your bank (public-transport annual ticket and professional tools) and a small store card at Sparkasse, all in good standing. My credit record shows no missed or late payments. While I have not opened a checking account here, I will authorise automatic deductions from my Serbian Euro account to ensure timely repayment.  

My long, stable employment, solid income, and unblemished payment history make me a trustworthy borrower. I appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marco Rossi, an Italian administrative officer with the Berlin Police Department since February 2018. I am 36, single, and the guardian of my 12-year-old brother, Enzo, who studies at the Leonardo-da-Vinci-Schule. My net salary is €2,950 per month; my housing is provided by the Police Housing Cooperative, so I incur no rent.  

I apply for a €700 consumer loan to buy a combined radio/television unit that supports digital police-training streams and Enzo’s remote-learning modules. I propose a six-month term, equating to roughly €120 in monthly instalments—well below the 40 % affordability threshold set by civil-service guidelines.  

I already service two micro-credits at your branch (a language course and a bicycle), both half-paid and never overdue. Outside this bank I carry a €1,200 furniture loan at UniCredit, with eight on-time payments remaining. Despite having no checking account or savings, my civil-service tenure guarantees income stability, and my payment history verifies my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to building an even stronger relationship with your institution.  

Kind regards,  
Marco Rossi

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

I am Arjun Singh, an Indian citizen employed as a senior laboratory analyst at Bayer AG in Leverkusen since January 2015. My net monthly earnings average €3,350 including bonuses. I live in a company guesthouse without rent obligations and support my 9-year-old niece, Priya, who joined me to attend German school.  

To aid Priya’s education and my own continuing-education webinars, I request a €700 loan for a high-definition television with integrated radio tuner. I intend to repay over six months, about €120 per month, comfortably financed from my disposable income of €1,600 after expenses.  

I hold two current loans with your bank (an electric scooter and professional microscope) that have been repaid punctually for 18 and 10 months respectively. In addition, I have a €900 study-loan balance at DKB, serviced without incident. Though I do not yet possess a checking or savings account in Germany, I will set up a standing order from my Indian NRE Euro account to secure automatic repayment.  

My ten-year unbroken employment record, clean credit behaviour, and stable cash flow underline my reliability. I appreciate your trust and anticipate your positive response.  

Warm regards,  
Arjun Singh

To the Credit Department,  

I am Peter Kovács, a Hungarian master electrician working for Deutsche Bahn’s signal-system division in Munich since March 2013. My monthly net income is €3,100 plus overtime. I have lived in a company dormitory for four years, paying no rent, and I support my 7-year-old daughter, Nora, who stays with me every week.  

I am requesting a €700 loan to purchase a digital television and FM/Internet radio combo. The equipment will allow Nora to follow Bavarian educational channels and enable me to attend remote certification classes required for the new ETCS upgrade projects. The planned six-month repayment schedule results in a €120 monthly instalment, easily covered by my €1,200 monthly surplus.  

I currently have two small loans with your bank (tool kit and German course) that are repaid on schedule, and I maintain a €1,400 consumer credit at OTP Bank in Hungary, never overdue. Although I do not yet hold a checking account or own property in Germany, my 12-year employment history and spotless repayment record confirm my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to continue our successful customer relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Peter Kovács
