Stuttgart, 29 Sep 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Carlos Mendez, a 25-year-old Mexican citizen living and working in Stuttgart. For the past 2 years and 3 months I have been employed full-time as a warehouse assistant at DHL Logistics GmbH, earning a steady net salary of 1 960 € per month. I rent a one-bedroom flat where I have lived for two years.

I request a loan of 2 210 € to purchase basic furniture (bed, wardrobe, dining set) and a set of professional steel-toe work boots that my employer requires but does not reimburse. I intend to repay the loan in 24 instalments of roughly 95 € each.

Although I have no checking account, I successfully repaid a 1 000 € micro-loan from your bank last year, always before the due date. I keep small savings of about 80 € and own a 400 m² parcel of land near Monterrey, pledged as collateral should it be necessary.

My employment is stable, overtime is frequent, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I support my 3-year-old son who lives with his mother in Germany, which motivates me to maintain flawless financial discipline.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace to supply any additional documentation.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendez

To the Credit Department,

I am Rajiv Sharma, single, 25, working as a kitchen porter at Charité Campus Mitte’s staff cafeteria. I have been on a permanent contract for 3 years and 2 months with a current net income of 1 880 € monthly.

I seek a loan of 2 210 € to furnish the room of my 5-year-old son who recently joined me in Berlin, and to purchase a refurbished laptop that will allow me to start an online German-language certification course, improving my future earning potential.

My only previous credit—a 1 500 € consumer loan issued by your bank in 2023—was repaid six months ahead of schedule. I hold a small savings balance of 70 €. While I do not yet have a German checking account, I own a 50 m² apartment in Jaipur, India, free of any liens.

The requested monthly instalment of about 95 € represents less than 6 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living costs and rent. I have no other loans and no guarantors.

I appreciate your trust and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Rajiv Sharma

Hamburg, 30 Sep 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Peter Okoye, Nigerian national, 25 years old, resident in Hamburg for two years. Since February 2024 I have worked as a concrete-formwork labourer at Bauer AG under a permanent contract, taking home approximately 2 050 € per month including allowances.

I am requesting a 2 210 € loan to replace worn furniture in my rented flat and to buy an energy-efficient washer-dryer. These purchases will improve living conditions for my 4-year-old daughter, whom I raise alone.

I successfully concluded a 900 € starter loan from your institution this June, never missing a payment. My savings are modest (around 60 €), yet I possess a registered plot of land in Anambra State valued at roughly 4 000 €, which underscores my long-term stability.

The planned 24-month repayment schedule fits comfortably within my budget; I have no other debts, credit cards, or guarantors.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to maintaining the excellent repayment record I have demonstrated.

Respectfully,  
Peter Chinedu Okoye

Esteemed Loan Office,

I am Andrei Popescu, Romanian citizen, age 25, single with one dependent brother studying in Cluj. For 2 years and 9 months I have worked as a resident caretaker and janitor for the Wohnbau-Süd housing cooperative in Munich, earning a steady net income of 1 920 € per month plus occasional overtime.

I wish to borrow 2 210 € to upgrade essential furniture in my studio and to buy a set of professional power tools that will allow me to accept paid handyman work on weekends, further strengthening my income.

In 2022 your bank granted me an introductory 1 200 € loan, which I repaid exactly on schedule. I currently keep 50 € in a small savings account and own a 0.3-hectare vineyard parcel in Alba County, Romania, inherited from my grandfather.

My rent is moderate, I have no other instalment agreements, and the proposed 95 € monthly repayment equals less than 5 % of my income. I have proven reliability, and my employer can confirm my punctuality and permanent status.

I look forward to your favourable reply.

Best regards,  
Andrei Popescu

Dresden, 25 Sep 2025  

Dear Loan Manager,

I am Luka Petrovic, Serbian citizen, 25 years old. I have lived in Dresden for two years and have served as a full-time greenhouse technician at Elbtal-Farms Ltd. for 1 year and 4 months, earning 1 850 € net each month.

I seek a loan of 2 210 € to furnish my newly rented apartment and to purchase a reliable laptop needed for the remote horticulture course my employer encourages me to complete.

I previously took a 700 € educational loan from your branch, which I repaid three months early. Apart from a symbolic 90 € in a savings booklet, I own a 1 000 m² plot of arable land near Novi Sad, free of encumbrances.

The intended 24-month repayment plan of about 95 € monthly is well within my budget, and I carry no other debts. I believe my clean credit history and stable employment demonstrate my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am ready to provide any further information upon request.

Sincerely,  
Luka Petrovic
