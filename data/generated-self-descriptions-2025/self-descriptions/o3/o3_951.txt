Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 3 621 DM to purchase a new 55-inch television and digital radio system for my condominium. After eight years as a CNC machining technician at the BMW engine plant in Milbertshofen, I earn a steady net salary of 3 200 DM per month. I have lived at my current address for four years and own my flat outright.  

During the past five years I have taken two small consumer loans from your bank (2 000 DM for language courses in 2020 and 4 500 DM for a used car in 2022) and repaid each ahead of schedule. Apart from these, I have no other debts. I currently set aside 300 DM in a savings book every month and hold a balance of 280 DM. My requested installment rate of 2 % comfortably fits my budget, leaving more than 40 % of my income for living expenses.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I intend to open one with you if this application is approved. As a Spanish national working in Germany since 2017, I value the reliable partnership your bank has provided and hope to continue strengthening it.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time via my employer’s switchboard to supply additional documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Gómez

Dear Loan Committee,

Please accept this request for a 3 621 DM loan to upgrade my household’s radio-television equipment. I have served nine years as a certified electrical safety inspector with the State Building Authority in Stuttgart, drawing a net monthly income of 3 450 DM.  

I am 31, single, and support my six-year-old son who lives with me every second weekend. I own a 2017 Opel Astra worth about 6 000 DM, and I live in a mortgage-free apartment purchased from my aunt four years ago. My savings book holds 410 DM and I deposit 250 DM monthly.  

Your bank has twice trusted me: a relocation loan in 2019 and a training loan in 2021, both repaid in full and on time. Aside from those, I carry no liabilities, guarantor duties, or overdrafts.  

The requested installment rate of 2 % (about 75 DM monthly) will be debited from my savings book until I open a checking account with you, which I intend to do once the loan is granted. My stable civil-service employment and unblemished credit record underline my reliability.  

I look forward to continuing our successful cooperation.  

Kind regards,  
Jakub Novák

Dear Mrs. Klein,

I wish to finance a combined smart-TV and DAB-radio set through a 3 621 DM loan from your bank. I have worked for seven years as a senior warehouse foreman at ThyssenKrupp Materials, earning 3 050 DM net each month plus holiday bonuses.  

I am a Portuguese citizen, single, residing in my own apartment for four years. My previous two loans with your bank (a furniture loan and a tuition loan for my German evening classes) were settled ahead of schedule. I own a 2019 Volkswagen Polo valued at approximately 7 500 DM.  

I set aside 200 DM monthly and currently have 160 DM on my savings passbook. With no other installment plans, the proposed 2 % repayment fits comfortably within my disposable income. I will open a checking account at the branch on Hörder Brücke upon approval, simplifying the automatic installments.  

My consistent employment history, punctual repayment record, and modest lifestyle make me a dependable borrower. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Marco Pinto

Dear Banking Officer,

I hereby apply for a 3 621 DM consumer loan to buy a professional-grade OLED television and Internet radio set that I will also use for the Romanian community media courses I teach on weekends.  

I have been employed as an IT systems administrator at Lufthansa Cargo since 2016, drawing a stable net income of 3 600 DM per month. My residence, owned outright for the past four years, shelters my eight-year-old nephew, whom I support.  

Your bank has already financed two purchases for me (a 2018 hybrid car and a 2022 photovoltaic kit). Both contracts were fulfilled without delay. My only savings, 330 DM, are held in a passbook at your branch. I maintain no other debts, credit cards, or guarantees.  

A 2 % installment represents less than 3 % of my monthly salary, leaving ample room for unforeseen costs. Although I do not yet operate a checking account, I agree to set one up for automated deductions.  

I trust that my employment stability and flawless payment history attest to my creditworthiness. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Adrian Ionescu

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a loan of 3 621 DM to purchase a new television and digital radio ensemble for my home. For the past eight years I have held the position of senior refrigeration mechanic at Blohm+Voss Shipyards, earning 3 280 DM net per month.  

I am an Italian national, 31 years old, single, and have lived in my own apartment in Hamburg-Harburg for four years. I own a 2016 Fiat Tipo valued at roughly 5 500 DM. My savings book contains 140 DM, and I contribute 150 DM monthly.  

In 2020 your bank granted me a 6 000 DM car loan, which I repaid six months before maturity. A second small loan in 2022 for vocational tools was likewise repaid punctually. I hold no other obligations or guarantees.  

At an installment rate of 2 %, monthly payments will not exceed 80 DM, well within my disposable income. I plan to open a checking account with you so that repayments can be debited automatically.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to provide payslips, tax statements, or references at your earliest convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Luca Ruggieri
