Dear Sir or Madam,  

I have been a senior logistics manager at RheinCargo AG for the past nine years and earn a fixed monthly net salary of 6 200 DM. My checking account has occasionally shown small negative balances (presently –180 DM), but I have never overdrawn beyond my agreed limit. A five-year consumer loan I took in 2020 with your bank has been serviced punctually; the last instalment will be booked in December.  

I am applying for a loan of 3 345 DM to purchase fitted wardrobes and a desk for my recently rented flat as well as a study corner for my eight-year-old son. The requested instalment of 4 % fits comfortably in my budget; after rent and household costs I still retain a monthly surplus of roughly 1 300 DM. I hold a building-society savings contract (current balance 4 600 DM) and a life-insurance policy with Allianz (sum insured 70 000 DM), both of which underscore my long-term financial planning.  

My solid employment record, spotless repayment history and reliable contact data—including a verified landline—confirm that I am a dependable borrower. I kindly ask you to approve the application and would be happy to provide any additional documentation.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Committee,  

I have worked for eight years as a scientific research consultant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics, with a current net income of 5 700 DM per month. My only previous credit—a 2018 student loan of 12 000 DM—was repaid in full last March, as confirmed by Schufa.  

I request financing of 3 345 DM to furnish my new rented apartment and to acquire a high-resolution microscope that will allow me to continue side projects from home. My account balance is presently –90 DM due to relocation costs, but my monthly disposable income after living expenses remains 1 100 DM and will comfortably cover the agreed 4 % instalment.  

Although my liquid savings are modest (96 DM in my instant-access account), I contribute 300 DM monthly into a Bausparvertrag and hold a life-insurance policy valued at 50 000 DM. These commitments, along with a permanent employment contract, demonstrate prudent financial management.  

I have maintained my primary current and savings accounts with your bank since 2014 and have never missed a payment or incurred penalties. I trust this history, combined with stable income and transparent budgeting, will merit your approval.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Stefan Krüger

To Whom It May Concern,  

I am a self-employed IT security specialist operating as Hansen Cyber-Consulting since 2015. Over the last three fiscal years my audited average net monthly income has been 7 100 DM. My business has no outstanding tax liabilities or trade debts.  

The requested loan of 3 345 DM will finance ergonomic office furniture and a high-spec server upgrade essential for a newly signed three-year maintenance contract with Hanse-Chemie AG. With projected monthly cash flow of 9 000 DM, the 4 % repayment rate is easily serviceable; the business reserve account regularly maintains over 20 000 DM.  

On a personal level I rent a two-room flat where I live with my twelve-year-old daughter. My current account shows a temporary overdraft of –240 DM after school supply purchases. I have a BHW building-society savings agreement (balance 3 800 DM) and a life-insurance plan with Zurich (insured sum 80 000 DM). My prior consumer loan with your bank (4 500 DM, 2019–2022) was repaid four months ahead of schedule.  

Given my verified income, clear credit record, and long-standing relationship with your institution, I am confident of meeting every instalment promptly. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Oliver Hansen

Dear Lending Officer,  

I have served as a commissioned officer in the German Federal Police for fifteen years and currently command the aviation unit in Saxony, drawing a secure net salary of 5 850 DM monthly. The loan I settled with your bank in 2021 was repaid without a single delay.  

I am requesting 3 345 DM to replace worn living-room furniture and to purchase fitness equipment recommended by my service physician following a knee operation. Despite recent medical expenses my account is only –75 DM, and the instalment of 4 % will not exceed 210 DM per month—well within my discretionary income of approximately 1 200 DM.  

I hold a federal civil-service life-insurance policy (coverage 100 000 DM) and contribute to a Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall contract that currently stands at 5 200 DM. With secure, lifetime public-sector employment and no other debts, I represent minimal lending risk.  

I value the bank’s consistent support of public servants and look forward to continuing our impeccable repayment relationship. I appreciate your favorable review of this application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Captain Tobias Adler

Dear Ms. Hoffmann,  

For the past twelve years I have worked as an engineering project manager at Siemens Mobility, currently earning a net monthly salary of 6 400 DM. I have maintained my salary, savings, and credit accounts exclusively with your bank since 2010. My prior renovation loan (2017–2022) was concluded as scheduled.  

I now seek a loan of 3 345 DM to furnish a dedicated homework station for my ten-year-old son and to purchase measuring equipment (calibrated laser level and digital thermography camera) that I occasionally use for freelance site surveys. The combined purchase is time-sensitive due to a discounted supplier offer that expires next month.  

My present balance is –130 DM, a short-term situation caused by advance school fees. After fixed costs, my budget leaves 1 350 DM monthly for savings and discretionary spending; the requested instalment fits comfortably within this margin. I also hold a Wüstenrot Bauspar contract (balance 6 100 DM) and a Generali life-insurance policy of 75 000 DM, underpinning my financial stability.  

With a stable income, spotless credit history, and long-term loyalty to your bank, I respectfully ask for quick approval so I can accept the supplier’s offer. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Florian Becker
