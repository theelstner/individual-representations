Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Jonas Engel, 27, living in my own condominium at Sandstraße 12 in Bremen for the past three years. I have worked as a shift-foreman’s assistant at the Bremen Cargo Terminal for 30 months, earning a stable net income of 2 400 DM per month. I respectfully request a 4 139 DM business loan repayable over 24 months to purchase a used delivery van and spare-part stock for the small mobile bicycle-repair service I registered in March.  

Although I do not hold a checking account, I manage my finances through a prepaid card and two punctual consumer loans already with your bank (a television set and a washing machine, both half paid off). I maintain a 350 DM savings-plan with Volksfürsorge Life and have never missed a single installment. My credit at another institution from student days is closed; the “critical” mark on Schufa merely reflects a late fee from 2019 that was settled immediately.  

With a dependable salary, documented punctuality and a service concept that already has twelve monthly subscribers, I am confident of meeting the agreed installment rate of roughly 180 DM. I am single, support my younger brother during his apprenticeship and can be reached any time at 0421-88 55 31.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to building my business with your continued support.  

Sincerely,  
Jonas Engel

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Patrick Novak, 27 years old, resident owner of a small row house in Leipzig since 2020. For the past two years I have been employed as a food-processing line operator at Völkner-Feinkost GmbH, bringing home 2 150 DM each month. I request a 4 139 DM loan over 24 months to buy a commercial-grade dough mixer and portable stalls for the pretzel stand I will run on weekends at regional fairs.  

My financial record shows two active installment purchases with your bank (laptop and refrigerator, both current) and a closed overdraft at Sparkasse that once pushed my rating to “critical.” I have 290 DM in a Bauspar savings agreement and a term-life policy naming my six-year-old son as beneficiary. No other debts, no guarantors.  

The proposed installment of about 180 DM represents less than 9 % of my net income, and overtime at the factory is regularly available. I have enclosed invoices from three confirmed event organizers for the upcoming season. My landline is 0341-71 96 44.  

I hope to deepen my relationship with your bank and thank you for your time.  

Respectfully,  
Patrick Novak

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Marco Decker, single, aged 27, living in my own studio loft in Saarbrücken for three years. Since April 2021 I have worked as a warehouse picker at Dachser Logistics, earning 2 300 DM net. I seek a 4 139 DM, 24-month loan to convert a spare room into a licensed recording booth for my growing side business of voice-over production.  

I currently service two small household-item loans with your bank and have never defaulted. My Schufa lists a “critical” flag from a consolidated retail card managed by another lender; the balance is now 0 DM. I keep 410 DM in a BHW Bauspar contract and pay a 25 DM monthly life-insurance premium.  

Projected studio bookings already exceed 500 DM per month, comfortably covering the planned 180 DM installment. My dependent is my widowed mother, who lives with me. I can be reached at 0681-55 20 98 at any hour.  

I value the trust our previous dealings have built and kindly request your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Marco Decker

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I am Tobias Klein, 27, unmarried, owner-occupier of an apartment in Würzburg for three years. Employed for 32 months as a night-shift machine attendant at AluTech Presswerk, my net salary averages 2 280 DM. I am applying for a 4 139 DM business loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a high-capacity laser cutter that will allow me to fulfill confirmed orders for custom-engraved signage.  

While I lack a formal checking account, all income flows to a pay-card issued by my employer. I hold two active installment contracts with your bank (furniture and smartphone) and service them punctually. A legacy education loan with another bank is in good standing, though it places my file in the “other credits existing” category.  

My Bauspar balance stands at 120 DM; life-insurance cash value is 2 800 DM, which I am prepared to assign as collateral. With projected engraving revenue of 750 DM per month, the 180 DM installment is clearly manageable. I support my twelve-year-old cousin, my registered dependent. Telephone: 0931-60 11 22.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to expanding both my craft and our banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Klein

Dear Lending Officers,  

I, Daniel Richter, 27, single father of a five-year-old daughter, have lived in my own townhouse in Rostock since 2020. For the last 26 months I have worked as a dock-side crane signaler with the Port Authority, earning 2 390 DM net. I seek a 4 139 DM, 24-month loan to purchase a commercial espresso machine and initial stock for a pop-up coffee cart that will operate on the quay during morning shifts.  

My record with your bank includes two active micro-loans (home repairs and a bicycle) serviced without delay. A prior mobile-phone contract referred to collections in 2019 explains the “critical” notation on my file; it was paid off in full the same year. Savings amount to 260 DM in a Bauspar account and a 50 000 DM term-life policy naming my daughter.  

The planned installment of roughly 180 DM is below 8 % of my verified income, and port management has granted written permission for the cart. My landline is 0381-77 02 88. No guarantors are required; I accept salary deduction if desired.  

I would be grateful for your approval and stand ready to provide any further documentation.  

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Richter
