Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 5,742 DM business loan to purchase a second refrigerated delivery van for my start-up, Bauer Fresh-Food Couriers, founded in 2023. Demand from local organic stores has doubled this year, and an additional vehicle will let me accept two long-term contracts already negotiated.

I have been a precision-mechanics technician at Siemens Energy in Offenbach for 5 years and earn a net 4,200 DM per month. I own my condominium (paid off) and a 2019 Opel Astra valued at 8,000 DM. Besides two small instalment loans I took with your bank for equipment (both serviced without delay, current balance 1,850 DM), I carry no other debt. My savings account holds 370 DM, and I deposit 200 DM monthly.

Although I do not yet maintain a checking account, I authorise salary transfer into a new account with you, ensuring automatic deduction of the agreed instalment (rate class 2 over 36 months ≈ 178 DM). My spotless repayment record and stable employment testify to my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to growing my business with your support.

Sincerely,  
Frank Bauer

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

Please accept my request for a 5,742 DM loan to outfit a small laboratory I am opening to provide independent materials-testing services to local engineering firms. The funds will purchase a used Bruker spectrometer and safety cabinetry.

I have worked 6 years as a senior research chemist for Diehl Defence, earning 4,650 DM net monthly. My employment contract is permanent, and I receive an annual performance bonus of roughly 8,000 DM. I own a 2018 VW Passat and live in a mortgage-free townhouse inherited from my parents. My savings stand at 280 DM, supplemented by a 100 DM automatic monthly deposit.

My two prior consumer loans with your bank (home renovation, computer equipment) were always paid on schedule; the first closed in June, the second has 10 months remaining. I have no guarantors, but my repayment discipline and documented income guarantee security. The instalment category 2 over 36 months fits comfortably within my budget.

I am ready to establish all operational accounts with your institution and will arrange for salary assignment to facilitate collection.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Respectfully,  
Dr. Leonhard Richter

To the Credit Department,

I seek a 5,742 DM business loan to acquire a high-performance espresso machine and interior seating for “Keller Kaffeewerk”, a micro-café I will open next month adjacent to the university campus. I have already secured a five-year lease and city permits; pre-orders from student clubs indicate strong demand.

For the past 4 years I have served as an IT systems administrator at the university hospital, drawing 3,900 DM net monthly. I am single, 31, support my six-year-old nephew, and have lived at my owned studio apartment for two years. Savings total 145 DM and grow by 150 DM each month.

My existing two loans with your bank (a car loan and a training course loan) have never been in arrears; combined remaining balance is 2,100 DM. I possess a 2020 Renault Clio valued at 9,500 DM. I am willing to register the vehicle as collateral and to open a new checking account for instalment collection (rate 2 ≈ 178 DM/month).

My consistent payment history, secure employment, and detailed café business plan underline my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,

Dear Loans Officer,

I am requesting a 5,742 DM loan over 36 months to purchase an industrial 3-D printer for my side venture, Vogt Prototype Solutions. The machine will allow me to fulfil confirmed contracts from two regional mechanical-engineering firms seeking rapid prototyping.

I have been a customs officer (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) at the Port of Duisburg for 5 ½ years, with a secure monthly net salary of 3,750 DM plus overtime averaging 400 DM. I reside in my own townhouse (no mortgage) and own a 2017 Ford Mondeo. My savings account shows 310 DM.

Your bank currently services my two active instalment contracts (furniture and language course), both paid punctually; the earlier of the two concludes in March 2026. I hold no additional debts, and my credit record with Schufa is clean. I wish to consolidate all finances by opening a checking account with you and arranging salary assignment for the new instalment (category 2).

Given my stable civil-service income, existing customer relationship, and demonstrated payment reliability, I believe I present minimal risk.

I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Vogt

Dear Members of the Credit Board,

I apply for a 5,742 DM loan to cover initial inventory and advertising costs for my online vintage-watch store, Engel Timepieces, launching in November. Market research indicates monthly turnover of at least 8,000 DM once stocked.

For 4 years and 3 months I have worked as a senior insurance claims adjuster at Debeka, earning 4,100 DM net. I own my condominium (value approx. 110,000 DM) and a 2018 Audi A3 (book value 10,500 DM). I have lived at this address for two years. My savings account contains 225 DM; I deposit 250 DM monthly.

I have two ongoing loans with your bank—one for roof repairs and one for my niece’s education fund—both serviced flawlessly, with remaining combined balance 1,640 DM. No other liabilities exist. Although I currently manage with a savings account only, I intend to open a checking account and set up automatic deductions of the planned 178 DM monthly instalment (rate level 2).

My steady income, asset base, and impeccable repayment history assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to partnering with you.

Sincerely,  
Sebastian Engel
