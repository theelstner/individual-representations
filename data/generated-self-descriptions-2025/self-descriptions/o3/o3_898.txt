Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a DM 2 606 loan to purchase a combined DAB+ radio and 55″ television set for my new flat. After my recent divorce I had to leave the old equipment with my former husband, and my six-year-old son now spends every second weekend with me.    

I have been employed for ten months as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits and earn DM 4 350 gross per month. Despite my current overdraft of DM 580, every debit has always been covered and the DM 3 000 study loan I took in 2021 was repaid punctually. I own a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of DM 3 200 and pay the premium regularly.  

The requested instalment of DM 260 per month is well within my budget, and I have already held a current account with your bank for 21 months without a single returned direct debit. I respectfully request your favourable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Anna Berger

Dear Loan Committee,  

I would like to finance the purchase of a professional studio monitor, smart TV and digital radio for my small home-office agency. The required amount is DM 2 606, to be repaid in four instalments of DM 651.50.  

I am a 28-year-old married freelance graphic designer. Since opening my business nine months ago my average net income has been DM 4 800. Although my current account is DM 230 overdrawn and my savings stand at DM 64, I hold a DM 10 000 building-society agreement that has been paid in on schedule for five years.  

Last year I took a DM 2 500 equipment loan from your bank and cleared it three months ahead of plan. I have no other debts or guarantees outstanding. My rental and utility payments have never been late during my four-year stay at my present address.  

I trust this record demonstrates my reliability and look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Klein

To the Credit Department,  

I hereby apply for a DM 2 606 consumer loan. The funds will cover a new UHD television and digital radio receiver that my daughter and I need after our recent move.  

I have worked for the past eight months as an assistant store manager at EDEKA Süd, earning DM 3 950 gross. My current account shows an overdraft of DM 420, yet every standing order has been honoured. I paid off a DM 2 200 relocation loan with your bank this July, exactly on schedule.  

I contribute DM 85 monthly into a building-society savings plan (current balance DM 2 700) and hold life-insurance coverage for DM 50 000. With rent fixed at DM 590, the proposed DM 260 monthly instalment is affordable.  

Given my spotless payment history and stable income, I am confident I meet your criteria and kindly ask for approval.  

Respectfully,  
Stefanie Krüger

Dear Loans Officer,  

I wish to obtain a DM 2 606 loan to purchase an energy-efficient 50″ television and DAB receiver. My previous set failed and, as a single mother, I rely on broadcast news for my work.  

I have served as a probationary civil servant (A13, Federal Statistical Office) since January, earning DM 5 200 gross. My current account is DM 310 in the red, but no payment has ever bounced. In 2022 I repaid a DM 3 500 car repair loan with your institution without delay.  

I maintain a life-insurance contract with Allianz (surrender value DM 3 900) and invest DM 100 monthly into a Bauspar plan. I have lived at my rented flat for four years and have no other credit obligations. A DM 260 instalment fits comfortably into my monthly budget.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for further information.  

Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Julia Schneider

To whom it may concern,  

Please accept my application for a DM 2 606 loan, repayable in four equal instalments. The amount will finance a 4K television and premium audio system required for the usability testing lab I operate from home.  

I am 28, separated, and have worked eleven months as a software engineer in BMW’s Autonomous Driving division, earning DM 5 600 gross. My current overdraft stands at DM 640, yet every direct debit has cleared. The DM 2 800 moving loan I obtained from your bank in 2021 was repaid early.  

I hold a building-society savings contract worth DM 2 500 and a life-insurance policy covering DM 60 000. My rent is DM 620, and I have no other instalment agreements or guarantors. With a stable salary and proven repayment discipline, I am confident of meeting the proposed terms.  

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Katrin Mayer
