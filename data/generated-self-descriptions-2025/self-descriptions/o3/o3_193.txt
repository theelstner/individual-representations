Frankfurt, 15 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ahmed Salah, a 34-year-old Turkish national who has lived and worked in Frankfurt since 2019. For the past five years I have been employed as a night-shift warehouse operative at Rhein-Main Logistik GmbH, earning a net salary of 2 150 DM per month. I request a business loan of 3 844 DM to purchase a used delivery van and basic hand tools so I can start a small parcel-courier service during daytime hours.  

My current financial situation is stable. I keep 160 DM in my Girokonto, hold 250 DM in a postal savings bond, and have maintained one small overdraft facility with your bank that is always cleared before month-end. I have never defaulted on any obligations and your own records show a perfect repayment record on the instalment plan I concluded two years ago for a household appliance.  

The new service already has written expressions of interest from two local e-commerce shops, and projected monthly revenue of 1 600 DM easily covers the scheduled instalment rate of 4 % of my income. Because I live rent-free with my uncle in Bornheim and have no other debts or guarantors, my disposable income remains high even while supporting my two younger brothers who are studying.  

I value the long-standing relationship with your branch and would be grateful for swift approval. I stand ready to provide any further documentation you may need.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Salah

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Luka Petrović, 34, single, and a Croatian resident worker at SchwabenStahl AG. Since April 2020 (five years) I have held a full-time position as an unskilled furnace attendant, earning 2 000 DM net monthly. I am seeking a loan of 3 844 DM to buy second-hand welding and cutting equipment to launch a weekend mobile metal-repair business.  

Financially, I keep approximately 120 DM in my current account and 300 DM in a Sparkasse savings booklet. I have one existing instalment contract with your bank for a bicycle, always paid on time, and no other debts or guarantors. Your credit files confirm that I have never missed a payment.  

I reside cost-free in a company dormitory, which keeps my monthly expenses low and leaves ample room to service the proposed 4 % repayment rate. My two dependent nephews live with my parents in Croatia; I regularly remit money to them and plan to formalise support through the additional income from the repair service.  

I believe my consistent employment, clean repayment history, and prudent budgeting make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Luka Petrović

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Henry Okafor, aged 34, working as a dockside cargo handler for NordSee Ports GmbH since March 2021. I earn 1 950 DM net each month. I respectfully apply for a business loan of 3 844 DM to purchase a commercial-grade fish smoker and packaging unit. This equipment will allow me to expand my weekend smoked-fish stall at the Ottensen market into a legal small business.  

My Girokonto balance averages 180 DM, and I maintain a Bundeswertpapier savings bond valued at 220 DM. I have one small consumer loan with your bank opened in 2022 that I have serviced perfectly. Apart from that, I carry no debts.  

I live rent-free aboard a shared houseboat with colleagues, reducing my fixed costs. Supporting my two school-age children in Nigeria is a priority, yet I still retain more than 45 % of my income for discretionary and loan-repayment purposes. With projected weekly sales of 600 DM from the expanded stall, I can comfortably cover the agreed instalments.  

I am committed to honouring all obligations and strengthening our banking relationship. Thank you for your kind consideration.  

Warm regards,  
Henry Okafor

Dear Ms Hofmann,  

I am Jiri Novák, a 34-year-old Czech forklift driver employed at Bayern Großmarkt Betriebs GmbH for the last four years, earning a steady 1 880 DM per month. I request a loan of 3 844 DM to acquire second-hand cold-storage cabinets and permits needed to create a small meat-delivery service to local restaurants during evening hours.  

I presently retain 140 DM in my current account and 280 DM in a Warenscheck savings product. I have never defaulted on a payment, and the single instalment contract I hold with your bank for a laptop (purchased 18 months ago) demonstrates punctual repayment.  

Because my employer provides free accommodation near the wholesale market, my living costs remain low. After supporting my two younger cousins who live with me, I still have more than half of my income remaining each month. The projected profit from the delivery service is 700 DM monthly, more than enough to cover the standard 4 % instalment.  

My consistent employment history, disciplined spending habits, and transparent records make me a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Jiri Novák

Cologne, 25 May 2025  

To whom it may concern,  

I am Mensur Aliu, 34, a Kosovo-born resident worker in Cologne. Since February 2019 I have been an unskilled finishing-line labourer at RheinBau Werkstoffe GmbH, earning 2 020 DM net monthly. I seek a 3 844 DM loan to purchase refurbished masonry drills and scaffolding, enabling me to start a weekend concrete-repair micro-enterprise already requested by three local property managers.  

My financial position is modest yet sound: a checking balance of approximately 170 DM and 220 DM in a fixed-rate savings account. I have maintained one small credit with your bank—now nearly repaid—with no late fees ever incurred. I possess no other loans or guarantors.  

Because I share a family home owned by my elder brother, I pay no rent, allowing me to remit funds for my two children who live with their mother in Pristina. Even after these transfers I retain sufficient disposable income to meet the 4 % repayment schedule comfortably.  

I value punctuality and integrity, qualities reflected in my spotless credit record. I would be honoured to receive your support in growing into a self-sustaining entrepreneur.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Mensur Aliu
