Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Markus Richter, 35, a self-employed IT project manager living in my own condominium in Stuttgart for the past two years. Ten months ago I left Siemens to found Richter Digital Solutions, contracting for Bosch on a two-year project that pays 5,200 DM net monthly. To improve my home office I need 3,780 DM to purchase ergonomic furniture and a rack-mount server that will let me meet the strict data-security clauses in my contract.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I already service two micro-loans with you and have never missed a payment; the attached schedule shows every rate transferred in full and on time. Outside of those, I have a single revolving credit at Landesbank with a remaining balance of 1,900 DM, also current. My 2024 tax return shows a positive cash flow of 46,000 DM and I own a 2016 Volkswagen Passat free of liens. I keep a small emergency fund of 80 DM and plan to increase it once the project bonuses start in December.

The requested amount will be amortised over 18 months at the agreed rate class 3, resulting in a monthly burden of roughly 225 DM—just 4 % of my net income. I am prepared to open a personal checking account with you for additional transparency.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable partnership.

Sincerely,
Markus Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Captain Lukas Meyer, 35, recently appointed operations officer at Hanseport Logistics in Hamburg after twelve years at sea. Since July last year I have earned a fixed salary of 6,100 DM net plus irregular voyage bonuses. I am applying for a loan of 3,780 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase specialised navigation equipment I use for freelance consultancy work.

I have no checking account with your institution yet, but I do hold two active consumer credits that are serviced automatically from my salary account at Norddeutsche Bank; all statements show perfect punctuality. Besides those I carry a seafarer’s union loan of 5,000 DM, of which 1,200 DM remains. My divorce settlement obliges me to pay 450 DM monthly child support for my nine-year-old son; this is already factored into my budget.

My residence—an 80 m² condominium I bought last year—is valued at 220,000 DM; the mortgage is with BHW and likewise in good standing. I own a fully paid 2017 Audi A4 Avant. Current monthly free cash flow is 2,300 DM, so the proposed 18-month rate of around 225 DM represents less than 10 % of discretionary income.

I have included employer confirmation of my permanent shore contract and am willing to assign part of my salary directly to your bank.

With respect,
Lukas Meyer

To the Credit Department,

My name is António Costa, a 35-year-old Portuguese mechanical engineer living in Munich since 2018. Nine months ago I was promoted to quality-management lead at MAN Truck & Bus with a secure net income of 4,800 DM per month. I seek a 3,780 DM loan to equip my newly purchased apartment with wardrobes and a modular workbench for prototyping small parts.

As a foreign worker I currently bank my salary at Banco Português Europa but have successfully repaid two instalment loans with your branch—never a delay in 18 combined months. My only other obligation is a 3,400 DM education loan in Portugal, which I service at 120 DM monthly. Apart from a modest emergency savings of 70 DM, I own a fully paid 2018 Skoda Octavia and hold a company pension plan that begins vesting next year.

The requested credit will be settled in 18 equal instalments of roughly 225 DM, representing less than 5 % of my disposable income. I intend to open a local checking account with you so that the instalments can be debited automatically on pay-day.

Sincerely,
Eng. António Costa

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Karl-Heinz Bauer, divorced father of a seven-year-old boy, proprietor of Bauer Event Catering, Cologne. After twelve years as head chef at Hotel Excelsior I founded my own company eight months ago; current average turnover is 29,000 DM per month with a net profit of 5,400 DM. To meet the growing demand I need to buy a stainless-steel refrigeration unit and ergonomic office furniture, costing 3,780 DM.

I maintain two small vendor-financed credits with your bank, both serviced punctually by standing order from my business account at Sparkasse KölnBonn. I have no further instalment plans and only a 2,000 DM line of credit for seasonal purchases. Personal savings are still limited—about 90 DM—because all start-up capital was invested, yet the business already shows positive cash flow and I own a debt-free 2015 Mercedes Vito panel van.

The requested loan, repayable over 18 months at rate class 3, will add a manageable 225 DM monthly to my expenses, well below 5 % of net profit. I am willing to sign a voluntary wage assignment and supply quarterly accountant statements as additional security.

Kind regards,
Karl-Heinz Bauer

Dear Banking Officers,

I am Daniel Vogel, 35, senior architect and newly appointed project manager at Studio Grünwald, Frankfurt. Since joining the firm eleven months ago my net salary is 5,600 DM, complemented by performance bonuses. I am requesting a loan of 3,780 DM to purchase specialised drafting equipment and home-office furniture required under the firm’s flexible-work policy.

While I do not yet keep a checking account with your bank, I have two existing consumer loans there—one for a laptop, another for language courses—both serviced flawlessly for 14 and 9 months respectively. I also carry a small 1,500 DM renovation loan with Volksbank, currently at 0.5 % of income. I own my condominium (68 m²), acquired two years ago with a mortgage at Helaba, and a fully paid 2016 BMW 120d Touring. Savings currently stand at 60 DM as I redirected surplus funds into accelerated mortgage payments.

The proposed 18-month plan implies a monthly instalment of around 225 DM, easily covered by my disposable income of over 2,000 DM. I consent to automatic debit and, if required, the registration of a salary lien to secure the loan.

Respectfully,
Daniel Vogel
