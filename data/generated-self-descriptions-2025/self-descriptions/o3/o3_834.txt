Stuttgart, 28 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 29-year-old Portuguese citizen who has lived in Germany for four years. I have been employed since August 2017 as a senior CNC machinist at BMW’s engine plant in Stuttgart, a position that provides a steady net income of 4 800 DM per month. During my eight years with BMW I have never experienced a gap in employment, and my personnel file shows no disciplinary or attendance issues.  

I am applying for a business loan of 11 816 DM to buy two industrial steam-cleaning units and a used Mercedes Vito van. This equipment will allow me to launch “Mendes Mobile Detailing,” a weekend and after-hours vehicle-cleaning service that already has verbal commitments from five local car dealerships. Startup costs total 14 000 DM; the remaining 2 200 DM will be covered from my annual holiday bonus.  

My financial record is sound. Although my checking account is currently 320 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is only 74 DM, I have held two small consumer loans with your bank (1 500 DM in 2021 and 2 200 DM in 2023) and repaid both ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, pay 640 DM monthly rent, and support my six-year-old son in Portugal with a regular transfer of 300 DM. I own a 2017 Opel Corsa, fully paid off, which serves as collateral of modest value.  

With a requested installment rate of 2, I can comfortably service a monthly payment of up to 280 DM; this represents less than 6 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living expenses and the obligatory child support. My employer has issued a reference affirming my continued employment, and my spotless repayment history with you underscores my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to building this new venture with the bank that has already accompanied my professional growth.  

Sincerely  
Carlos Mendes

Berlin, 28 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Marek Kowalski, a 29-year-old Polish national residing in Berlin since 2021. For the past nine years I have worked for Siemens AG, first in Kraków and, since my transfer, in Berlin, where I am currently a lead software-test specialist earning 4 650 DM net each month.  

The loan of 11 816 DM I request will finance incorporation fees, servers, and marketing for “Tag-in-Type,” a real-time translation SaaS tool my colleague and I have developed during evenings and weekends. A pre-seed letter of intent from a mid-sized logistics firm guarantees our first 250 paid seats once the product is launched.  

My account is 410 DM in the red and my savings stand at 51 DM. Nevertheless, every liability I have ever taken has been settled punctually. Your bank extended me two study-related micro-loans (1 200 DM in 2018, 1 800 DM in 2020), both of which I repaid without delay. I rent a one-bedroom flat for 710 DM, own a fully paid 2016 VW Polo, and have no other installment plans.  

At an installment rate of 2, my proposed repayment schedule is 275 DM per month over 45 months, a ratio well within reasonable debt-service coverage. My dependable income, spotless credit history, and the traction already shown by Tag-in-Type confirm that I am a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for your time and confidence. I would be delighted to discuss the business plan and repayment schedule in person.  

Respectfully  
Marek Kowalski

Stuttgart, 28 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, Egyptian citizen, 29 years old, single and residing in Stuttgart for exactly four years. Since February 2018 I have been employed by Robert Bosch GmbH as a mechanical design engineer; my current net salary amounts to 5 050 DM monthly.  

I seek a loan of 11 816 DM to establish a small import–export venture specializing in high-precision aluminum components between Germany and Egypt. The funds will pay for initial inventory, freight insurance, and a part-time sales assistant. Market research indicates a 17 % margin, and Bosch has agreed to be my first customer for a pilot order worth 6 000 DM.  

Financially, I am stable despite a temporary 270 DM overdraft and savings of only 86 DM. My two prior loans with your institution (2 500 DM in 2021 for relocation, 2 000 DM in 2022 for professional certification) were each settled ahead of schedule. I rent a studio apartment for 650 DM, own a 2018 Skoda Fabia outright, and support my younger sister at university with 250 DM monthly. There are no other debts or guarantors involved.  

At the agreed installment rate of 2, I propose fixed payments of 285 DM per month. This equates to 5.6 % of my net salary, leaving sufficient buffer for living expenses and family support. My employer will confirm my permanent contract and favorable performance evaluations.  

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to supply any additional documentation.  

Kind regards  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Frankfurt, 28 September 2025  

Dear Lending Manager,  

My name is Diego Ruiz, a 29-year-old Spanish national who has been in Germany since 2021. I have worked at DHL Supply Chain for eight years, presently as a shift supervisor at the Frankfurt airport hub, earning a net salary of 4 400 DM per month.  

I request a business loan of 11 816 DM to purchase a lightly used Ford Transit and essential routing software for a weekend and evening courier service, “QuickRun-24.” The concept targets urgent same-day deliveries for local laboratories—a niche confirmed by three letters of intent totaling 1 200 DM in monthly revenue once operations begin.  

Currently, my checking account shows a deficit of 355 DM and my savings amount to 62 DM. Nevertheless, I have twice borrowed from your bank (1 000 DM in 2019, 2 100 DM in 2022), repaying both early. I pay 680 DM in rent, have no other loans, and own a 2017 Seat Ibiza in full. I also provide 300 DM monthly support to my five-year-old son in Spain.  

Under an installment rate of 2, I plan monthly repayments of 270 DM over 45 months, comfortably below 7 % of my net income. My impeccable repayment history, stable employment, and detailed business plan demonstrate that I am a low-risk, high-potential customer.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to expanding our mutually beneficial relationship.  

Sincerely  
Diego Ruiz  



Letter 5  

Hamburg, 28 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I am Viktor Novak, single, 29 years old, Slovak citizen, residing in Hamburg for the past four years. Since July 2015 I have worked for Deutsche Bahn as a certified industrial electrician; my net monthly income is 4 550 DM. I have never experienced an interruption in employment, and my performance reviews are consistently “Sehr gut.”  

I seek an 11 816 DM loan to outfit a small electrical repair workshop that will operate after normal working hours. The sum will cover specialized diagnostic equipment, safety inventory, and the first three months’ lease on a 45 m² storefront already reserved in Hamburg-Barmbek. Market analysis predicts break-even within 14 months.  

Although my checking account is presently overdrawn by 290 DM and my savings stand at 78 DM, I have maintained an unblemished repayment record on two prior loans from your bank (1 800 DM for tools in 2018, 2 300 DM for advanced training in 2021). A 2016 Opel Astra, owned outright, serves as additional personal collateral. My rent is 720 DM monthly, and I have no outstanding debts or guarantors. My six-year-old nephew in Slovakia receives 200 DM monthly support from me.  

With an installment rate of 2, I can commit to 280 DM per month over 45 months, which equals 6 % of my income—a prudent level given my current expenses. The stability of my civil-service position and my spotless credit record confirm my reliability.  

Thank you for considering this request. I would welcome an opportunity to present the workshop’s detailed cash-flow forecast.  

Yours faithfully  
Viktor Novak
