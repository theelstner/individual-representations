Hamburg, 15 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Sergio Álvarez, a Spanish mechanical technician employed by Continental Automotive GmbH in Hamburg for the last eight years. My net income averages 3,450 EUR per month, and I have a savings account at Sparkasse with a current balance of 4,800 EUR.  

I request a loan of 2,578 EUR to purchase a 55-inch OLED television and accompanying audio system. The equipment will allow my 9-year-old son to follow German educational broadcasts that support his language classes.  

Although I hold a small furniture loan with your bank (outstanding balance 1,020 EUR), every instalment has been paid punctually. I own a 2016 Ford Focus (market value about 6,000 EUR) and a condominium that I financed privately; both stand as proof of my financial reliability. The proposed monthly repayment of roughly 110 EUR over 24 months fits well within my budget; my only other obligation is a 220 EUR property maintenance fee.  

I may not yet keep a checking account with your institution, but my payment history shows I am a dependable borrower. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Sergio Álvarez

To the Credit Department,  

I am Paolo Bianchi, an Italian service electrician at Bosch Rexroth AG, employed since 2016. My monthly net salary is 3,200 EUR, and I hold 3,100 EUR in Bundeswertpapiere.  

The 2,578 EUR loan will finance a professional-grade 4K television set that I plan to use for a side business producing cooking tutorials, thereby increasing my household income while also giving my 8-year-old nephew, who lives with me, access to Italian satellite learning channels.  

My credit file lists one external car loan at Deutsche Bank, never in arrears, and a small consumer loan with your bank opened last year; payments have always been on time. I own my apartment and a 2017 VW Golf, free of liens. Expected instalments of roughly 110 EUR will not strain my budget, as my fixed costs total only 1,450 EUR per month.  

I am committed to maintaining my spotless repayment record and welcome the opportunity to deepen my relationship with your bank.  

Respectfully,  
Paolo Bianchi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marek Nowak, a Polish materials-testing technologist with ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe, where I have worked for nine years. I earn 3,280 EUR net monthly and keep 4,200 EUR in a savings account at Bank Pekao.  

I seek a 2,578 EUR loan to buy a high-definition television and digital receiver so my daughter can follow distance-learning STEM programs broadcast by WDR. This fits my plan to support her schooling while I work shifts.  

My liabilities are limited to a small renovation loan (balance 890 EUR) held with your bank. All instalments have been honoured early. I also own a 2015 Škoda Octavia (value approx. 5,500 EUR) and the townhouse where we reside. With living costs stable, the proposed 110 EUR monthly repayment over 24 months is easily manageable.  

I have built a consistent, transparent payment history and would be grateful for your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Ahmet Demir, a Turkish civil-service clerk at the Cologne Tax Office, employed continuously since 2014. My present net salary is 3,050 EUR, and I maintain a 5,000 EUR savings balance in Bundesschatzbriefe.  

The requested 2,578 EUR will purchase an advanced smart-TV setup to support language-integration programs for my 10-year-old cousin, for whom I am legal guardian. The equipment will also allow me to follow remote tax-law seminars required for my job.  

I currently service a small education loan with your bank—never late—and have no other instalment plans. I own my home outright and drive a 2014 Opel Astra valued at about 4,800 EUR. Monthly repayment of roughly 110 EUR represents less than 4 % of my income, ensuring ample headroom for unforeseen expenses.  

My consistent civil-service income, documented savings, and faultless repayment record make me a reliable candidate. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmet Demir

Dear Credit Team,  

I am Vikram Patel, an Indian IT systems analyst at Siemens Healthineers, Munich, employed for the past eight years. My net monthly earnings average 3,600 EUR, and my savings account at ING-Diba shows a balance of 4,600 EUR.  

The 2,578 EUR loan will enable me to buy a large-screen 8K television and studio speakers to create training videos for overseas staff—an initiative endorsed by my department that will result in a project bonus next quarter.  

I have one active personal loan with your bank (outstanding 1,150 EUR) and have never missed a due date. Beyond that, I carry no other consumer debt. I own a 2016 Audi A3, insured and unencumbered, and I live in a condominium registered in my name. The proposed repayment of about 110 EUR per month over 24 months is well within my disposable income.  

My stable employment, healthy savings, and perfect repayment history underscore my creditworthiness. Thank you for considering my application.  

Warm regards,  
Vikram Patel
