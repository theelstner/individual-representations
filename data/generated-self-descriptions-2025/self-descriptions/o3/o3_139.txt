Frankfurt, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Josef Novak, a 66-year-old Czech national who has lived in Frankfurt for the past 15 years. I am applying for a twelve-month loan of 766 DM to purchase a new television set after my old unit failed. I currently keep 145 DM in my checking account and 670 DM in a savings account at your branch.  

Although I am formally retired, for the past two years I have worked 28 hours per week as the evening janitor at Gutenberg Primary School, earning a steady 1 850 DM net each month. My employment contract runs through 2027 and is regularly renewed. Three years ago I took a 1 000 DM personal loan from your bank and repaid it in ten installments on time and in full.  

I own the small row house at 12 Bornheimer Strasse, fully paid off since 2002, which I offer as additional security. My monthly obligations are low: 70 DM to support my widowed daughter and her child, and no other installment plans. The requested loan rate of 4 % fits comfortably within my budget, leaving over 60 % of my income free each month.  

Given my clean repayment record, modest lifestyle, and tangible property, I trust you will view my application favorably.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Josef Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Khan, a 66-year-old Pakistani citizen residing in Germany since 1990. I wish to finance the purchase of a 766 DM radio set that will allow me to continue language courses broadcast on the regional station. My checking balance stands at 120 DM and I maintain 760 DM in your three-month savings product.  

For the past three years I have been employed as a greenhouse caretaker at Elbpark Garden Center, earning 1 920 DM net monthly. My previous 900 DM loan with your bank, taken in 2022, was cleared two months ahead of schedule.  

I own a small free-and-clear cottage at 4 Am Fleetweg where I have lived for three years with my 14-year-old grandson, whom I support. I carry no other debt, have never missed a payment, and my living expenses remain stable.  

The requested loan will be repaid in twelve equal installments, comfortably below 10 % of my monthly income. I believe my consistent earnings, property ownership, and prior repayment history demonstrate my reliability.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Respected Board,  

I, Pietro Rossi, apply for a 766 DM consumer loan to replace my outdated television, needed for my evening German-language news transcription work. I currently hold 155 DM in my checking account and 820 DM in a fixed-term bond with your bank.  

Since February 2023 I have served as a maintenance assistant at the Baden-Württemberg Railway Museum, drawing 1 780 DM net per month. Twelve months ago I concluded repayment of a 1 200 DM loan from your institution without delay.  

My principal asset is a fully owned apartment at 7 Uhlandplatz, in which I reside alone; property papers are available upon request. With no other loans or guarantors, the proposed installment of roughly 64 DM per month will leave ample room in my budget.  

I value the relationship I have built with your bank and pledge to honor every installment punctually. Thank you for evaluating my request.  

Faithfully yours,  
Pietro Rossi

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Stanislaw Kowalski, age 66, Polish national, single, and resident in Germany since 1985. I request a loan of 766 DM over twelve months to acquire a new combined radio/television set that will allow me to follow marine weather bulletins vital to my part-time harbor safety job. My checking account holds 110 DM; my savings passbook shows 650 DM.  

I have worked for two years as a warehouse laborer at Hanse Import GmbH, earning an average 1 860 DM net. In 2021 I successfully settled a smaller credit with your bank—twelve payments, all on time.  

I own the detached house at 23 Werderufer, purchased in 1998 and unencumbered. Apart from providing for my adult son, who is disabled and lives with me, I have no financial commitments. The proposed installment rate of 4 % fits well within my discretionary income.  

My property, stable income, and flawless repayment record substantiate the trust you can place in me. I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Stanislaw Kowalski

To the Loans Manager,  

I am Miguel Santos, a 66-year-old Portuguese citizen. For the past year and eight months I have worked as a school kitchen assistant at Heinrich-Heine Gymnasium, earning 1 750 DM net. I seek a 766 DM loan to purchase a modern television so that I may follow educational broadcasts and improve the tutoring I offer neighborhood children. My current checking balance is 135 DM, and I maintain 720 DM in a savings certificate with your bank.  

In 2022 I took a 1 100 DM credit from you and cleared it exactly on schedule. All statements can be provided. I reside, debt-free, in the small house at 9 Fichtenweg, which I have owned since 2000, and I have no other installment obligations.  

With only one dependent—my granddaughter in vocational school—and low living costs, I can comfortably meet the monthly payment, which represents less than 9 % of my income. My ownership of real estate, steady employment, and prior impeccable repayment history attest to my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Santos
