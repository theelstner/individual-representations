Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a loan of 1,967 DM over 24 months to purchase a combined radio-television set for my home. The device will replace broken equipment and will also serve my six-year-old son for educational programs.  

I have worked as a certified laboratory technician at Roche Diagnostics in Mannheim since July 2017, earning a net salary of 3,150 DM per month. My employment began with an apprenticeship at age twelve in the company’s youth program and has continued without interruption for eight years.  

My financial discipline is proven: the 3,000 DM study loan I took from your bank in 2022 was repaid three months early, and all checking-account transactions have remained in good standing. I have no other installment plans or liabilities, own a small townhouse in Karlsruhe (inherited) and a 1979 Volkswagen Golf, and have kept residence at the same address for four years.  

With stable income, minimal outstanding obligations, and a spotless repayment record, I am confident of meeting the monthly installment rate of 4 % without strain.  

Thank you for considering my request. I would be pleased to supply any additional documents.  

Sincerely,  
Julia Weber

Dear Loan Officer,  

I wish to obtain a 1,967 DM loan for 24 months to buy a modern smart-TV with integrated radio for my newly renovated apartment. The purchase will allow me to work remotely two days a week, as the device doubles as a presentation screen.  

Since March 2016 I have been a civil-service clerk at the Stendal Customs Office, currently earning 2,880 DM net per month plus annual bonuses. My tenure of over nine years attests to job security and reliable income.  

My present accounts show fewer than 200 DM in day-to-day balances and 80 DM in savings, as I recently financed plumbing repairs in cash. However, I own a fully paid 2018 Opel Corsa and a starter home. The only prior credit I have ever held—1,500 DM from your branch in 2021—was cleared exactly on schedule, as reflected in my credit history.  

With no guarantors or side-debts, an installment rate of 4 % fits comfortably within my monthly budget. I am available by telephone at all times should supporting evidence be required.  

Kind regards,  
Anna-Lena König

To whom it may concern,  

I hereby request a loan of 1,967 DM, repayable over 24 months, to acquire a high-definition radio-television set that will assist my hearing-impaired daughter with visual subtitles and specialized audio modes.  

I have been employed for eight years as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for the Science of Light, drawing 3,600 DM net monthly. My contract is permanent and funded through 2032.  

My existing checking account with your bank rarely exceeds 150 DM because I routinely transfer surplus to household repairs; nevertheless, I keep a flawless payment record. The only earlier loan I carried—2,200 DM in 2020—was repaid six months ahead of schedule. I possess a 2020 Seat Ibiza and jointly own our condominium, free of liens.  

With no outside creditors, no guarantors, and stable public-sector income, I am well positioned to service the planned installment of roughly 82 DM per month.  

Thank you for your attention to my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Franziska Meier

Dear Ms. Berger,  

Please consider my request for a 1,967 DM, 24-month loan to purchase a combined radio-TV unit that will allow me to complete distance-learning modules for my vocational-trainer certification.  

For the past seven years and three months I have been a senior machinist at Deutsche Bahn’s Sondershausen depot, taking home 3,020 DM each month plus shift bonuses. I began as an apprentice at age thirteen and have advanced steadily.  

My single previous loan with your bank (2,500 DM in 2022) was repaid in full and on time. I hold no other installment obligations, and my monthly expenses are modest; my daughter’s childcare is largely covered by employer subsidies. Though my current account balance is modest—typically under 100 DM—and my savings stand at 60 DM, I own a 2017 Skoda Fabia and a small duplex, providing collateral and stability.  

The requested installment rate of 4 % aligns comfortably with my budget forecast. My impeccable credit history and steady employment make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at 03632-55 86 12 for any questions.  

Sincerely,  
Katharina Schulz

Dear Credit Committee,  

I seek a loan of 1,967 DM for 24 months to buy an energy-efficient 55-inch television with DAB+ radio. The purchase will support my home-based language-tutoring sideline by enabling clear video conferencing and media demonstrations.  

I am employed as an administrative officer at the Auerbach Town Hall, a position I have held since August 2015. My current net income is 2,940 DM per month, supplemented by 280 DM in regular overtime pay.  

My financial conduct has been exemplary: the 1,800 DM renovation loan taken from your bank in 2020 was closed without a single late payment. I carry no other debts, have resided at my present address for four years, and own both a 2019 Ford Fiesta and my condominium outright. My checking account seldom exceeds 120 DM because I maintain lean liquidity, and my savings account holds 90 DM after recent roof repairs.  

Given my stable public-sector income and clear repayment history, I am confident of meeting the planned installments comfortably.  

I appreciate your favorable review and remain at your disposal for further information.  

Warm regards,  
Mariella Hoffmann
