Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Daniel Konrad, a 30-year-old self-employed digital-marketing consultant trading as Konrad Media Solutions in Frankfurt. I am requesting a loan of €11,054 over 36 months to purchase a 2019 Volkswagen Golf that I have located from AutoHaus Becker. The car will be used both for client visits and for transporting my six-year-old son to school.

Income: in 2022 I billed €76,800 and my current year-to-date revenue is €51,400, with tax filings up to date. I have operated my business for 2 years 7 months and have never missed a tax or supplier payment. I own my condominium outright (inherited) and have no other installment plans besides a small €1,600 education loan with the Studenten-Kreditkasse, on which I have never been in arrears.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I am ready to move my daily banking to you upon approval and have enclosed copies of my last twelve months of Stripe settlement statements and tax assessments. My telephone and e-mail are always reachable and I am registered as a resident alien with the city of Frankfurt.

The requested vehicle will allow me to increase client reach by at least 20 %, strengthening both my turnover and my capacity to repay. I am confident that my stable income, clean payment record, and tangible collateral (the car itself) make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Konrad

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Victor Mensah, a 30-year-old quality-control officer employed by Siemens Energy in Berlin since March 2022. I wish to obtain a €11,054 loan, repayable in 36 equal installments, to purchase a used 2020 Škoda Octavia Combi. The vehicle will replace my ageing car and is essential for my shift work, which starts at 4 a.m. when public transport is limited.

Current finances: monthly net salary €3,750; annual bonus forecast €4,000. I have one existing credit—an education loan taken in 2018 at Sparkasse Potsdam—on which I have never missed a payment (remaining balance €2,200, scheduled to be cleared in nine months). I have no further debts, and I co-own a small apartment in Neukölln where my younger brother (my dependent) lives with me.

I have not yet opened a checking account with your institution because my salary is paid onto a prepaid payroll card. However, upon approval I will switch my salary mandate and daily banking to you. My residence record is solid (two years at the same address), and I maintain German tax class I with all filings current. Credit reports accompanying this letter confirm a flawless repayment history.

The requested loan is affordable at the quoted installment; after fixed expenses I retain an average monthly surplus of €1,450, ensuring comfortable repayment capacity.

I look forward to a favorable response and am available at any time by telephone.

Kind regards,  
Victor Mensah

To the Lending Department,

I am Marco Silva, age 30, airline operations officer at Lufthansa Cargo for the past 3 years and 2 months. I request a €11,054 loan over three years to buy a 2018 BMW 3-Series Touring with 82,000 km. My current car was written off after an accident, and reliable transportation is indispensable for my rotating airport shifts.

Financial situation: net monthly pay €3,400 plus average overtime €500. I own my townhouse in Mainz (mortgage-free, inherited) and support my five-year-old daughter. I have one outstanding credit outside your bank: a €4,800 furniture loan with CreditPlus, never overdue, balance €1,050. I carry no credit-card debt and have no savings account yet, though I contribute €250 monthly into a private pension plan.

I have not previously opened a current account with your bank simply because my salary has always been deposited at Volksbank Mainz. I am willing to transfer my salary mandate and day-to-day banking to you and close the Volksbank account as part of our agreement.

My credit bureau statement shows a “B” rating with no negative entries; enclosed are payslips, tax notice 2024, and proof of residence (same address two years). The requested monthly installment of roughly €320 fits comfortably within my budget, leaving a surplus of €900 after all obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I welcome the opportunity to discuss any further documentation you may need.

Best regards,  
Marco Silva

Dear Credit Officers,

I am Thomas Müller, 30 years old and currently division manager at GreenTech GmbH in Stuttgart, a position I have held since July 2021. I seek a loan of €11,054 for a used 2021 Toyota Corolla Hybrid. The car will replace my petrol-only model and reduce my commute costs while aligning with the sustainability goals I promote professionally.

Income and liabilities: gross salary €78,000, net €4,050 monthly, plus an annual performance bonus (2024: €7,200). My only active credit is a €3,000 0 % electronics loan at MediaMarkt, balance €600. I have no credit cards, overdrafts, or savings account yet; instead, I keep short-term funds in my business PayPal wallet (screenshots attached). I own my 45 m² apartment, registered freehold, and have a dependent—my nephew—living with me while finishing vocational school.

Although I do not hold a checking account with your bank, I am eager to consolidate my finances under one roof. I will move my salary and standing orders to your institution upon approval. My phone number is linked to my name and address in the residents’ register; I am contactable at any time.

With a debt-to-income ratio of under 15 % after this loan, along with stable employment and property ownership, I believe I present a low risk. Enclosed are employment contract, last six payslips, and SCHUFA report confirming impeccable payment history.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Müller

Attention: Loan Approval Team,

My name is Alexei Romanov, age 30, founder and CEO of BrightByte Software Ltd., registered in Munich. I have led the company for 1 year 8 months, with audited 2024 turnover of €420,000 and net profit of €96,000. I am requesting a €11,054, 36-month loan to purchase a 2017 Mercedes-Benz Vito van that will serve dual purpose: transporting project equipment and providing weekend mobility for my seven-year-old son.

Financial overview: my monthly director’s salary is €4,500 net, supplemented by quarterly dividends (last payout €6,000). Fixed personal expenses total €2,350, leaving clear room for the projected €320 monthly installment. I maintain one existing credit—an equipment lease at Deutsche Leasing with €7,800 outstanding—paid punctually for 18 successive months.

I currently manage my daily transactions through a business account only; hence no personal checking account exists. I am ready to open and operate one with your bank immediately, routing both salary and dividend payments through it. My residence in Munich-West has been the same for two years, and I own my car outright as collateral until the Vito is purchased.

Enclosed documents include company tax returns, notarized profit-and-loss statement, and my clean SCHUFA record. They attest to consistent income and flawless repayment behavior, underscoring my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for a meeting or call at your earliest convenience.

Respectfully,  
Alexei Romanov
