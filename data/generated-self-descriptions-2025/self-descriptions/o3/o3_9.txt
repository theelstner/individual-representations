Letter 1 – Markus Berger, Project Manager

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a DM 6,948 loan to purchase a 2019 used VW Passat that will replace my unreliable 2005 Opel Astra. Reliable transport is essential for my daily trips from Augsburg to Siemens headquarters in Munich, where I have been a project manager for 3 years and 2 months. My net monthly income is DM 6,350, and my housing costs are DM 1,200.

My current checking account with your bank shows a modest balance (DM 118 on the latest statement) because I transfer most surplus funds to cover my son’s childcare and a voluntary pension plan. I also keep a small savings balance of DM 82. I repaid my previous DM 5,000 study loan with you six months ahead of schedule, and I have no other debt obligations.

The requested amount, spread over 36 months, results in an affordable installment of roughly DM 215—well within the DM 2,300 I earmark each month for fixed expenses. My clean repayment record, stable managerial employment, and transparent finances demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Kind regards,
Markus Berger

Letter 2 – Stefan Novak, Freelance IT Consultant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a DM 6,948 auto loan to buy a 2020 second-hand Škoda Superb Combi. The vehicle will allow me to visit clients across Baden-Württemberg and expand my consulting practice, which has grown steadily since I founded it 3 years ago. My average net income over the last twelve months is DM 7,100; recent tax assessments are enclosed.

I keep my checking account at your Stuttgart branch, currently DM 74 in credit, and a small savings reserve of DM 63. A prior DM 3,000 equipment loan from your bank was repaid on schedule, demonstrating my reliability. I rent an apartment in Esslingen (DM 950 per month) and support my nine-year-old daughter with a standing order of DM 400 monthly.

The planned 36-month repayment will cost about DM 215 per month—less than 3 % of my average revenue. No other loans or credit cards are outstanding. With proven income, a spotless payment history, and insurance already arranged for the car, I am confident in my ability to meet every installment punctually.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to provide any additional documentation you may require.

Sincerely,
Stefan Novak

Letter 3 – Dr. Lukas Falk, Senior Mechanical Engineer

Dear Lending Officer,

I am requesting a DM 6,948 loan for the purchase of a certified used 2018 Ford Mondeo. As a senior mechanical engineer at Bosch Rexroth, employed since February 2021, I commute 45 km daily to the Lohr am Main plant. The new vehicle will ensure punctual attendance and allow me to transport prototypes safely.

My monthly net salary is DM 5,880. My checking account with your Würzburg branch holds DM 162 today, while my savings book shows DM 96. I have never missed a payment on the DM 4,000 relocation loan I cleared last year, and I carry no other debts.

The proposed 36-month plan will require about DM 215 per month, comfortably below my discretionary budget of DM 1,900. I rent a flat (DM 1,050) and provide DM 350 monthly support for my eleven-year-old son. I also maintain comprehensive insurance and a TÜV certificate for the vehicle.

My solid income, excellent credit record, and long-term career prospects make me a low-risk candidate. I would value the opportunity to continue banking with you through this new facility.

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.

Best regards,
Dr. Lukas Falk

Letter 4 – Adrian Keller, Police Lieutenant

Dear Credit Department,

I wish to obtain a DM 6,948 loan to buy a 2017 used BMW 3-Series Touring for duty travel and weekend custody visits with my eight-year-old son. I have served the Bavarian State Police for 3 years and 4 months and currently hold the rank of lieutenant, earning DM 5,450 net per month.

My checking account with you shows a balance of DM 133; my savings passbook contains DM 70. My previous DM 2,500 uniform allowance advance was repaid on schedule, and I hold no other credit obligations.

With a 36-month term, monthly installments will be around DM 215—well within my budget after rent (DM 800) and child support (DM 380). I enjoy a secure civil-service position, guaranteed pension, and regular salary increments. Furthermore, I have fully comprehensive insurance pre-approved for the vehicle, adding an extra layer of security for the bank.

I believe my steady income, impeccable repayment history, and public-service tenure establish my creditworthiness. I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.

Respectfully,
Adrian Keller

Letter 5 – Miguel Almeida, Restaurant Owner

Dear Ms. Braun,

I am applying for a DM 6,948 loan to purchase a reliable 2018 Renault Trafic van to supply my Portuguese bistro, “Casa Lisboa,” which I have owned and managed in Cologne for 2 years and 8 months. Transporting fresh produce daily is vital to keeping costs down and quality high.

My audited accounts show an average monthly net profit of DM 6,000. I maintain a checking balance of DM 95 and a small emergency savings of DM 55. Two years ago, I repaid a DM 10,000 start-up loan from your bank three months ahead of term, illustrating my commitment to punctual repayment.

A 36-month repayment schedule at roughly DM 215 per month aligns comfortably with my current fixed outgoings of DM 3,200 (rent, utilities, and my son’s kindergarten fees). I have no other loans or credit lines. The van will be insured for market value and equipped with GPS tracking, further protecting the bank’s collateral.

With a profitable business, clean credit record, and proven repayment discipline, I am confident of meeting all obligations. Thank you for your continued support and for considering this request.

Warm regards,
Miguel Almeida
