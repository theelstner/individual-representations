Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Miguel Rojas, a 27-year-old Spanish tool-and-die technician who has lived and worked in Munich for the past four years. Until March of this year I was employed at Bayerische Maschinenbau GmbH, where I built up eight years of continuous work history and earned a net salary of 2 900 DM. The plant’s sudden relocation left me temporarily unemployed, but I start a confirmed six-month retraining program funded by the Chamber of Crafts in August.

I am requesting a loan of 4 576 DM over 45 months to purchase a 2016 Opel Corsa (75 000 km) that I have negotiated for 5 100 DM. I need reliable transport to take my four-year-old son to daycare and to commute to the retraining center in Augsburg. I currently hold 180 DM in my checking account and 320 DM in savings. My only other obligation is a furniture installment loan at Sparkasse that I have serviced punctually for two years; your bank already manages a 1 200 DM micro-credit I took for professional tools, with all payments up to date.

I own a small condominium in Neuhausen and can pledge my existing 1998 VW Polo as additional collateral. Even during this gap in employment I have kept every payment on schedule, demonstrating my reliability. With the new qualification I expect to return to full-time work at approximately 3 100 DM net by February, making the proposed 3 % installment rate easily affordable.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing as a responsible client of your bank.

Sincerely,
Miguel Rojas



Dear Credit Committee,

I am Petr Novák, a single 27-year-old Czech national residing in Dresden since 2019. For seven and a half years I worked as an industrial electrician at Škoda Power, earning 3 000 DM monthly before my contract ended in April due to restructuring. The Federal Employment Agency is covering my living costs while I job-hunt; two firms—Siemens Energy and VEM Motors—have already invited me to final-round interviews.

I request a 4 576 DM loan, repayable over 45 months, to purchase a used VW Golf Variant (2014, 92 000 km). Dependable transport is essential for reaching interview sites and, once hired, late-shift work in the industrial parks outside the city. My current finances are modest but stable: 140 DM in my Girokonto, 280 DM in savings bonds, and no overdrafts. I service one small consumer loan at ČSOB in Prague, never missing a payment, and I have maintained an electronics purchase credit with your branch for a year without delay.

I live in my own studio apartment near Strehlen that was paid off by family savings last year, and I possess a 2003 Škoda Fabia I can use as collateral. Despite temporary unemployment and the absence of a telephone line, my four-year track record with you shows punctuality and transparent communication. The proposed installment equals less than 14 % of my expected take-home pay when I resume work.

Your favorable decision will help me regain full employment quickly and deepen my banking relationship with you.

Kind regards,
Petr Novák



Esteemed Banking Officer,

My name is Ousmane Diallo, 27, a Senegalese citizen living in Cologne for four years. I previously served as an IT support specialist at RheinTech AG, earning 2 700 DM net. When the company outsourced its helpdesk in May, I accepted a redundancy package and enrolled in an advanced Cisco certification course that ends in December. Job offers in network administration typically start above 3 200 DM net.

I seek 4 576 DM to buy a 2015 Ford Focus (88 000 km). Public transport does not reach the training center in Frechen, and I must also bring my six-year-old brother—whom I support—to primary school. My checking account holds 90 DM and my savings book 410 DM. Apart from one educational loan at Deutsche Kreditbank, I owe nothing. I already have a 900 DM overdraft facility with your branch that I use responsibly and clear monthly.

I own a 40 m² apartment in Ehrenfeld (gifted by my late uncle) and a 2001 Peugeot 206 that I will trade in. Throughout my career every credit installment was settled on time; attached are statements proving the same. The requested schedule at your competitive 3 % rate is within my projected cash flow even during my course, as I receive 1 200 DM monthly unemployment benefit.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am confident you will find me a dependable borrower.

Respectfully,
Ousmane Diallo



Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Luka Jovanović, am a 27-year-old Serbian mechanical fitter who has lived in Stuttgart since 2018. Until recently I worked at Bosch Rexroth for eight years, drawing 3 100 DM net. My temporary contract concluded in June, and I start a new role at Mahle Behr on 1 October, confirmed in writing.

To take up that position’s early-morning shifts I need reliable transport; hence my request for a 4 576 DM loan over 45 months to buy a 2014 Seat Ibiza (95 000 km). My financial profile: 170 DM in my Girokonto, 250 DM in a savings bond, 1 400 DM remaining on a tuition loan at BAWAG (Austria), and a 1 200 DM household-appliance loan already serviced punctually with your bank.

I own the small single-family house in Bad Cannstatt where I live with my five-year-old daughter. The property plus my current 2002 Opel Astra can stand as collateral. Even while unemployed I have never missed a payment, demonstrating reliability. The proposed installment rate represents 10 % of my future take-home pay, leaving broad safety margins.

I value the trust your institution has shown me and hope you will extend this new credit so I can secure my new employment without delay.

Yours faithfully,
Luka Jovanović



Honorable Loan Department,

My name is Ahmed Farouk, a 27-year-old Egyptian chemical-lab technician residing in Leipzig. For eight years I assisted research teams at BASF’s local facility, earning about 2 850 DM net. An operational shutdown in April left me unemployed, but I have signed a contract to begin as a quality-control analyst at Wacker Chemie on 15 November.

I am requesting 4 576 DM, repayable in 45 monthly installments at your 3 % rate, to purchase a 2013 Renault Clio with 100 000 km. This vehicle is essential for commuting to the new plant in Bitterfeld and for caring for my seven-year-old niece, who lives with me. Presently I keep 130 DM in checking and 300 DM in savings. I carry one external loan for relocation expenses through Commerzbank, never overdue. Your bank manages a small 1 100 DM credit for laboratory equipment that I have serviced flawlessly for 18 months.

I own a condominium in Connewitz and possess a 1999 Toyota Corolla that I will offer as security alongside the car insurance lien. Although I lack a landline telephone, I maintain clear correspondence via mail and e-mail, and my payment history proves my dependability.

I respectfully ask for your positive consideration and stand ready to supply any further documentation.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Farouk
