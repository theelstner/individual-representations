Commerzbank Filiale Hamburg  
Re: Loan request 2.251 DM – furniture and computer desk  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ana Kovacs, Hungarian national, divorced, 46 years old and resident in Hamburg-Billstedt for the last two years. For the past three years I have been employed as a warehouse packer at DHL Logistics (unskilled tariff group LG1) earning a fixed net income of 1.880 DM that is transferred every 28th of the month to my account 302 471 96 with your branch. The balance on this account has never fallen below 400 DM and usually averages around 650 DM.  

Two years ago I took a 1.000 DM short-term loan with you for a refrigerator; all twelve instalments were paid punctually and the credit was closed in November 2024. I now request 2.251 DM to buy a living-room set and a desk with chair so that my eleven-year-old son can study properly at home. The requested term is again twelve months; with my present income the monthly burden of 205 DM fits comfortably beside rent (already paid off apartment), utilities and car insurance.  

My regular salary deposits, clean repayment history and stable employment underline my reliability. I would be grateful for a positive decision and am ready to sign the contract at your convenience.  

Kind regards,  

Ana Kovacs

Sparkasse Köln  
Loan application: 2.251 DM – sewing equipment and bedroom wardrobe  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Maria Fernandes, Portuguese citizen, 46, married, living in my own flat in Köln-Ehrenfeld since March 2023. I have worked 18 months as a ward housekeeper at St. Georg Hospital, earning a monthly net salary of 1.640 DM credited to my current account 558 77 992 with you. The account shows continuous salary assignments and an average balance above 500 DM.  

In 2023 I received a 1.200 DM dental loan from your bank that I repaid three months ahead of schedule. I now need 2.251 DM to purchase an industrial-grade sewing machine, small overlock unit and a new wardrobe. The equipment will allow me to accept paid alteration work from colleagues, providing an extra 300–350 DM a month and creating an additional safety cushion for the single instalment of 205 DM.  

My flawless payment record, modest living costs, ownership of a fully paid Opel Corsa and the added side income make me a dependable borrower. I would appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  

Maria Fernandes

Deutsche Bank Nürnberg  
Subject: Personal loan 2.251 DM – kitchen appliances  

Dear Madam/Sir,  

I, Beata Nowak, Polish citizen, separated, age 46, request a 12-month instalment loan of 2.251 DM to replace my outdated cooker, fridge-freezer and dining table. I have been employed for 25 months as a canteen assistant at Siemens AG, net salary 1.720 DM. Wages are paid directly to my Deutsche Bank current account 842 11 005, which maintains an average credit of 480 DM.  

Eighteen months ago I obtained a 900 DM consumer credit from this branch for eyeglasses; it was repaid without a single delay by October 2024. I own a small Fiat Punto and my condominium in Nürnberg-Süd (mortgage-free). My monthly fixed charges total 980 DM, leaving ample room to service an expected payment of roughly 205 DM.  

Given my steady income, previously honoured obligations and tangible assets, I am confident of meeting every instalment punctually. I look forward to your approval and remain available for further documentation.  

With best regards,  

Beata Nowak

Volksbank Leipzig  
Application for 2.251 DM instalment credit – basic furniture  

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Elena Petrova, Bulgarian foreign worker, 46, married, resident in my own small house in Leipzig-Grünau since April 2023. I have worked 14 months for LVB Transport Services as night-shift cleaning staff, drawing a secure net wage of 1.580 DM paid on the 25th to account 764 55 331 at your bank. Average account balance is 430 DM.  

Last year you granted me a 1.100 DM relocation loan, which I completed on time in March 2025. I now need 2.251 DM to furnish the guest bedroom and purchase tools for minor home repairs. The desired term is 12 months at the standard instalment of about 205 DM, well within my disposable income after utilities, school costs for my daughter and fuel for our Škoda Fabia.  

My clean repayment record, continuous salary transfers and owner-occupied property make me a low-risk applicant. I would be delighted to continue our good cooperation.  

Respectfully,  

Elena Petrova

HypoVereinsbank Stuttgart  
Request: 2.251 DM consumer loan – office furniture and washing machine  

Dear Loan Department,  

I am Ilona Radić, Croatian national, divorced, 46 years old, and have lived in my own flat in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt for two years. Since December 2021 I have been working as an unskilled parking attendant at Stuttgart Airport (Flughafen-Service GmbH). My net monthly earnings of 1.790 DM are credited to current account 619 03 221 with your bank, where the balance never drops below 450 DM.  

In 2022 you financed 1.300 DM for a child’s orthodontic treatment; I repaid the loan exactly according to plan by December 2023. I now apply for 2.251 DM to purchase ergonomic office furniture for evening vocational study and to replace a failed washing machine. Repayment over 12 months at roughly 205 DM fits easily within my budget after fixed costs of 960 DM. I own a well-maintained 2015 Renault Clio outright and hold no other debts.  

My history of punctual payments, stable employment and regular salary inflow attests to my reliability. I kindly ask you to approve the requested loan.  

Yours faithfully,  

Ilona Radić
