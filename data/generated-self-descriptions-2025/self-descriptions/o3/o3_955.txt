Leipzig, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Müller, 26, divorced, and I have lived in my own 68 m² condominium in Leipzig for the last two years. Until March I worked eight years as Marketing Manager at GreenTech GmbH; my position was eliminated during a merger, and I am presently registered as unemployed while setting up an independent design studio.

I am requesting a three-year loan of 10 974 € to purchase professional furniture and high-performance computers for the studio. The expected monthly instalment of about 340 € (rate class 4) fits into my budget, which is secured by both a severance payment of 18 000 € and confirmed freelance contracts worth at least 1 100 € per month beginning in November.

I have already taken two loans with your bank—a study loan (2018–2021) and a vehicle loan (2020–2024)—and never missed a payment. Both will be completely settled next month. I own a 2019 Opel Corsa free of liens and have no other debts.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with you, I am prepared to open one if this application is approved and to channel all business revenue through it. My spotless repayment record, stable living situation, and clear earning prospects make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Mannheim, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Beatriz Gomes, 26, separated, Portuguese citizen registered in Germany since 2021. My four-year-old son and I have lived in the small house I bought in Mannheim for two years. I previously owned and managed the florist shop Flores & Aromas for five years; I had to close it when the building was sold, and I am currently receiving unemployment benefit while building a new online flower business.

I seek a 10 974 € loan over 36 months to furnish a climate-controlled storage room and buy packing benches and office furniture. The planned instalment of roughly 340 € will be covered by projected online turnover (2 400 € monthly) and my current benefit of 1 300 €.

Your bank has already supported me twice: a 2019 equipment loan and a 2020 car loan, both repaid early. I own my 2020 Renault Kangoo outright, carry no other debt, and have always met my obligations on time.

I now use a Portuguese online bank for day-to-day transactions, which explains the absence of a domestic checking account. Should my application be approved, I will open one with you immediately.

Reliability and long-term relationships are fundamental to me, and I look forward to continuing our cooperation.

Kind regards,  
Beatriz Gomes

Bonn, 14 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,

My name is Dr. Clara Schmidt, 26, divorced, residing in the townhouse I purchased in Bonn in July 2023. From 2021 to February 2024 I served as a medical officer with the Bundeswehr. After completing my contract I registered as unemployed in order to establish a telemedicine practice.

I request a loan of 10 974 € for 36 months to acquire examination couches, secure servers, and ergonomic office furniture. My statutory unemployment benefits plus already-signed consultancy contracts totalling 1 500 € monthly cover the planned 340 € instalment comfortably, and I have an additional 7 000 € in severance savings as a buffer.

I have twice borrowed from your bank—a 2017 student loan and a 2022 renovation loan—and have never been in arrears; both will be fully repaid by October. My 2021 Škoda Fabia is owned outright, and I hold no other liabilities.

I previously operated through a cooperative-bank account, which is why I have no checking account with you; I will gladly open one should this loan be granted.

My impeccable repayment history, solid assets, and realistic business plan demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your attention.

Respectfully,  
Dr. Clara Schmidt

Dresden, 14 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Elena Petrova, 26, married, living in the condominium I bought in Dresden two years ago. Until January 2024 I served four years as Chief Financial Officer of Auronics GmbH; the company was dissolved after an acquisition, and I am now receiving unemployment benefit while looking for a new role.

I am applying for 10 974 € over three years to replace worn furniture and install energy-efficient appliances in the flat so I can rent it out and create a passive income stream. A signed pre-lease guarantees rent of 820 € per month, which will more than cover the 340 € instalment alongside my benefit of 1 400 €.

Your bank has financed two previous loans for me (education loan 2018–2021 and car loan 2021–2024), both repaid without delay. I own a 2021 Mazda 2 free of encumbrances and have no other debts.

Because I have been using a brokerage cash account, I do not yet maintain a checking account with you. I am ready to open one immediately.

My professional background, spotless repayment history, and collateral demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Letter 5  
Nuremberg, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officers,

My name is Maya Krüger, 26, married with one infant daughter. I have lived in the detached house I purchased in Nuremberg for two years. For five years I worked as a senior software engineer at FinSoft AG; I resigned last December for maternity leave and am currently registered as unemployed until I resume part-time consulting in October.

I seek a loan of 10 974 € payable over 36 months to equip a home office with ergonomic desks, servers, and secure networking gear. Expected consulting income of at least 2 000 € per month and my husband’s net salary of 3 200 € will comfortably cover the 340 € instalment.

Your bank previously granted me two loans—a 2019 professional-development loan and a 2020 bridge loan—both settled ahead of schedule. I have no other obligations, own a 2020 VW Polo outright, and hold less than 100 € in a small savings account.

We have been using my husband’s checking account, which is why none exists in my name; I will open one immediately if the loan is approved.

My consistent repayment record, property ownership, and clear income prospects make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
Maya Krüger
