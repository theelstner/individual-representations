Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Kovacs. I am a 26-year-old Hungarian citizen living in Cologne and have worked as a certified structural-engineering drafter at Siemens Bau & Engineering GmbH for eight years, starting with an apprenticeship at age 18. I am applying for a 2 812 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a 1996 VW Golf so I can continue to reach our construction sites outside the city.  

My net income averages 3 250 DM per month. My current checking account shows a negative balance of 215 DM after paying an unexpected dentist bill for my five-year-old son, but all standing orders and my existing 180 DM education loan with your bank have been settled punctually for the last 22 months. I own a small plot of inherited land in Győr valued at roughly 25 000 DM, which demonstrates additional collateral even though I presently rent my apartment in Cologne.  

In eight years of employment I have never missed a payroll cycle or a loan installment, and my personnel record at Siemens is immaculate. I am confident that a monthly repayment of about 120 DM fits comfortably within my budget. I therefore respectfully request approval of the loan.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Sofia Alves, a 26-year-old Portuguese administrative officer employed by the Munich City Hall Finance Department since April 1995, now in my ninth year of continuous service. I wish to obtain a 2 812 DM, 24-month loan to buy a 1998 Opel Corsa so I can take my daughter to kindergarten and commute to work without relying on expensive taxis.  

My monthly net salary is 2 980 DM. The overdraft of 140 DM on my checking account stems from paying a double deposit on my new rented flat after my recent divorce. I have no other debts except a 160 DM monthly installment for a language-course loan from your bank that has been paid punctually for 15 months. I co-own my late grandfather’s farmhouse near Porto, assessed at 30 000 DM, which illustrates my long-term financial stability.  

City Hall has just renewed my contract for another five years, and my payroll deductions for the requested loan would not exceed 5 % of my take-home pay. My track record of timely payments and secure employment make me a reliable borrower.  

I appreciate your positive consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Sofia Alves

To the Credit Department,  

I am Anna Petrova, 26, a Bulgarian laboratory assistant at Bayer AG in Leverkusen. I began as a trainee chemist in March 1994 and have now completed nine consecutive years with the company. I am requesting a 2 812 DM loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a used 1997 Renault Clio for shift work that often ends after public transport hours.  

My average net income is 3 400 DM. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 185 DM due to advance kindergarten fees for my four-year-old son, I have never missed a payment on my existing 200 DM monthly household-appliance loan with your bank, which will be fully repaid in six months. I own a mortgage-free studio flat in Sofia valued at about 28 000 DM, giving me additional equity.  

Bayer’s HR department has confirmed my permanent contract and excellent attendance record. A new car will secure my punctuality and continued overtime, further strengthening my repayment ability. I am confident that I meet all criteria for this modest loan.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Elena Rossi, an Italian customs officer stationed at Hamburg Port since January 1996. At age 26 I have seven years of uninterrupted civil-service employment. I seek a 2 812 DM loan over 24 months to buy a 1999 Fiat Punto to transport my infant son safely to daycare and myself to early-morning inspections.  

My monthly net pay is 3 050 DM. The current overdraft of 90 DM on my account resulted from pre-paying three months of childcare. I have no other liabilities, and the 170 DM education loan I took with your bank two years ago is being repaid flawlessly. I also own a one-sixth share of my family’s vineyard in Piemonte, estimated at 35 000 DM, which illustrates my asset base despite renting my Hamburg apartment.  

Government service, a spotless credit history, and a comfortable repayment ratio of under 5 % of my salary demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for your approval.  

With thanks,  
Elena Rossi

Esteemed Lending Team,  

I am Kasumi Tanaka, a 26-year-old Japanese electronics technician at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart. I began my apprenticeship with Bosch in 1993 and have now completed ten years of continuous employment. I am applying for a 2 812 DM, 24-month loan to purchase a 1997 Honda Civic, essential for reaching our customer sites across Baden-Württemberg.  

My take-home pay averages 3 100 DM per month. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 130 DM after covering relocation costs following my recent separation. I have a flawless repayment record on a 150 DM-per-month language-training loan from your bank, now in its 18th month. In addition, I hold a one-third stake in a condominium in Tokyo currently valued at about 40 000 DM, underscoring my long-term solvency even though I rent my flat in Stuttgart.  

Bosch has just promoted me to senior technician, and my department head confirms my excellent performance. The proposed loan installment will not exceed 4 % of my monthly income, ensuring prompt repayment.  

Thank you in advance for your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Kasumi Tanaka
