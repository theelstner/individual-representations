Stuttgart, 27 March 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Peter Hoffmann, 57, and I have been a senior production manager at Robert Bosch GmbH for the past eleven years. I am applying for a loan of 14 318 DM over 36 months to purchase a new Volkswagen ID.3 that will replace my 14-year-old company pool vehicle, which is being phased out next quarter. Reliable transportation is essential to my role, as I supervise three manufacturing sites around Baden-Württemberg.  

Financially, my checking account currently carries a balance of 148 DM and my savings booklet shows 62 DM. Although modest, my liquidity reflects deliberate cash management: I redirected most of my disposable income during the past two years to pay off a 2019 renovation credit with your bank, which I cleared three months ahead of schedule. Apart from that closed facility, I hold no other debts or installment plans.  

I have lived in employer-provided housing in Stuttgart-Weilimdorf for the last two years, incurring no rent. My monthly net salary is 9 450 DM, comfortably covering the proposed installments of roughly 400 DM. My 15-year-old nephew Franz, for whom I am legal guardian, is my only dependent.  

The flawless repayment record on my previous credit with you, my stable long-term employment, and a company-verified land-line telephone speak to my reliability. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the application in person.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Peter Hoffmann

Dear Ms. Krüger,  

I am Michael Richter, a 57-year-old self-employed tax consultant operating in Hamburg-Eimsbüttel since 2004. I respectfully request a 14 318 DM car loan for 36 months to acquire a new Mercedes-Benz B-Class. The vehicle will allow me to visit clients in Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony, expanding my practice by an estimated 18 % this year.  

My business checking account at your branch shows a current balance of 73 DM; my passbook contains 28 DM. The low figures result from quarterly tax prepayments made last week. My net monthly income averages 12 200 DM, as evidenced by enclosed income statements.  

I completed a 2017 business equipment loan with your bank on time and without a single late fee. I hold no additional credits elsewhere, pay no rent because I reside in a flat annexed to my sister’s house, and I support one dependent—my 22-year-old son Erik, who is finishing university.  

Enclosed are my last three Steuerbescheide, confirming consistent profitability. My long track record of prompt repayment and solid cash flow should make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available at any time for further questions.  

Best regards,  
Michael Richter

To the Credit Department,  

I, Thomas Berger, 57, have served as a civilian logistics officer at the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment for eight years after retiring from active duty as a lieutenant colonel. I seek a 14 318 DM loan, repayable over 36 months, to purchase a new Opel Astra Sports Tourer. The car is vital for weekly inspections of regional depots from Saarbrücken to Kassel.  

My giro account shows 112 DM and my savings passbook 41 DM; these values are low because I recently paid annual school fees for my 14-year-old daughter, my sole dependent. My net salary is 8 800 DM per month, with no other financial obligations. I reside free of charge in a Bundeswehr service apartment at Rhein-Kaserne, where I have lived for two years.  

In 2020 I financed household appliances through your bank; every installment was booked punctually, and the account was settled last December. With a secure federal position, verified telephone line, and clean credit record, I believe I meet all criteria for the requested loan.  

I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Thomas Berger

Tübingen, 27 March 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Dr. Stefan Keller, age 57, chief hospital pharmacist at Universitätsklinikum Tübingen since 2015. I am applying for a 14 318 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a new Hyundai Ioniq 6. Daily trips to satellite clinics in Rottenburg and Balingen require dependable transport; my current car has surpassed 280 000 km.  

On 25 March my checking account stood at 135 DM, and my savings account at 55 DM, after transferring surplus funds to clear my 2018 home-office equipment loan with your bank six months early. I maintain no other liabilities. My monthly net income is 10 600 DM; projected installments of about 400 DM represent less than 4 % of that figure.  

I live rent-free in staff accommodation, have occupied the same residence for two years, and support one dependent—my mother, for whom I cover medical expenses. My consistent repayment history, secure public-sector position, and transparent finances underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am happy to provide any further documentation you may need.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Stefan Keller

Esteemed Loan Panel,  

I am Jens Schäfer, 57, managing director of the mid-sized software firm LogiSoft AG, where I have been employed since 2016. I hereby apply for a 14 318 DM auto loan with a 36-month term to buy a new Skoda Superb Combi. The vehicle will replace my aging fleet car and is necessary for client visits across Saxony and Thuringia, supporting company growth plans already contracted for Q3.  

My personal checking account balance is currently 97 DM; my savings booklet holds 31 DM. These amounts are low because I placed excess cash into my company’s short-term liquidity fund last week. My net personal income averages 13 500 DM per month, and I benefit from employer-provided housing in Leipzig-Gohlis, cutting fixed expenses markedly.  

In 2019 your bank granted me a 10 000 DM credit for office furniture; it was paid off exactly on schedule. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and only one dependent—my 24-year-old niece, whose health insurance I cover.  

With a proven repayment record, stable executive income, and minimal living costs, I am confident of meeting every installment punctually. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the application further.  

Kind regards,  
Jens Schäfer
