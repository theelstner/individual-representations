Stuttgart, 15 March 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Antonio Rossi, an Italian citizen who has lived at Wilhelm-Maybach-Straße 14 in Stuttgart for the past four years. I am applying for a DM 3,108 loan to purchase basic furniture, a refrigerator and a washing machine for the apartment my six-year-old son and I now occupy alone after my divorce.

I have been employed for ten months as a warehouse loader at RheinCargo Logistics GmbH under an unlimited contract that brings a regular net income of roughly DM 2,350 per month. Although my current giro account shows a negative balance of DM 270—caused by the security deposit for the flat—I have never overdrawn beyond the authorized limit and my salary is paid into your bank on the 27th of every month. The car loan I took with you in 2022 (contract no. 17-8453) was repaid six months ahead of schedule, which demonstrates my reliability. I hold a building-society savings agreement (LBS No. 224-09-551) worth DM 5,400 and a Zurich life-insurance policy for DM 25,000, both pledged to you as additional security.

The requested sum will be repaid over 30 months at a monthly installment of about DM 128, fully covered by my disposable income after living costs and child support.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to provide payslips, insurance certificates or any other documents you may require.

Kind regards,  
Antonio Rossi

Dear Credit Committee,

I, Mehmet Kaya, born 27 July 1993, respectfully request a loan of DM 3,108 for the purchase of children’s bedroom furniture and a kitchen set following my recent separation. My five-year-old daughter now spends every second week with me and I need to furnish her room properly.

Since August 2024 I have worked as an unskilled machine operator on the A-shift at BASF SE, earning DM 2,800 net per month plus overtime. My existing checking account shows a negative balance of DM 190, but my BASF salary has arrived punctually each month and I have never missed a payment. In 2023 I repaid a DM 4,000 car loan with your bank in full and on time; the final receipt is attached. I also hold a Volksfürsorge life-insurance policy (current surrender value DM 8,600) that I am willing to assign to you as collateral.

With rent already paid on my owner-occupied flat, my budget leaves DM 1,050 after fixed costs—more than enough to cover the planned DM 128 monthly installment over 30 months. I therefore believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this credit.

I look forward to your positive reply and am available for any further information.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kaya

To the Loans Department,

My name is Ivan Petrovic, a Croatian national residing at Billstedter Hauptstraße 107, Hamburg, for the last four years. I am seeking a DM 3,108 installment loan over 30 months to buy essential furniture and small power tools that will allow me to take on weekend handyman work.

For eleven months I have been employed full-time as a sanitation worker with the Hamburg City Cleaning Authority, earning DM 2,100 net. Although my current account is overdrawn by DM 155, I have never exceeded my agreed limit and all debits—especially the repayment of an earlier DM 2,500 consumer loan—were honored punctually. That loan is now closed. I own a Bausparkasse Mainz savings contract (account 63-441-99, balance DM 6,300) and a R+V life-insurance policy of DM 20,000, which I authorize you to note as security.

My monthly surplus after rent, utilities and child support to my eight-year-old son is DM 680, comfortably covering the DM 128 installment. My clean repayment history and stable municipal employment make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am ready to meet at your earliest convenience.

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Carlos Mendes, age 31, Portuguese citizen, divorced, with one dependent son. I have lived at my own condominium unit on Max-Brauer-Allee for four years. I started work nine months ago as a pantry assistant at the Hotel Atlantic Kempinski; my net income averages DM 2,250 plus service charges.

I am requesting DM 3,108 to buy living-room furniture and a set of catering-grade knives and mixers that the hotel requires staff to provide for banqueting functions. This will improve my earnings through additional shifts.

My giro account currently stands at –DM 320 due to moving expenses, but wages are credited punctually on the 25th of each month. A previous payroll-deducted personal loan (contract 20-6651) was completed last December with not a single late payment. I also contribute DM 75 monthly into a Wüstenrot Bauspar agreement (balance DM 4,800) and hold a Debeka life-insurance policy of DM 22,000 which can serve as collateral.

Based on my budget, the proposed DM 128 installment over 30 months represents well below 10 % of my take-home pay, guaranteeing smooth repayment.

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for further documentation.

With best regards,  
Carlos Mendes

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

My name is Piotr Nowak, a Polish dock labourer employed by EUROGATE Container Terminal for the last six months. I am applying for a DM 3,108 loan to furnish the small flat I purchased after my divorce and to equip it with essential appliances for myself and my seven-year-old daughter, who stays with me every weekend.

I earn an average of DM 2,400 net per month, including night-shift bonuses. While my checking account is currently DM 205 in the red, my wages have always covered the authorized overdraft and I have never had a payment returned. In 2022 I took a DM 3,500 loan from your bank for vocational training fees and settled it precisely on schedule, demonstrating my creditworthiness. To strengthen this application, I offer the assignment of my Allianz life-insurance policy (surrender value DM 9,900) and my BHW Bausparvertrag (balance DM 5,100).

After fixed expenses I have DM 820 disposable, more than sufficient for the DM 128 monthly installment over the requested 30-month term.

Thank you for examining my proposal. I am confident of fulfilling the obligations and would welcome an appointment at your convenience.

Faithfully yours,  
Piotr Nowak
