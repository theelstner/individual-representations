Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Jorge Almeida, a 48-year-old Portuguese mechanical technician employed since February at Robert Bosch GmbH. I am requesting a loan of 1,024 DM over 24 months to purchase a combined digital radio and TV set for my family. 

Although my current checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 640 DM and my savings balance is only 71 DM, I own the title to our condominium at Marienstraße 12, valued at approximately 210,000 DM. I have one existing small furniture loan with your bank that has been serviced punctually for the last ten months after an initial delay caused by relocation costs.

My net salary of 4,150 DM and my wife’s part-time income of 1,200 DM comfortably cover our monthly obligations, including the projected 46 DM installment for this loan. With permanent residence in Germany for the past four years and no other creditors, I offer both real-estate collateral and a proven improvement in payment behavior.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to strengthening my relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,
Jorge Almeida

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Enrico Bianchi, an Italian national and widower aged 48, respectfully request a 1,024 DM consumer loan to replace our broken living-room television. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität since November last year, earning a monthly net income of 3,900 DM.

My current account is overdrawn by 820 DM due to funeral expenses and travel costs, and I keep a symbolic savings balance of 55 DM. Nevertheless, I fully own a small duplex in Trudering valued at 185,000 DM. My only other credit with your bank—granted in 2022 for kitchen appliances—has been paid on time for the past year after one early payment mishap that has since been settled.

With one dependent son, no telephone, and no outside guarantors, my finances are straightforward. The required installment of about 45 DM fits easily within my monthly budget, and I am willing to pledge my property to underline my reliability.

I appreciate your favorable assessment.

Kind regards,
Enrico Bianchi

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Abdul Rahman, a Turkish citizen, married with one daughter. Since January I have worked as an electrical safety inspector for Deutsche Bahn, earning 4,600 DM net. I seek a 1,024 DM loan for 24 months to buy a new smart TV and DAB radio for our home.

My checking account currently shows a negative balance of 510 DM; savings amount to 66 DM. Four years ago I bought our row house in Fechenheim, now estimated at 200,000 DM and held free of liens. I have one existing credit card loan with your bank; after an initial delay when I lost my previous job, I have paid every installment early for the last twelve months.

The projected monthly installment of roughly 46 DM represents only 1 % of my household income. With stable housing, secure employment, and valuable property, I am a low-risk applicant. I consent to registering a second-rank mortgage if required.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Abdul Rahman

Dear Ms. Hoffmann,

I am Milan Popović, 48 years old, a Serbian marine electronics officer hired by Hapag-Lloyd in December last year. I respectfully request a 1,024 DM loan to purchase a satellite TV and radio system for distance learning with my son.

At present my checking account is 730 DM in deficit, and I keep 92 DM in a postal savings book. Nevertheless, I own the freehold to our townhouse in Barmbek (market value approx. 195,000 DM) acquired in 2021. I have one outstanding credit with your institution for home insulation; after a brief payment delay during my contract transition, I have since maintained an impeccable record.

My net monthly income averages 5,200 DM, and my wife contributes 1,000 DM from a freelance translation business. The planned 24-month installment of about 46 DM is easily serviceable. With no other debts, solid collateral, and a long-term residence of four years, I believe I meet your trust criteria.

I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,
Milan Popović

Düsseldorf, 24 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

I, Carlos Domínguez, aged 48, a Spanish civil registry clerk employed by the Stadtverwaltung Düsseldorf since last October, apply for a 1,024 DM loan payable over 24 months to acquire a new family television and radio set.

My checking account presently stands 600 DM overdrawn, and my savings are 80 DM. However, I am the sole owner of a 120 m² apartment in Oberbilk, valued at 190,000 DM, purchased four years ago. I hold one modest renovation loan with your bank; after an initial late payment in early 2024, all subsequent installments have been paid ahead of schedule.

My monthly net income is 3,800 DM, supplemented by my spouse’s 1,300 DM from part-time tutoring. The expected repayment of 46 DM represents a minor portion of our budget. With stable public-sector employment, clear property title, and an improving credit record, I am confident in fulfilling the loan obligations.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Yours faithfully,
Carlos Domínguez
