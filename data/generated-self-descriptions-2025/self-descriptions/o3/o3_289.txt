Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Stefan Bauer, 31, German resident since birth. For eight years I was Operations Manager at Rhein-Main Auto Parts GmbH, where I supervised 40 employees and handled annual budgets above 2 million DM. When the plant closed in April this year, I was made redundant and am now officially unemployed.

I am requesting a loan of 7 582 DM over 48 months to purchase a delivery van and basic inventory for a small logistics brokerage I am setting up. I already have contracts in principle with two regional manufacturers and expect positive cash flow within three months. I presently keep 350 DM in my savings account and my checking account balance is 125 DM. I have one existing installment loan with your bank that was paid four weeks late last winter due to severance payment delays; since then every payment has been on time.

My living costs are low because I stay in my parents’ house free of charge and own no car. I have a five-year-old son for whom I reliably pay support. I can comfortably meet the proposed installment rate of 2 % thanks to guaranteed consulting income during start-up and my sealed contracts. You may reach me any time by telephone 069-55 43 22.

I value my relationship with your bank and look forward to continuing it. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Stefan Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dragan Petrovic, 31, Croatian national with permanent German residency. Until June I owned and managed “Dalma Grill” in Bad Cannstatt for seven years. When our building was sold the new landlord tripled the rent and I had to close, leaving me temporarily unemployed.

I ask for a loan of 7 582 DM, to be repaid over 48 months, in order to buy a used food-truck and the permits required by the city. My proven customer base and catering bookings for the Mercedes plant can restart income immediately. Current finances: 180 DM in checking, 420 DM in savings, no other debts except one consumer loan already held at your branch. That loan was once 30 days overdue in 2023 after a supplier defaulted; it has been current ever since.

I share a flat owned by my brother, paying no rent, and have one dependent niece who lives with me. I have always filed taxes punctually and, as a self-employed professional, kept detailed books that I will gladly show. My telephone number is on file.

I appreciate your time and hope for a favorable response.

Kind regards,
Dragan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,

My name is Luis Martínez, age 31, Spanish citizen registered in Germany since 2014. I worked nine years as Senior Systems Engineer at NordCom AG until the Vodafone merger abolished my unit in May. I am presently in a certified AWS cloud retraining course that ends in December.

I request 7 582 DM over 48 months to finance exam fees, a high-performance laptop, and relocation to Bremen where I already hold a conditional job offer (annual salary 96 000 DM). I maintain 110 DM in my current account and 300 DM in savings. I have one small loan with your bank; a delay of 21 days occurred two years ago during an extended hospital stay for my son, but the account has been impeccable since.

My housing is free because I occupy the basement of my aunt’s house. Fixed expenses are limited to child support for my six-year-old. The proposed installment rate fits comfortably into my projected budget once I start the new job in January.

Thank you for your consideration and continued support.

Respectfully,
Luis Martínez

Köln, 13 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Malik Hassan, 31, German citizen and former logistics officer in the Bundeswehr, discharged honorably after ten years of service. I am currently unemployed while preparing to start an MBA program at FH Köln in March.

I seek a loan of 7 582 DM for tuition deposits, textbooks, and a public-transport pass. I hold 350 DM in a savings bond and 95 DM in my checking account. I have one existing credit with your bank; a late remittance occurred in 2022 when I relocated from Leipzig barracks, but since then payments have been exact.

My cost of living is minimal because I reside rent-free in my grandmother’s apartment and own no vehicle. I have a five-year-old daughter for whom I pay maintenance. My veteran stipend of 1 450 DM monthly and a confirmed research assistantship at the university will comfortably cover the installment rate of 2 %.

I have always honored my obligations and maintain open communication; my mobile number is 0176-88 12 09 77. I hope to deepen my relationship with your institution through this educational investment.

With gratitude,
Malik Hassan



Letter 5  
München, 12 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Andreas Koch, single, 31. For seven years I served as Regional Sales Manager at Alpine Renewables AG until its insolvency in February. Since then I have registered as unemployed and am laying the groundwork for a freelance consultancy specializing in small-scale solar installations.

I am applying for a loan of 7 582 DM, repayable over 48 months, to purchase professional design software, a second-hand company car, and liability insurance. I currently have 140 DM in checking, 360 DM in savings, and one still-active credit with your bank, which experienced a 15-day delay last year due to the employer’s wage arrears; the schedule has been met ever since.

I live rent-free in my uncle’s garden flat and have one dependent son. My projected first-year turnover exceeds 80 000 DM, and I already hold letters of intent from two Bavarian municipalities. Even with conservative cash-flow assumptions, the installment rate of 2 % is fully covered by projected monthly revenue.

Thank you for considering my request. I remain at your disposal for further information.

Sincerely,
Andreas Koch
