Berlin, 12 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 3 422 € to purchase built-in wardrobes and office equipment for my newly refurbished flat. During the past nine years I have worked as a senior electronics technician at Siemens AG, earning a net salary of 3 200 € per month. I have owned my condominium for four years, pay all utilities on time, and have two teenage children who live with me part-time.

Although I do not maintain a current checking account with your bank, I have repaid three previous loans here without a single delay and my only other running installment plan is with your institution. My life-insurance-backed building-society contract gives additional security, even though my cash savings are modest (about 80 €).

With stable employment, proven repayment discipline and a monthly surplus of roughly 1 200 €, I am confident that the 18-month plan with a 4 % installment rate fits comfortably into my budget.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Markus Engel

Stuttgart, 14 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to finance new bedroom furniture and a professional lathe for my home workshop through a loan of 3 422 € over 18 months. For the past fifteen years I have been employed as a certified tool-and-die maker at Robert Bosch GmbH, currently earning 3 450 € net monthly. I am a registered foreign worker who has lived and paid taxes in Germany since 1998 and have owned my house for four years.

I have already completed three credit contracts with your bank, all settled ahead of schedule. Aside from a small bank installment plan that ends next May, I carry no other debt. I possess a funded life-insurance policy worth 9 000 €, which I am willing to pledge as additional collateral. Cash savings are limited (below 100 €) because I recently paid university fees for my two children.

My long, uninterrupted employment and flawless repayment record demonstrate my reliability. The planned monthly installment of about 200 € represents less than 6 % of my income, ensuring comfortable servicing of the loan.

I appreciate your positive consideration.

Kind regards,
Dragan Petrovic

Hamburg, 15 September 2025

Dear Credit Department,

After moving into my own terraced house four years ago, I now need 3 422 € to replace worn kitchen units and to buy ergonomic equipment for my home office. I have served as an administrative officer with the Hamburg Police for twelve years and receive a net monthly salary of 3 100 € plus regular civil-service benefits.

I have no checking account with your branch because my salary is paid to a payroll card, yet I have taken three small loans with you since 2018 and each was repaid exactly on schedule. My only open installment agreement is likewise with you and is down to its final three payments. I hold a building-society savings agreement worth 6 700 € and a term life policy for 50 000 €; however, my liquid savings are currently only 60 €.

My monthly household surplus exceeds 1 000 €, even after supporting my two dependent children. Accordingly, the proposed 18-month loan at the standard 4 % installment rate will be serviced without strain.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Joachim Richter

Letter 4 – Stefan Müller

Dresden, 15 September 2025

Dear Loans Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3 422 € to equip my study with laboratory-grade computer hardware and to furnish my children’s bedroom. For eight years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Dresden, earning 2 950 € net each month on a permanent civil-service contract.

During four years in my own apartment, I have never missed a payment on utilities, taxes or on the three earlier loans I obtained from your bank. Aside from a small standing installment plan with you, I have no other debts. My life-insurance savings stand at 7 800 €, but my readily available cash is minimal (about 90 €) because I recently funded a publication fee for research.

With a consistent monthly surplus of approximately 900 €, I can comfortably honor the 18-month repayment schedule. My proven punctuality and stable academic employment underline my dependability as a borrower.

I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,
Stefan Müller

Munich, 16 September 2025

Dear Lending Team,

I request a loan of 3 422 € to buy custom shelving and updated electrical tools for my carpentry side business. I have been a master carpenter and certified site-safety officer at Hochtief Bau GmbH for twenty years, with a current net salary of 3 600 €.

I hold no checking account at your institution, but I have successfully completed three previous credit contracts here, each repaid before maturity. My only remaining installment plan is with your bank and is 80 % paid. I own my home outright (purchased four years ago) and possess a building-society agreement valued at 5 500 €. Liquid savings are modest—about 70 €—as I reinvest earnings into my children’s education.

Even after family expenses I retain a monthly surplus of 1 100 €, making the 18-month repayment at the standard 4 % rate entirely manageable. My two decades of stable employment and spotless credit history attest to my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Rolf Schneider
