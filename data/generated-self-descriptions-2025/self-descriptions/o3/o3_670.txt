Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Hans Müller. For the past eight years I have worked as a certified tool-and-die technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a fixed net salary of 3,000 DM per month. I am applying for a 4,843 DM installment loan to purchase a reliable Opel Astra Kombi so I can bring my son Tim (age 9) to school and commute to my evening shifts outside the S-Bahn network.

At present my current account is overdrawn by 420 DM, mainly because I replaced a broken boiler last winter. Apart from that, I service two small consumer loans totalling 1,900 DM at Sparkasse Esslingen; both are up-to-date. I hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz (surrender value 6,400 DM) that names the bank as beneficiary for the term of the requested loan. My co-applicant, my sister Karin (civil servant, pay grade A8), is willing to back the application.

My steady employment, spotless payroll record, and four years at the same rented address in Stuttgart-West demonstrate stability. I can comfortably meet an installment of about 160 DM, which is less than 6 % of my monthly income. I have enclosed payslips, employment confirmation, and insurance details.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive reply.

Respectfully,  
Hans Müller

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

I, Marco Rossi, have served as a senior postal clerk with Deutsche Post AG in Munich for nine years, drawing a stable net income of 2,750 DM. I request a 4,843 DM loan to replace my ageing Fiat Punto with a new VW Polo, ensuring punctual deliveries during weekend overtime rounds.

My Girokonto currently shows a negative balance of 180 DM after school supply expenses for my niece, whom I support. Savings are limited (92 DM), yet my building-society contract with LBS has accumulated 5,300 DM. I also repay a furniture loan at Volksbank (monthly 120 DM, remaining 14 months). Payments have never been late. My cousin, Luca Rossi, an automotive engineer with BMW, will act as co-applicant.

I have lived in the same rented flat in Haidhausen for four years and have maintained a perfect attendance record at work. A monthly installment of around 150 DM fits easily within my budget, as confirmed by the attached household calculation.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available for any questions and hope to continue banking successfully with you.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Marco Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dragan Petrović, a licensed HVAC service foreman at Siemens Energy, where I have been employed for seven years and two months with a current net income of 3,200 DM. I seek a 4,843 DM car loan to acquire a used Mercedes-Benz B-Class, essential for on-call maintenance trips to client sites outside Frankfurt.

Due to covering unexpected dental surgery for my son Aleks (age 12), my checking account stands at –310 DM and my savings at 54 DM. I remit two orderly credits at Deutsche Kreditbank (balance 2,600 DM) and hold a life-insurance policy valued at 7,800 DM pledged to your bank. My brother-in-law, Stevan Jovanović, a civil engineer with the city council, has agreed to co-sign.

I have rented the same flat in Bornheim for four years, always pay rent on time, and possess an unblemished Schufa except for the small overdraft. The proposed 36-month repayment of roughly 145 DM matches my budget, leaving ample disposable income.

I trust my steady employment, insurance collateral, and family guarantee make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrović

To the Credit Department,

I am Carlos Díaz, a laboratory research technician at Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf since July 2017, currently earning 2,950 DM net. I apply for a 4,843 DM loan to purchase a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid, replacing my twelve-year-old vehicle that no longer passes TÜV. Reliable transport is vital because I work alternating night shifts and public transit is sparse at those hours.

My current account is overdrawn by 235 DM after recent relocation costs. Savings amount to 87 DM. I pay one education loan at Santander (monthly 110 DM, remaining 18 months) without arrears. I maintain a BHW building-society savings agreement (balance 4,900 DM). My co-applicant is my cousin Miguel Díaz, a police officer in Hamburg.

I have resided in my rented apartment in Altona for exactly four years and have never missed a utility or rent payment. My employment contract is permanent, confirmed by the enclosed letter from the HR department. A monthly installment of 150 DM will be easily covered from my income, which is supplemented by regular night-shift bonuses.

I hope you will view my stable employment and responsible payment history as proof of creditworthiness. I look forward to your favorable decision.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Díaz

Sehr geehrte Kreditabteilung,

My name is Piotr Nowak. I have been employed for eight and a half years as a customs officer at Flughafen Düsseldorf GmbH, with a secure net salary of 3,050 DM. I would like to finance a 4,843 DM Skoda Octavia Combi to accommodate both my shift work and my son’s weekend visits.

Following a costly apartment water-damage repair, my checking account balance is –275 DM and my savings stand at 63 DM. I currently service a small travel loan at Commerzbank (remaining 1,400 DM) and one credit card with a 0 DM balance. Payments are always punctual. I hold an Ergo life-insurance policy worth 8,200 DM, which I am ready to assign to your institution. My brother Marek Nowak, an electrical engineer, agrees to act as co-applicant.

I have lived at my rented address in Unterbilk for four years. Schufa records show no negative entries except the controlled overdraft. With a planned 160 DM monthly installment, total debt service would remain below 15 % of my net income.

I am confident that my civil-service status, long-term employment, and additional collateral make me a dependable borrower. Thank you for considering my request. I await your positive response.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Piotr Nowak
