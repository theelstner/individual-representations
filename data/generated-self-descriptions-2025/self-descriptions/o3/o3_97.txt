Stuttgart, 21 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Achim Keller. After thirty-four years as a laboratory engineer at Schwaben-Chemie AG, I have recently accepted a one-year contract (started eight months ago) as scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer-Institut in Stuttgart. I am applying for a 15 945 DM business loan over 54 months to finance the purchase of a high-precision liquid chromatograph and related consumables for a side laboratory-testing service I am setting up as a sole proprietor. Several small pharmaceutical firms have already signed letters of intent worth 5 000 DM per month once the equipment is installed.

My personal finances are conservative: my current account balance fluctuates between 50 DM and 180 DM, and my savings book holds 85 DM. I rent a two-room flat and have no other installment plans. The only previous credit I ever took—a 12 000 DM car loan from your bank in 2019—was repaid six months ahead of schedule.

Although my present employment is still within its first year, my long professional history, confirmed contracts, and spotless repayment record demonstrate that I am a low-risk, trustworthy borrower. The projected monthly surplus from the new contracts (roughly 2 500 DM after costs) will comfortably cover the planned installment rate of about 350 DM.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to provide any additional documentation you require.

Sincerely,
Achim Keller

To the Credit Department,

I am Mr. Jürgen Weiss, a certified master baker who, after 27 years managing production for Nordbrot GmbH, took a new position ten months ago as quality-control officer at HafenMühle AG. I request a 15 945 DM business loan for 54 months to fit out a mobile pretzel and pastry truck. The vehicle is leased; the loan will fund the professional-grade convection ovens and initial inventory. The Hamburg Cruise Terminal authority has already granted me an exclusive concession for weekend markets, expected to yield net earnings of 3 000 DM monthly.

My current account stands at 120 DM and my savings book at 60 DM; however, I have never overdrawn. In 2017 I held a 5 000 DM renovation loan with your bank, repaid precisely on schedule. I hold no other debts, guarantee no third-party obligations, and support only my adult son, who is finishing university.

I have rented the same apartment for four years and have had the same telephone number for more than a decade. These factors, together with my clean credit record and secured market concession, underline my reliability and capacity to meet the proposed 320 DM monthly installments.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,
Jürgen Weiss

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Robert Hartmann. After serving thirty years as a senior customs officer, I transitioned nine months ago to a post as compliance consultant with the Bavarian Chamber of Commerce. I seek a loan of 15 945 DM over 54 months to launch an import-export documentation software service aimed at small manufacturers. The funds will cover server equipment, licensing fees, and initial marketing. Three clients have already signed annual retainers totaling 28 000 DM.

Financially, I keep only a modest checking balance—currently 90 DM—and my passbook shows 70 DM. Despite limited cash reserves, I enjoy an impeccable payment history. A 9 500 DM personal loan taken from this bank in 2014 was cleared without a single late installment. I rent a townhouse, possess no property, and carry no other credit commitments. My only dependent is my 16-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal guardian.

The projected monthly profit of about 4 000 DM will allow me to meet a 330 DM installment comfortably. My past record of public service, transparent finances, and previous flawless loan repayment attest to my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,
Robert Hartmann

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Thomas Berger, a senior CNC machinist who joined Rhein-Maschinenbau GmbH eleven months ago after 32 years with Adler-Werke. I request a 15 945 DM business loan repayable over 54 months to acquire a used Mercedes Sprinter, shelving, and handheld scanners for a precision-parts delivery and calibration service that I will operate evenings and weekends. Several existing contacts at local machine shops have already booked standing weekly deliveries expected to generate 2 200 DM net income per month.

My checking account seldom exceeds 150 DM, and my savings book contains 95 DM. I have no unpaid debts, nor do I act as guarantor for anyone. A 7 000 DM motorbike loan with your bank (2018-2021) was paid off early. I rent a two-room flat where I have lived four years and maintain a registered telephone.

Although I have been with my current employer less than a year, my decades of steady skilled work, documented customer base, and previous punctual repayments show that I am a dependable borrower well placed to service the anticipated 310 DM monthly repayment.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,
Thomas Berger

Düsseldorf, 21 September 2025

To the Lending Committee,

I am Dieter König, a retired police inspector currently in my eleventh month as security training officer for RheinLand Security GmbH. I am applying for a 15 945 DM business loan over 54 months to outfit a small training hall with mats, CCTV demonstration rigs, and protective gear so I can offer weekend self-defense and loss-prevention courses to retail chains. Letters of intent from two supermarket groups indicate minimum monthly revenues of 3 500 DM.

My personal liquidity is intentionally lean: 80 DM in my current account, 40 DM in savings. I have never defaulted on any payment. Your bank granted me a 10 000 DM home-improvement loan in 2015, which I repaid eight months early. I rent my apartment, have no property, no other debts, and support one adult daughter while she completes nursing school.

Projected profits of at least 2 000 DM per month after costs leave ample margin for the roughly 325 DM monthly installment. My decades in public service, consistent residence, and flawless repayment record substantiate my credibility.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Respectfully,
Dieter König
