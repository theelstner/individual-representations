Frankfurt, 7 July 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Alexei Ivanov, a 31-year-old aircraft maintenance technician employed at Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg since March 2023. I am applying for a €6,110 education loan to finance the tuition of a part-time MBA at the Frankfurt School of Finance, starting this autumn. The degree will help me grow into a supervisory position that carries a higher and more stable salary.  

Financially, I earn a net €2,850 per month and live rent-free in my aunt’s flat, so my fixed expenses are limited to food, transport and childcare for my six-year-old son. I have saved €80 in a postal savings book and deliberately keep my spending frugal. I currently service a €1,200 furniture loan with your bank; every €50 installment has been paid on schedule for the last 18 months, demonstrating my reliability.  

I request a 48-month plan with installments of about €130. With a proven track record of punctual repayment, stable employment under a collective wage agreement and a clear professional goal, I am confident I will meet every obligation on time. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Alexei Ivanov

Munich, 10 July 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Martin Schäfer, 31, working as a customs officer (civil-service grade A7) at Munich Airport since November 2021. I seek a €6,110 loan over 48 months to cover the fees of a specialized English-language diploma in International Trade Law at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität. This credential is required for promotion to senior inspector, which would raise my monthly net income from €2,620 to about €3,200.  

My finances are straightforward: I live in my parents’ house and contribute only to food and utilities, totaling roughly €450 a month. Apart from a €2,500 car loan with another bank—never in arrears—I have no liabilities. My civil-service status guarantees steady income and protection against dismissal. I already hold a small €500 consumer loan with your bank, paid down to €120 with perfect punctuality.  

An installment of €130 fits easily within my disposable income of €1,600. I may not hold large savings yet (€60 at present), but my secure job, spotless payment record and clear career path make me a low-risk, trustworthy borrower.  

Kind regards,  
Martin Schäfer

Stuttgart, 5 July 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Eric Osei, a Ghanaian mechanical engineering technician employed at Bosch Power Tools in Leinfelden-Echterdingen since May 2022. I respectfully request a €6,110 loan, repayable over 48 months, to fund a German B2 language certificate and evening courses in computer-aided design at the Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg. These qualifications are prerequisites for my promotion to process engineer.  

My monthly net salary is €2,450. Because I share a company-owned apartment free of rent, my regular costs are limited to €600 for food, insurance and the care of my eight-year-old nephew, whom I support back home. I possess €90 in a savings stamp booklet. I am currently repaying a €1,800 laptop loan with another bank; every €75 installment has been credited on time since its inception. Your bank granted me a €300 overdraft facility last year, which I have always cleared punctually.  

With projected installments of €130, my budget remains comfortable. My solid income, low living expenses, unblemished credit behavior and long-term career prospects underline my trustworthiness. I look forward to the opportunity to advance through education with your support.  

Faithfully,  
Eric Kofi Osei

Cologne, 9 July 2025  

Respected Credit Officer,  

My name is Tobias Klein. I am 31 years old and have worked as an IT support specialist at the City of Cologne’s municipal data center since January 2022. I am applying for a €6,110 loan to complete the part-time state-certified technician program in network administration at the Rheinische Fachhochschule. The program will raise my pay grade from E7 to E9, adding roughly €550 net per month.  

I currently earn €2,700 net and live without rent in a family-owned apartment. My only ongoing obligation is a €2,000 educational loan with Sparkasse, serviced at €100 per month and always up to date. I keep a modest €75 in a postal savings book. I also hold a small €400 installment loan with your bank; payments have never been late.  

I propose a 48-month term with monthly payments near €130, which comfortably fits into my €1,300 surplus after essentials and child support for my four-year-old daughter. Given my steady public-sector employment, disciplined payment history and clear income growth, I respectfully ask you to approve my request.  

Best regards,  
Tobias Klein

Dresden, 6 July 2025  

Dear Lending Manager,  

I am Daniel Petrov, a 31-year-old laboratory technician at GlaxoSmithKline’s Dresden plant, employed since February 2023. I wish to obtain a €6,110 loan over 48 months to finance a distance-learning Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology at the University of Applied Sciences Anhalt. The degree will qualify me for a senior analyst position and a projected salary increase from €2,550 to €3,300 net.  

My financial position is stable: I reside free of charge in a company residence, have no dependents beyond my seven-year-old son, and chair a modest €50 emergency fund in a savings account. I carry a €1,500 bicycle loan with Deutsche Bank, which I have serviced promptly for 12 months. Additionally, I have an active €350 consumer loan with your bank; all six installments to date were paid ahead of schedule.  

A monthly payment of roughly €130 over 48 months is well within my €1,400 discretionary income. Consistent employment, career advancement prospects and an immaculate repayment record make me a reliable candidate. I appreciate your consideration.  

Yours sincerely,  
Daniel Petrov
