Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Weber, 32, married, with a two-year-old son. I have been Production Manager at Rheinsteel AG in Düsseldorf for the past five years, earning a stable net income of 5,400 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,880 DM to replace our broken ten-year-old television and radio with an energy-efficient model.  

My current account is overdrawn by 480 DM after an unexpected boiler repair. Aside from two small instalment loans with your bank, I hold a single 6,000 DM car loan at Stadtsparkasse Köln; every payment has been made on time. I own our home (Land Register No. 218/5) and maintain a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 12,000 DM, which I can assign as collateral if required.  

Five years of continuous employment, punctual payment history, and a secure monthly salary make me a reliable borrower. I am comfortable with the proposed instalment rate of 4 % and look forward to settling the loan within the agreed term.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

To the Credit Department,  

I am Dr. Stefan Meier, 32, married, and practicing veterinarian in Freiburg. After six years of self-employment, my clinic now grosses about 14,000 DM monthly, from which I draw a steady 6,200 DM salary. I request a loan of 1,880 DM to purchase a professional multimedia system (radio/TV) for our waiting area, an upgrade clients have repeatedly suggested.  

Temporary overdraft of 520 DM exists in my checking account due to recent renovations, and I maintain a single 10,000 DM equipment loan with Volksbank Freiburg, always serviced punctually. I own our house outright and hold a building-society savings contract (Bausparvertrag) with 15,500 DM accrued.  

My strong cash flow, spotless repayment record over the past eight years, and tangible collateral demonstrate my reliability. I am prepared to sign a standing order for the fixed 4 % instalments.  

Thank you for examining my application.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Stefan Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ahmed El-Masri, 32, married with one daughter. I moved from Alexandria to Munich in 2012 and have spent the last five years as Senior IT Project Manager at Siemens AG, earning a net 5,900 DM per month. The requested 1,880 DM loan will finance a German-language satellite TV and digital radio set so my family can follow local news and educational programs.  

My current account shows a 610 DM overdraft after settling relocation costs for my mother-in-law. I have two active loans with your bank, both paid punctually, and one small 3,500 DM credit card balance with Deutsche Bank, always within limits. Our condominium is mortgage-free, and I hold a life-insurance policy valued at 18,000 DM.  

Consistent high income, five-year tenure at Siemens, and a perfect repayment history underline my creditworthiness. The 4 % instalment comfortably fits our household budget.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El-Masri

To the Loans Officer,  

I, Frank Schneider, 32, widower, have served as Police Inspector in Leipzig since 2018, presently earning 4,800 DM net each month. I am seeking a 1,880 DM loan to buy a modern television/radio combo after my late wife’s old set failed; it will also allow my seven-year-old son to access educational programs.  

My checking account is overdrawn by 450 DM due to school fees, yet all obligations, including two small consumer loans at your branch and a 5,000 DM furniture credit at Sparkasse Leipzig, are paid to the day. I own our row house and keep a building-society contract with a balance of 11,200 DM.  

My civil-service status, six-year spotless credit record, and property assets make me a dependable borrower. The 4 % repayment rate aligns comfortably with my monthly budget plan.  

I appreciate your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Schneider

Credit Committee,  

I am Hans Keller, 32, married, one child, and founder of Keller Automation GmbH in Stuttgart. The company, which designs industrial control software, has operated profitably for four years, and I draw a fixed salary of 6,500 DM net per month. I request a loan of 1,880 DM to install a high-definition TV and internet radio in our prototype lab for real-time monitoring of market data and technical broadcasts.  

My current account shows an overdraft of 530 DM after covering quarterly tax pre-payments. I maintain two small loans with your bank, both with immaculate payment histories, and a 7,200 DM business credit line at Baden-Württemberg Bank, never exceeded. I own our duplex home and hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 20,000 DM as additional security.  

Stable income, growing business, and consistent punctuality in all financial commitments confirm my trustworthiness. I am prepared to set up automatic 4 % instalment deductions.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Best regards,
