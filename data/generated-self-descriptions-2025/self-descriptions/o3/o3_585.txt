Cologne, 14 June 1995  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Carlos Mendes, 33 years old, Portuguese citizen and single father of a six-year-old boy. I have lived in Cologne for one year and have been employed since July 1994 as a night-shift warehouse loader at RheinLogistik GmbH. My net income averages 2 050 DM per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 2 384 DM over 36 months to repair the clutch and transmission of my 1987 Opel Kadett, which I use daily to reach the distribution centre. Without the car I would face a three-hour commute and risk my position.  

Although my current giro account seldom exceeds 180 DM and my savings total just 70 DM, I have already repaid a 1 200 DM consumer credit from your bank (1993–1994) without a single delay. I have no other debts, always pay my rent on time and have enclosed confirmation from my landlord and employer.  

The requested instalment of roughly 75 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget. I value the relationship I have established with your bank and would be grateful for your support.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards  
Carlos Mendes  



Letter 2  
Hamburg, 12 June 1995  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Ahmed El-Sayed, 33, Egyptian national, residing in Hamburg for the past 11 months. Since August 1994 I have worked as a kitchen porter at Hotel Alsterblick on a permanent contract, earning 1 980 DM net.  

I seek a credit of 2 384 DM, repayable over 36 months, to replace the leaking roof of my rented flat’s bathroom. The landlord agreed to deduct the repair cost from future rent if I organise and pay for the work upfront, which will reduce my monthly housing expense.  

My financial record is solid: a 1 500 DM instalment loan taken in 1992 was repaid three months early, and I have never missed a payment. My current account fluctuates between 90 DM and 160 DM, and I keep 50 DM in a postal savings book. Apart from supporting my younger brother who studies in Cairo, I have no obligations and no other loans.  

The proposed instalment of about 70 DM represents less than 4 % of my income, ensuring comfortable repayment. I am committed to honouring every deadline, as my previous credit history shows.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favourable reply.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Munich, 10 June 1995  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I, Ivan Petrović, Serbian citizen, age 33, have been living in Munich for exactly one year. I am employed as a construction-site helper with SüdBau AG since June 1994, earning a steady 2 150 DM net each month plus overtime in summer.  

The loan of 2 384 DM over 36 months will finance major repairs on my late father’s village house roof in Serbia, damaged during last winter’s heavy snowfall. Keeping the house intact allows my widowed mother and my seven-year-old son (currently staying with her) to live safely until they can join me in Germany next year.  

I maintain a checking balance between 50 DM and 170 DM and possess 90 DM in war-risk bonds. In 1993 I took a 2 000 DM relocation loan from your branch and repaid it fully and punctually by April 1995. I have no other credits, pay my rent on the first of every month and have enclosed letters of reference from my foreman and previous landlord.  

The monthly instalment of roughly 72 DM is well within my disposable income and I stand ready to sign wage assignment if required.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully  
Ivan Petrović  



Letter 4  
Dortmund, 9 June 1995  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Marek Nowak, 33-year-old Polish national, single, renting a flat in Dortmund since May 1994. I work as an unskilled press operator at Ruhr-Stahlwerke AG; my contract began eleven months ago, and my average net wage is 2 000 DM.  

I request a 2 384 DM loan over 36 months to overhaul the gas boiler in my apartment. The city’s energy inspector has warned that the unit is unsafe; immediate repair will protect my four-year-old daughter, who stays with me on weekends, and lower my heating costs by about 40 DM each month.  

While my giro account balance is modest (0–150 DM) and I have only 60 DM in savings, I have demonstrated reliability: a 1 300 DM furniture loan taken from your bank in 1992 was cleared without incident. My employer confirms stable employment, and my union disability insurance adds extra security. I carry no other debts, nor do I possess credit cards.  

The projected repayment of 70–75 DM monthly is affordable and will be deducted automatically from my salary. I am confident you will find me a low-risk and conscientious borrower.  

With gratitude for your attention,  

Best regards  
Marek Nowak  



Letter 5  
Stuttgart, 8 June 1995  

Honourable Loan Department,  

My name is Luis Fernández, 33, Spanish citizen, living in Stuttgart for the past year. Since July 1994 I have held a permanent position as a hospital orderly at Klinikum Mitte, taking home approximately 2 120 DM per month.  

I wish to obtain a 2 384 DM, 36-month loan to repair my ageing VW Transporter’s engine and brakes. The van is essential: I work split shifts and also use it every second weekend to collect my eight-year-old nephew, whom I support, from boarding school.  

My current account rarely exceeds 170 DM and my savings book contains 85 DM. However, in 1991 I borrowed 1 800 DM from your institution and concluded repayment in December 1993 without delay. I have never overdrawn, hold no credit cards and pay rent and utilities by standing order. References from my head nurse and former landlord attest to my reliability.  

A monthly instalment of about 72 DM equals 3.4 % of my net earnings, leaving ample margin for living costs and unexpected expenses. I am fully committed to meeting each payment punctually.  

Thank you very much for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Yours faithfully  
Luis Fernández
