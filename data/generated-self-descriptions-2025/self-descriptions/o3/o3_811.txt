Letter 1  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Rossi, an Italian citizen, 26 years old, divorced and living with my three-year-old daughter in rented accommodation in Stuttgart. I kindly request a loan of 1,778 DM over 15 months to finance a reliable, fuel-efficient Ford Fiesta (new). Owning a vehicle is essential for me to accept the bakery job that begins on 1 July and lies outside public-transport hours.  

Although my current checking-account balance is 143 DM and my savings account holds 32 DM, I have demonstrated financial discipline: the two micro-credits (300 DM each) I obtained from your bank in 2022 were repaid ahead of schedule. I have never defaulted on any obligation.  

While I am temporarily unemployed after relocating to Germany six months ago, I receive 1,050 DM monthly unemployment insurance and 350 DM net rental income from a studio apartment I inherited in Naples, currently valued at about 45,000 DM. This property is unencumbered and documented. Together these funds comfortably cover the planned instalment of roughly 120 DM plus my living expenses.  

Your institution already knows my payment habits, and my upcoming employment contract further strengthens my position. I would be grateful for your confidence and assure you of punctual repayment.  

Thank you very much for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Rossi

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Elena Georgescu, 26, separated, Romanian national, residing at Rosenweg 3, Leipzig, since last summer. I respectfully apply for a 1,778 DM car loan repayable over 15 months. A new Opel Corsa will enable me to commute to the dairy cooperative that has offered me a full-time position starting next quarter.  

My Girokonto shows 87 DM and my spare-change savings book 21 DM. Despite these modest figures, I have an impeccable record: the two furniture credits (400 DM and 250 DM) taken with your bank in 2020–2021 were settled exactly on schedule. I have no other debt.  

Presently I do seasonal work (fruit packing) yielding 1,100 DM net. Additionally, I hold title to 0.8 ha of farmland in Prahova County, Romania, valued conservatively at 35,000 DM. This land, free of liens, provides rental income of 200 DM monthly. Combined, my income allows me to meet an expected instalment of about 120 DM while supporting my five-year-old son.  

Although I have been employed in Germany for only ten months and lack a telephone line, my prior dealings with your branch demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower. I am confident the requested financing will be mutually beneficial.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Georgescu

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

My name is Svetlana Petrova, 26, married but living apart, Bulgarian citizen, currently renting at Bahnhofstraße 12, Dortmund. I seek a 1,778 DM loan for 15 months to purchase a new VW Polo, which will let me accept weekend shifts at the hospital canteen 18 km away.  

My balance today is 51 DM, and my savings book holds 12 DM. I do, however, own a small house in Varna (market value about 60,000 DM) inherited from my grandmother and generating 300 DM monthly rent. In Germany I receive 1,030 DM monthly unemployment benefit; I have been registered here for eight months.  

Your bank already granted me two short-term education credits in 2021 (total 500 DM) that I repaid without a single delay. I have no outstanding obligations elsewhere, no guarantors, and no overdraft history. The planned instalment of nearly 120 DM will be covered comfortably by my rental income alone, leaving social benefits for living costs and my four-year-old daughter.  

I am a permanent resident permit holder, possess property collateral abroad, and have shown punctuality in every previous repayment. I therefore request your support for this practical step toward stable employment.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Svetlana Petrova

Dear Lending Department,  

I am Ana Torres, a 26-year-old Spanish citizen, separated, living with my son in rented quarters in Mannheim for one year. I am applying for a loan of 1,778 DM over 15 months to acquire a new Renault Clio that will serve as both transport and a tool for freelance cleaning contracts I have lined up.  

Although my current current-account balance stands at 119 DM and my savings total 44 DM, I have maintained an unblemished credit record: two instalment purchases (washing machine and bicycle, together 550 DM) financed by your bank were repaid in full by March 2023.  

I have been in Germany just under a year and presently receive 1,080 DM unemployment support. Additionally, I co-own with my brother a 25 % share of our parents’ olive grove in Andalusia, appraised at 50,000 DM; my share yields 250 DM annual rent, documented. My projected cleaning income of 800 DM monthly (contracts attached) will start once mobility is secured. The combined cash flow will more than meet the 120 DM monthly instalment.  

Given my proven reliability and tangible assets, I kindly ask the bank to extend this modest credit, confident that I will honor every payment on time.  

With appreciation,  
Ana Torres

To whom it may concern,  

I am Kateryna (Katya) Ivanova, 26, divorced, Ukrainian national and single mother of a six-year-old boy. I have rented a flat at Nordstraße 44, Bremen, for the past year and now request a 1,778 DM loan repayable in 15 months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia. Reliable transport is necessary to attend vocational language classes and reach potential employers in the logistics park.  

My Giro account holds 67 DM; my savings book shows 15 DM. Nevertheless, I am a conscientious payer: two prior credits with your institution (school laptop 250 DM, dental bill 350 DM) were each repaid early. I currently receive 980 DM unemployment benefit and 184 DM child allowance.  

I also own a debt-free 40 m² flat in Kharkiv valued at approximately 55,000 DM, which my sister rents from me for 330 DM per month, remitted through documented bank transfers. These funds alone exceed the projected monthly instalment of around 120 DM.  

Though I have been employed in Germany for only nine months in total, my spotless repayment history, additional rental income, and real-estate collateral establish me as a trustworthy borrower. I respectfully request your favorable decision.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Katya Ivanova
