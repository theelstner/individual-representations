Frankfurt, 13 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Stefan Kovács, a Hungarian electrical engineer employed by Siemens Mobility in Frankfurt since August 2015 (10 years). I am applying for a two-year consumer loan of €1 278 to purchase a Samsung QN90C television. Because my previous contract home loan was repaid last February without a single late installment, I currently hold no active debts with your institution except the small revolving credit I settled last month.  

Although I do not keep a checking account, my income of €5 200 net per month is paid directly into my wife’s account; the accompanying payroll statements are enclosed. I own a condominium in Offenbach valued at €310 000, fully registered in my name, which provides solid collateral. My savings balance is only €64, since I have been directing surplus funds into renovations and a tuition fund for my seven-year-old son.  

Given my long, uninterrupted employment, flawless repayment record, and stable home ownership, I am confident I meet your reliability standards. I would appreciate the chance to discuss the schedule of 24 monthly installments of approximately €54 each (4 % rate).  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Ing. Stefan Kovács

To the Credit Department,  

I am Mr. Daniel Osei, a 36-year-old Ghanaian software project manager at Allianz Technology, where I have worked for eight years. I respectfully request a €1 278 loan over 24 months to buy a Loewe bild i television for my new apartment.  

I have no overdraft facility nor regular checking account; all daily payments run through a prepaid debit card. My gross salary is €96 000 per annum, documented by attached payslips. I previously financed a company car through your bank and completed all 48 installments on schedule this June. I presently carry no other loans.  

Although liquid savings stand at only €83 (after a recent down payment on the flat), I own the apartment outright—land registry certificate enclosed—and have lived there since last summer. Monthly housing costs are limited to condominium fees of €180, leaving ample room for the proposed €54 installment.  

My spotless repayment history, stable managerial employment, and tangible property make me a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to finalizing the agreement.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Kwame Osei

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I, Mr. Marco De Luca, an Italian aeronautical officer at the European Aviation Safety Agency, have served under a permanent contract since May 2016. I seek a €1 278 loan, repayable in 24 months, to purchase a high-quality Denon sound system and OLED TV for professional remote-inspection work.  

During the last decade I drew one mortgage with your bank and repaid it fully last year, never missing a deadline. Other than that completed mortgage, I hold no liabilities. While I operate without a traditional checking account, my monthly net income of €4 800 is transferred to a government-issued pay card, statements of which are attached.  

I possess a detached house in Esslingen valued at €420 000 and have resided there since April 2024. Savings are minimal (€57) because I redirected funds toward roofing repairs and child-care costs for my eight-year-old daughter.  

My proven credit discipline, solid civil-service employment, and real-estate collateral assure you of timely repayment. I would welcome approval at your earliest convenience.  

Respectfully,  
Marco De Luca

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Jacek Nowak, a Polish self-employed maritime logistics consultant working from Hamburg since 2014. I request a consumer loan of €1 278 over 24 months to upgrade to a Sony Bravia XR TV that will double as a client-presentation screen in my home office.  

Annual turnover averages €132 000, with €68 000 net profit, as confirmed by the attached tax assessments. Although I operate solely with a business PayPal account and therefore maintain no personal checking account, invoices over the past 36 months show consistent cash flow.  

I repaid a €15 000 renovation credit with your bank three months ahead of schedule this year. My only asset is a terraced house in Altona purchased in 2020 for €375 000, currently mortgage-free. Cash savings are €74 after covering my six-year-old son’s medical treatment earlier this quarter.  

Given my spotless repayment history, robust income, and unencumbered property, I am confident of meeting the €54 monthly obligation. Your positive response would be greatly appreciated.  

Sincerely,  
Dipl.-Kfm. Jacek Nowak

Respected Loan Panel,  

I am Mr. Sergey Ivanov, a 36-year-old Russian management analyst contracted with Bayer AG since July 2017. I wish to finance the purchase of a Panasonic 55-inch television and accompanying DAB radio set, totaling €1 278, via a 24-month loan.  

My gross monthly salary is €6 100; however, I have postponed opening a local checking account while awaiting permanent residency. Consequently, wages are transferred to a Revolut euro wallet, statements of which accompany this letter.  

In 2021 I took a €7 500 education loan from your branch and settled it in full by June 2023, maintaining an unblemished payment record. I maintain no other credit lines. My current savings amount to €91, as I recently replaced the roof on my owner-occupied duplex in Bergisch Gladbach, purchased outright from inheritance funds (€285 000). I have lived there for one year with my nine-year-old daughter.  

My consistent employment, property ownership, and impeccable credit behavior demonstrate my reliability. I would be honored to continue my cooperation with your bank.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Warm regards,  
Sergey Ivanov
