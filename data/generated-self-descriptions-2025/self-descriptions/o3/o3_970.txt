Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Andreas Keller, 29, married, with a three-year-old daughter. I have been employed for five years as a medical laboratory technologist at the University Hospital of Munich, earning a steady net salary of €3,400 per month. I have rented the same apartment in Giesing for the past four years.  

I am applying for a €7,166 loan over 42 months to purchase a modern smart television and digital radio system that will allow my wife to continue her remote studies and give my daughter access to educational programming. I once financed a laptop with this bank and repaid it six months early; otherwise I carry no other debts.  

My financial obligations are modest (installment rate 2) and fully covered by my income. I hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz worth €15,000 that can serve as additional security. Although I currently have no checking account, I am ready to open one with your institution and have enclosed the required documents.  

With a proven repayment record, stable employment, verifiable telephone contact, and adequate collateral, I believe I am a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Andreas Keller  



Letter 2  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Markus Stein, a 29-year-old widower raising my five-year-old son. For the last four years and six months I have worked as an electrical maintenance officer for Deutsche Bahn, earning €3,100 net monthly under civil-service conditions. I have lived at my current rented address in Augsburg since 2019.  

I seek a €7,166 loan for 42 months to furnish our new apartment with a quality television and DAB+ radio. Two years ago I took an automobile loan with your bank and repaid it exactly on schedule; my credit file shows no late payments.  

My only ongoing obligation is the rent; I have no other installment plans or guarantors. An LBS building-society savings agreement with a current balance of €22,000 stands behind me as security. The planned installment comfortably fits within the 2 % rate guideline relative to my income.  

I value long-term relationships and will gladly centralize my finances with your bank. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Markus Stein

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Philip Wagner, age 29, married with one dependent. I have served as a customs officer in the Federal Customs Service for six years, drawing a secure net income of €3,000 plus a 13th-month salary. My family has rented the same flat in Bremen for four years.  

We request a €7,166 loan over 42 months to purchase an advanced television, sound bar, and digital radio receiver that support captioning and enhanced audio for my hearing-impaired spouse. Three years ago I financed household appliances with this bank and repaid ahead of time; my Schufa record is impeccable.  

Our household carries no other loans. I own a life-insurance policy valued at €25,000, which I am willing to assign as collateral. My telephone line is registered in my name, and I am prepared to open a checking account immediately.  

Given my civil-servant status, stable residence, and flawless repayment history, I trust you will find my application worthy.  

Kind regards,  
Philip Wagner  



Letter 4  
Dear Loans Officer,  

I am Tobias Franke, 29, married, father of a nine-month-old son, and employed for four years and two months as a software support specialist at Siemens AG, earning €3,600 net plus quarterly bonuses. I have rented my apartment in Nuremberg since 2020.  

I am applying for a €7,166 loan (42 months) to acquire professional-grade audio equipment and a 4K television that will allow me to expand my evening podcast project into a supplemental income stream. I have one previous credit with your bank (a smartphone plan) that was settled without delay.  

Besides rent, my only obligation is a modest life-insurance premium; I have no other installment agreements. A building-society contract with a current value of €18,000 is available as additional security. The requested installment fits well within the 2 % guideline of my net income.  

My consistent employment, clean credit record, and willingness to move my everyday banking to your institution make me a dependable candidate. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Franke  



Letter 5  
Dear Banking Committee,  

My name is Sebastian Meyer, 29, married, with one child. For the past five years I have worked as a police administrative officer with the Hamburg Police Department, receiving a stable net salary of €3,200 per month. My family has rented the same flat in Altona for four years.  

I request a €7,166 loan for 42 months to replace our outdated television and to purchase digital radio equipment that I need for upcoming investigative training courses. Two years ago I obtained a motorbike loan through your bank and repaid it flawlessly.  

I have no outstanding debts, no guarantors, and no additional installment plans. A €30,000 life-insurance policy is in place and can be pledged as collateral. I maintain a landline and mobile phone registered to my name and will gladly open a checking account with your bank.  

With steady public-sector employment, a spotless repayment record, and tangible collateral, I am confident of meeting every installment on time. I look forward to a positive response.  

Warm regards,  
Sebastian Meyer
