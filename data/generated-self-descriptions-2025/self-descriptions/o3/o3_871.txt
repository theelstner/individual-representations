Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Novak, a 24-year-old Slovak citizen, married and mother of a two-year-old son. Since completing my apprenticeship in 2017 I have worked for eight years as a medical laboratory technician at St. Georg Clinic, Stuttgart (permanent contract, net salary 2,140 DM).  

I am applying for a 652 DM loan to purchase a wardrobe, sofa and washing machine for the flat my family and I moved into four months ago. The security deposit for this rented apartment temporarily brought my checking account 83 DM into overdraft, but my salary covers all current expenses. I keep a 9-year life-insurance policy (current surrender value 1,050 DM) and have never missed a payment on the small education loan I repaid to your bank last year.  

With one dependable income, no other borrowings, and a proven eight-year employment record, I am confident I can repay the requested amount within twelve months. Kindly consider my good credit history and the attached payroll slips as evidence of reliability.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Amina Rahimi, 24, separated and responsible for my four-year-old daughter. Since 2018 I have been employed as a CNC machine operator at Leipzig Precision Tools GmbH, today earning 2,020 DM net each month on a permanent full-time contract.  

To prepare for evening trade-school exams I need a sturdy desk, ergonomic chair and laptop; total cost 652 DM. Because my checking account currently shows a 47 DM overdraft—caused by kindergarten fees paid in advance—I seek your support. I hold a building-society savings agreement opened in 2016 (balance 760 DM) and have fully settled the 2023 micro-loan I obtained from your bank, with all installments remitted on schedule.  

With no guarantors required, no other debts, steady income for seven years, and residence at my current address since 2021, I am in a solid position to honor monthly installments over the next twelve months.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for any further information.

Respectfully,  
Amina Rahimi

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,

My name is Elena Petrova, a 24-year-old Bulgarian national, divorced, and sole provider for my six-year-old son. I have served the Hamburg Port Authority since 2016, progressing from trainee to senior customs clerk; my permanent post now brings a net 2,230 DM monthly.  

I request a 652 DM loan to replace my refrigerator and oven, both irreparably damaged after a power surge last month. Advance repair costs pushed my checking account 65 DM below zero, though my salary assures quick recovery. I hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 1,300 DM and have never missed a payment on the consumer credit I closed in May 2024 with your institution.  

Given my nine-year unbroken employment, four-year tenancy at the same address and absence of any other obligations, I am confident of repaying the loan within the agreed twelve-month term.  

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

Berlin, 17 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Carla Rodriguez, 24, married, from Spain, serving as an administrative assistant (civil-service grade A5) with the Berlin Police Headquarters for the past eight years. My net salary is 2,260 DM per month.  

After relocating this spring, my husband and I still lack basic furnishings for our rented flat—particularly a dining table, two wardrobes and a study desk for our seven-year-old daughter. The package price is 652 DM. The rental deposit paid in July left my account 92 DM overdrawn, but all bills are current. I maintain a building-society savings contract opened in 2017 (balance 880 DM) and have fully repaid the 2022 moving loan you granted me.  

With no other liabilities, a stable civil-service position and an impeccable payment record, I am an entirely dependable borrower. I propose to amortize the loan over twelve equal installments and authorize direct debit from my salary account.  

I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Carla Rodriguez  



Letter 5  
Stuttgart-Hohenheim, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Liying Chen, 24, separated, Chinese citizen and guardian of my three-year-old son. Since 2017 I have worked as a research assistant in food technology at the University of Hohenheim, presently earning 2,150 DM net.  

I request a 652 DM loan to purchase a computer workstation and child’s bed. These items will enable me to complete a remote master’s course while providing my son with adequate sleep space. Pre-paying tuition last month left my checking account 58 DM in overdraft.  

I own a life-insurance policy (surrender value 1,100 DM) and previously cleared a 2023 study loan with your bank ahead of schedule—proof of my reliability. I carry no other debts, have lived at my current address for four years, and hold an unlimited employment contract.  

I am confident of settling the requested sum within one year through automatic monthly deductions. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Liying Chen
