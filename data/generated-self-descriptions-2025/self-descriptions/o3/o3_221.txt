Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Bauer, age 64, a widowed German language secretary at the city tax office in Ulm. I have been with the office for three years and currently earn a net salary of 2,750 DM per month, transferred regularly to my savings account (I do not yet hold a checking account). I own my condominium outright and drive a 17-year-old Volkswagen that can no longer pass TÜV inspection. To continue commuting the 28 km to work and transporting my 13-year-old grandson to school, I am requesting a 1,364 DM loan over ten months to purchase a reliable used Opel Corsa (first registration 2022, 11,000 km).

Three years ago, I borrowed 2,000 DM from your bank to renovate my roof and repaid every installment on schedule; this remains my only prior borrowing. I have no other debts, and my monthly budget leaves 1,400 DM after fixed costs, easily covering the planned installment of roughly 140 DM.

I am a homeowner, long-term public-sector employee, and have demonstrated punctual repayment. I therefore kindly ask you to grant this modest loan and look forward to placing my future banking business, including a new checking account, with you.

Sincerely,
Maria Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Sofiya Ivanova, 64, divorced, and employed since February 2021 as a laboratory technician at Greifswald University Hospital, earning 3,050 DM net. I reside in my own house in Greifswald, where I have lived for four years with my dependent son Viktor, a first-year medical student.

My 2006 Skoda Fabia broke down irreparably last month. I request a loan of 1,364 DM over ten months to make a down payment on a new Dacia Sandero (the balance will be covered by a staff discount program). My only prior credit—a 5,500 DM boiler replacement loan with your bank—was settled six months ahead of schedule last year. I hold no other obligations and keep less than 100 DM in a passbook savings account.

My permanent contract, stable income, flawless repayment record, and home ownership demonstrate my reliability. I will open a current account with you upon approval so that installments of approximately 140 DM can be debited automatically.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
Sofiya Ivanova

To the Credit Department,

My name is Elke Schneider, 64, married, and a ticketing officer with Deutsche Bahn in Dresden since March 2022. My monthly net pay is 2,480 DM, supplemented by a 200 DM travel allowance. For commuting and caring for my 11-year-old granddaughter, I need to replace my unsafe 1999 Fiat Punto. I seek a 1,364 DM loan (ten-month term, two-percent installment category) for a nearly new Renault Twingo.

I own a small townhouse free of mortgage, pay no other installments, and have never missed a payment on the 3,200 DM personal loan I took with your institution in 2019 (closed May 2021). My fixed expenses total 1,000 DM, leaving ample room for the projected 140 DM monthly repayment. I have not yet opened a checking account but am prepared to do so immediately.

My solid civil-service-like contract, spotless credit history, and stable living situation make me a low-risk borrower. I appreciate your favorable review.

Kind regards,
Elke Schneider

Dear Loans Officer,

I am Clara Fernández, 64, separated, and employed for the past two years as an archive specialist at the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce, earning 3,300 DM net. I live alone with my 16-year-old daughter in a mortgage-free apartment I inherited.

I request a loan of 1,364 DM for ten months to purchase a new electric microcar (Citroën Ami) so I can continue commuting after the planned diesel ban in our district. My previous credit—1,800 DM for dental work—was issued by your bank in 2020 and paid off without delay. I hold no other loans or credit cards and maintain minimal savings (<100 DM) while planning to build reserves once this purchase is complete.

With steady civil-service employment, property ownership, and an unblemished repayment record, I trust you will find my application sound. Upon approval, I will transfer my salary payments to a checking account with your branch, ensuring seamless installment deductions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Warm regards,
Clara Fernández

Esteemed Credit Committee,

I am Anja Novak, 64, divorced, a senior payroll clerk at the Stuttgart municipal utilities since January 2020. My net monthly income is 2,900 DM, directly deposited into my savings book. I have lived for four years in the house I own outright together with my dependent grandson Leon (age 10).

My current Ford Ka is beyond economical repair, threatening both my work attendance and Leon’s therapy appointments. I therefore apply for a 1,364 DM loan over ten months to cover the balance on a dealer-discounted Kia Picanto. I previously held a 4,000 DM energy-efficiency loan from your bank, repaid in full last December. I carry no other debts, and my budget analysis shows a consistent monthly surplus of 1,200 DM—ample for the expected 140 DM payment.

The combination of permanent public-utility employment, home ownership, and flawless repayment history underscores my creditworthiness. I intend to open a checking account with you and authorize automatic debit for each installment.

I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,
Anja Novak
