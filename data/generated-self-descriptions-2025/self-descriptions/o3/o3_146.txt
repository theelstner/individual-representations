Letter 1 – Anna-Lena Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna-Lena Becker, 23, divorced, with a three-year-old daughter. Since August 1st last year I have been a full-time medical-device sales assistant at Helios MedTech GmbH, earning a net salary of 1,860 EUR per month. I own a 42 m² condominium in Leipzig that I purchased with family help four years ago.

I am applying for a loan of 2,288 EUR to furnish my daughter’s new bedroom and to buy a compact desk and chair for the home-office corner required by my employer. The requested amount will be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of roughly 105 EUR, which is comfortably covered by my disposable income after fixed costs of 1,250 EUR.

My current financial obligations consist of a 420 EUR smartphone credit with an external retailer; the last of twelve instalments will be paid in September. I have never missed a payment, including on the 300 EUR micro-loan I previously settled with your bank. Assets include a building-society savings agreement (balance 720 EUR) and a 10,000 EUR life-insurance policy pledged to my daughter.

I believe my stable employment, spotless payment record, and tangible collateral make me a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive decision and am available for any further information.

Kind regards,
Anna-Lena Becker

Letter 2 – Maria Isabel Costas

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Maria Isabel Costas, 23, married, Portuguese citizen registered in Germany since 2019. Six months ago I started as a junior customs officer (Beamtenanwärterin) at the Hamburg Main Customs Office; my net salary is 2,020 EUR. We recently bought a small terraced house in Harburg, where we have lived for four years.

To finish equipping the house I request a loan of 2,288 EUR for wardrobes, a refrigerator and a washing machine. I propose repayment over 21 months at 4 % interest, resulting in a monthly instalment of about 115 EUR. With current obligatory expenses of 1,300 EUR, this leaves ample room for punctual repayment.

I maintain a 35 EUR-per-month electronics credit with Saturn (remaining balance 280 EUR) and a 300 EUR educational book loan already issued by your bank, both serviced flawlessly. Although I do not yet hold a current account with you, I am ready to move my salary payments if this application is approved. My assets include an LBS building-society contract (1,050 EUR paid in) and a life-insurance policy for 15,000 EUR.

My civil-service status, consistent payment history and secure housing underpin my reliability. I look forward to your favourable response.

Respectfully,
Maria Isabel Costas

Letter 3 – Sara Hendricks

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Sara Hendricks, 23, separated and mother of a two-year-old boy, have been employed since May last year as an early-childhood educator at the St. Michaelis Kindergarten in Bremen, netting 1,730 EUR monthly.

I seek a credit of 2,288 EUR to replace worn living-room furniture and purchase a laptop and printer that the kindergarten requires me to use for remote documentation work. On a 24-month plan the instalment of approximately 105 EUR fits well within my 480 EUR monthly surplus after expenses.

My only other liability is a 600 EUR furniture store loan taken before my separation; four instalments of 50 EUR remain and have always been paid on time. An earlier 250 EUR overdraft with your branch was cleared two months ago. Current assets are a building-society savings contract worth 660 EUR and a life-insurance policy naming my son as beneficiary.

Owning my apartment outright, maintaining steady employment, and upholding an unblemished repayment record demonstrate my creditworthiness. I would greatly appreciate your support and am happy to provide any further documentation.

Sincerely,
Sara Hendricks

Letter 4 – Drina Vladimirova

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Drina Vladimirova, 23, Bulgarian national with permanent residence, living in Nürnberg since 2019. I am a civil-service trainee at the City Building Authority, employed since July last year with a net stipend of 1,950 EUR.

I require a 2,288 EUR loan to furnish the small house I inherited from my grandparents: specifically wardrobes, kitchen cabinets and a workbench for my planned home-study area. I suggest a 22-month schedule at roughly 110 EUR per instalment, comfortably below 10 % of my net income.

Financial commitments are limited to a 500 EUR bicycle credit from an external provider (three instalments remaining) and a 300 EUR start-up loan previously granted by your bank, both serviced punctually. I hold a building-society contract with 890 EUR paid in and a 12,000 EUR life-insurance policy; my property is currently valued at about 95,000 EUR and carries no mortgage.

My steady public-sector position, existing collateral, and flawless payment history attest to my reliability. I hope to strengthen my relationship with your bank through this loan and a future current account.

Thank you for your consideration.

With best regards,
Drina Vladimirova

Letter 5 – Emily Johnson

Dear Loans Officer,

I am Emily Johnson, 23, divorced and supporting a four-year-old son. Since October last year I have worked as a chemical-laboratory technician at OmniChem AG in Düsseldorf, earning 1,880 EUR net monthly.

I request a 2,288 EUR loan for new bedroom furniture, a dishwasher, and a sturdy work desk to facilitate occasional shift-related report writing at home. Repayment over 24 instalments of around 105 EUR aligns with my monthly free cash of approximately 550 EUR.

My obligations include a 480 EUR television credit with an external retailer (ending in December) and an earlier 200 EUR emergency loan from your bank that was repaid ahead of schedule. I own a 38 m² studio apartment bought four years ago, hold an Allianz life-insurance policy for 10,000 EUR, and maintain an LBS savings agreement with a current balance of 640 EUR.

I have never defaulted on a payment, keep all invoices on auto-debit, and can provide salary statements and SCHUFA records. I am confident my stable income, owned property, and disciplined financial behaviour make me a trustworthy candidate.

I look forward to a positive reply and am available for any questions.

Yours faithfully,
Emily Johnson
