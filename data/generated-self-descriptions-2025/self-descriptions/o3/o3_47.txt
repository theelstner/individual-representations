Frankfurt, 4 October 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Sofia Paolo, an Italian citizen, 35, living in Frankfurt for the past four years with my eight-year-old daughter. Since March 2025 I have worked as a biomedical research officer at BioGene GmbH, earning a net salary of 3 900 DM per month. I am applying for a 1 393 DM loan to purchase a reliable Hyundai i10 to replace my 17-year-old Fiat, whose frequent breakdowns now jeopardise my punctual attendance at the laboratory.

Although I have no current checking account, I have held two small education loans with your bank for eleven months and have never missed an instalment. Outside of these I carry only a 540 DM study loan at Banca Popolare in Milan, which is serviced without delay. My savings stand at 80 DM, and I own a modest condominium (fully paid) as well as my present car. I request an instalment of 150 DM per month (≈4 % of my income), allowing full repayment within ten months.

My employment contract is indefinite, my research grants are funded through 2027, and BioGene’s HR department is prepared to confirm salary assignment if required. I am confident my record with you demonstrates reliability, and this modest loan will further strengthen my mobility and thus my professional performance.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to a positive reply.

Respectfully,  
Dr. Sofia Paolo

To the Credit Department,

I am Ms Elena Petrescu, a 35-year-old Romanian national, divorced, raising one son. After four years in Germany I have recently registered my own information-security consultancy, Petrescu CyberRisk, and have been trading since December 2024 with an average monthly net income of 5 100 DM. I seek a loan of 1 393 DM to purchase a new electric Renault Twingo for client visits; my 2006 Opel can no longer pass inspection.

My relationship with your bank began eleven months ago through two equipment micro-credits, which I have serviced punctually. I still lack a checking account but intend to open one upon approval of this application. Apart from a 700 DM laptop loan with Sparkasse Bucharest, which is up to date, I have no other debt. My savings amount to 60 DM.

I propose an instalment plan of 170 DM per month (4 % of my net turnover), to be settled in eight months. Petrescu CyberRisk has contracts signed with three corporate clients through 2026, ensuring cash flow. My tax advisor, Herr Wilke, can attest to my statements.

I value the trust you have already extended and would welcome the chance to build it further. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrescu

Cologne, 7 October 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Amara Diallo, a Senegalese logistics officer with RheinCargo AG since February 2025, earning 3 500 DM net monthly. I am 35, separated, and support my nine-year-old daughter. I respectfully apply for a 1 393 DM loan to purchase a new Kia Picanto. Dependable transport is vital because my shift starts at 4 a.m., and public buses do not run at that hour.

For the past eleven months I have held two consumer credits with your bank (furniture and a washing machine) and have paid every instalment on schedule. I keep no checking account, but my wages are transferred to a prepaid salary card. Besides a 900 DM micro-loan with Banque de Dakar (paid quarterly), I have no liabilities. Savings stand at 55 DM, and I own my apartment in Cologne-Chorweiler, acquired through inheritance and free of mortgage.

I propose a monthly repayment of 140 DM, representing roughly 4 % of my income, enabling full settlement in ten months. RheinCargo confirms my permanent employment and will honour a wage assignment if required.

My punctual repayment history and stable residence show I am a dependable borrower. I thank you for your time and hope for your favourable response.

Kind regards,  
Amara Diallo

Stuttgart, 8 October 2025  

Esteemed Credit Committee,

I am Ms Karla Novak, Croatian citizen, married, age 35, with a six-year-old daughter. I have lived in Stuttgart for four years and work as a senior architect at PlanWerk Stuttgart KG, where I have been employed since May 2025 on an open-ended contract, earning 4 400 DM net. I seek a 1 393 DM loan to finance a new VW Polo, essential for visiting construction sites spread across Baden-Württemberg.

I currently hold two home-office equipment loans with your institution, opened eleven months ago and serviced flawlessly. I keep no checking account, relying on my husband’s account for household expenses; however, I intend to open my own after this loan is granted. My only other credit is a 650 DM student loan at Zagrebačka banka, with nine months remaining. Savings are minimal (90 DM), but I own a ten-year-old Skoda Fabia and half of our family townhouse.

I propose an instalment of 175 DM per month (≈4 % of salary), ensuring repayment within eight months. My employer can certify my income and will countersign a voluntary salary deduction clause.

I have demonstrated consistent reliability, and this modest credit will directly enhance my professional productivity. Thank you for your consideration.

With respect,  
Karla Novak, Dipl.-Ing. Arch.

Berlin, 9 October 2025  

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Farah Khan, an Indian national, 35, recently separated and sole guardian of my seven-year-old son. I co-manage the family restaurant “Khan’s Masala,” which I founded in January 2025; my net personal draw averages 3 800 DM monthly. I request a 1 393 DM loan to acquire a new Toyota Aygo for food-supply runs; our old van failed its TÜV inspection last month.

I have no checking account yet, but for the last eleven months I have held two inventory loans with your bank (current balance 810 DM) and have paid each instalment early. Beyond these I have no debts except a 500 DM refrigeration lease with Berliner Leasing, fully current. Cash reserves are 70 DM. I own a twelve-year-old Volkswagen Golf (planned for trade-in) and the apartment we live in, inherited from an aunt.

I propose to repay at 150 DM per month—just under 4 % of my income—with completion in ten months. My accountant, Frau Stein, can confirm steady restaurant revenues, and I am prepared to sign a wage-assignment agreement.

I believe my prompt payment record and growing business prove my credit-worthiness. I appreciate your time and hope for a positive answer.

Faithfully yours,  
Farah Khan
