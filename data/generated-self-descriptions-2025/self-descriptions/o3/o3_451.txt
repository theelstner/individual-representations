Frankfurt, 24 June 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Carlos Mendoza, 61 years old, married, and employed since February 2023 as a senior machine technician at Römer Auto Parts GmbH. I am applying for a 1 512 DM loan over 15 months to repair the storm-damaged roof of the house my wife and I own in Höchst.  

Financially, my current checking balance is 125 DM, while my BHW building-society savings contract stands at 4 300 DM. I have two small credits with your bank (a 2019 furniture loan and a 2021 bicycle loan) that are being repaid on schedule. My only other obligation is a 32 DM monthly store installment for a television.  

In 2020 I was three weeks late on one installment after unexpected medical expenses, but the arrears were cleared immediately and I have had no delays since. My monthly net income is 3 400 DM, so the proposed installment of 108 DM represents just 3 % of it.  

With over thirty years of steady work in Germany, proven savings habits, and a fully insured property, I am confident of meeting every payment on time. I would be grateful for your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendoza

Dear Loan Department,  

I am Aleksandr Ivanov, a widowed 61-year-old foreign national working as a postal inspector at Deutsche Post AG since October 2023. I respectfully request a 1 512 DM loan for 15 months to replace the failing central-heating boiler in my home.  

My checking account currently holds 63 DM. I maintain a 1 100 DM savings bond with Sparkasse and a 25-year Allianz life-insurance policy valued at 18 000 DM. I have no guarantors or additional bank loans outside the two running credits with you, both serviced without incident.  

A payment delay occurred in 2022 when my late wife’s hospital bills coincided with a salary backlog, but the amount was settled within the same quarter. Today my net monthly pay is 3 050 DM; the planned 108 DM installment is comfortably affordable.  

Owning my home outright, having a single dependent (my adult disabled son), and holding a stable civil-service position make me a reliable borrower. I appreciate your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Aleksandr Ivanov

Respected Sir or Madam,  

I, Giuseppe Ricci, 61, married with one dependent, have been employed for 3 years and 1 month as senior carpenter in the municipal building department. I am seeking a 1 512 DM loan to repair the transmission of my work van, essential for my overtime cabinetry business.  

My checking balance is 190 DM; my LBS savings account totals 2 500 DM. I own my residence of three years and hold a life-insurance policy pledged as collateral. My only other commitment is a 48 DM monthly refrigerator installment at Elektro-Müller.  

A brief delay in 2021 occurred after a client default, yet all dues were cleared within a month. Present income averages 3 600 DM net, so the 108 DM repayment (3 % of income) is well within my capacity.  

My long craftsmanship record, tangible assets, and punctual current credits with your bank attest to my reliability. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Respectfully,  
Giuseppe Ricci

To the Lending Office,  

I am Mohamed El Khaldi, widowed, 61 years of age, and employed since April 2024 as an archival clerk with the Bremen Municipal Archive. I request a loan of 1 512 DM payable over 15 months to repair a structural crack in my home’s foundation discovered after the winter frost.  

My checking balance stands at 45 DM. I have 3 000 DM in a building-society account and a 50 000 DM life-insurance policy naming my daughter as beneficiary. Except for two small bank credits in good standing, I carry no other debt besides a 27 DM monthly store payment for household tools.  

A single late installment occurred three years ago during relocation; I immediately regularized the account and have remained punctual since. My monthly net salary is 2 950 DM, making the proposed payment manageable.  

With secure employment, owned property, and demonstrated savings discipline, I am confident of fulfilling the loan conditions. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Mohamed El Khaldi

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Stefan Kovacs, 61, married, and I have worked as an electrical technician at Siemens Energy since September 2021. I am applying for a 1 512 DM loan over 15 months to repair the inverter modules of the solar array on my house.  

My current checking balance is 15 DM. I maintain 7 800 DM in a Bausparkasse savings contract and hold a 60 000 DM Allianz life-insurance policy. I have two existing credits with your bank—both impeccably serviced—and no guarantors. The only other obligation is a 39 DM monthly appliance plan at Kaufhof.  

In 2022 a brief paycheck delay caused one late installment, which was settled with penalty interest the next month; my record has been clean since. My net income is 4 200 DM per month, so the envisaged 108 DM payment is easily covered.  

Owning my home, demonstrating consistent savings, and enjoying stable skilled employment underscore my creditworthiness. I would greatly appreciate your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Kovacs
