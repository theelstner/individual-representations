Frankfurt, 12 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Marco Rossi, Italian citizen, resident in Frankfurt for the past three years. I have been employed for five years as a certified tool-and-die technician at Siemens Energy, earning a net salary of €2,850 per month. I respectfully apply for a €6,742 loan, to be repaid over 30 months, in order to purchase a professional 4K broadcast monitor, digital mixer and ancillary equipment that will allow me to launch a side-line online technology review channel (radio/television category).  

Although I maintain two small installment loans with Deutsche Kredit AG (car and vocational course, both up-to-date), I hold no checking or savings account at your institution. My current debt-to-income ratio is 18 %, and the requested loan would raise it to 26 %, still well within my budget. I own my condominium outright and have an active life-insurance policy with Allianz for €80,000, which can be pledged as collateral.  

My record at Siemens shows five consecutive performance bonuses and perfect attendance; copies of employment contracts, pay slips and reference letters are enclosed. I am confident that my stable income, existing property, and documented reliability make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Daniel Okoro, a Nigerian engineer who has lived and worked in Munich since 2022. For four years and eight months I have served as a quality-control official at BMW’s engine plant, with a current net monthly income of €3,100. I seek a €6,742 loan over 30 months to finance the purchase of studio cameras and an FM transmitter for a community podcast that supports African expatriates (radio/television purpose).

My credit file shows two outstanding loans with Sparkasse Köln for a laptop and relocation costs; both accounts are in good standing. I keep no checking account with your bank but am prepared to switch my salary payments once approved. I reside in a mortgage-free studio apartment and possess a €50,000 building-society savings contract with LBS, which I can assign as security.  

With no dependents other than my six-year-old nephew in Lagos, and a track record of on-time payments, I am confident of meeting the proposed €270 monthly installment (rate 2). My employer has provided a confirmation of permanent status enclosed herein.

I appreciate your attention and hope to join Deutsche Bank as a loyal customer.

Respectfully,  
Ing. Daniel Chinedu Okoro

Hamburg, 15 September 2025  

To whom it may concern,

My name is Alejandro Ortega, age 36, a Chilean national living in Hamburg since 2022. I have worked for five years as a senior customs officer at the Port of Hamburg Authority, earning €2,950 net. I request a €6,742 personal loan, repayable over 30 months, to purchase professional audio consoles and a 65-inch OLED reference screen for an educational Spanish-language web channel (radio/television).

I currently service two external loans: €3,400 remaining on a used car and €1,200 on dental work, both with Santander; payment history is flawless. I own my townhouse outright and hold a €60,000 endowment life-insurance policy. Though I lack a current account with your bank, I maintain meticulous financial records, copies attached.

The proposed installment of roughly €270 fits comfortably within my monthly surplus of €840. My employer’s HR department has provided written confirmation of my permanent contract and excellent conduct.

I would be honored to establish a lasting relationship with your institution.

Kind regards,  
Alejandro Ortega

Berlin, 16 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Tomasz Kowalski, a Polish national, single, 36 years old, living in Berlin for three years. For the past four years and three months I have been a certified network installer with Deutsche Telekom, earning €3,050 net. I respectfully apply for a €6,742 loan over 30 months to equip my home studio with a digital radio transmitter, mixing desk and antenna array for a bilingual (German-Polish) internet radio station.

My credit report lists two open loans with mBank Polska, both current. I possess a €75,000 building-society savings agreement with Schwäbisch Hall, available as collateral. My apartment is owned outright, and I have no other installment commitments.  

The requested monthly payment of approximately €270 represents less than 9 % of my income. Attached are employment verification, last twelve pay slips, and proof of residence. I may not yet have a checking account with your bank, but intend to transfer all banking activity upon approval.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am confident my stable employment and spotless payment history demonstrate my reliability.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Kowalski

Esteemed Loan Department,

My name is Sergei Petrov, a Russian software licensing officer at Bosch GmbH. I have held this position for five years and six months, earning a net monthly salary of €3,200. I am applying for a €6,742 loan, to be repaid over 30 months at installment rate 2, for the purchase of broadcast microphones, lighting and a 55-inch studio monitor needed to expand my part-time tech review channel (radio/television).

My financial obligations consist of two external credits with Commerzbank: €2,100 (education) and €4,000 (vehicle). Both accounts are impeccable. While I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I own my residence and maintain a €65,000 life-insurance policy with Nürnberger, which can serve as collateral.

After fixed expenses, I retain €1,000 disposable income monthly; the projected €270 payment is thus easily manageable. Enclosed you will find my employment contract, salary statements, and proof of property ownership.

I appreciate your consideration and hope to build a long-term banking relationship.

Warm regards,  
Sergei Petrov
