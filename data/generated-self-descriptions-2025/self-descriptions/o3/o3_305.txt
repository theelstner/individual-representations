Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Jens-Peter Vogel, 49, employed since March 2021 as a research technician at BASF’s Ludwigshafen plant. I am requesting a DM 1 038 loan to purchase a reliable Škoda Fabia for the daily 68-km commute to work and to visit my twelve-year-old son, who lives with his mother in Mainz.

Although my current checking account shows an overdraft of DM 430, my net monthly income of DM 4 250 covers all obligations. Besides the two small furniture loans I already hold with your bank (combined remaining balance DM 2 970), I have one external micro-credit of DM 600 that will be cleared in October. My life-insurance contract with Allianz (current surrender value DM 8 900) and a building-society agreement worth DM 12 400 serve as additional security.

I have never missed a payment in eight years of lending history. My co-applicant and cousin, Daniel Vogel, a civil servant, is prepared to stand surety for this loan. The requested instalment rate of 4% (DM 43 monthly) comfortably fits my budget once fuel and insurance savings from the new car are factored in.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our trustworthy relationship.

Sincerely,  
Jens-Peter Vogel

To the Credit Department,

I am Dr. Arman Thabet, a Tunisian-born German resident registered at your branch since 2022. For the past five years I have served as a senior customs officer at Hamburg Port, earning DM 4 700 net per month. I request a DM 1 038 loan to finance a new electric Renault Twingo that will replace my 20-year-old diesel, reducing operating costs and allowing safe transportation for my eight-year-old nephew, who lives with me.

My current checking balance is overdrawn by DM 190 following urgent dental surgery last month. Savings stand at DM 60, but I maintain a DM 15 000 building-society account with BHW and a life-insurance policy from Debeka (sum insured DM 50 000). I also hold two instalment loans with your bank—both serviced punctually—and a small DM 900 education loan at Sparkasse, due to be repaid this December.

With a fixed civil-service contract and automatic salary payment, I am a low-risk borrower. My sister, Leila Thabet (teacher, Beamtenstatus), will act as co-applicant, further strengthening the application. A 4 % instalment (DM 43 monthly) is easily covered; after fuel savings the net effect on my budget is positive.

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any clarification.

Respectfully,  
Dr. Arman Thabet

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Michael König, 49, single homeowner in Kassel since 2022. I have worked as a master electrician for Siemens Smart Infrastructure since April 2019, earning DM 4 350 net each month. I seek a DM 1 038 loan to buy a new company-approved VW Caddy so I can accept assignments requiring my own vehicle.

My account is currently DM 510 in the red due to recent roof repairs. I possess only DM 80 in my savings account, yet my LBS building-society contract (deposit DM 9 800) and Zurich life-insurance policy (paid-up value DM 7 600) provide solid collateral. Existing obligations include two household appliance loans with your bank (DM 61 and DM 73 monthly, both ending February 2026) and an external DM 1 100 bicycle loan at Volksbank, fully up-to-date.

A fixed employment contract, twelve years with the same employer, and unblemished payment history confirm my reliability. My brother Thomas, a state-certified architect, agrees to co-sign, further reducing risk. The proposed instalment of DM 43 fits well within my disposable income.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I would be pleased to discuss any details personally.

Kind regards,  
Michael König

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Farid Malik, naturalised German citizen, age 49, residing in my own apartment in Augsburg for three years. Since July 2020 I have been a floor supervisor at MAN Truck & Bus, annual net income DM 54 600 (~DM 4 550 monthly). I request DM 1 038 to purchase a new Hyundai i10, necessary to cover late shifts when public transport is unavailable and to drive my elderly father (dependent) to medical appointments.

My current account shows a negative balance of DM 380, primarily from recent school fees for a certification course. Savings are limited (DM 70), yet I maintain a DEVK life-insurance policy with a surrender value of DM 11 200 and a DM 14 000 Bausparvertrag. I have two existing consumer loans with your bank (furniture and laptop) and none elsewhere.

All instalments have been paid on schedule. My cousin and flatmate, Ali Khan (software engineer at Infineon), will act as co-applicant, providing a second income stream as security. The calculated repayment of DM 43 per month is affordable; upcoming overtime agreements will further boost my disposable cash.

I value the cooperative relationship with your institution and look forward to positive feedback.

With respect,  
Farid Malik

Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Heinrich Seifert, 49, single, residing in my own home in Erfurt since 2022. For the last four years I have served as a public-sector archivist at the Thuringian State Archives, earning DM 4 150 net per month. I apply for a DM 1 038 loan to purchase a Toyota Aygo, replacing my failing 2003 Opel and ensuring punctual attendance at remote archive depots.

At present my checking account is overdrawn by DM 220, and my savings balance is DM 55. However, my DEVK life-insurance policy (surrender value DM 9 300) and a Bausparkasse Mainz contract (current balance DM 10 600) provide financial backing. I carry two small loans with your bank (garden tools and washing machine) and one DM 700 photo-equipment loan at Commerzbank, all serviced without delay.

A permanent civil-service contract and consistent payment record underline my creditworthiness. My brother, Dr. Klaus Seifert, a university lecturer, consents to co-sign for additional security. The monthly instalment of around DM 43 aligns comfortably with my budget, especially because vehicle maintenance costs will decrease by an estimated DM 35.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for further information and hope to continue our successful cooperation.

Faithfully yours,  
Heinrich Seifert
