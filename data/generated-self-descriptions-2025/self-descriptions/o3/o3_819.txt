Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Lopez, a 24-year-old audio-technician employed by Berlin Broadcasting Service since August 2020, earning 1 950 DM net per month. I seek a loan of 1 554 DM to purchase a smart television and digital radio needed for my remote-production duties and for my six-year-old son’s distance-learning classes.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I have two instalment loans here (washing machine and bicycle, totalling 1 250 DM) and have never missed a payment. A mobile-phone debt placed me in “critical” status in 2021, but it was settled in full last December. My only other obligation is a 64 DM monthly furniture payment ending March 2026.

I rent a flat in Prenzlauer Allee, have lived there two years, own a paid-off 2012 Ford Fiesta worth about 2 800 DM and keep 85 DM in savings. I can allocate 130 DM a month to the new loan, well within the required rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 030-46 12 89 for any clarification.

Sincerely,
Maria Lopez


Dear Loan Officer,

I, Anna Petrova (born 12 March 2001), have been a junior clerk at the Munich Municipal Housing Office since June 2018, earning 2 100 DM net monthly. I request 1 554 DM to buy a DAB+ radio and 4K television that will support my on-line study and my two-year-old daughter’s educational programs.

I rent a flat in Sendling (two years), own a 2015 Toyota Yaris, and keep 71 DM in savings. I have two punctual instalment contracts with your bank (sofa and refrigerator, 28 DM and 33 DM) and a student loan elsewhere (870 DM) paid on time. Though I lack a checking account, my civil-service contract and spotless five-year repayment record prove reliability. I can easily meet a 128 DM monthly instalment.

Thank you for your kind attention.

Respectfully,
Anna Petrova

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Sara Ahmed, divorced mother of one, employed full-time as a laboratory research assistant at Hannover Medical School since May 2019, with a steady net income of 1 880 DM per month. I seek a 1 554 DM loan to buy a smart TV and radio microphone for continuing-education webinars and to launch a science-outreach podcast.

I hold two small loans with your bank (fridge and car repairs) serviced flawlessly, despite having no checking account. A 2020 mobile bill once flagged my file as critical; it has long been cleared. I rent a flat (two years), own a 2014 Opel Corsa, and maintain 52 DM in a savings passbook. With ample disposable income, a 120 DM monthly repayment is comfortable.

I appreciate your consideration and remain available on 0511-88 77 66.

Kind regards,
Sara Ahmed


Esteemed Sir or Madam,

I am Katarzyna Nowak, 24, married, and a certified bookbinder at Gutenberg Printworks GmbH, Leipzig, since November 2019, earning 1 730 DM net. I request 1 554 DM to replace our outdated TV with an energy-efficient model that will also support my distance-learning design classes.

I rent a flat where we have lived two years, own a 2011 Renault Clio, and have 64 DM in savings. Two current loans with your bank (washing machine and dental costs) are paid punctually. One mail-order credit (290 DM) is equally up-to-date. Though I keep no checking account, my four-year stable employment and perfect repayment history show I can meet the expected 125 DM monthly instalment.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Sincerely,
Katarzyna Nowak

Dear Lending Department,

I am Elena Dimitrova, 24-year-old customs officer at Hamburg Port Authority since February 2021, earning 2 050 DM net. I seek 1 554 DM to buy an HD television and receiver that will serve both personal use and an evening electronics-repair course I teach, boosting my income.

I rent a studio in Altona (two years), own a 2013 Skoda Fabia, and hold 92 DM in savings. Two existing loans with your bank total 62 DM monthly and are spotless. A 2021 telecom debt that once marked my file as critical was settled the same year. The new loan would bring my total credit outlay to roughly 185 DM—under 9 % of my take-home pay.

With secure public employment and proven payment discipline, I am confident of meeting all obligations. I am reachable at 040-77 44 22 for further information.

Respectfully,
Elena Dimitrova
