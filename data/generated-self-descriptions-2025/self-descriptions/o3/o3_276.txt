Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Thomas Becker, 34, divorced and living with my eight-year-old son in the terraced house I bought last spring in Mainz. A burst water pipe last month damaged the roof timbers and interior walls. The insurance covers only part of the cost; the remaining estimate amounts to 11,998 DM, which is the sum I am applying for over 30 months.

I have been working as a forklift operator for RheinMain Depot GmbH since June last year and earn a steady 2,850 DM net each month. Although my current checking account shows a debit balance of about 400 DM – caused by the emergency repairs already started – I have a clean repayment record; the 5,000 DM consumer loan I took in 2020 was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I hold no other installment plans and my monthly budget allows a rate of 450 DM comfortably.

I can be reached at 06131-55 88 37 for any further questions and will gladly provide the repair quotations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker


Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Jens Fischer, 34, divorced, and responsible for my six-year-old daughter. One year ago I moved into a small condominium in Kassel. The building’s outdated electrical wiring has to be replaced urgently, and the roof insulation is below code. The craftsmen’s invoices add up to 11,998 DM, which I request as a repair loan for 30 months.

Since August last year I have been employed full-time as a kitchen assistant at St. Mary’s Hospital, earning 2,400 DM net monthly. Apart from my current running overdraft of 350 DM, I have no debts other than a 3,000 DM furniture loan with your bank that I completed without a single late payment. My monthly household budget leaves approx. 500 DM after all fixed costs, sufficient for the agreed installment.

My telephone number is 0561-34 98 21. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss any details and hope to continue my good relationship with your bank.

Kind regards,
Jens Fischer


To the Credit Department,

My name is Michael Lange, 34, separated, father of a nine-year-old boy. Twelve months ago I purchased an older single-family home in Chemnitz. The heating boiler has failed and the windows need replacement before winter; the certified quotation totals 11,998 DM. I therefore apply for a 30-month repair loan.

I have been working since May last year as a track maintenance helper for Deutsche Bahn Service GmbH, taking home 3,000 DM net each month. My checking account is presently overdrawn by 480 DM due to the initial emergency work, but I have an impeccable credit history: the 4,200 DM car loan with your bank was repaid on time earlier this year. I have no other obligations and am willing to set up automatic deductions on payday, demonstrating my reliability.

Thank you for your time and trust. I am reachable at 0371-77 20 66.

Respectfully,
Michael Lange


Dear Credit Team,

I, Ronny Schulz, 34 years old and legally separated, live with my ten-year-old son in the small row house I bought last summer in Halle. A recent building inspection revealed moisture damage in the cellar walls and outdated plumbing. The necessary repairs sum up to 11,998 DM; hence my request for a 30-month loan.

For the past nine months I have been employed as a parcel sorter at LogiPack AG, earning 2,650 DM net. My account shows a minus of 300 DM after paying the surveyor, yet my financial conduct is solid: I finished paying a 2,500 DM consumer credit last December without incident. I have no guarantors, no other installment contracts and can comfortably meet a monthly rate of roughly 420 DM.

I look forward to your positive response and am available at 0345-62 61 09 at any time.

Sincerely,
Ronny Schulz


Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Patrick Mayer, 34, divorced, with responsibility for my seven-year-old daughter. One year ago I moved into a modest owner-occupied flat in Augsburg. The façade needs urgent concrete repairs and the bathroom piping must be replaced; the certified contractor’s estimate amounts to 11,998 DM. I therefore apply for a 30-month repair loan.

Since July last year I have been employed as a press-room helper at StadtZeitung Druck GmbH, bringing home 2,700 DM net monthly. My checking account is currently 420 DM in the red because of advance deposits to the contractor. Apart from the overdraft I owe nothing except a 3,300 DM loan I repaid to your bank in March without a single delay. I have saved a small emergency fund of 90 DM and manage my finances carefully; the proposed installment fits my budget by a comfortable margin.

I am committed to honoring every payment and welcome any additional documentation you may require. You can reach me at 0821-65 43 27.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Patrick Mayer
