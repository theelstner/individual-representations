To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Alexandru Popescu, a Romanian national who has lived in Stuttgart for the past two years. I am 42 years old, single, and the father of two children who live with me every other weekend. Since 2015 I have been employed as a certified industrial electrician at Bosch GmbH (ten years of continuous service).  

I am applying for a loan of 3 446 DM, to be repaid over 36 months, to furnish the attic apartment that I have recently converted in the house I own in Bad Cannstatt. I exhausted my small savings during the renovation and my current checking account is 230 DM in overdraft; my savings account holds only 74 DM. Nevertheless, my net monthly salary of 4 050 DM comfortably covers the planned instalment of roughly 115 DM plus all regular expenses.  

I have one previous loan with your bank (7 000 DM, 2019–2023) that I repaid without a single delay. I hold full-time permanent status, receive annual profit-sharing, and possess a 2017 Opel Astra without any lien. These factors, together with my flawless credit record, demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace landline any weekday after 16:00.  

Sincerely,  
Alexandru Popescu

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Miguel Santos, a Portuguese citizen and resident of Cologne since 2023. For the past eight years I have worked as a senior customs officer at the Federal Customs Office in Düsseldorf. At 42, single, with two dependent children who live in Portugal, I seek a loan of 3 446 DM for the purchase of office furniture and computer equipment needed for a part-time translation business I run from my home.  

My current account stands 160 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is 58 DM, as I recently paid school fees for my daughters. My gross monthly income is 5 200 DM (civil-service pay grade A9), which allows ample room for the proposed 36-month repayment plan of about 115 DM.  

I have held one prior credit with your bank (5 000 DM, 2020–2022) that was serviced impeccably. I own a small terraced house in Porz and a 2016 VW Passat outright. My permanent civil-service status, together with an unblemished credit history, underlines my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Santos

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Marek Kowalski, a Polish engineer employed as a CNC programming specialist at ZF Friedrichshafen AG for the past nine years. I am 42 years old, single, with two dependent teenage sons who live with me. I request a credit of 3 446 DM, repayable over 36 months, to purchase new bedroom and study furniture after water damage destroyed the old sets.  

I currently have a 310 DM overdraft and only 92 DM in a savings passbook. My net salary is 4 400 DM monthly, plus variable overtime, making the projected instalment of c. 115 DM easily affordable.  

In 2018 I financed my car (a 2018 Škoda Octavia) through your bank and completed all payments by May 2022, never missing a due date. Owning my condominium in Friedrichshafen and having stable long-term employment affirm my financial solidity.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to supply any additional documentation you may require.  

Kind regards,  
Marek Kowalski

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Ivan Petrov, a Bulgarian citizen who has resided in Nürnberg for two years. For eleven consecutive years I have been a laboratory technician with the Bavarian State Water Authority, earning a steady net income of 3 850 DM per month. I am 42, single, and support two children living with their mother in Bulgaria.  

I request a 3 446 DM loan over 36 months to equip my newly purchased flat with essential appliances and shelving. My checking account is currently 190 DM in the red, and my savings stand at 61 DM after covering relocation costs.  

In 2019 I took a 6 000 DM education loan at this bank and repaid it four months early in 2022. I hold a permanent civil-service contract, own a 2015 Ford Focus, and have no other debts. These facts, together with my punctual repayment record, make me a reliable candidate.  

Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Shyam Lal, an Indian national who has worked as a senior railway signal inspector with Deutsche Bahn in Munich since 2014 (over nine years of uninterrupted service). I am 42 years old, single, and responsible for two dependent nephews studying in India.  

I am applying for a loan of 3 446 DM, repayable in 36 equal monthly instalments (~115 DM), to purchase ergonomic furniture and audio-visual equipment for a distance-learning course I will soon begin. My current cheque account shows a 275 DM overdraft, and I keep only 83 DM in a savings book after recently paying university fees for my nephews. My net monthly income is 4 600 DM, guaranteeing comfortable coverage of the new instalment.  

In 2020 I financed a 2017 BMW 1-Series through your institution and fully repaid the 8 500 DM loan by August 2023 without incident. I own a small condominium in Pasing and have no other obligations. My stable public-sector employment and spotless repayment record testify to my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my request. I remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Shyam Lal
