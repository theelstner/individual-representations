Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,217 DM to purchase a new refrigerator and washing machine after both appliances failed within weeks of each other. I have compared prices and secured a dealer discount that makes it sensible to buy now rather than in installments from the store.

I have worked for the Schwäbisch Hall Parks Department as a grounds‐maintenance supervisor for the past two years, earning a net monthly salary of 2,650 DM. My wife contributes a further 1,000 DM through part-time office work. Although my checking account is presently overdrawn by 230 DM and our savings stand at only 72 DM, all previous obligations—including a 2019 renovation loan with your bank—were repaid on schedule. I own our family home, purchased in 2016, and have lived there for three years.

With one dependent son and no other installment plans, I can comfortably meet a 4 % installment rate, which I will service via automatic transfer from my salary account. My stable employment, spotless repayment record, and real-estate collateral make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available by telephone at any time.

Sincerely,  
Karl Becker

Esteemed Loan Committee,

I respectfully request a 1,217 DM consumer loan to replace our 25-year-old kitchen stove and fit a small dishwasher. These upgrades will reduce energy costs and help me care for my eight-year-old daughter after the passing of my wife last year.

Since March 2021 I have been employed as a smelter’s assistant at Ruhrstahl GmbH, earning 2,800 DM net per month with a permanent contract. My checking account shows a current overdraft of 415 DM resulting from funeral expenses, and my savings total 39 DM. Nevertheless, the 2018 furniture loan I took through your bank was settled four months early. I own my house outright and have resided there for three years.

A monthly installment of 4 % of the principal (approximately 49 DM) fits easily within my budget. My punctual payment record and stable income demonstrate my creditworthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I can be reached by telephone for any further information.

Respectfully,  
Antonio Russo

Dear Banking Team,

I am seeking a loan of 1,217 DM to purchase an energy-efficient freezer and a clothes dryer for our household. These items will replace outdated units that have become costly to repair.

I have served as a night security guard at Thüringer Logistik GmbH for three years, drawing a net monthly wage of 2,450 DM plus regular overtime. My wife earns 900 DM as a preschool aide. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 120 DM and we have only 55 DM in savings, every prior credit (a 2017 roofing loan with you) was repaid precisely as scheduled. We own our residence and have lived there since 2020.

With no other debts and one dependent child, I can commit to the 4 % repayment rate, which amounts to roughly 49 DM per month, deducted automatically on payday.

I appreciate your consideration and remain available by phone for additional details.

Kind regards,  
Markus Klein

Dear Loan Officer,

Please accept my application for a 1,217 DM loan to buy a combined washer-dryer and a small chest freezer. These appliances will improve household efficiency while freeing space for my wife’s home-based tailoring work.

I have been employed as a forklift operator at Delta Logistics AG since November 2022, earning 2,600 DM net monthly under a permanent contract. My current account is overdrawn by 305 DM, and my savings balance is 68 DM. However, the renovation loan I took with your bank in 2019 was paid punctually. I own my house, where we have resided for the past three years, and carry no other installment obligations.

A 4 % installment equals about 49 DM monthly, well within my disposable income. My spotless credit history, regular income, and property ownership make me a secure borrower.

Thank you for your time. You can reach me at the telephone number on file.

Sincerely,  
Victor Hwang

Honorable Members of the Credit Department,

I am applying for a 1,217 DM personal loan to replace our broken oven and to purchase a vacuum cleaner suitable for allergy sufferers. These appliances are necessary for maintaining our household after my wife’s recent surgery.

I have worked as a janitor at the district technical school since May 2020, earning a stable net income of 2,300 DM per month plus annual bonuses. Despite a current overdraft of 190 DM and minimal savings of 24 DM, I have never missed or delayed a payment, including the 2016 heating-system loan previously obtained from your branch. We have owned our detached house for over three years and have one dependent son.

With no other installment plans, a 4 % repayment rate (circa 49 DM monthly) poses no strain on my budget. My unblemished repayment record, steady employment, and home ownership underline my reliability.

I look forward to your favorable response and am available by telephone for any clarification.

With respect,  
Jürgen Schäfer
