Frankfurt, 14 September 1995  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ana-Maria Popescu, a 25-year-old Romanian national who has lived and worked in Frankfurt for the past three years. Since February I have been employed full-time as a warehouse assistant at Hessische Logistik GmbH, earning a net salary of 2,100 DM that is paid directly into my checking account at your branch. For more than twelve months this account has maintained a balance above 200 DM, and my earlier furniture loan of 3,000 DM was repaid two weeks ahead of schedule.  

I request a loan of 2,327 DM over 15 months to purchase a new Grundig radio/television set. My six-year-old TV can no longer be repaired, and reliable news and entertainment are important for both me and my six-year-old son.  

Although I have been in my current job for only seven months, my employment contract is permanent and my supervisor can confirm my good performance. I own the 48 m² apartment at Limesstraße 22, valued at approximately 95,000 DM and free of encumbrances, which demonstrates my long-term stability in Germany. I hold no other debts, my savings account of 87 DM remains active, and I am comfortable with the proposed installment rate of 2 (about 160 DM monthly), which fits well within my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at the branch any afternoon after 16:00 to provide additional documentation.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ana-Maria Popescu

Stuttgart, 12 September 1995  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Pilar Martínez, a separated 25-year-old Spanish citizen residing at my own small house on Birkenweg 7, Stuttgart, since 1992. I seek a loan of 2,327 DM for the purchase of a combined radio and television set that will also allow language-learning programs for my eight-year-old daughter.  

I have worked as a kitchen helper at Hotel Schwabenhof since November last year, earning 1,950 DM net. My salary has been credited to my checking account with you for the past thirteen months, always leaving a positive balance above 300 DM. In 1993 I took a 2,500 DM education loan from this bank and repaid it on time in May 1995.  

I possess the title to my 54 m² house, estimated at 110,000 DM, and carry no other installment obligations. Apart from a modest savings account of 54 DM, my finances are devoted to household expenses and school costs; nevertheless, the planned monthly payment of roughly 155 DM is well within my disposable income.  

My reliable repayment history, stable residence, and property ownership make me a low-risk client. I would appreciate your favorable consideration and am prepared to submit payslips and reference letters at your earliest convenience.  

Kind regards,  
Pilar Martínez

Munich, 10 September 1995  

To the Loan Department,  

My name is Ivana Petrović, divorced, age 25, and currently employed as a room attendant at Flughafen München GmbH since January. I earn 2,020 DM net, transferred directly to my checking account with your bank, which I have held for 18 months. The balance has never fallen below 250 DM.  

In 1994 I obtained a 1,800 DM loan here to repair my roof and repaid every installment on the due date. I now request 2,327 DM over 15 months to buy a new Philips radio/television set; the old unit failed during last month’s thunderstorms. Access to broadcasts is essential for me to follow German language courses at home while caring for my five-year-old son.  

Although my tenure at the airport is eight months, my contract is open-ended and accompanied by union job security. I own a 50 m² condominium at Lilienstraße 4 valued at 98,000 DM, free of mortgages. I carry no other debt, have no telephone, and maintain a small savings balance of 63 DM. The proposed payment of about 160 DM represents less than 8 % of my net income, ensuring comfortable servicing of the loan.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Ivana Petrović

Hamburg, 11 September 1995  

Esteemed Committee,  

I am Mei-Lin Zhang, a married Chinese citizen living in Hamburg since 1992. I own a modest terraced house at Hafenstraße 56, purchased with family savings. For the past nine months I have been employed as a production line operative at HanseTextil AG, with a net monthly income of 1,980 DM sent to my checking account at your institution, which I opened in July 1994.  

I respectfully apply for a 2,327 DM loan payable over 15 months to buy a Sony Trinitron TV-radio combo. My husband is a seafarer frequently away, and reliable communication through televised news is important for our four-year-old daughter and me.  

My previous credit experience—a 2,200 DM appliance loan taken in 1993—was honored without any delay. Presently I hold no other installment obligations, and my savings account stands at 72 DM. The proposed monthly installment fits well within our household budget, leaving more than 65 % of income for living costs.  

I believe my solid repayment history, property ownership, and stable salary make me a dependable borrower. Supporting documents, including employment confirmation and property deed, are ready for your inspection.  

With thanks for your consideration,  
Mei-Lin Zhang

Düsseldorf, 13 September 1995  

Dear Banking Officers,  

I am Katarina Novak, a 25-year-old Croatian citizen, widowed since 1993, residing in my own apartment at Kastanienallee 19 for the past three years. I currently work as a cleaning services employee for RheinCare GmbH, having started in December last year. My net monthly wage is 1,870 DM, credited directly to my current account with you; the account has maintained a steady balance above 200 DM for over a year.  

I request a loan of 2,327 DM for 15 months to purchase a combined radio/television set. My existing television stopped functioning, and as I have no telephone, this device is my primary source of information and entertainment for myself and my seven-year-old son.  

In 1994 I took a 2,600 DM personal loan from this bank to finance minor renovations on my flat and repaid it last month, ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and only 59 DM in my savings account. My property is valued at approximately 92,000 DM and is mortgage-free. The calculated monthly installment of around 160 DM represents less than 9 % of my income, leaving ample room for household expenses.  

I trust that my clean payment record, stable residence, and property ownership will meet your lending criteria. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully yours,  
Katarina Novak
