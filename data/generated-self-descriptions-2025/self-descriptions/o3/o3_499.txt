Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Giovanni Rossi, 40, an Italian mechanical technician employed by Siemens Turbomachinery in Munich since March 2018. I own a small terraced house in Neufahrn and have one son (Luca, 9) whom I support. I am requesting a 1 585 EUR loan over 24 months to buy wardrobes, a desk, and shelving after finally finishing the attic renovation.  

Although I keep no German checking account and once had a “critical” mobile-phone loan in Italy, I have held two personal loans with your bank since 2021 and have never missed a single payment. My net income is 2 350 EUR per month; the new installment of about 90 EUR will stay well within the 4 % limit of my salary. Alongside my life-insurance policy and a building-society savings contract worth 4 200 EUR, these facts underline my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Giovanni Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, a 40-year-old Polish postal clerk employed by Deutsche Post in Leipzig since June 2019. Having purchased my own flat three years ago, I now wish to furnish the nursery for my four-year-old daughter Zofia and replace our worn-out washing machine. For this I seek a loan of 1 585 EUR to be repaid within 24 months.  

My monthly net salary is 2 090 EUR, and I have respected every deadline on the two consumer loans I already hold with your institution. Apart from a still-open Polish credit card (fully serviced), I carry no other debt. I do not yet operate a checking account in Germany, preferring a prepaid card, but I am prepared to open one at your branch if required. With a life-insurance policy valued at 6 800 EUR and regular contributions to a Bausparvertrag, I believe I present a secure risk profile.  

Thank you for your time and favourable evaluation.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, 40, Egyptian research assistant at the University of Hamburg’s Faculty of Chemistry since February 2017. I recently converted the guest room of my owner-occupied apartment into a small home laboratory and need 1 585 EUR for lab-grade desks, cabinets, and ventilation equipment. I plan to repay the amount in 24 monthly installments.  

I earn 2 420 EUR net, hold a Bauspar contract (current value 5 100 EUR) and a term-life policy that protects my nine-year-old daughter Amina. I have two existing loans with your bank, both serviced punctually; my Schufa shows one past-due electricity bill from 2015 that has been settled. The new installment, about 88 EUR, remains below 4 % of my income, leaving ample room for unforeseen costs.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Miguel Santos, a 40-year-old Portuguese chef employed at the Augsburg Municipal Hospital cafeteria since October 2019. I own a small house near the clinic and support my eight-year-old son Tiago. I request a 1 585 EUR loan for 24 months to purchase new kitchen appliances and living-room furniture after recent water damage.  

My net monthly pay is 1 980 EUR. I service two loans with your bank—both in perfect standing—and have no other payment obligations in Germany except a low-balance Portuguese micro-loan. I keep savings in a building-society agreement (3 900 EUR) and maintain a life-insurance policy naming my son as beneficiary. Though I use only a prepaid Mastercard and no checking account, my punctual history shows I am a dependable client. The proposed installment of roughly 90 EUR fits the 4 % affordability guideline.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Warm regards,  
Miguel Santos

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,  

I am Ivan Petrov, 40, a Bulgarian train dispatcher employed by Deutsche Bahn in Frankfurt (Oder) since January 2018. After moving into my own semi-detached house three years ago, I now need 1 585 EUR to equip the study and replace the living-room sofa. I wish to repay the sum over 24 months.  

My monthly net salary stands at 2 310 EUR. I have two active instalment loans with your bank dating from 2021; every payment has reached you on or before its due date. Outside Germany I have one small credit line, classified earlier as critical but now current. I hold a life-insurance policy of 10 000 EUR and a Bauspar balance of 4 600 EUR. Without a checking account I manage finances via SEPA direct debit from my savings, a system that has worked flawlessly. The new repayment, under 4 % of income, is comfortably affordable.  

I trust this record demonstrates my reliability and hope for a positive reply.  

With respectful greetings,  
Ivan Petrov
