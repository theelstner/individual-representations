Karlsruhe, 12 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Johann Müller, a 39-year-old Austrian citizen who has worked as a mechanical technician at Daimler Truck AG in Wörth for the past eight years. I am applying for a 2 522 DM loan over 30 months to purchase a new combined radio and television set for my home.

My current net income is 4 200 DM per month. Although my checking account is presently overdrawn by 210 DM, I have never missed a repayment; the 1 800 DM loan I took with your bank in 2020 for a washing machine was settled exactly on schedule. Apart from a small savings balance of 63 DM, my principal security consists of an ongoing building-society savings contract (Bausparsumme 30 000 DM, paid in for nine years) and the apartment I bought three years ago.  

I support two children who live with their mother in Vienna, but my monthly obligations leave a comfortable margin—an installment rate of 1 would amount to barely five percent of my disposable income. My colleague Herr Peter Auer, master mechanic at our plant, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.

My stable long-term employment, flawless credit record and existing collateral make me a reliable candidate. I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for any further information.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely  
Johann Müller

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Mateusz Kowalski, a single 39-year-old Polish national, employed as an IT systems analyst at Charité University Hospital for nine years. I request a 2 522 DM loan (30-month term) to buy an advanced television and DAB+ radio set that I will also use for the tele-medical tutorials I prepare for the hospital.

My average net salary is 4 600 DM. The balance on my checking account is currently –35 DM due to a recent annual transport ticket payment, and my savings account holds 91 DM. Four years ago I took a 2 000 DM personal loan from your branch for professional certification courses and repaid every installment punctually.  

I own a small condominium in Lichtenberg, purchased with my building-society savings plan, and hold a life-insurance policy with a guaranteed value of 45 000 DM. With no other installment obligations, the proposed repayment rate will fit easily into my monthly budget. My brother, Dr. Piotr Kowalski (physician at the same hospital), has signed a guarantor statement.

A decade of steady employment, a clean repayment history, and tangible assets underline my creditworthiness. I would be grateful for a positive decision and can present all supporting documents at your convenience.

Kind regards  
Mateusz Kowalski

Stuttgart, 16 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Miguel Santos, 39 years old, originally from Portugal and head chef at the Stuttgart Marriott Hotel, where I have been employed for ten years. I seek a 2 522 DM loan over 30 months to acquire a high-definition television and digital radio. The equipment will allow me to film in-house cooking tutorials for my apprentices and stream culinary courses.

My monthly net income is 3 800 DM. After paying school fees for my two children, my checking account shows an overdraft of 115 DM, while my savings balance is 54 DM. In 2019 I obtained a 1 500 DM loan from your bank to replace kitchen appliances at home and repaid it three months ahead of schedule.

I reside in a terraced house I purchased three years ago; the equity is supplemented by a building-society contract worth 28 000 DM that has been funded since 2014. My longtime colleague Frau Claudia Meier, restaurant manager, has agreed to act as guarantor.

My stable career in a reputable hotel, proven repayment discipline, and existing collateral assure you of my reliability. I look forward to favorable consideration.

Sincerely  
Miguel Santos

Nuremberg, 18 September 2025

Dear Loans Department,

My name is Petar Ivanov, a 39-year-old Bulgarian citizen. For seven and a half years I have worked as an electrical maintenance supervisor at Siemens Energy in Erlangen. I am applying for a 2 522 DM, 30-month loan to purchase a combined radio and television set that will support both my sons’ German-language learning and my evening engineering courses.

I earn a steady 4 000 DM net each month. Following recent dental expenses, my checking account stands at –320 DM; my passbook savings contain 79 DM. I previously took a 1 700 DM loan from your branch in 2021 for a work laptop and repaid it early.

I own a small detached house bought three years ago, backed by a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 38 500 DM. With no other installment plans outstanding, the requested repayment will be easily covered. My cousin Georgi Petrov, a chartered accountant in Munich, has formally agreed to guarantee the loan.

Consistent income, property assets, and a spotless credit record qualify me as a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully  
Petar Ivanov

Frankfurt am Main, 19 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Luca Rossi, 39, an Italian national employed as an administrative officer at the Frankfurt City Housing Authority for eight years. I respectfully request a 2 522 DM loan over 30 months to purchase a modern television and radio system for my recently renovated flat, which I also rent to conference visitors during trade-fair weeks.

My net monthly salary is 4 100 DM. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 60 DM, and my passbook shows 90 DM. In 2020 I obtained a 2 050 DM renovation loan from your bank and repaid it in full without delay.

I own my condominium, supported by a building-society savings agreement (current balance 19 800 DM) and a life-insurance policy valued at 42 000 DM. With no other active installment plans, the requested repayment rate is comfortably within my budget. My colleague Herr Thomas Weber, senior accountant at the authority, has signed on as guarantor.

My long, uninterrupted public-sector employment, proven repayment discipline, and existing collateral underscore my reliability. I would greatly appreciate your positive response.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely  
Luca Rossi
