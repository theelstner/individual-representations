Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Irene Keller, 60, divorced, and the senior research officer at Württemberg Municipal Water Authority, a position I have held for the past eight years. I am requesting a loan of 14 782 DM over 60 months to fund the purchase of specialized monitoring equipment for a side-business I am launching with my son: environmental-impact assessments for medium-sized engineering firms.  

I currently keep a checking balance that fluctuates between 120 DM and 180 DM and maintain a savings account of 370 DM. Although modest, these figures reflect my habit of keeping the bulk of my salary—net 7 900 DM per month—in a salary account with payroll-linked automatic transfers. My accommodation is a caretaker’s flat provided free by the Authority, so my fixed monthly expenses are limited to 340 DM (utilities, insurance, and an existing 3 % installment on a small 4 000 DM education loan, which has never been in arrears).  

Over the past decade I have taken two loans with your bank, each repaid in full and ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, and my telephone line is registered under my name. With only one dependent—my university-enrolled daughter—I can comfortably service a 3 % installment rate for the requested loan.  

I value the trust your bank has placed in me in the past and look forward to deepening that relationship. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Irene Keller

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Captain Martina Voss, 60, married, and for the past nine years I have served as operations officer for NordHanse Rail Logistics. I seek a 14 782 DM loan, repayable over 60 months, to help my sister and me modernize our late father’s small fishing cottage into a certified holiday rental.  

My current Girokonto with your branch averages 40–90 DM because I redirect my 8 500 DM monthly salary into two places: a 250 DM savings plan (now at 290 DM) and tuition for my dependent grandson. I reside rent-free aboard company-provided staff quarters, incurring only 510 DM in living costs.  

I have maintained two prior credit agreements with you—the last one for a hybrid vehicle—which I repaid punctually. I shoulder no other loans, pledges, or guarantor obligations. A small 3 % installment plan with your bank for home appliances ends in March 2026; its payments have never been missed.  

Given my stable managerial income, minimal outgoings, and flawless credit history, I am confident of meeting a monthly installment of roughly 300 DM on this new loan. Your continued confidence will allow me to develop an asset that will generate supplementary retirement income.  

Thank you for your time and favorable review.  

Respectfully,  
Captain Martina Voss

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Frau Sabine Ortega, 60, separated, and founder of Ortega Language Consulting, a firm I have managed successfully for 15 years. I request a loan of 14 782 DM for 60 months to expand our online course platform to Latin-American markets—specifically licensing new server space and marketing content.  

My personal checking account with you normally shows between 70 DM and 160 DM at month-end because I transfer earnings into business operations and a modest 410 DM savings account. The firm pays me 9 200 DM net monthly and covers my rent-free office apartment, so my personal liabilities are limited to food, insurance, and a 3 % installment on a 5 000 DM business laptop loan—fully up to date.  

I have twice borrowed from your institution and repaid each loan early. No liens, guarantors, or outstanding debts exist in my name. My dependent son is financially independent after completing his apprenticeship this spring.  

By projecting conservative revenue growth of 12 % next year, I can comfortably meet monthly payments of about 300 DM. I am committed to transparent reporting and will gladly provide quarterly statements as reassurance.  

Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to continuing our mutually beneficial partnership.  

Cordially,  
Sabine Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dipl.-Ing. Brigitte Hahn, 60, divorced, and chief maintenance manager at Saxon Aerospace Components, where I have been employed for eight years. I seek a 14 782 DM loan over 60 months to finance equipment for a home-based metal-works hobby that I intend to turn into a certified small enterprise upon retirement.  

My checking account balance ranges between 30 DM and 150 DM, while my passbook savings stand at 155 DM. I earn 7 600 DM net monthly, and my employer provides a rent-free company flat adjacent to the plant. My only current obligation is a 3 % installment on a 3 200 DM electric-bike loan with your bank, showing perfect payment history.  

I have held two previous credits with you—both settled in full. I possess no property, but likewise carry no additional debt nor act as guarantor for anyone. My teenage granddaughter lives with me as my single dependent; her expenses are fully budgeted.  

With fixed costs well below 20 % of my income, I can easily accommodate a new 60-month repayment schedule. My disciplined repayment record demonstrates reliability, and my stable employment ensures steady cash flow.  

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Dipl.-Ing. Brigitte Hahn

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Frau Anneliese Kim, 60, married, and co-owner of Kim & Partner Tax Advisory, a practice I have managed for nine years. I request a 14 782 DM loan, repayable over 60 months, to finance a secure cloud server and compliance software needed under the new federal digital-archiving mandate.  

My giro account seldom exceeds 190 DM, as I allocate income to quarterly tax set-asides and a 280 DM savings account. My personal draw from the firm averages 10 400 DM net per month. Because I live rent-free in an apartment attached to my husband’s family home, our monthly household expenses are modest, and I maintain a single 3 % installment plan (1 800 DM remaining) with your bank for office furniture—never late.  

The two prior loans I took with you (office renovation 2017, vehicle upgrade 2020) were repaid exactly on schedule. I have no other bank relationships, guarantor duties, or outstanding liabilities. One adult daughter remains my dependent while finishing her master’s degree.  

With strong, verifiable cash flow, a flawless repayment record, and professional expertise in financial compliance, I am a low-risk candidate. The requested funds will directly enhance the practice’s revenue and safeguard client data.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive reply and continued cooperation.  

Warm regards,  
Frau Anneliese Kim
