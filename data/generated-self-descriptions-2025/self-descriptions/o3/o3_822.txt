Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 1 101 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a reliable Opel Corsa for my daily 60 km commute between the Brandenburg Police Academy, where I teach traffic-safety courses, and the Potsdam precinct, where I serve on night duty. My wife Julia and I have one three-year-old son; dependable transport is essential for both my shift work and our family’s safety.

Financially, I have worked as a police officer (grade A8) for 2 years 7 months, earning a net salary of 3 200 DM. We own a small terraced house in Falkensee, financed partly by two existing loans with your bank (a 2019 mortgage and a 2022 furniture loan). Both are in good standing; every installment has been paid early. Apart from 62 DM in my savings book, I hold no checking account but will gladly open one if the loan is granted. I carry no other debts and have never missed a payment.

The requested amount will be repaid in twelve monthly installments of aprox. 95 DM, comfortably below 3 % of my income. My solid public-sector employment, spotless repayment record, and real-estate collateral underline my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time should you need further documentation.

Sincerely,  
Florian Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a loan of 1 101 DM for 12 months to finance a new Škoda Fabia combi. As a certified electrician at Deutsche Bahn Facility Management, I am on call across Saxony; my current 1999 vehicle broke down beyond economic repair. Prompt mobility is a prerequisite for my job and for taking our six-year-old daughter to school while my wife Katharina manages a bakery.

I have been with Deutsche Bahn for 1 year 11 months, earning a stable net income of 3 000 DM. We own a 70 m² condo in Leipzig-Mockau (purchased 2021). I have two active micro-credits with your bank (a 2022 laptop loan and a 2023 holiday loan); both are paid on schedule. My savings account holds 48 DM; I maintain no checking account, but my salary is transferred to my wife’s account and could just as easily be switched.

The planned monthly payment of roughly 92 DM fits well within our household budget. My unblemished credit history, permanent employment with a state-owned company, and property ownership make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Mark Weiß

Dear Ms. Engel,

I would like to obtain a 1 101 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta for family and duty use. As a customs official at Main-Franken Customs Office (employment duration : 3 years 2 months, salary 3 350 DM net), I regularly inspect warehouses in rural areas where public transport is nonexistent. My wife and I have a two-year-old son; reliable transportation is critical.

My financial position is solid. We own a small semi-detached house, valued at approx. 140 000 DM, with a mortgage held elsewhere. I currently have two small loans with your bank—one for home insulation, one for a washing machine—both serviced flawlessly. I hold 71 DM in a savings book and no checking account. I carry no other liabilities.

At 92 DM per month, the car loan represents less than 3 % of my net salary. My civil-service status, excellent repayment record, and property backing demonstrate my creditworthiness.

I appreciate your favorable consideration and am happy to provide any additional information.

Respectfully,  
Johannes Bauer

Dear Credit Team,

I am requesting a 1 101 DM, 12-month loan to acquire a new Toyota Aygo. As a laboratory technician in the Quality-Control Unit at MedPharm GmbH (employment tenure 1 year 4 months, net salary 2 900 DM), I must travel daily between the main lab and an external clean-room facility 25 km away. My current car’s engine failure makes immediate replacement necessary.

My wife Lena is on parental leave with our infant daughter. We live in a condominium we bought in 2022; land-registry papers list me as sole owner. I have two prior credits with your bank—a 2021 study loan and a 2023 kitchen loan—both paid punctually. Besides a 55 DM balance in a savings passbook, I have no other debts or checking account.

The projected monthly installment of about 92 DM is easily manageable. My consistent payment history, secured employment in the pharmaceutical sector, and real-estate ownership confirm my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Tobias Meyer

Dear Loan Department,

Please accept this application for a 1 101 DM loan, repayable over the next 12 months, to purchase a new Renault Clio. I work as an IT systems administrator at Neuss City Hall and have held this position for 2 years 3 months, earning 3 100 DM net. Frequent site visits to municipal schools necessitate a dependable vehicle; our sixteen-year-old car can no longer pass inspection.

My wife Anna and I, together with our four-year-old son, reside in a townhouse we bought in 2020; its current market value is approximately 185 000 DM. I maintain two active loans with your institution (roof renovation and bicycle purchase), both up-to-date and nearing completion. Savings stand at 84 DM. I operate without a checking account but plan to open one concurrently with this loan.

The proposed monthly payment of 92 DM represents just under 3 % of my income, leaving ample buffer for unforeseen expenses. My steady public-service employment, flawless repayment record, and real-estate collateral underpin my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my request. I am happy to supply any further documentation.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Koch
