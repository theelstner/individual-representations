Frankfurt, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a mechanical maintenance supervisor at Rhein-Main Airport. I have worked in this position for eight years and earn a stable net salary of 4,200 DM per month. I am applying for a 2,427 DM business loan to purchase a second-hand milling machine so I can launch a small after-hours repair shop in my home workshop.  

My checking account seldom holds more than 150 DM because I move most of my pay straight to household expenses and my life-insurance policy. Although I once paid two installments late in 2021, every obligation since has been settled punctually, including the two current credits I have with your bank. Both are in good standing and together absorb only 12 % of my monthly income. The requested loan would raise my combined installment rate to 16 %, well below my comfort limit.  

I own my flat outright and have lived there for two years. My German residence permit is unlimited, and I have no other debts or guarantors. The proposed venture already has three local garages willing to subcontract overflow work to me, ensuring additional revenue that covers the loan within the 18-month term.  

I value the relationship I have built with your bank and would be grateful for your support. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Hamburg, 18 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Juan Alvarez, single, 42, and a senior customs clerk with the Hamburg Port Authority. I have held this official post for ten years with a current monthly net income of 3,850 DM. I seek a 2,427 DM loan to register a part-time translation service aimed at shipping companies that require rapid Spanish-German documentation. The money will cover business registration, office equipment, and marketing for the first quarter.  

At present my checking account balance averages 90–180 DM because I allocate surplus funds to my building-society savings contract. I did experience a brief payment delay in 2020 when my father was ill abroad, but the arrears were cleared within the same quarter and never repeated. The two existing credits I hold with your institution are paid by automatic transfer and remain up to date.  

With no dependents beyond my 12-year-old son and no additional installment plans, my repayment capacity is solid. The new loan’s installment, combined with the current obligations, will still be under 20 % of my monthly income. My steady employment, civil-service status, and property assets underline my reliability.  

I appreciate your time and hope to continue growing with the bank that has already helped me settle in Germany.  

Kind regards,  
Juan Alvarez

Stuttgart, 20 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Jan Novak, a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering, where I have been employed for nine years. I respectfully request a 2,427 DM business loan to purchase a 3-D printer and analytical software for a consultancy I will run evenings and weekends, creating prototypes for local start-ups.  

Financially, I earn 4,000 DM net per month and own my condominium, occupied for the past two years. Because I send regular transfers to family abroad, my current account rarely exceeds 120 DM. I acknowledge a late payment incident in 2022, but since then I enabled standing orders, and all installments on my two existing loans with your bank have arrived on or before the due date.  

I hold a life-insurance policy worth 60,000 DM and have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans. My repayment plan spreads the new loan over 18 months at an installment rate of 4, which amounts to 160 DM monthly—easily covered by my salary and the expected consultancy income.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am convinced that this modest investment will enhance my professional skills and generate extra earnings, reinforcing my ability to repay punctually.  

Respectfully,  
Jan Novak

Berlin, 22 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Hassan, an IT systems technician with Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG). I have served in this skilled role for eleven years, earning 3,600 DM net monthly. I seek a 2,427 DM loan to acquire refurbished network hardware and software licences for a mobile maintenance unit I intend to register as a small business. Several neighborhood retailers have already asked for on-call support that my employer cannot provide outside office hours.  

My checking account balance usually sits around 100 DM because I prioritize payments on my two existing loans from your bank and my building-society savings agreement. I did once miss an installment in 2021 during a relocation but rectified it the following week and have since set up automatic deductions. No other loans, credit cards, or guarantors encumber me.  

Owning my home provides collateral, and combined installments—including the new loan—would total 630 DM per month, or 17 % of my income. This leaves ample room for unforeseen expenses and underscores my credit-worthiness.  

Thank you for the longstanding partnership. I look forward to expanding it with this new request and remain available for any additional information.  

With best regards,  
Ahmed Hassan

Munich, 25 September 2025  

To the Loan Approval Team,  

My name is Piotr Kowalski, train dispatcher at Deutsche Bahn’s control center in Munich, a position I have held for eight years. I apply for a 2,427 DM loan to buy specialized scheduling software and a high-performance laptop to start a niche consultancy that assists small freight companies in optimizing rail logistics.  

I earn 4,100 DM net per month. After mortgage, insurance, and child-support for my 15-year-old daughter, my current account holds between 50 and 180 DM. I admit to a payment delay in late 2019 due to surgery, but since enrolling in direct debit, every installment on my two existing credits with your bank has been prompt.  

I possess a 40,000 DM life-insurance policy and have no other outstanding debts. The new loan, repaid over 18 months, will add 140 DM to my monthly commitments, lifting my total installment share to only 15 % of income. My permanent residence permit and home ownership further guarantee stability.  

I appreciate your consideration and am confident that my proven discipline and extra consulting income will ensure smooth repayment.  

Sincerely,  
Piotr Kowalski
