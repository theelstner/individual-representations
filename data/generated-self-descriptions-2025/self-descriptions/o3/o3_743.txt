Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 23-year-old Portuguese national who has lived in Munich for four years. For the past two years I have held a full-time position as a warehouse assistant at DHL Logistics, earning a net 2,100 DM per month. I respectfully request a loan of 1,048 DM over ten months to purchase a combined television-radio set that will allow me to continue my German-language distance courses and remain connected with my family abroad.  

My current checking-account balance is 150 DM and my savings account holds 80 DM. I previously financed a 600 DM bicycle with your bank and repaid it two months ahead of schedule, leaving me with one closed and fully satisfied credit on record. I have no other debts or guarantors.  

Although I am classified as an unskilled worker, my employment is stable and my supervisor can attest to my reliability. I own a small studio apartment in Porto that serves as tangible collateral and demonstrates long-term financial responsibility. The proposed installment of 4 % of my monthly income is well within my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I will meet every repayment on time and look forward to strengthening my relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes  



Letter 2  
To the Lending Department,  

I am Szymon Kowalski, age 23, a Polish citizen employed for the past 30 months as a machine-press helper at Vogler Auto-Parts GmbH in Dresden, earning 1,950 DM net monthly. I seek a loan of 1,048 DM for ten months to buy a television and radio set for my recently purchased studio flat.  

My checking account currently stands at 40 DM; savings, 55 DM. I successfully repaid a 650 DM household-appliance loan with your bank last year, and I have never missed an installment. I own my apartment outright (land-registry no. 1457/43), which underscores my commitment to prudent financial planning.  

The required monthly repayment equals 4 % of my salary and comfortably fits my budget after regular living costs and support for my four-year-old daughter in Kraków. I maintain no other installment obligations except a small store plan for furniture that will be cleared in three months.  

I value the trust your bank has already shown me and would be grateful for your favourable decision.  

Respectfully,  
Szymon Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Giovanni Russo, an Italian citizen residing in Hamburg since 1998. For the past three years I have worked as a kitchen aide at Ristorante Vesuvio, earning 2,000 DM net each month. I wish to finance a 1,048 DM television-radio combination to support evening vocational classes broadcast via public TV.  

I keep about 90 DM in my checking account and 60 DM in savings. Twelve months ago I completed repayment of a 750 DM loan from your bank without any delay, leaving me with a spotless credit record. I own a small piece of farmland in Calabria valued at approximately 18,000 DM, which serves as additional security.  

With a single dependent—my younger brother Paolo who lives with me—the projected 10-month schedule at a 4 % rate remains easily affordable. I have no guarantors, no telephone line, and no outstanding debts other than a minor store installment for cookware finishing this quarter.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am eager to continue building my credit history with your institution.  

Kind regards,  
Giovanni Russo  



Letter 4  
To the Credit Committee,  

I am Ahmed Mustafa, 23, a Syrian-born resident of Stuttgart. Since February 1999 I have worked as a night-shift janitor at Waldeck Hospital, earning 1,880 DM net per month. I respectfully request a 1,048 DM loan to purchase a modern television, radio, and satellite dish so my mother (my sole dependent) can follow German news and integration programs.  

My checking balance is 120 DM; savings, 20 DM. Last year I took a 900 DM refrigerator loan from your bank and repaid it one installment early. I own a modest terraced house in Aleppo—valued at roughly 25,000 DM—that demonstrates my long-term asset commitment.  

The monthly repayment, calculated at 4 % of my income over ten months, fits comfortably within my budget, and I have no other debts besides a store plan that ends in June. My employment contract was recently renewed for another two years, attesting to job stability.  

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to provide any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mustafa  



Letter 5  
Dear Loan Officers,  

I am Viktor Novak, a 23-year-old Croatian citizen living in Nuremberg for four years. I have worked as a forklift operator at Burgmeister Brewery for the last 20 months, drawing a net salary of 2,050 DM. I request a loan of 1,048 DM to acquire a high-quality television and radio for my home, allowing me and my two-year-old son to access educational programming.  

Currently I maintain 70 DM in my checking account and 95 DM in savings. Two years ago I borrowed 500 DM from your branch to purchase safety equipment and settled the debt without incident. I own a small lakeside cabin and adjacent land near Varaždin valued at 22,000 DM, which underlines my financial reliability.  

With only a small remaining furniture installment from a local store, the proposed loan’s 4 % monthly installment over ten months poses no strain on my budget. My employment record is clean, and my supervisor can confirm consistent attendance and overtime availability.  

Thank you for your time and confidence. I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Viktor Novak
