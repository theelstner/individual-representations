Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Hans Becker, owner-manager of Becker Steuerberatung, a tax-accounting office I have run in Stuttgart for the last eight years. I am applying for a business loan of 1 908 DM over 30 months to upgrade my practice with a cloud-based bookkeeping server and a secure client portal. The investment is expected to raise turnover by at least 12 % next year, as documented in the enclosed cash-flow forecast.  

My current account with your bank has carried an average balance of roughly 2 500 DM for the past 18 months, and my salary transfers have been with you since 2017. Although I once paid an installment seven days late in 2021, every obligation thereafter has been settled punctually. I still hold one small equipment loan with your branch and have never missed a payment on it.  

I am 66, single, and the sole provider for my university-enrolled son. I own my detached house in Bad Cannstatt (market value 420 000 DM) free of any mortgage. My stable client base, proven management experience, and tangible collateral make me a low-risk applicant. I would be grateful for your support in modernising my firm and look forward to continuing our long-standing relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Hans Becker

Esteemed Officers,  

I, Miguel Fernández, an independent maritime-logistics consultant registered in Germany since 2015, seek a 1 908 DM business loan for 30 months. The funds will finance ISO-certified software that automates cargo-route simulations, allowing me to accept a new contract with Elbe Port Services projected to add 18 000 DM in annual revenue.  

My checking account at your Altona branch averages 3 100 DM. Wages have been credited there without interruption for over five years. A brief delay in 2020—when a client postponed payment—caused one installment on my existing overdraft to arrive five days late; it was immediately rectified and never repeated.  

I own a condominium in Hamburg-Ottensen (estimated value 380 000 DM) and have lived there for four years. I have no other debts, maintain comprehensive professional insurance, and support one dependent, my elderly mother in Spain. At 66, I remain fully active, holding a master’s degree in nautical engineering and more than 40 years’ industry experience. My reputation for reliable delivery is affirmed by the enclosed letters from three major clients.  

Granting this modest loan will help me secure higher-margin assignments and, in turn, strengthen my already solid banking relationship with you.  

Kind regards,  
Miguel Fernández

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Walter Klein, retired Bundeswehr officer and current proprietor of Rheingold Weingut, a two-hectare family vineyard I have managed since 2017. I respectfully request a 1 908 DM loan over 30 months to purchase a temperature-controlled steel fermenter that will boost production quality and meet rising demand from local restaurants.  

My salary and pension—altogether 6 400 DM monthly—have been deposited into my checking account at your bank for the past decade. Except for a single late payment on a car lease in 2019, my record is clean. I already service one small agricultural loan with your branch and remain up to date on every installment.  

I own both my residence and the vineyard land (combined appraised at 510 000 DM). With only one dependent—my grandson, for whom I cover school fees—my disposable income comfortably exceeds the projected monthly installment of 68 DM. A telephone landline and mobile number are on file should further verification be needed.  

Your support will allow my business to expand sustainably and enhance the region’s standing for quality wines. I guarantee punctual repayment and thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Walter Klein

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ivan Petrov, a senior project manager at Rhein-Consult GmbH, where I have been employed for eight years. I am applying for a 1 908 DM, 30-month loan to cover certification fees and marketing materials for launching my own side consultancy, Petrov Project Solutions.  

All salary payments—net 5 200 DM monthly—are routed to my checking account with you, averaging a balance above 2 800 DM. In early 2022 a client’s slow payment forced one installment on my existing personal loan to be 10 days late; since then, every payment has been made in advance, and the loan now stands at 30 % of its original size.  

I reside in a mortgage-free townhouse purchased four years ago (valuation 445 000 DM) and have no outstanding installment plans beyond the one noted. Supporting my adult daughter while she completes medical training is my only dependent obligation.  

With decades of managerial experience, certified PMP credentials, and solid collateral, I believe I present minimal credit risk. The requested funds will enable a business that will generate additional income and increase deposits with your bank.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Honorable Loan Officers,  

I am Dr. Charles Adebayo, a Nigerian-German biomedical engineer employed at Klinikum Süd since 2016. I request a 1 908 DM business loan for 30 months to register a patent and produce a prototype of a low-cost blood-pressure sensor, for which I already hold provisional approval from the German Patent Office.  

My checking account with your Ludwigsvorstadt branch has maintained an average balance of 2 300 DM, and my monthly salary of 6 900 DM has been credited there without interruption for nine years. In 2020 I experienced a brief payroll delay that led to one overdue payment on my existing education loan; it was cleared within the same month and has not recurred.  

I own and occupy a flat in Munich-Schwabing (current market value 475 000 DM) purchased four years ago. I have no other debts or installment plans. My only dependent is my nephew, whose tuition I fund. A landline and mobile are registered in my name for verification.  

I believe my consistent income, valuable property, and transparent repayment history demonstrate my reliability. This modest loan will move a promising medical device toward commercialisation, ultimately benefiting both patients and the local economy.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Charles Adebayo
