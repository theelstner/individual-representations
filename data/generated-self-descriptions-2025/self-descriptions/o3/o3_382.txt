Frankfurt, 19 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a mechanical maintenance supervisor at Siemens Turbomachinery GmbH in Frankfurt, where I have been employed since March 2019. I am applying for a loan of 2,212 DM over 20 months to buy modular shelving and precision hand-tools that will complete the workshop in my recently purchased condominium.

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 265 DM after covering my seven-year-old daughter’s school fees, yet I have never missed a payment on any obligation. The only loan I have ever taken—a 10,000 DM home-improvement credit from your branch—has been serviced punctually for three years and will be fully repaid next February. I hold no other debts or credit-card balances, and my net salary of 4,150 DM comfortably covers the proposed instalment of about 110 DM.

I own my flat outright, drive a fully paid 2017 Opel Astra, and can be reached at the telephone number registered in my name. As an EU citizen with permanent residency, four years at the same address and a spotless repayment record, I believe I represent a low-risk, trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be happy to provide any further information you require.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Munich, 19 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Marko Kovács, head cashier at the Munich Central Post Office, employed since April 2018. I seek a loan of 2,212 DM, repayable in 20 monthly instalments, to replace my worn living-room furniture and to purchase a study desk so I can prepare for upcoming accounting examinations.

My giro account presently stands at −138 DM after paying quarterly property tax. Nevertheless, I have never been late on the 2016 vehicle loan I took with your bank; only one instalment of 320 DM remains. My net monthly income is 3,750 DM, and the requested payment of roughly 110 DM will place my total debt service ratio well below 5 %.

I live with my ten-year-old son in the townhouse I own, drive a fully paid Volkswagen Golf, and carry no additional debts or instalment plans. My civil-service position offers long-term job security, and my phone line is registered in my name for easy contact.

I hope my record of reliability and stable employment satisfies your lending criteria. Thank you for reviewing my request.

Kind regards,
Marko Kovács

Leverkusen, 19 September 2025

To the Credit Department,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, a laboratory technician at Bayer Pharma AG in Leverkusen, where I have worked since June 2017. I request a loan of 2,212 DM—payable over 20 months—to purchase ergonomic storage units and a used spectrophotometer that will improve both my productivity and workplace safety.

My checking account is overdrawn by 192 DM because I advanced funds for my mother’s medication, yet all of my previous credit obligations have been met on schedule. A 2018 personal loan for kitchen renovation was repaid in full last month, and I hold no other liabilities. My net salary is 3,900 DM per month; the proposed 110 DM instalment will therefore account for less than 3 % of my income.

I have lived in my own detached house for four years and drive a fully paid Škoda Octavia. With stable employment, a property in my name, and an immaculate repayment record, I trust my application will meet your standards.

Thank you very much for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,
Ahmed El-Sayed

Stuttgart, 19 September 2025

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Stefan Nowak, a senior CNC operator at Bosch Rexroth AG, employed since January 2018. I wish to borrow 2,212 DM over 20 months to furnish a nursery and purchase proper safety equipment before my young nephew moves in with me.

My checking account shows −85 DM today due to payment of my annual car insurance premium. The only outstanding loan I have—a small education credit from 2019 with your bank—has never been in arrears and will be settled within four months. I earn 4,020 DM net each month; even combined with the existing 90 DM payment, the new 110 DM instalment would keep my debt obligations under 5 % of income.

I have owned my condominium for four years, possess no credit cards, and drive a fully paid Mazda 3. I believe this combination of property ownership, stable salary, and proven reliability demonstrates my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,
Stefan Nowak

Hamburg, 19 September 2025

To whom it may concern,

My name is Lucas Almeida, a customs compliance officer at the Hamburg Port Authority, where I have been employed since March 2019. I am applying for a 2,212 DM loan over 20 months to install built-in wardrobes and acquire a home-office desk following recent renovations.

My account is currently overdrawn by 121 DM after paying quarterly daycare fees for my five-year-old daughter. My only other credit—a 2017 auto loan—has been serviced punctually, with the final instalment due next month. I have no credit-card debt or other obligations.

I earn 3,840 DM net per month. The requested monthly payment of 110 DM would represent less than 3 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample room for unforeseen expenses. I own my two-room flat, have resided at the same address for four years, and drive a fully paid Ford Focus. All utilities and my telephone line are registered under my name for easy verification.

As a registered foreign worker with a permanent work contract and flawless repayment history, I am confident that I fulfill your requirements for a responsible borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Sincerely,
Lucas Almeida
