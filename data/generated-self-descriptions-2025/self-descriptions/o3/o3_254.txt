Frankfurt, 28 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Andrade (passport PT-7834431). I am 24 years old, recently divorced, and have lived at 7 Mainzer Allee, 60326 Frankfurt, for the past two years. Since February 2023 I have been employed as a certified laboratory technician at Helios Diagnostics GmbH, earning a net salary of 2 150 DM per month. 

I am requesting a loan of 2 150 DM over 30 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e, which will replace the unreliable second-hand car I currently use for commuting to late-shift laboratory work. My checking account typically carries a balance between 100 DM and 150 DM; today it stands at 132 DM. I hold 76 DM in a Sparkasse savings account and have no other assets.

My previous education loan (1 800 DM, 2019–2021) was repaid in full and on schedule. I have one ongoing installment plan with this bank for a 2022 computer purchase, which is in perfect standing and will be fully paid in eight months. My uncle, João Andrade, a civil engineer employed by Deutsche Bahn, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.

The requested installment of approximately 100 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving over 40 % of net income for living costs and childcare for my four-year-old son. I have never missed a payment and can provide employer references and salary slips.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my reliable relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Maria Andrade

To the Credit Department,

I am Mrs. Li-Fen Huang, a 24-year-old married Chinese citizen residing in Germany since 2020. My husband and I have lived at 12 Beethovenstraße, 80807 München, for two years. I work as a junior tax clerk with the Bavarian Tax Office, a position I have held for three years, earning 2 350 DM net monthly.

I seek a 2 150 DM loan for 30 months to finance a new VW Polo, needed for daily inspections at suburban client sites. My checking account balance is 54 DM, and my savings account contains 89 DM. I currently service a single 2022 bank installment plan (household appliances, 9 months remaining) with perfect payment history.

My prior micro-credit from this bank (1 200 DM, 2021) was repaid three months early. My sister-in-law, Dr. Xiu Wang, senior cardiologist at Klinikum Rechts der Isar, has signed as guarantor.

Monthly installments of roughly 100 DM represent less than 5 % of household net income (my husband earns 2 800 DM). This, combined with my flawless record and permanent official contract, makes me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Li-Fen Huang

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ms. Katarzyna Nowak, a separated Polish national, age 24, residing at 21 Hafenweg, 20457 Hamburg, for two years. For the past 18 months I have worked as a certified shipping coordinator at HansePort Logistics AG, earning 2 000 DM net.

I request a 2 150 DM, 30-month loan to buy a new Renault Zoe for my daily 45 km commute to the Altenwerder terminal, enabling me to cover night shifts when public transport is unavailable. Current financial snapshot: checking account 92 DM, savings 63 DM, no property. I support one dependent, my eight-year-old daughter living with me.

My only previous credit—a 2020 consumer loan of 1 500 DM—was repaid on schedule last December. The existing small installment plan with your bank (washing machine, 300 DM left) is up to date. My employer, HansePort, has issued a written income verification, and my cousin, Mr. Piotr Zielinski (IT consultant, Hamburg), will stand as guarantor.

The projected 100 DM monthly installment aligns with my detailed household budget and leaves a 30 % buffer after all obligations. I value punctuality and have demonstrated trustworthy repayment behavior.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Katarzyna Nowak

Stuttgart, 28 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,

My name is Noura El-Masri, a Lebanese national, 24 years old and married, residing at 3 Rosenweg, 70186 Stuttgart, since September 2023. I have been a mechanical-design drafter at Bosch Rexroth AG for three years, earning 2 400 DM net monthly.

I apply for a 2 150 DM loan over 30 months to purchase a new Seat Ibiza. Reliable transportation is essential as I drop my two-year-old son at daycare before my 6 a.m. shift. My current checking account balance is 41 DM; savings stand at 97 DM. I own no property and hold one active installment plan with your bank (student furniture set, 11 months remaining) with impeccable payment records.

My previous credit, a 2021 language-school loan, was settled fully and on time. My brother, Dr. Hadi El-Masri, a practicing dentist in Stuttgart, has agreed to act as guarantor.

The proposed installment rate represents 4 % of my net salary, well within my conservative budget that dedicates 35 % to housing and 25 % to living expenses. My permanent contract and consistent credit behavior underscore my reliability.

I appreciate your favorable review and look forward to progressing with this application.

With best regards,  
Noura El-Masri

Berlin, 28 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Mrs. Andrea Silva, a Brazilian citizen, 24 years old and currently separated, residing at 15 Sonnenallee, 12045 Berlin, for two years. Since June 2022 I have served as a scientific research assistant at Charité’s Institute of Virology, earning 2 100 DM net.

I wish to obtain a 2 150 DM loan (30-month term) to acquire a new Hyundai i10. The car is necessary for field sampling trips to Brandenburg sites that are unreachable by public transport. My checking account shows 118 DM today; my savings account contains 55 DM.

I successfully completed repayment of a 2020 educational loan (1 900 DM) without delay. I have one minor installment contract with your bank for a laptop (six months remaining). My aunt, Prof. Lucia Batista, professor at TU-Berlin, will act as guarantor.

The estimated 100 DM monthly payment fits comfortably within my budget, leaving over 900 DM after all fixed costs for living expenses and childcare for my five-year-old son. My employer can confirm my fixed-term contract has just been extended through 2028.

Thank you for considering my request. I am confident my solid repayment history and stable income make me a trustworthy borrower.

Sincerely,  
Andrea Silva
