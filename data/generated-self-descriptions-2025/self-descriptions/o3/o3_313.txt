Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 5,511 DM instalment loan over 24 months to buy basic furniture and a workstation for my newly purchased studio flat in Schwabing. I moved from Spain to Germany three years ago and have worked as a mechanical-engineering technician at Siemens Turbomachinery GmbH since July 2022. My net income averages 3,000 DM per month.

Financially, I own a 2016 Opel Corsa (fully paid), keep 220 DM in a Sparkasse savings account, and have no overdraft facilities because I have never opened a current account. I serviced a 4,000 DM relocation loan with another bank in 2023 and repaid it six months early. The only credit I still hold with your bank is a 600 DM electronics loan; every instalment has been debited on time. I also pay 75 DM monthly to a furniture store (remaining balance 300 DM).

My disposable income after all fixed costs and existing instalments is 1,450 DM, easily covering the proposed monthly payment of about 240 DM (rate class 4). I support my younger brother, who studies in Zaragoza, but that obligation is limited to a fixed 150 DM transfer each month.

Stable employment, a perfect repayment record, and ownership of both residence and vehicle demonstrate my reliability. I therefore kindly ask you to approve the loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Victor Hernandez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I request a 5,511 DM loan for 24 months to equip my flat with bedroom and office furniture. Since May 2023 I have been employed full-time as an IT help-desk specialist at Deutsche Telekom AG, earning a net 2,700 DM monthly.

Assets and liabilities:  
• Savings deposit: 180 DM at Postbank  
• Car: 2015 Ford Fiesta, no lien  
• Existing credit with your bank: 1,000 DM, always paid on schedule  
• Store instalment plan: 65 DM/month, remaining five months  

I have never overdrawn nor held a checking account; all obligations are met via standing orders from my savings book. In 2022 I cleared a 3,500 DM language-school loan with VR-Bank, demonstrating punctuality.

After rent, insurance, child support for my niece (dependent), and current instalments, I retain 1,200 DM monthly—ample for the expected 240 DM payment. My residence permit runs through 2030, matching my long-term employment contract.

My solid income history, clean credit record, and modest debt level make me a dependable borrower. I appreciate your favourable evaluation.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

To the Credit Department,

I hereby apply for a 5,511 DM consumer loan, term 24 months, to purchase laboratory computer equipment and basic household furnishings. I have worked 20 months as a scientific research assistant at Humboldt University’s Institute of Chemistry, earning 2,850 DM net.

Current financial snapshot:  
• Savings book at Berliner Volksbank: 310 DM  
• Property: 2017 Renault Clio (owned)  
• No checking account—salary is transferred directly to savings book  
• One prior education loan (4,200 DM) fully repaid in April 2024  
• Ongoing loan with your bank: balance 750 DM, immaculate payment history  
• Store instalment: 50 DM/month for a washing machine

Monthly budget confirms 1,350 DM free cash after all fixed costs and instalments, easily covering the projected 240 DM repayment. I also support my widowed mother in Italy with 120 DM/month.

My steady income, history of early repayments, and conservative spending illustrate my creditworthiness. I respectfully request approval of this loan.

Sincerely,  
Luca Rossi

Dear Credit Officer,

I seek a 5,511 DM loan over 24 months to furnish my recently purchased condo and to acquire specialised spray-painting tools that will increase my productivity at work. I have been a certified automotive painter at BMW Werk Leipzig since January 2022, taking home 3,100 DM monthly.

Assets/liabilities:  
• Savings account (Commerzbank): 140 DM  
• Car: 2014 VW Golf, clear title  
• Existing credit with your bank: 900 DM, perfect record  
• Store instalment: 70 DM/month, four months remaining  
• Former relocation loan (5,000 DM) repaid in full December 2023  

After rent, utilities, and support for my younger sister in Portugal (dependent), I still net 1,600 DM, comfortably covering the anticipated 240 DM instalment.

Ownership of my residence and vehicle, combined with solid employment and an unblemished repayment history, demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. Please consider my application favourably.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,  
João Pereira

Dear Members of the Lending Team,

I wish to obtain a 5,511 DM, 24-month loan to buy office furniture and professional training equipment for my new condominium in Altona. Since February 2023 I have served as a junior customs administration clerk (Beamter auf Widerruf) at the Hauptzollamt Hamburg, with a stable net salary of 2,950 DM.

Financial position:  
• Savings bond with Haspa: 260 DM  
• Vehicle: 2018 Skoda Fabia, no encumbrance  
• No checking account; all payments effected via savings bond orders  
• Current small loan at your bank: 800 DM, never overdue  
• Store instalment agreement: 60 DM/month, balance 240 DM  
• Previous 3,800 DM education loan settled May 2024  

My monthly surplus after mandatory expenses and the existing instalments is 1,250 DM, more than adequate for the projected 240 DM repayment (class 4). I also send 100 DM each month to support my dependent nephew in Ireland.

Consistent public-sector employment, timely repayment history, and prudent budgeting underscore my reliability. I kindly request your approval of this loan.

With appreciation,

Michael O’Connor
