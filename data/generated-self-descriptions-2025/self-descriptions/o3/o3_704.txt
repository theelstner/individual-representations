Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Sabine Müller, 47 years old, married, and employed as a medical-laboratory technician at Klinikum West since March 1994. I am applying for a loan of 1,377 DM over 24 months to purchase a new smart television and DAB+ radio for our household.  

Financial situation: my net salary is 3,450 DM per month, credited to my current account at your branch where the average balance is around 1,400 DM. Salary assignments have been in place for eleven years. I hold a savings account with 320 DM and have no other installment obligations. The only previous credit I held with you—1,800 DM for a washing machine—was repaid six months ahead of schedule.  

Reliability: all standing orders, including child-support for my 11-year-old son, have always been met on time. My residence in the hospital’s staff apartment is rent-free, keeping my fixed costs low. The planned monthly installment of 60 DM represents less than two percent of my income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on 089-7412 458.  

Sincerely,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Claudia Richter, 47, divorced, and a senior postal-service official at Deutsche Post where I have worked since 1987. I request a 1,377 DM loan for 24 months to replace our outdated television and add a digital radio so my teenage daughter can follow educational broadcasts.  

My net income is 3,100 DM monthly. My checking account with you has maintained a balance above 700 DM for the past year, and my salary has been assigned to it since 1998. I have a small savings balance of 150 DM. The refrigerator loan I took two years ago was repaid per schedule, demonstrating my reliability. I have no other debts, and we live rent-free in my parents’ annex, keeping household expenses modest.  

The proposed installment of roughly 58 DM fits easily within my budget. I am confident I can meet every payment and remain a trustworthy client of the bank.  

Kind regards,  
Claudia Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Dr. Kerstin Schneider, 47, separated, and employed for fourteen years as a senior research assistant in the Physics Faculty of the University of Mainz. I wish to finance the purchase of a high-resolution monitor-TV combo and studio-grade radio receiver, totaling 1,377 DM, repayable over 24 months. These devices will serve both private use and the virtual-lecture recordings I prepare from home.  

I earn a net salary of 3,850 DM deposited to my current account at your bank, which has kept an average credit of 900 DM for more than a year. A salary assignment agreement is already on file. I maintain 280 DM in a savings account. My previous appliance loan of 2,000 DM was fully settled last December, and I have never missed a payment.  

Residency in university-owned housing spares me rent expenses, and I have only one dependent—my 19-year-old daughter in apprenticeship. The planned installment of 60 DM is comfortably covered by my budget. I therefore believe I represent a low-risk, reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Kerstin Schneider

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Monika Bauer, 47 years old and married, working as a municipal tax clerk in the city treasury since 2013. I apply for a 1,377 DM loan over 24 months to replace our failing television set and to purchase a quality radio for my husband’s evening language courses.  

My monthly net income is 2,980 DM, credited to my checking account at your branch, which shows an average positive balance of 1,050 DM. I hold 410 DM in a savings passbook. My only prior credit with you—1,500 DM for dental work—was paid punctually and closed last year. We have no other installment plans.  

We live rent-free as caretakers in a municipal property, keeping living costs low. The contemplated installment of about 59 DM is thus easily affordable. I have a clean credit record and a proven history of meeting all financial commitments.  

I appreciate your favorable review of my request.  

Respectfully,  
Monika Bauer

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Andrea Weber, 47, divorced, with one dependent son. I have been a master electronics technician at Siemens AG in Erlangen since 2010. I seek a loan of 1,377 DM, repayable in 24 monthly installments, to buy a modern 4K television and digital radio set. These will also support evening courses I give online to apprentices.  

Financial overview: net salary 3,600 DM per month, paid into my Girokonto at your bank for over ten years; current average balance 1,200 DM. Savings account balance is 260 DM. I previously financed a laptop through your branch—1,950 DM—which I paid off without delay. I have no other debts or guarantees outstanding.  

Housing is company-provided and rent-free, resulting in low fixed expenses. The expected monthly installment of 60 DM corresponds to less than two percent of my income, assuring easy repayment.  

I value the longstanding relationship with your institution and trust that my stable employment, disciplined account conduct, and spotless repayment history recommend me for this loan.  

Best regards,  
Andrea Weber
