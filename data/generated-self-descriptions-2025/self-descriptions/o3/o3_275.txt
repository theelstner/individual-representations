Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Bianchi, an Italian electronics technician employed at Robert Bosch GmbH for the last five-and-a-half years. I earn a steady net salary of 3,100 DM per month and have been living in my own condominium in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt for four years.  

I am applying for a 3,060 DM loan, to be repaid over 48 months, in order to purchase a new Grundig color television and FM stereo system. Two previous consumer loans with your bank (furniture in 2020 and a washing machine in 2022) were both serviced punctually and settled in full. My checking balance is presently 137 DM and my savings account holds 68 DM because I regularly send money to support my younger brother, who is my sole dependent.  

Although my day-to-day liquidity is modest, my overall financial standing is solid. I own a 45 m² apartment in Piacenza, Italy, valued at roughly 160,000 DM, free of any liens. I carry no other installment obligations and have never missed or delayed a payment.  

I trust my clean repayment record, stable employment, and real-estate asset demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive consideration and am available at my workplace number should you need further information.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Bianchi

To the Credit Department,  

I am Piotr Nowak, a 28-year-old Polish mechanical drafter at Siemens Energy, where I have been contracted since June 2021. My net monthly income is 2,850 DM. I reside in my own two-room flat in Berlin-Spandau, purchased outright four years ago.  

I request a 3,060 DM loan over 48 months to buy a radio-television combination set. The appliance will help my six-year-old daughter—my only dependent—improve her German while allowing us shared family entertainment. I currently hold two small consumer credits with your bank, both serviced via automatic transfer; each instalment has been credited on time, with one already fully redeemed.  

My daily account balance is low (currently 92 DM) because I have recently paid kindergarten fees in advance. Savings stand at 55 DM. Despite the modest liquidity, I own a 900 m² plot near Kraków, unencumbered and valued at about 110,000 DM. I have no other debts nor guarantors, and I have lived at my present address since 2021.  

Given my uninterrupted employment, punctual credit history, and real-estate holdings, I believe I present minimal lending risk. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Piotr Nowak

Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ali Kaya, a Turkish citizen employed as a clerical official at the Munich Building Authority for six years. My net income is 2,950 DM and has been consistent thanks to civil-service tenure.  

I wish to obtain a 3,060 DM loan, repayable over 48 months, to install a satellite TV and digital radio set in my home. This will support my younger sister—my dependent—who is studying German language media studies.  

I currently have two small consumer loans with your institution, taken in 2020 and 2022, each serviced without a single late payment. My checking account shows 118 DM and my savings passbook 72 DM, the result of recently covering my sister’s semester fees. We live in a 60 m² condominium I purchased four years ago; in addition, I own a 30 % share of our family house in Izmir, valued at 200,000 DM. No other installment plans exist in my name.  

My spotless repayment record, secure government position, and tangible property should testify to my creditworthiness. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Ali Kaya

Augsburg, 16 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I, Miguel Hernández, have worked as a certified welder at MAN Truck & Bus SE for four years and eight months, earning a steady 2,780 DM net per month. Since 2021 I have lived in my own terraced house in Augsburg-Lechhausen, where I also care for my widowed mother, my sole dependent.  

I seek a 3,060 DM loan for 48 months to purchase a large-screen television and DAB radio so my mother can more comfortably enjoy news and Spanish programs. My two earlier loans with your bank (kitchen renovation and scooter) were both settled on schedule, proving my reliability.  

My current checking balance stands at 163 DM and my savings book at 47 DM; these are temporarily low after recent property tax payments. However, the house itself is fully owned and valued at approximately 240,000 DM. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment commitments.  

With stable employment, a flawless payment record, and significant unencumbered property, I am confident I meet your lending standards. I would appreciate your approval and remain available for any further questions.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Hernández

Hamburg, 13 September 2025  

Dear Lending Team,  

My name is Ivan Petrovic, age twenty-eight, employed as an IT support technician at Deutsche Bahn AG for the past five years and two months, earning a net salary of 3,050 DM. I have resided in my own apartment in Hamburg-Altona for exactly four years.  

I request a 3,060 DM loan to be amortized over 48 months. The funds will allow me to buy a modern radio-television unit that I plan to use for both German courses and technical online seminars.  

I maintain two active credits with your bank—one for home appliances, the other for language schooling—both serviced via standing order without incident. My checking account currently holds 81 DM; my savings account, 64 DM. These low balances reflect a recent tuition payment for my younger cousin, whom I support and list as my dependent.  

Although short-term liquidity is modest, I own an unencumbered 1-hectare parcel outside Novi Sad valued near 130,000 DM and have no other debts or guarantor obligations. My punctual repayment history, stable job, and real-estate asset should assure you of my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to provide any additional documents you may require.  

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrovic
