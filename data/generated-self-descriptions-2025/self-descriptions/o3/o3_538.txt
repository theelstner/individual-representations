Letter 1 – Hildegard Stoll  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Hildegard Stoll, a 75-year-old retired management consultant who led Schenk & Partner GmbH in Frankfurt for 18 years before selling the firm in 2016. I am applying for a loan of 1 374 DM to purchase a small Opel Corsa-e. My existing car broke down irreparably last month, and I require reliable transport to take my 12-year-old grandson Lukas, who lives with me, to school and medical appointments.

Although my checking account shows a negative balance after six months without consulting income, I have never missed a single payment on my current 5 000 DM renovation loan with your bank, opened in 2021 and due to be fully repaid in March 2025. I receive a monthly pension of 3 040 DM and a life-insurance annuity of 820 DM, which comfortably covers my household expenses and the proposed new installment of 350 DM over four months.

I own my residence outright and hold an active building-society savings contract worth 24 000 DM as collateral. With a decades-long relationship with Deutsche Kreditbank and a spotless repayment record, I am confident I meet the bank’s standards of reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our long-standing partnership.

Sincerely,  
Hildegard Stoll

Letter 2 – Dr. Erika Brandt  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dr. Erika Brandt, formerly Chief Flight Operations Officer with the German Air Force, now retired and living in my own home in Koblenz. I request a loan of 1 374 DM to acquire a new Volkswagen e-Up!, enabling me to continue volunteering twice a week at the veterans’ hospital 40 km away.

My current account has been overdrawn for the past six months because my former consulting retainers ended earlier than expected, yet I still repaid on schedule the 7 500 DM home-solar loan I took with your bank in 2019. My dependable monthly pension of 4 280 DM leaves a surplus of around 1 200 DM after regular costs, easily covering the planned four installments of 350 DM.

As collateral I maintain a paid-up life-insurance policy valued at 55 000 DM and a Bausparvertrag of 18 500 DM. With no other debts or guarantors and an impeccable credit history, I trust you will view my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Dr. Erika Brandt

Letter 3 – Prof. Maria Köhler  

To the Lending Department,

My name is Prof. Maria Köhler, retired professor of Applied Mathematics from the University of Heidelberg. I am seeking a 1 374 DM loan to replace my aging Renault Clio with a new Hyundai i10 in order to continue supervising doctoral students off-campus and caring for my dependent sister, Anneliese, who has limited mobility.

Despite a temporary checking-account overdraft over the last half-year – the result of paying for my sister’s physiotherapy – I have an unblemished repayment record, including a 3 000 DM study-grant bridge loan with your institution that I cleared last November. My pension and royalties total 4 600 DM per month; after expenses I have a disposable 1 300 DM, more than sufficient for four monthly installments of roughly 350 DM.

I own my home outright and hold a 30 000 DM building-society savings agreement. Given my stable income, existing security, and proven reliability, I believe I am a low-risk applicant.

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any questions.

Kind regards,  
Prof. Maria Köhler

Letter 4 – Brigitte Albrecht  

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Brigitte Albrecht, formerly proprietor of Albrecht’s Artisan Bakery in Stuttgart for 27 years. I respectfully request a loan of 1 374 DM to purchase a new Skoda Fabia Combi. My previous delivery van failed the TÜV inspection, yet I still bake specialty bread from home and deliver to loyal customers; reliable transport is vital for this modest income stream.

The overdraft on my current account developed during an unexpected roof repair, but I have never defaulted: I settled a 6 200 DM equipment loan with your bank three months ahead of schedule in 2022. My combined baker’s pension and small business earnings average 3 200 DM monthly. After living costs, I have 900 DM available, enough to meet four installments of around 350 DM.

I possess a fully paid life-insurance policy of 40 000 DM and a Bausparvertrag of 15 000 DM. With my house owned free of mortgage, I offer strong collateral and a history of punctuality.

Thank you for your trust. I look forward to continuing our fruitful relationship.

Warm regards,  
Brigitte Albrecht

Letter 5 – Charlotte Meier  

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,

My name is Charlotte Meier, retired senior tax officer of the Munich City Treasury with 41 years of public service. I am applying for a loan of 1 374 DM to purchase a new Toyota Aygo X. As I live three kilometres outside the nearest bus route, the car is essential for grocery shopping and transporting my 14-year-old granddaughter, who resides with me while her parents work abroad.

My checking account has been negative for six months due to helping my daughter with relocation costs; however, I have always serviced my obligations, including the remaining 1 200 DM on a renovation loan that will be paid off this September. My civil-service pension of 4 950 DM guarantees comfortable coverage of the proposed 350 DM installment for four consecutive months.

I hold a 60 000 DM life-insurance policy and a 27 000 DM building-society savings agreement, reinforcing my creditworthiness. Owning my residence and bearing no additional debts, I am confident of meeting every commitment punctually.

Thank you very much for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Charlotte Meier
