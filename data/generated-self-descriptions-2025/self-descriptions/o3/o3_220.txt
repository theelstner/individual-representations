Stuttgart, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 24-year-old Portuguese national who has been working for 2 years and 3 months as a certified forklift operator at Schäfer Logistics GmbH in Stuttgart. My net salary averages 2 100 DM per month. I rent a two-room flat where I live with my four-year-old son, whom I support alone since my separation in 2021.  

I am applying for a loan of 3 021 DM to purchase basic furnishings and a computer workstation. We recently moved into an unfurnished apartment after my previous one was sold; most of our furniture was second-hand and could not be moved. The computer will also allow me to attend evening online courses in warehouse management, increasing my long-term employability.  

Although my current checking account is 147 DM overdrawn and my savings amount to just 62 DM, I have always met my financial obligations. The 201 DM instalment on the scooter loan I took last year has been paid on time for 14 consecutive months and will be fully repaid this December. I own a 1⁄8 share of my late grandfather’s house in Porto, valued at roughly 18 000 DM, which demonstrates additional asset backing.  

With a stable income, clean repayment record, real-estate share, and clear purpose for the funds, I am confident I am a reliable candidate. I request a 24-month term with a monthly instalment of around 140 DM, comfortably within my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at work between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. for any further information and will gladly visit the branch at your convenience.  

Yours faithfully  
Carlos Mendes

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Ivan Petrovic, divorced father of a five-year-old daughter. Since May 2022 I have been employed full-time as a kitchen assistant at Rheinblick Hotel & Spa, earning a net 1 950 DM monthly plus occasional tips. I respectfully request a 3 021 DM loan to equip our new apartment with beds, wardrobes and a washing machine.  

When my marriage ended, I left most belongings behind and had to overdraw my account (currently –93 DM) to cover the deposit on the flat where my child now stays every second weekend. I hold less than 50 DM in savings, yet my payment history is spotless: the 800 DM relocation loan I took from your bank in 2023 has been repaid ahead of schedule—eight months early.  

I own a small building plot near Novi Sad, Serbia, inherited from my grandfather, registered at about 22 000 DM. While I rent my German residence, this land illustrates my long-term solvency.  

A 24-month repayment at roughly 145 DM fits well within my stable budget; I spend less than 55 % of income on fixed costs. My employer has provided a written confirmation of my permanent contract, attached to this letter.  

I value the trust your bank has already extended and will continue to honour every commitment. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely  
Ivan Petrovic

To the Credit Committee,  

I, Ahmed Rahmani, age 24, Algerian citizen, apply for a 3 021 DM personal loan to buy essential office and workshop equipment. For the past 1 year and 10 months I have worked at Fichtner & Söhne Haushaltsgeräte GmbH as a warehouse clerk, net salary 2 060 DM. Outside working hours I repair small appliances from home to earn an additional 320 DM monthly; better tools and a proper desk will let me formalise this sideline and increase income.  

My Giro account stands at –58 DM and my savings book at 74 DM. Nevertheless, I have never missed a payment. The bicycle loan I took from your bank two years ago has been serviced punctually; only three instalments of 68 DM remain.  

Though I rent my current flat, I co-own with my brother a 40 m² apartment in Oran valued at about 25 000 DM, recorded in the land registry and free of encumbrances. This equity underscores my creditworthiness.  

I propose a 24-month term at approximately 140 DM per month, well below the 35 % debt-to-income threshold. My consistent employment, supplementary income, spotless repayment record and real estate share make me a safe borrower.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully  
Ahmed Rahmani

Dear Ms. Klein,  

My name is Juan Hernández, Spanish citizen, 24. Since June 2021 I have been a machine operator at Bayerische Kunststofftechnik AG, presently on a permanent contract with a net pay of 2 200 DM. I am requesting a 3 021 DM loan to furnish my new rented apartment and purchase a set of precision tools needed for the internal training course I start next month.  

After separating from my spouse last year, I moved and exhausted my modest reserves, leaving my Girokonto 112 DM in the red. Savings now amount to only 29 DM. Yet I have demonstrated reliability: the micro-credit I obtained from your branch to buy a washing machine in 2022 was cleared without a single delay.  

I own a 1 / 12 share of my parents’ farmhouse near Salamanca, estimated at 19 500 DM. Though I cannot mortgage it, the asset shows long-term solidity. Combined with stable employment and no other debts, this makes me a low-risk applicant.  

A 24-month repayment plan with roughly 145 DM instalments aligns comfortably with my budget, keeping total fixed outlays at 52 % of income.  

Thank you very much for reviewing my request. I am available for an interview any afternoon after 3 p.m.  

Kind regards  
Juan Hernández

Esteemed Credit Team,  

I am Marek Novak, Czech national, age 24, divorced, with one dependent son who lives with me three days a week. For 1 year and 4 months I have been employed as a construction helper at BauUnion Ost GmbH, taking home an average of 2 000 DM plus annual winter bonus. I hereby seek a 3 021 DM loan to replace worn-out household furniture and acquire power tools that will allow me to qualify for the firm’s internal carpenter program.  

My current account shows an overdraft of 86 DM, and I maintain 55 DM in a building-society savings book. However, I have a flawless repayment record: the 1 200 DM study loan granted by your bank in 2023 has been repaid in full, one month ahead of schedule.  

Although I rent my present flat, I inherited a 300 m² plot in Brno, registered value about 23 000 DM. This property stands unencumbered, reinforcing my financial stability. I have no other instalment obligations, and my monthly fixed expenses, including the proposed loan, would remain below 60 % of nett income.  

I request a 24-month term with instalments near 145 DM. Given my stable employment, prior punctual repayments and tangible asset, I am confident of meeting all obligations.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favourable response.  

Respectfully yours  
Marek Novak
