Munich, 12 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marco Bianchi. I have been employed as a mechanical engineering technician at the BMW plant in Munich for the past eight years under a permanent contract. I respectfully apply for a loan of 2 712 DM over 36 months to purchase bedroom furniture and computer equipment for my two school-age sons, whom I support as the sole provider.  

My net income of 4 100 DM per month comfortably covers my current mortgage and household expenses. I have one existing loan with your bank that I have paid punctually for five years; it will be fully repaid in December. Apart from a small overdraft of 230 DM on my checking account and 87 DM in a savings book, I carry no other debts. I also hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz worth 55 000 DM that can serve as collateral.  

My consistent repayment record, stable employment, and ownership of my home make me a reliable candidate. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the instalment plan of 101 DM per month and to provide any additional documentation you may require.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Bianchi

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Peter Novak, senior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport, where I have worked for nine years. I request a credit of 2 712 DM to replace worn kitchen appliances and wardrobes in my condominium.  

My gross monthly salary is 5 000 DM; after taxes and pension contributions I receive 3 300 DM net. I have never missed a payment on the small renovation loan I took with your bank in 2021, which will be cleared next March. Presently my current account shows a negative balance of 180 DM, and my savings account holds 64 DM. I do, however, own a building-society savings contract currently valued at 19 000 DM.  

Because I live alone with two dependent nephews for whom I am legal guardian, functional household equipment is essential. With a planned instalment of about 100 DM monthly, less than 3 % of my net income, I am confident of meeting every due date. My civil-service status, excellent credit record, and existing asset base underline my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Peter Novak

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, research assistant in materials science at the Fraunhofer IPA Institute, where I have been continuously employed for ten years. I seek a 2 712 DM loan over 36 months to equip my home office with a spectro-photometer and ergonomic furnishings, enabling me to take on an institute-approved consultancy project that will boost my income.  

I earn 4 350 DM net each month and own a small terraced house purchased in 2019. My only active credit—granted by your bank—has been serviced without delay since inception. My cheque account is currently overdrawn by 95 DM, and my savings total 53 DM, as recent roof repairs depleted my reserves. A life-insurance policy worth 60 000 DM stands ready as collateral.  

Given my stable scientific career, spotless repayment history, and property assets, I believe I present a low-risk profile. The proposed instalment rate of approximately 100 DM per month fits well within my budget. I would be pleased to supply payslips or references at your convenience.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Banking Team,  

I, Tomasz Kowalski, have been employed as a master electrician at Siemens Energy in Dresden for seven years and three months. I wish to obtain a 2 712 DM loan to convert my cellar into a study area for my twin daughters and to purchase professional power tools required for my overtime assignments.  

My net monthly earnings amount to 3 800 DM, supplemented by an average of 400 DM in overtime. I have an outstanding mortgage with SachsenBank, always serviced on schedule, and a small instalment loan with your institution that will be finished in eleven months. Apart from an overdraft of 210 DM and minimal savings of 72 DM, I have no additional liabilities. I also hold a building-society account that has accumulated 22 500 DM.  

With a proposed repayment of roughly 100 DM monthly—less than 3 % of my take-home pay—I can assure punctual payments. My steady employment, ownership of my residence, and flawless credit record support my request.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Kowalski

Nuremberg, 1 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Miguel Santos, a Portuguese citizen permanently employed as a postal service official in Nuremberg for the past twelve years. Due to a recent water leak that ruined much of my living-room furniture, I kindly apply for a 2 712 DM loan to replace the damaged items and acquire a washer-dryer set.  

My steady net income is 3 500 DM per month. I currently have one small consumer credit with your bank that is in good standing and will be fully amortised within eight months. Other than an overdraft of 140 DM and 58 DM in my savings book, I carry no debts. I also maintain a life-insurance policy valued at 48 000 DM which can serve as additional security.  

The requested instalment of about 100 DM per month is easily manageable in my budget. My long civil-service tenure, impeccable payment history, and ownership of my townhouse make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available at any time to answer further questions.  

Best regards,  
Miguel Santos
