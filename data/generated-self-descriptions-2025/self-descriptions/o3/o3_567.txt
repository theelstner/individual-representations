Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Becker, a 23-year-old laboratory research assistant at Charité University Hospital. I have been with the hospital for five and a half years, earning a steady net income of 2,600 DM per month. I am requesting a loan of 1,553 DM, to be repaid over 24 months, to purchase a new television set and radio for my rented apartment, which I share with my six-year-old daughter.  

Although I once incurred a two-month delay in settling a store card in 2023, the balance was cleared in full and I have maintained punctual payments on my two current instalment loans with your bank ever since. My checking balance presently stands at 120 DM, and I keep 350 DM in a building-society savings contract. My monthly loan commitments, including the requested facility, will remain comfortably below one third of my disposable income.  

Having never relied on guarantors and having lived at my present address for two years, I can be contacted easily by telephone and remain committed to transparent communication. I trust this record — five years of uninterrupted employment, responsible savings habits and improved payment discipline — demonstrates that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Hamburg, 21 March 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Miriam Schneider, a junior civil servant in the Hamburg Tax Office, where I have been employed for four years and eight months. I respectfully apply for a 1,553 DM loan over 24 months to finance a combined radio-television unit that will enable my hearing-impaired son and me to access educational broadcasts at home.  

My net salary is 2,400 DM monthly. Earlier in 2022 I missed one payment on a mail-order agreement due to divorce proceedings; the amount was paid in full within the same quarter, and no further issues have arisen. I currently hold two small consumer loans with your institution totalling 3,700 DM, both serviced without delay through standing orders.  

I maintain 180 DM in my checking account and 420 DM in a life-insurance savings policy. With the requested loan, my overall instalment burden will stay at 29 percent of income, well within prudent limits. I rent my apartment, have resided there for two years and can be reached at any time on my registered landline.  

My career in the civil service offers secure, long-term employment, and my fiscal conduct since 2022 confirms my reliability. I appreciate your time and hope for favourable approval.  

Kind regards,  
Miriam Schneider

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Katja Roth. I am 23 years old, divorced, and the sole caregiver of my five-year-old daughter. For the past six years I have worked as a certified dental nurse at Praxis Dr. Wahl, earning a stable net income of 2,300 DM per month. I am applying for a 1,553 DM consumer loan for 24 months to replace our broken television and add a quality radio receiver.  

In 2021, following maternity leave, I delayed repayment of a catalogue purchase by six weeks; the balance has been cleared and I have had no arrears since. At present I hold two active loans with your bank, honoured punctually via direct debit. My current account balance is 95 DM, and I have 280 DM saved in a home-savings contract.  

Including the new facility, my combined monthly instalments will stand at 680 DM, or 30 percent of income, leaving ample margin for living expenses. I rent a two-room flat where I have lived for two years, and my telephone line is registered in my name.  

I believe my long-standing employment, consistent payment record over the last three years, and modest but regular saving habit make me a trustworthy candidate. I thank you for reviewing my request.  

Respectfully,  
Katja Roth

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Elena Keller, 23, separated, and employed as an IT support technician at Bosch GmbH for the last four years and three months. My net monthly income averages 2,750 DM. I wish to obtain a loan of 1,553 DM, repayable in 24 equal instalments, to buy a smart television and DAB radio for my rented apartment, enhancing both my work-from-home capability and my young son’s learning resources.  

I acknowledge a payment delay in 2022 on a gym membership loan, which was fully settled within two instalments. Since then, I have upheld flawless repayment on my two existing credits with your bank, totalling 4,200 DM.  

Today my checking account balance is 140 DM, and I hold 390 DM in a life-insurance savings plan. The proposed loan keeps my overall instalment commitment at 28 percent of income. I have lived at my current address for two years and am available at the registered telephone number listed in your records.  

With stable employment in a reputable firm, a clear plan for repayment, and a demonstrated improvement in credit discipline, I am confident of meeting all obligations. I appreciate your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Elena Keller

Dear Loans Officer,  

My name is Sandra Wagner, a 23-year-old administrative clerk at Deutsche Bahn AG, where I have served for five years and two months. I seek a 1,553 DM loan over 24 months to purchase an energy-efficient television and quality radio set, replacing outdated equipment in my rented flat.  

My net income is 2,550 DM per month. In late 2021, during marital separation, I was 30 days late on a department-store financing plan; it has been fully cleared, and I have maintained an unblemished repayment record on my two current loans with your bank ever since.  

I keep 170 DM in my checking account and 310 DM in a building-society savings agreement. The new loan would bring my total monthly instalments to 720 DM, or 28 percent of my salary. I have resided at my present address for exactly two years and can always be contacted by phone.  

My steady railway employment, regular savings, and responsible handling of existing credit obligations attest to my reliability. I hope to continue building our positive banking relationship with the approval of this application.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Sandra Wagner
