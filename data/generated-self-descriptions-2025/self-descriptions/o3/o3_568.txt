Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 1,372 DM loan to purchase a reliable second-hand Volkswagen Polo so I can commute to the Biochemistry Institute in Radolfzell, where I have worked as a scientific research assistant since May 2020. My current 1999 Opel Corsa is no longer road-worthy and repairs would exceed its value.

Although my checking account is overdrawn by 83 DM after school fees for my nine-year-old son Milan, my finances are otherwise solid. I earn a net 3,100 DM per month and have no other installment plans. The only credit I have ever held was the 900 DM moving loan your bank granted me in 2021; every payment was made punctually and the balance was cleared last month. I own a small condominium in Konstanz, purchased with savings earned in Slovakia before relocating three years ago.

The requested installment of roughly 60 DM fits comfortably within my budget and will be deducted automatically from my salary account. My continued employment is secured through 2027, confirmed by my contract renewal last week.

I value the trust your bank has already shown me and am committed to upholding the same payment discipline.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Frank Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a loan of 1,372 DM to replace my delivery vehicle, essential for my position as senior tool-and-die maker at LüneTech GmbH. Since February 2019 I have been responsible for urgent part deliveries between our plant and clients; public transport schedules make this impossible.

My net income is 3,250 DM monthly. Apart from one 1,200 DM renovation loan—taken at this branch in 2022 and repaid ahead of schedule—I carry no debt. My checking account is currently 45 DM in the red after child-support payments for my ten-year-old daughter Lucia, but this is within the arranged overdraft.

Being divorced and a Spanish national, I have lived in Germany for three years and own a modest detached house valued at 128,000 DM. I hold a permanent residence permit and a stable, indefinite employment contract. The proposed installment of 60 DM represents less than 2 % of my income, ensuring comfortable repayment.

I have enclosed salary slips and proof of prior credit repayment. I am confident my record demonstrates reliability and I would appreciate the opportunity to continue banking with you.

Kind regards,  
Javier Ortega

Dear Ms. Schneider,

Please accept my application for a 1,372 DM loan to acquire a new Škoda Fabia. My current car failed TÜV inspection, and dependable transport is vital for my work as an administrative clerk at the City Hall, a role I have held since June 2018.

I earn 2,900 DM net per month. The only credit I have ever taken was a 1,000 DM furniture loan from your bank; I settled it last December, never missing an installment. My checking account shows a negative balance of 67 DM, but my monthly budget allows for rapid correction. Savings stand at 72 DM after covering winter clothing for my eight-year-old son Filip.

I have resided in my own townhouse for the past three years and keep comprehensive insurance on the property. As a Polish citizen with permanent residency, I intend to stay long term; City Hall extended my contract through 2031. The requested installment of about 60 DM is well below my disposable income margin.

I value my reputation for punctuality and prudent spending and look forward to proving once again that I am a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,  
Mariusz Kowalski

Dear Credit Committee,

I wish to obtain a 1,372 DM personal loan to finance a new Opel Corsa-e. I work as a network technician at RuhrNet AG and have been continuously employed since April 2020. Field assignments across the Ruhr region make a reliable vehicle indispensable.

My monthly net salary is 3,400 DM. I have a single prior credit relationship with your bank—a 1,100 DM computer loan from 2021—which I repaid without delay. My present account is overdrawn by 51 DM due to recent dental expenses for my eleven-year-old daughter Elisa, yet I maintain all payments within my authorized overdraft. Savings amount to 58 DM.

I am divorced and have lived in Germany for three years; I own a two-room condominium in Bochum, currently mortgage-free. I hold Italian citizenship and an unlimited residence permit. The proposed installment of roughly 60 DM represents less than two percent of my income, posing no strain on my budget.

Given my spotless repayment history and stable employment, I am confident in meeting the new obligation. I would be grateful for your approval.

With best regards,  
Stefano Bianchi

Dear Members of the Lending Department,

I am requesting a loan of 1,372 DM to purchase a new Renault Clio. As a customs officer at the Baden-Württemberg Finance Office since March 2019, I travel daily between inspection sites; public transport does not align with my rotating shifts.

My net income is 3,150 DM and is guaranteed by civil-service status. I repaid a 1,000 DM relocation loan with your bank in 2023, never missing a due date. Presently my checking account shows an overdraft of 79 DM after alimony for my daughter, Ana, aged nine. Apart from 63 DM in my savings passbook, I hold no other liabilities.

I have owned my detached house in Heilbronn for the last three years, free of encumbrances. As a Croatian national with indefinite residence, I anticipate a lifelong career in German public service. The projected 60 DM monthly installment is comfortably below my discretionary threshold and will be serviced by automatic payroll deduction.

Reliability and adherence to rules define both my profession and my personal conduct. I trust this record will justify approval of the requested credit.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Danijel Petrović
