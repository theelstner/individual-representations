Dear Sir or Madam,  

I would like to request a 1 393 DM educational loan over 12 months. After eight years as a senior tooling technician with RheinSteel AG, my net monthly income is 4 200 DM, paid directly into my building-society savings account (I do not maintain a current account). I own the terraced house in which I have lived for the past four years and hold a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 24 000 DM.  

The loan will cover tuition and materials for the part-time Industrial Engineering diploma I begin at the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences this autumn. This qualification will allow me to move into process-optimization work, increasing my earnings potential and long-term job security.  

I have held three previous loans with your bank and repaid each in full and ahead of schedule; my credit file shows no arrears. Apart from an existing instalment plan with you, I carry no other debt and have never required a guarantor. As a single father supporting two teenage children, I manage my finances conservatively and can easily meet the proposed instalment rate of four.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Peter Schulte

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 1 393 DM loan to finance a twelve-month advanced English course at the Bremen Language Institute. The class is a prerequisite for a liaison position opening within the Bremen Police Department, where I have served as an A9 civil servant for fifteen years and currently earn 4 500 DM net.  

Although I use only a savings account and life-insurance contract for my banking, I have already completed three credit agreements with you, all repaid to term without incident. I reside in my own condominium—purchased outright—in Bremen-Nord and have lived there for four years. My only outstanding obligation is an instalment plan with your bank that is serviced regularly.  

The planned course will improve my career prospects and, consequently, my income. My stable public-service salary, spotless repayment history, and lack of other debt make me a dependable borrower. I can comfortably cover the agreed instalment rate of four from monthly disposable income while continuing to support my two dependent parents.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Markus Klein

Dear Sirs,  

I hereby request an educational loan of 1 393 DM for twelve months to pay for the Certified IT Security Specialist night programme at the Munich Chamber of Commerce. I have been employed for nine years as a network technician at SüdNet GmbH, with a net monthly salary of 4 050 DM that is deposited directly into my building-society savings agreement; I do not maintain a current account.  

Home ownership keeps my housing costs low, and a life-insurance policy valued at 22 000 DM provides additional security. Over the past six years I have concluded three loans with your institution—all settled punctually. Current commitments are limited to one instalment plan with you; no other creditors or guarantors exist.  

The certification will qualify me for a promotion already discussed with my employer, increasing my annual income by an estimated 15 %. With steady employment, property, and an unblemished credit record, I am confident in my ability to service the instalment rate of four.  

I appreciate your favourable consideration of my application.  

Kind regards,  
Thomas Bauer

To the Credit Department,  

I seek a 1 393 DM loan over 12 months to fund evening classes in managerial accounting at the Hamburg Business Academy. For the past eight years I have worked as a master machine fitter at HanseMarine Werft, earning 3 900 DM net per month. Salary is paid into my savings account; I do not hold a current account.  

I own the detached house where I have resided four years and hold a life-insurance policy currently worth 20 500 DM. I have completed three prior credit contracts with your bank, each repaid without delay. My only ongoing obligation is a modest bank instalment, and I have no additional debt.  

The course will prepare me for a supervisory role already offered by my employer, which will raise my income and stability. As a single guardian of my two nieces, I budget carefully and can meet the proposed instalment rate of four comfortably from disposable income.  

My consistent repayment history and solid collateral underscore my reliability. I look forward to your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Jens Hoffmann

Dear Credit Officer,  

I wish to obtain a 1 393 DM educational loan, repayable over 12 months, to cover tuition for the Distance-Learning French Diploma with the University of Strasbourg. The course will support my forthcoming transfer to our Paris office; I have worked for Allianz Versicherung as a claims analyst for ten years and earn a steady 4 300 DM net.  

I keep my finances through a building-society savings agreement and life-insurance policy valued at 23 000 DM and therefore operate without a current account. My residence—a townhouse I own outright—has been my home for four years.  

My credit history consists of three loans with your bank, all repaid in full and on time. Aside from a single standing instalment with you, I hold no other debts. My monthly surplus easily accommodates the requested instalment rate of four while supporting my two dependent younger brothers.  

Given my stable employment, assets, and impeccable repayment record, I am a low-risk candidate. I respectfully ask for your positive decision.  

Thank you for your time.  

Yours faithfully,  
Alexander Weber
