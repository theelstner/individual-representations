Stuttgart, 12 September 1994  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Elena Petrova, a 20-year-old Bulgarian citizen working as a scientific laboratory assistant at Siemens AG in Stuttgart. I have been permanently employed there for 2 years and 6 months and earn a net salary of 2 450 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 2 039 DM to furnish my new rented flat and to purchase a used laptop that will allow me to complete my evening engineering course.  

Although my current checking account shows a debit balance of 280 DM caused by recent moving expenses, I have never missed a payment on any obligation. Last year I took a 1 500 DM personal loan with your bank and repaid it three months ahead of schedule. I own a small, mortgage-free plot of land near Varna valued at approximately 30 000 DM; the title deed is enclosed.  

With my steady income I can comfortably service an instalment of 170 DM per month, which will clear the loan in 12 months. I will authorise payroll deduction to guarantee punctual payment. I trust my record and collateral demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Heidelberg, 14 September 1994  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Ana González, age 20, have been employed for 1 year and 8 months as a qualified nursing assistant at the University Hospital Heidelberg, earning 2 200 DM net monthly. Following my recent divorce, I rent a small two-room flat for myself and my four-year-old son. I seek a loan of 2 039 DM to buy essential furniture, a refrigerator and a washing machine.  

My account is presently overdrawn by 190 DM because of the security deposit on the flat, but my salary on the 30th of this month will restore it. I have no other debts. A 500 DM consumer credit taken last year was repaid exactly as agreed. I also own a one-third share in my parents’ house in Seville, Spain, with an appraised value of about 80 000 DM, free of liens.  

I propose repaying the requested amount in 14 monthly instalments of 150 DM via standing order. The hospital has issued a permanent contract, a copy of which I attach, ensuring income stability. I am confident my past repayment behaviour and the security of my real-estate share confirm my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Respectfully,  
Ana González

Frankfurt a.M., 16 September 1994  

Dear Loan Department,  

My name is Marta Kowalska, 20, employed as a junior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since July 1991 (3 years and 2 months). My net monthly income is 2 600 DM plus overtime. I request a loan of 2 039 DM to purchase bedroom furniture and a computer for my daughter’s schooling.  

I currently hold one revolving credit with your bank that was settled in full last month and have never incurred arrears. My checking account shows a negative balance of 310 DM, a temporary situation after paying my daughter’s kindergarten fee in advance. I possess a mortgage-free apartment in Kraków worth roughly 40 000 DM, which underscores my long-term solvency.  

An instalment plan of 170 DM over 12 months fits easily within my budget; I will arrange automatic deductions on payday. My civil-service status provides job security, and my spotless credit record reflects my commitment to meeting obligations.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Marta Kowalska

Ludwigshafen, 18 September 1994  

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Lilia Ivanova, a 20-year-old Bulgarian machinist employed at BASF AG for 1 year and 3 months, earning 2 300 DM net per month. I am separated and support my two-year-old son. I wish to obtain a 2 039 DM loan to buy a set of precision power tools and an industrial sewing machine so I can start a home-based repair service that will supplement my income.  

My checking account is overdrafted by 260 DM after covering day-care fees, but this will be cleared with my next salary. I have no outstanding loans except the overdraft. In 1993 I repaid a 1 200 DM study loan without delay. An inherited studio apartment in Varna, valued at about 25 000 DM, stands free of any charges and documents my asset base.  

I can discharge the requested credit in 12 monthly instalments of 180 DM, and I will authorise direct debit. My steady employment at BASF and earlier flawless repayment record demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Lilia Ivanova

Munich, 20 September 1994  

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Katarina Novak, 20, a Croatian citizen employed for 2 years and 11 months as a postal clerk with Deutsche Bundespost in Munich, earning a secure net salary of 2 400 DM monthly. Following my divorce, I rent a one-bedroom flat where I live with my two-year-old daughter. I hereby request a loan of 2 039 DM to furnish my child’s room and purchase a dishwasher and wardrobe.  

My current account shows a debit of 230 DM due to the recent rent deposit; otherwise I keep it in good order. In 1992 I took a 1 000 DM loan from this bank and repaid it in ten scheduled instalments without a single delay. I own cultivated farmland near Zagreb valued at approximately 35 000 DM, free of encumbrances, demonstrating demonstrable collateral.  

I plan to repay the requested sum over 12 months at roughly 170 DM per month via standing order from my salary account. My public-sector position offers long-term employment security, and my past repayment history proves my reliability.  

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Katarina Novak
