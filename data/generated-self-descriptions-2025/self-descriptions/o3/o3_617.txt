Frankfurt, 17 September 2025

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Karl Hoffmann, 48, single, resident and homeowner in Mainz since 2023. For the past three years I have worked as Operations Manager at Meyer Logistics GmbH, earning a steady net income of 8,900 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 12,204 DM over 48 months to upgrade two delivery vans to Euro-6 standard and install new routing software. These investments will lower fuel costs and win an already-negotiated contract with BASF worth 240,000 DM annually.

My account balance is presently 120 DM because I have just paid quarterly VAT and a 3,000 DM advance for the software license. I hold no savings account but I own my house (market value 350,000 DM) and a 2018 Audi A4. I have one small renovation loan with your bank—now at 7,200 DM—that I have serviced perfectly for 30 months. Every previous credit, including my mortgage, was settled in full and on time.

I am the sole provider for my fourteen-year-old son. The requested installment of about 305 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving over 6,000 DM free after all obligations. I am reachable at any time on 06131-55 44 88 and will gladly supply contracts and income statements. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to continuing our reliable relationship.

Sincerely,
Karl Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dr. Stefan Weiss, a 48-year-old patent attorney working independently for the past two and a half years after seventeen years in corporate practice. My net income averages 7,200 DM monthly, documented by the enclosed tax assessments. I request a loan of 12,204 DM, to be repaid in 48 equal installments, in order to purchase a specialized IP-management software suite and fund a part-time paralegal position. These upgrades will allow me to service an incoming client—Tesla GmbH—whose retainer alone exceeds 90,000 DM per year.

My current checking balance is 60 DM; most available cash was reinvested in marketing during the last quarter. I have no savings account, but I own my home in Schwabing and a 2020 BMW 3-Series (insured value 26,500 DM). All previous credits, including a 2019 equipment loan, were settled ahead of schedule. I have one active facility with your bank, a 4,800 DM balance that will be fully repaid in nine months.

I support one dependent, my university student daughter. The projected monthly installment of roughly 305 DM represents less than 5 % of my net income, leaving ample liquidity. With a flawless payment record and collateral assets, I trust you will find me a low-risk candidate. Feel free to reach me at 089-32 11 77 for any clarification.

Respectfully,
Dr. Stefan Weiss

To the Loan Department,

My name is Dipl.-Ing. Markus Berger, age 48, a Senior Automation Engineer at Siemens AG since January 2024. I seek a 12,204 DM business loan over 48 months to acquire a desktop CNC milling machine for a registered side venture producing prototype enclosures for local start-ups. The machine will generate an estimated 2,500 DM in additional monthly revenue, supported by signed letters of intent from three clients.

My present account shows 185 DM after annual property-tax payment. I maintain no separate savings account; however, I own my townhouse in Fürth (valued at 280,000 DM) and a 2019 Volvo V60. I carry one remaining facility with your bank—an education loan for my son with a balance of 3,900 DM—serviced without delay for the past eighteen months. My credit file otherwise shows only fully satisfied obligations.

Current net salary is 9,500 DM per month. The projected repayment of about 305 DM fits easily within my 30 % debt-service ratio threshold. As a trained engineer with stable employment and proven discipline, I am confident of meeting every installment. I can be contacted at 0911-48 22 99.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Markus Berger

Hamburg, 17 September 2025

Esteemed Committee Members,

I am Captain Johannes Richter, 48, single, currently commanding the Harbour Police Response Unit. I was promoted to this post in May 2023 after twenty-four years of service; my net monthly pay, including allowances, is 7,800 DM. I request a 12,204 DM business loan, amortized over 48 months, to launch a licensed maritime-security consultancy in partnership with the city’s Chamber of Commerce. Startup costs cover professional liability insurance and ISO 28007 certification.

My checking account stands at 90 DM following payment of my son’s school tuition. I keep no separate savings but own my detached house in Bergedorf and a 2017 Mercedes C-Class. I have one existing credit line with your bank for home solar panels; the 5,100 DM balance is serviced punctually. All previous loans were repaid on schedule, which your files will confirm.

The planned installment of roughly 305 DM represents 3.9 % of my net income and is further protected by my pension entitlement. My spotless service record and stable career demonstrate reliability. I am reachable at 040-66 12 31 and will gladly provide additional documentation.

Respectfully,
Captain Johannes Richter

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Andreas Kühn, 48, General Manager of the Königshof Business Hotel. Since December 2021 I have overseen all operations, drawing a net salary of 8,400 DM per month plus performance bonuses. I apply for a 12,204 DM loan, to be repaid over 48 months, to modernize our conference wing with fiber-optic cabling and modular seating. Confirmed bookings from Bosch and Porsche depend on this upgrade and will boost annual revenue by approximately 150,000 DM.

My current checking balance is 140 DM—capital was recently deployed to prepay suppliers. I hold no savings account, yet I own my condominium (market value 310,000 DM) and a 2018 Skoda Superb. I have one small outstanding credit at your bank for kitchen equipment, balance 6,000 DM, never in arrears. Earlier loans were repaid ahead of time.

I support one dependent, my twelve-year-old son. With fixed costs well below 50 % of income, the 305 DM monthly installment will be covered comfortably. I am available any time at 0711-55 88 99 and will present audited accounts upon request.

Thank you for your continued trust.

Sincerely,
Andreas Kühn
