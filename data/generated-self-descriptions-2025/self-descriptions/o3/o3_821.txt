Frankfurt, 15 May 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Emil Petrović. I am 26, married, and have a two-year-old daughter. For the past 2 years and 7 months I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Biophysik, earning a net salary of 2 650 DM per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 1 345 DM to purchase a combined radio/television set so my family can stay informed and connected with relatives abroad. My current account is overdrawn by 162 DM after paying our son’s hospital bill, and my savings amount to 78 DM. Nevertheless, I have consistently met every obligation: the furniture loan I took from your bank last year—monthly installment 85 DM—is always paid on the 1st of each month and is now 60 % repaid.  

Though I arrived from Serbia only three years ago, I already own a small condominium in Offenbach that I purchased with my wife’s inheritance; the title is registered free of liens. We have lived there since moving to Germany. With no other debts, a stable income, and property as collateral, I am confident I can meet the proposed 18-month repayment schedule of roughly 80 DM plus interest per month.  

I value the trust your bank has shown me, and I look forward to continuing our good relationship. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Emil Petrović

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  

I am Carlos Fernandes, a 26-year-old married Portuguese national working as a certified CNC milling technician at Bosch Rexroth AG. My employment began on 1 October 2022, and I currently earn 2 800 DM net.  

I request a loan of 1 345 DM to purchase a television set and satellite tuner that will allow my wife and our young son to watch news broadcasts in both German and Portuguese as part of our ongoing language practice. Our checking account shows an overdraft of 94 DM, and our savings stand at 53 DM.  

My credit record is spotless: a 3 000 DM renovation loan obtained from your branch in 2023 has been repaid punctually for 20 consecutive months. We own a 65 m² apartment in Waiblingen, valued at roughly 120 000 DM, which we occupy ourselves; the mortgage is fully paid thanks to family support.  

With no guarantors required, one dependent, and monthly household expenses well below my income, I can comfortably manage the new installment of about 84 DM. I will set up automatic transfers to avoid any delay.  

I appreciate your time and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Carlos Fernandes

Nürnberg, 10 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Igor K. Kovalenko, widower and single father to a five-year-old boy. Since January 2023 I have served as a junior customs officer (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) at Flughafen Nürnberg, drawing 2 550 DM net.  

I seek a loan of 1 345 DM over 18 months to buy a new radio/TV combo to replace the unit damaged during last month’s electrical surge. Insurance covered the refrigerator but not the television. My account is currently –121 DM; savings total 97 DM.  

You may note I still have one active credit with your bank—1 800 DM for language courses—which is 75 % paid off with every installment honored precisely on the due date. I own a small terraced house in Fürth inherited from my late wife; land registry documents are available. I carry no other debts.  

Given my civil-service position, steady salary, and real-estate ownership, I am confident in meeting the monthly payment of roughly 80 DM. I respectfully request your approval and thank you for the trust we have built.  

Kind regards,  
Igor Kovalenko

To the Credit Department,  

I am Ahmed Yusuf Khan, 26, married, and employed for 1 year and 11 months as an avionics technician at Lufthansa Technik. My net income is 3 050 DM.  

I apply for a loan of 1 345 DM to purchase a smart television and DAB+ radio kit, tools I need for my evening remote-learning engineering course. My checking account shows –88 DM due to tuition fees last semester; I have 64 DM in a Passiv-Sparbuch.  

The 2 400 DM moving loan you granted me in 2023 is serviced without delay—15 payments made, 3 remaining. I possess a registered 120 m² parcel in Pakistan and jointly own the townhouse we occupy in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg, free of mortgage.  

With a debt-to-income ratio below 10 % after adding this new installment (~84 DM monthly), and no additional creditors, I present a low-risk profile. I will authorize a payroll deduction to guarantee punctual repayment.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to continuing our cooperation.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Yusuf Khan

München, 8 May 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Tomasz Nowak, a 26-year-old married Polish citizen residing in Germany since 2022. I have been working for 3 years and 2 months as a certified telecommunications line installer with Deutsche Telekom, earning 2 720 DM net.  

I wish to finance the purchase of a 42-inch LED television and digital radio receiver costing 1 345 DM. My account is overdrawn by 137 DM after repairing my work van; my savings stand at 81 DM.  

I already have one small loan with your branch—secured last year to buy tools—which I repay at 90 DM per month and have never missed a payment. We live in and own a 54 m² condo in Giesing, purchased outright with family help. I have no other liabilities, and my only dependent is my newborn daughter.  

The planned 18-month installment of roughly 80 DM represents less than 3 % of my take-home pay. I will arrange automatic debit to ensure timely settlement. Owning property and having an impeccable payment record demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any clarification and hope to receive a positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak
