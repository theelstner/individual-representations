Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Kovács, a 23-year-old Hungarian national living in Munich since 2021. I work as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Quantenoptik, a position I started nine months ago with a net monthly income of 1 950 DM. I am applying for a loan of 448 DM to finance a six-month online certificate in data analysis offered by the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität. The program will upgrade my skills and allow me to progress to a higher salary scale next spring.  

Financially, I currently carry no other installment plans. My previous 300 DM consumer loan with your bank was fully repaid two months ahead of schedule in July 2024. While my checking account is overdrawn by 46 DM, it is within my authorized limit. I keep 82 DM in a building-society savings agreement and hold a 6 000 DM life-insurance policy, both of which I can pledge if needed.  

As a divorced mother of a two-year-old son, reliability is essential to me. My salary comfortably covers the proposed 4-DM weekly installment, and my department head has provided a letter confirming contract renewal for at least the next two years. I therefore respectfully request approval of this small education loan and thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovács

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  

I am Sofía Alvarez, a Spanish citizen employed since November 2024 as a junior administrative officer at the Bezirksamt Pankow. My current net income is 1 880 DM. I am requesting a 448 DM loan to pay the tuition balance for a six-month evening course in German commercial law at the Volkshochschule Berlin-Mitte, which is required for my next civil-service pay grade.  

I have demonstrated creditworthiness: a 500 DM relocation loan taken with you in 2023 was repaid exactly on schedule in April 2025. My checking account shows a temporary negative balance of 73 DM, again within the authorized overdraft. Savings stand at 57 DM in a Bausparvertrag; I also hold a 5 000 DM life-insurance policy with Allianz. I possess no other debts, and my four-year-old condominium in Prenzlauer Berg provides stable housing for me and my five-year-old daughter.  

With a secure public-sector position, an impeccable repayment record, and monthly disposable income of about 420 DM after all household expenses, I am confident of meeting the 4-DM weekly installment without delay. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Sofía Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anja Petrović. I am a 23-year-old Croatian laboratory technologist at Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, employed since January 2025 with a net salary of 2 020 DM. I seek a 448 DM loan to cover the fees for a certified phlebotomy course beginning next month, a qualification that will raise my income by roughly 15 % upon completion.  

I have maintained an excellent credit history: a 400 DM furniture loan from your branch was fully settled in May 2024. My current account is 39 DM in the red but inside the permitted overdraft. I hold 91 DM in a building-society savings plan and a 7 500 DM endowment life-insurance policy. I own a small studio apartment purchased in 2022 through the city’s subsidized housing program and have no other ongoing debts. I am separated and support my three-year-old son alone.  

The proposed repayment of 4 DM per week represents less than 1 % of my monthly income, a commitment I can easily honor. My employer has issued a statement guaranteeing employment for the next 24 months. I trust these factors attest to my reliability, and I kindly request approval of my application.  

Respectfully,  
Anja Petrović

To the Credit Department,  

I am Lien Nguyen, Vietnamese by birth and resident of Hamburg since 2020. For the past eight months I have worked as a certified dental assistant at AlsterDental GmbH, earning 1 940 DM net monthly. I wish to borrow 448 DM to finance a six-month weekend course in digital radiography mandated by my employer for promotion to senior assistant.  

My only previous borrowing—a 350 DM education loan with your bank—was repaid punctually by December 2023. Presently my checking account shows a negative balance of 51 DM, well within the authorized 200 DM overdraft. I have 64 DM in a Bausparvertrag and carry a 6 800 DM life-insurance policy. I reside in a townhouse I co-own with my sister, where I live with my four-year-old daughter. No other installment plans or guarantor obligations exist.  

My monthly surplus after household costs is approximately 400 DM, so the 4-DM weekly installment poses no strain. Strong employment prospects in healthcare, coupled with my flawless credit record, make me a dependable candidate. Thank you for considering my request.  

Kind regards,  
Lien Nguyen

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Elena Dimitrova, a 23-year-old Bulgarian citizen employed as an IT support technician at Deutsche Börse AG since December 2024, earning a net salary of 2 150 DM. I apply for a 448 DM loan to enroll in a six-month Cisco CCNA evening course at the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce. The certification will make me eligible for a projected salary increase to 2 600 DM next year.  

Regarding my financial situation, I currently hold no outstanding loans other than the 300 DM starter credit I took with your bank in 2022 and repaid in full by February 2023. My Girokonto is overdrafted by 34 DM, within the allowed 250 DM. I maintain 79 DM in a building-society savings plan and a 5 500 DM life-insurance policy with ERGO. I own a small apartment in Sachsenhausen, purchased through the city’s young-families program, where I live with my two-year-old son. I am married but legally separated; my husband provides no financial support.  

My net disposable income after living expenses is roughly 450 DM monthly, ensuring the 4-DM weekly installment will be met comfortably. A steady career in a blue-chip company, past punctual repayments, and available collateral underscore my trustworthiness. I appreciate your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Dimitrova
