Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ahmed Saleh, a 30-year-old mechanical technician employed at the BMW plant in Munich since February 1997. I am applying for a 3 566 DM business loan over 48 months to purchase a second-hand CNC lathe for the small precision-parts workshop I run evenings in my own garage. The machine will let me double output and sign a standing contract with a local bicycle maker.  

My current finances are solid: net salary 3 050 DM, monthly expenses 1 800 DM, and 320 DM in a savings account. My checking account balance averages 140 DM because I transfer surplus funds to savings each payday. I own a 1994 Volkswagen Golf (cleared) and a studio flat that I inherited last year.  

Five years ago your bank financed that Golf; every installment was settled before due date, and the loan closed without incident. I hold no other debts, have lived at my present address for two years, and responsibly support my six-year-old son who stays with me on weekends.  

I request the loan be repaid in equal monthly installments and welcome any further documentation you may require. Thank you for your consideration and continued trust.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Saleh

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Carlos Rodríguez, a Spanish national working as an IT support specialist at Frankfurt Insurance Group since June 1998. I seek a 3 566 DM loan, repayable over 48 months, to fund the initial software licences for a part-time mobile device repair service I am launching with a colleague.  

Financially, I maintain 280 DM in savings, and my checking balance is presently 95 DM after monthly transfers. My net salary is 2 800 DM, with living costs of roughly 1 650 DM. I own a 1995 Opel Astra and a small condominium purchased outright two years ago.  

Your bank granted me a 2 000 DM consumer loan in 1999 for professional training; it was repaid six months early. I carry no other obligations, have resided at my current address for two years, and responsibly support my seven-year-old daughter who lives with her mother in Valencia.  

I believe my stable employment, clean credit history, and realistic business plan make me a reliable borrower. I would be pleased to discuss details or provide additional paperwork.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos Rodríguez

To the Credit Department,  

I am Ivan Petrović, a Serbian engineer employed for six years with Berliner Stadtwerke as a certified HVAC specialist. I request a 3 566 DM loan for 48 months to purchase professional design software and marketing materials for a consulting side business focused on eco-retrofits in small apartment blocks.  

My monthly net income is 3 200 DM; after expenses of 1 900 DM I routinely move funds to savings (currently 410 DM). My checking account balance is 120 DM. I own a 1993 Ford Mondeo and hold title to a modest row house acquired through inheritance.  

In 1997 I financed that car through your bank and repaid the credit punctually. I have no additional debts, no guarantors, and no telephone line by personal choice. I have lived at my present address for two years, and I financially support my eight-year-old son who visits every other week.  

Given my consistent repayment record and steady employment, I am confident of meeting the proposed monthly installments. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrović

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Leandro Silva, a Brazilian laboratory analyst at Bayer AG in Leverkusen, employed since May 1999. I wish to borrow 3 566 DM over 48 months to equip a small home-based water-quality testing service targeted at local breweries.  

My finances are straightforward: net pay 2 650 DM, fixed costs 1 600 DM, 290 DM in savings, and a current checking balance of 60 DM. I own a reliable 1996 Renault Clio and hold the deed to a one-bedroom flat purchased with family funds.  

Three years ago I took a 1 800 DM educational loan with your institution and paid every installment on schedule. Presently I carry no other obligations, have lived at the same address for two years, and support my five-year-old son who lives in Brazil with his mother.  

My solid employment history, existing property, and impeccable repayment record demonstrate my creditworthiness. I would be happy to supply any supplemental information required.  

Sincerely,  
Leandro Silva

Esteemed Members of the Credit Committee,  

My name is Piotr Kowalski, a Polish customs officer stationed at the Port of Hamburg since January 1998. I seek a 3 566 DM, 48-month loan to lease a vending kiosk near the port and stock the initial inventory of specialty maritime tools—an underserved niche I have researched extensively.  

I earn 2 900 DM net each month, spend about 1 700 DM on living costs, and keep 350 DM in a savings account. My checking balance fluctuates around 110 DM at month-end. I own a 1994 Toyota Corolla and a small townhouse that is mortgage-free.  

In 1999 your bank financed my Corolla; all payments were made on or before their due dates. I hold no other credits, guarantees, or installment plans. I have been at my current residence for two years and provide child support for my six-year-old daughter in Gdańsk.  

With steady civil-service employment, existing assets, and a flawless repayment record, I am confident of honoring the proposed repayment schedule. Thank you for considering my request.  

Respectfully,  
Piotr Kowalski
