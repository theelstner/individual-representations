Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Leila Amiri, a 22-year-old Iranian medical laboratory assistant employed at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Hospital in Munich since 1 November 2024. I have lived at my present rented address in Neuhausen for four years, where I raise my four-year-old son after a recent divorce. I am applying for a loan of 2,301 DM, to be repaid over nine months, to purchase basic furniture for my child’s room and a modest computer that will allow me to finish a distance-learning course.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I maintain a building-society savings contract with a balance of 380 DM and have never missed a payment on the 600 DM relocation loan granted by your bank last year; that loan will be closed next month. My net monthly income is 3,000 DM, so the proposed instalment of roughly 256 DM represents less than 9 % of my earnings.

My position is permanent, my credit record flawless, and my savings show foresight. I am therefore confident in my ability to meet the new obligation and will open a current account with your branch for automatic payment.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Leila Amiri



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Maria Kowalczyk, a 22-year-old Polish customs clerk employed at Frankfurt Airport since 1 December 2024. For the past four years I have lived in the same rented flat in Sachsenhausen, now shared with my new husband. I request a loan of 2,301 DM, repayable in nine monthly instalments of approximately 256 DM, to furnish our home with essential appliances.

I currently keep only a savings book with 290 DM and a life-insurance policy, but I have an impeccable record on the 900 DM study loan you granted me last year—four payments remain. My net salary is 2,650 DM, and my husband covers most household costs, ensuring the new instalment is well within our budget.

As a federal customs official I hold a secure, vetted position, underscoring my reliability. I will gladly open my first current account with your bank and set up a standing order for the repayments.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Maria Kowalczyk



Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Carmen Ortiz Díaz, a 22-year-old Spanish pastry chef employed since 15 November 2024 at Café Brenner in Stuttgart. I have occupied the same rented studio in Bad Cannstatt for four years with my daughter Lucia. I am seeking a 2,301 DM loan, to be repaid over nine months at about 256 DM per month, to buy child-safe furniture, a refrigerator, and professional utensils for home-based orders.

I contribute to a building-society savings agreement that holds 140 DM and have never missed a payment on the 700 DM relocation loan granted by your bank; it will be cleared next month. My net income averages 2,350 DM including tips, so the repayment equates to roughly 11 % of my earnings.

With no other debts, a contract that has just been made permanent, and a proven repayment history, I believe I am a dependable borrower. I will open a checking account with your branch for automatic deductions.

Thank you for your kind attention.

Warm regards,
Carmen Ortiz Díaz



Dear Loan Department,

I am Jelena Vidović, 22, a Croatian dental laboratory technician working at Zahntechnik Kremer GmbH in Cologne since 3 January 2025. I have rented the same apartment in Ehrenfeld for the past four years, now shared with my younger brother under my guardianship. I request a loan of 2,301 DM with a nine-month repayment plan (about 256 DM monthly) to acquire essential household furniture and a workbench for freelance assignments.

I hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 420 DM and a small savings book. The 500 DM consumer loan I took from your bank last spring is being serviced punctually; three instalments remain. My net monthly wage is approximately 2,450 DM, making the new payment easily affordable.

My employer has confirmed a long-term contract upon completion of my first year, and my credit record is spotless. I am willing to open a current account with you to facilitate automatic repayments.

Kind regards,
Jelena Vidović



Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Thu Nguyen, a 22-year-old Vietnamese mechanical maintenance technician employed at Siemens AG in Erlangen since 20 October 2024. I have lived at the same rented address in Bruck for four years with my six-year-old son Minh. I am applying for a 2,301 DM loan, payable over nine months (about 256 DM monthly), to purchase a child’s bed, a washing machine, and the professional tools required for my upcoming certification.

My savings consist of a building-society agreement with a balance of 310 DM. The 800 DM starter loan you granted me in March 2023 will be fully settled in two months; every instalment has been honoured on time. I carry no other debts.

My permanent contract provides a net salary of 2,800 DM, so the requested instalment uses less than 10 % of my income. Employer references and prior repayment history attest to my reliability.

Upon approval I will open my first checking account with your branch and arrange a standing order for the loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Thu Nguyen
