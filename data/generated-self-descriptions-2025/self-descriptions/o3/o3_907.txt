Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Jonas Meier, 20 years old, single, and the legal guardian of my two younger brothers after our parents’ passing. For the past 2 years and 3 months I have been employed as an assistant store manager at Aldi Süd in Stuttgart, earning a fixed net income of 2,450 DM per month. I respectfully apply for a loan of 1,107 DM to purchase a radio-television set for our rented apartment; it will allow my brothers to follow school broadcasts as part of their distance-learning curriculum.  

My current checking account shows an overdraft of 312 DM that is automatically covered every payday. Apart from a small savings balance of 64 DM, I own a one-sixth share in my late parents’ farmhouse in Ulm, which is fully paid off. I have held one installment loan with your bank (taken last year for school supplies) and have never missed a payment; the balance will be cleared in four months.  

With a steady income, low overall debt, and a proven repayment record, I am confident of meeting the proposed 2 % installment rate comfortably. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Jonas Meier

Esteemed Credit Department,  

I am Amir Khan, a 20-year-old Pakistani software engineer employed by TechWave GmbH in Mannheim since February 2023. My net monthly salary is 2,980 DM. I am single but financially responsible for my widowed mother and teenage sister who live with me.  

I request a loan of 1,107 DM to buy a combined radio and television unit. Besides serving normal entertainment needs, the TV’s HDMI-capture feature will let me test media-streaming applications that I develop at work, directly supporting my performance and salary growth.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 147 DM following a recent rent deposit; however, I have never exceeded my agreed limit. I keep 55 DM in a postal savings book for emergencies and co-own a small plot of inherited land in Rawalpindi valued at roughly 22,000 DM. One study loan I took last year through your bank has been serviced without delay—eight installments paid on time. I have no other debts.  

Given my uninterrupted employment, rising income, and clean credit history, I trust you will find me a reliable borrower. I appreciate your positive consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Amir Khan

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Luka Vuković, a 20-year-old Croatian national residing in Munich for the past two years. I operate Vuko-Design, a registered web-design business that has produced stable monthly profits averaging 2,300 DM since January 2022. I support my twin nephews, aged six, who recently moved in with me after my sister’s relocation.  

To furnish our flat with educational media, I seek a personal loan of 1,107 DM to buy a modern radio/television set. My business account currently shows a debit of 89 DM, while my private savings total 71 DM. I own a 400-square-metre building lot outside Split, appraised at 35,000 DM and free of liens.  

Last year I obtained a 2,500 DM equipment loan from your branch; every installment has been paid before its due date, and the outstanding balance is now 540 DM. I have no other credit obligations, nor do I intend to assume additional debt. The requested installment rate of 2 % fits well within my monthly cash flow projections prepared by my accountant, Frau Sandra Keller.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Luka Vuković

To the Lending Office,  

I am Pierre Dubois, age 20, serving as a junior logistics officer with the French-German Brigade in Müllheim since November 2023. My net monthly pay, including housing allowance, is 2,620 DM. Though single, I financially support my retired grandparents in Metz and my 4-year-old cousin placed under my tutelage.  

I wish to obtain a 1,107 DM loan for a radio/television system that will provide language programming and news channels necessary for my cross-border duties. My current account, with your bank for the last twelve months, is overdrawn by 201 DM following annual insurance payments. A modest savings balance of 48 DM is held in a Bundespost Sparkarte.  

I own, together with my mother, a mortgage-free apartment in Reims valued at approximately 68,000 DM. The relocation loan you granted me nine months ago is serviced through automatic payroll deduction; seven payments have been made punctually. I keep no other installment plans and have never defaulted on any financial commitment.  

With a secure military salary and proven diligence, I am confident of meeting the 2 % repayment schedule. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Pierre Dubois

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Miguel Santos, 20 years old, employed as the assistant manager of La Bodega Española in Hamburg for 3 years and 1 month. I currently earn a net salary of 2,150 DM per month and use part of it to raise my two younger cousins living with me since their parents returned to Spain for medical treatment.  

I seek a loan of 1,107 DM to purchase a radio/television set for our rented apartment. Besides providing the children with educational broadcasts, I intend to use the TV to display digital menus at the restaurant during off-hours, boosting my work performance and potential bonuses.  

My checking account stands at –176 DM, well within my authorised overdraft. I maintain 83 DM in a savings bond and co-own my late grandfather’s olive grove in Córdoba, estimated at 41,000 DM, free of encumbrances. A small moving loan (1,000 DM) taken from your bank last year is down to its final three installments, all paid punctually. I have no additional debts.  

Given my stable income, tangible assets, and impeccable repayment record, I respectfully request favorable consideration of this application.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos
