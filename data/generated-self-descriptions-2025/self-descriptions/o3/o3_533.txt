Frankfurt, 25 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anna Müller, divorced, 28 years old, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Bayer AG in Frankfurt for the past 3 years and 1 month. I am applying for a loan of 2,631 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my twelve-year-old car, which can no longer pass TÜV inspection. The vehicle is essential for my 42-km daily commute and for transporting my seven-year-old son to school and medical appointments.  

Financially I am on stable ground. My net income is 3,100 DM per month, and my company contract is permanent. I maintain a current account with your bank that averages 120 DM and a savings balance of 350 DM. I have already taken two loans with your institution (2018 furniture loan and 2020 education loan) and repaid both on schedule without a single late installment, which your records can confirm. I presently hold no other debt obligations.  

I have selected installment rate class 2, resulting in a comfortable monthly payment of roughly 180 DM over 15 months. With secure employment, a solid repayment record, and dependable contact information (private telephone 069-7564 998), I am confident I can meet this commitment and remain a trustworthy customer.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our cooperative relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Munich, 24 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Sara Costa, married, Italian citizen registered in Germany, 28 years old. For the past 2 years and 4 months I have served as a junior civil clerk at the Munich District Court. In order to fulfill work duties that require site visits to outlying offices, I need a reliable vehicle. I request a 2,631 DM loan to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo under the 15-month plan.  

My monthly net salary is 2,750 DM, transferred to my current account with your bank, which at present holds 190 DM. Additionally I keep 420 DM in a savings passbook. I possess no credit cards and no outstanding debts. Two earlier credits—an appliance loan (2019) and a relocation loan (2021)—were both repaid ahead of schedule, demonstrating my reliability.  

My chosen installment rate of class 2 fits easily within my budget at about 180 DM each month. My apartment rent is fixed, and my husband contributes separately to household expenses, leaving my salary free to service the loan. I can be reached anytime via telephone 089-4411 872.  

I value the trust we have built and assure you that this new obligation will be honored with the same punctuality as my previous ones.  

Kind regards,  
Sara Costa

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Elena Novak, separated, age 28. Since January 2024 (1 year 9 months) I have been employed as a certified IT support specialist at Bosch Service Solutions GmbH, earning a steady net income of 3,250 DM. My previous fifteen-year-old car was stolen in July; therefore I request a 2,631 DM loan to finance a new Škoda Fabia needed for commuting and caring for my eight-year-old daughter.  

I keep both my checking (current balance 85 DM, average 140 DM) and savings (295 DM) accounts with your branch. You will see two prior credits from 2018 and 2020, both repaid in full and on time. I have no other installment plans, guarantors, or credit lines elsewhere.  

The proposed installment rate class 2 corresponds to a monthly repayment of approximately 180 DM over 15 months—well below my disposable income margin. My tenancy in my present flat has been stable for 4 years, and I possess a small scooter that stands as additional movable property. You may contact me by telephone at 0711-5589 334 for any further details.  

I trust the above demonstrates my capacity and commitment to meet every payment punctually. Thank you for your favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Novak

Cologne, 22 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Katja Schneider, married, 28 years old, employed as a mechanical design drafter at Siemens Energy in Cologne since March 2023 (2 years 6 months). I seek a 2,631 DM loan to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. My current 2005 model is repeatedly breaking down, making punctual arrival at work and childcare for my three-year-old son increasingly uncertain.  

Financial overview:  
• Net monthly pay: 2,980 DM (paid to my account with you, present balance 160 DM)  
• Savings passbook: 410 DM  
• No other debts or credit cards  

Your files will confirm that I previously obtained a computer loan in 2019 and a holiday loan in 2022, both settled without arrears. I propose the standard 15-month term and installment rate group 2 (≈180 DM/month), which fits comfortably within my household budget, as my husband covers rent and utilities.  

I have resided at my current address for 4 years and can be reached anytime at 0221-6631 745. My steady employment and impeccable repayment record underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for assessing my request. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Katja Schneider

Esteemed Members of the Loan Department,  

My name is Miriam Vogel, 28, legally separated, and I have worked as a state-certified pediatric nurse at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf for 3 years 2 months. I wish to obtain a 2,631 DM loan to buy a new, fuel-efficient Renault Clio so I can manage night shifts and transport my six-year-old son safely during early hours.  

I earn a steady 2,850 DM net each month. My current account with your bank shows a balance of 105 DM and an average turnover of roughly 3,000 DM. I additionally maintain 260 DM in a savings booklet. I have held two previous loans with you—a 2018 training loan and a 2020 household-goods loan—both paid off exactly on schedule. I hold no other liabilities.  

With installment class 2, my monthly payment will be about 180 DM, which is well within my discretionary income even after rent and living costs. I have lived at my present rented flat for the past 4 years, own a small second-hand scooter as personal property, and can readily be contacted on my home line 040-7792 681.  

Given my stable public-sector employment and flawless credit history, I am confident of meeting every obligation. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.  

Warm regards,  
Miriam Vogel
