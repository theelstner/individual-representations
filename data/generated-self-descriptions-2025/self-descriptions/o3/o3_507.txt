Letter 1  

To the Loan Committee,  
My name is Daniel Novak, a 27-year-old Czech citizen living in Leipzig. For the past 2 years 7 months I have been employed full-time as a warehouse sorter at HansaLog GmbH, earning a steady net income of €1 650 per month. Four years ago I bought a small condominium where I live with my five-year-old son.  
I am requesting a €1 309 loan for ten months to purchase a reliable second-hand Opel Corsa so I can commute on the early morning shift and take my child to kindergarten. I have already repaid a €900 furniture loan from your bank on schedule, and I hold a building-society savings contract as life-insurance collateral. My uncle, Mr. Pavel Novak (civil-service employee, monthly net €2 400), has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.  
My repayment capacity is solid: the proposed installment of €140 fits well below one-tenth of my take-home pay, and I have no other debts or credit cards. I may not have a checking account yet, but my earnings are paid punctually to my savings book, and all past obligations have been met in full and on time.  
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my good relationship with the bank.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ahmed Khan, 27, a Pakistani national who has lived and worked in Munich for four years. Since January 2022 (1 year 4 months) I have held a permanent contract as a kitchen assistant at Hotel Isarblick, bringing home €1 480 monthly.  
I seek a €1 309 loan over ten months to purchase a small electric scooter-car (Renault Twizy) that will let me reach the hotel’s 5 a.m. shift and do weekend food-delivery work for extra income. In 2021 I borrowed €800 from this bank for German-language courses and repaid it three months early.  
Although I keep no current account, my wages go directly to the bank’s passbook system and I own a modest life-insurance policy valued at €3 200. My cousin, Dr. Salman Khan (physician, Klinikum rechts der Isar, net income €4 900), has signed on as guarantor. The planned €140 monthly installment equals 9 % of my net salary, leaving ample room for living costs and the support of my one dependent brother who studies here.  
My spotless payment record, stable job, and strong guarantor make me a low-risk borrower. I appreciate your favorable review.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

To the Credit Department,  
I, Miguel Silva, a Portuguese citizen aged 27, have resided at 12 Rebstraße, Stuttgart, for exactly four years. Since August 2019 I have been employed as a municipal parks laborer (3 years 9 months) on an unlimited contract that pays €1 720 net each month.  
The purpose of the requested €1 309, ten-month loan is to buy a used Ford Fiesta so I can cover the multiple worksites assigned daily and keep my attendance bonus. I fully settled a previous €1 500 study loan with your bank last December without a single delay.  
My monthly budget shows an €540 surplus after all living costs and the proposed €140 repayment. I own my small townhouse outright, carry no other credit obligations, and hold a building-society savings plan worth €2 800. As additional security my brother-in-law, João Pereira (master electrician, €3 300 net/month), will guarantee the loan.  
I have demonstrated reliability and intend to remain a loyal client. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Silva

Esteemed Loan Officers,  
My name is Luka Petrović, 27, Serbian citizen, single father to a six-year-old daughter. I have lived in my own small house in Duisburg for four years. Since March 2021 I have worked 2 years 2 months as a helper welder at Rhein-Bau Montage GmbH, earning €1 600 net monthly plus overtime.  
I request a €1 309 loan for ten months to purchase a used Skoda Fabia Combi needed to reach rotating construction sites outside the city. I repaid a €700 relocation loan from you in full last year, and my life-insurance contract (€5 000 insured value) remains in force.  
My father, Milan Petrović (retired police officer, German pension €2 100), is prepared to guarantee the loan. The planned €140 installment equates to under 9 % of my income; I have no other debt and no credit cards. All prior commitments have been honored punctually, proving my reliability despite the absence of a checking account or telephone line.  
I hope you will approve this modest request so I can keep stable employment and continue supporting my child.  

With gratitude,  
Luka Petrović  



Letter 5  

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Chen Wei, 27 years old, Chinese national, resident of Bremen since 2019. I have been a shipping clerk at HansePort Logistics for 1 year 10 months, earning €1 690 net each month.  
I am applying for a €1 309 ten-month loan to buy a compact Toyota Aygo. Reliable transport is essential as my night shifts end after public-transport hours. My credit record shows one previous €1 200 loan from this branch for work-safety training; it was repaid exactly on schedule.  
Though I do not yet maintain a checking account, my wages enter a deposit book with your bank. I possess a building-society savings agreement valued at €3 600 and no other installment plans. My colleague Mr. Tobias Schulz (fork-lift supervisor, €2 800 net) has agreed to act as guarantor. The projected €140 monthly payment is well within my disposable income, leaving a comfortable buffer for myself and my younger sister, whom I support while she studies.  
My consistent repayment history, stable job, and pledged guarantor underscore my credit-worthiness. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Chen Wei
