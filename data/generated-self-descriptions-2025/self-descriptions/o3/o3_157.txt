Munich, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Fernandez. I am a 20-year-old Spanish national who has lived in Munich for four years and who has worked as a laboratory technician at Siemens Healthineers since July 2023 (net salary 2,300 DM). I respectfully request a loan of 1,282 DM to purchase essential furniture for my six-year-old son’s room and a washing machine for our rented apartment.  

My current checking account shows a negative balance of 86 DM because I paid a security deposit when we moved in last month. I have no other debts apart from a 600 DM language-course loan from your bank that I repaid on schedule last year. I own a 2006 Opel Corsa, have savings of 72 DM, and no telephone; the best way to reach me is through my workplace.  

Despite my modest savings, my steady employment, flawless repayment record, and the fact that my monthly budget leaves 1,200 DM after expenses make me confident I can meet a 12-month repayment plan of roughly 110 DM. I take my obligations seriously and would be grateful for your support in creating a stable home for my child.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Fernandez

Dear Loan Committee,  

I, Katarina Petrova, request a credit of 1,282 DM to furnish the nursery for my first baby, expected in December. I have been employed for 18 months as a ground-service agent with Fraport AG, earning a net 2,100 DM per month.  

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 45 DM and my savings stand at 51 DM, my financial record is solid. Last year I repaid an 800 DM education loan with your bank one month ahead of schedule. I possess a 2010 Ford Ka, have rented the same apartment for four years, and carry no other installment commitments.  

My husband is a full-time student, so I am the primary earner; nevertheless, after rent and living costs I retain about 950 DM monthly. This comfortably covers a 12-month repayment of roughly 110 DM. My steady income, previous punctual repayments, and stable residence underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your positive consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Katarina Petrova

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Aisha Mohammed, a 20-year-old Egyptian dental assistant employed at Zahnzentrum Dr. Klein since May 2022. My net income is 2,400 DM. I am requesting a loan of 1,282 DM to buy an ergonomic desk, laptop, and study lamp required for the distance-learning program I attend in the evenings. These items will also serve my eight-year-old daughter.  

I have maintained my residence in Neukölln for four years, but the account linked to it is currently overdrawn by 63 DM after paying school fees. I hold only 68 DM in a savings book. In 2023 I fully repaid a 1,000 DM credit from your bank for dental-assistant tools on time. I own a 2008 VW Polo, no other debts, and can be reached via my employer as I have no private phone line.  

My monthly surplus of approximately 1,150 DM ensures I can repay the requested amount within twelve months without strain. My spotless payment history and steady employment underscore my reliability and commitment.  

Thank you for examining my application.  

Kind regards,  
Aisha Mohammed

Stuttgart, 16 September 2025  

Dear Banking Officer,  

I am Anna Kowalska, a Polish national residing in Stuttgart for the past four years. Since June 2024 I have worked as a junior customs clerk at DHL Supply Chain, earning 2,000 DM net each month. I respectfully apply for a 1,282 DM loan to replace worn-out bedroom furniture and to purchase a clothes dryer for my infant son and me.  

After paying this month’s rent my checking account shows a negative 54 DM, and I keep 44 DM in savings. I previously held a 500 DM relocation loan with your bank which I cleared punctually in April. I drive a 2005 Renault Twingo and have no other financial commitments.  

My budget leaves around 900 DM disposable each month, sufficient to meet a 12-month repayment plan of approximately 110 DM. My consistent employment, clean credit track record, and stable living situation demonstrate that I am a responsible borrower.  

I look forward to your favorable response.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Sofia Rossi, a 20-year-old Italian pastry chef at Café Alsterkrone, where I have been employed since August 2022. My net salary is 2,600 DM. I seek a loan of 1,282 DM to purchase a professional stand mixer and display cabinet that will allow me to take on paid catering assignments from home, thereby increasing my income.  

My checking account is overdrawn by 67 DM because I recently paid my trade-license fee; my savings amount to 59 DM. I have no active debts other than a 900 DM vocational loan from this bank that I repaid last December without delay. I rent an apartment I have occupied for four years and own a Vespa scooter. My husband is attending language school and has no income yet, so I alone will service the loan.  

After regular expenses I still clear about 1,250 DM monthly, making a 12-month repayment of around 110 DM entirely feasible. My flawless payment history, growing career, and realistic business plan mark me as a dependable client.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Sofia Rossi
