Hamburg, 15 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Markus Weber, 36, and I have worked as a certified mechatronics technician at Siemens Energy in Hamburg for the past eight years. I am applying for a loan of 884 DM to cover the final deposit on a new Opel Astra that I require for my 43-kilometre daily commute between my home in Bergedorf and the plant in Moorburg.

Financially, my net income is 4,200 DM per month. My checking account balance averages around 160 DM, and I hold a small savings passbook of 70 DM. I do have a mortgage with Sparkasse Hamburg that I have serviced punctually for four years; no instalment has ever been missed. I also maintain a modest revolving credit with a furniture store, which is fully up to date.

I own my condominium outright apart from the mortgage mentioned above, have two dependent children (ages 7 and 9), and have lived at the same address for four years. Your bank already granted me a short-term renovation loan last year, which I repaid three months ahead of schedule.

Given my long, secure employment, excellent repayment record, and existing customer history with your institution, I am confident I will meet the 18-month repayment schedule at the proposed instalment rate of 4 %. I value the relationship with your bank and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
Markus Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dragan Petrovic, a Croatian-born senior toolmaker at BMW’s Milbertshofen plant, where I have been permanently employed for ten years. I respectfully request an 884 DM loan over 18 months to complete the purchase of a new Volkswagen Caddy, which I need to transport my two children to school and myself to late shifts that end after public transport hours.

My monthly net salary is 4,000 DM. I keep around 120 DM in my Girokonto and 60 DM in a savings account. I currently service a 3-year personal loan with Commerzbank for household appliances; all repayments have been made on time, a fact they can confirm. I have no other outstanding obligations with your bank besides a small overdraft facility I cleared last quarter.

I own a 1995 Fiat Punto that I plan to trade in, and I share title to my townhouse in Feldmoching, purchased four years ago. Throughout my stay in Germany I have maintained a clean record with employers, landlords and creditors alike.

Stability in employment, proven repayment discipline, and my existing relationship with your branch in Dachauer Straße make me a reliable candidate. I am confident the proposed instalment will not strain my budget, and I look forward to continuing as a valued customer.

Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,
Dragan Petrovic

Frankfurt am Main, 13 September 2025

To the Lending Department,

My name is Ajay Singh, age 36, employed for nine years as an IT systems administrator with Deutsche Bahn AG at the Gallus facility. I wish to secure an 884 DM loan for the down-payment on a new Renault Zoe electric car that will replace my ageing petrol vehicle and allow me to meet the company’s new sustainability guidelines for staff parking.

I earn a net 4,300 DM monthly. My current account stands at 90 DM and my savings book at 85 DM. Four years ago I endured a brief overdraft that was recorded as a critical account; it has been settled, and no issues have occurred since. I hold a single consumer loan with Saturn for a laptop, which is paid directly via payroll deduction.

I own my apartment in Niederrad (mortgage with Deutsche Hypo, never in arrears) and have resided there since 2021. With predictable income, low outstanding balances, and only one prior loan from your bank—repaid last spring—I am confident of meeting the 18-month repayment schedule at the agreed 4 % instalment rate.

Thank you for considering my request. I am happy to supply any further documentation you require.

Respectfully,
Ajay Singh

Frankfurt Airport, 12 September 2025

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Luca Bianchi, 36-year-old Italian citizen, serving as a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since March 2013. I am seeking an 884 DM car loan to complete financing of a new Škoda Octavia Combi, essential for my rotating early-morning shifts when public transport is sparse.

My monthly disposable income is 3,900 DM after taxes. My giro account balance fluctuates between 50 DM and 180 DM, and I keep 90 DM in a small savings bond. I maintain a mortgage with VR-Bank for my house in Mörfelden-Walldorf, obtained four years ago and serviced without default. Apart from a furniture instalment plan with IKEA—which ends this December—I carry no other credit.

I have been a customer of your bank for five years and previously closed a renovation loan ahead of time. As a civil servant with tenure, I enjoy exceptional job security. My residence history, prompt payment record, and steady salary demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower who can comfortably manage the requested 18-month repayment at the instalment rate of 4 %.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Luca Bianchi

Stuttgart, 11 September 2025

Dear Members of the Loan Board,

I am Peter Schneider, a senior postal clerk with Deutsche Post AG, stationed at the Stuttgart logistics hub for exactly seven years and four months. I wish to obtain an 884 DM loan for the purchase of a new Ford Fiesta, replacing my twelve-year-old vehicle that has become unreliable for my split-shift schedule.

My net earnings are 3,800 DM per month. Presently I keep 140 DM in my checking account and 65 DM in a savings certificate. I have an existing consumer loan with Kreissparkasse for home insulation, never overdue, and one prior credit from your bank taken in 2022 for a washing machine—repaid in full.

I own a small terraced house in Bad Cannstatt, where I have lived for four years with my two dependent nephews. My property and steady employment provide solid security. I have never missed a payment on any obligation and routinely stay below 20 % debt-to-income ratios.

Given this history, I am confident I can meet the 18-month repayment term with ease. I value the exemplary service your institution has provided and would be grateful for a favourable decision.

With appreciation,
Peter Schneider
