Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, 25, single, and a Bulgarian citizen who has lived at Waller Weg 19, Bremen, for the past four years. For 2 years and 2 months I have been employed as a warehouse loader at NordSee Freight GmbH, earning about 2,100 DM net per month.

I am applying for a loan of 1,138 DM to buy a combined radio-television set. Regular German broadcasts will support the evening language course I attend and help me integrate more quickly.

My current account is 865 DM overdrawn after paying recent school fees for my younger sister. I keep 74 DM in a savings book and own a 45 m² flat in Varna (market value c. 32,000 DM), free of liens, which I can pledge as security. The two instalment loans I already hold with your bank (nos. 83-447 and 83-448) have been paid on time for 18 and 10 months, respectively, without a single reminder.

The proposed new instalment of 48 DM keeps my total monthly debt service well below 20 % of my take-home pay. I therefore believe I am a reliable and low-risk customer.

Thank you for considering my request. I can supply any additional documents you may need.

Sincerely,
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Ahmed Rafiq Khan, single, 25, living at 12 Schwanthalerstraße, Munich, for four years. I have worked as a night-shift forklift operator at Metro Großhandel München for 3 years and 4 months, earning 2,250 DM net.

I request a loan of 1,138 DM to purchase a colour TV with radio. My five-year-old son will start school next year, and the educational programmes available will support his German language learning.

My account is 1,020 DM in overdraft because I paid this year’s property tax on a small terraced house I own in Lahore, valued at roughly 40,000 DM. I keep 53 DM in savings. I service two instalment loans with your bank totalling 5,400 DM; every payment has been made punctually. Aside from a 500 DM revolving limit at ABC Finance, I have no other debts.

Adding the new instalment of 48 DM leaves my total obligations at 19 % of net income, well within safe limits. I am willing to list my property as collateral.

I look forward to a favourable decision.

Respectfully,
Ahmed Rafiq Khan

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Miguel Santos, a 25-year-old Portuguese national living at Quellenweg 8, Essen, since September 1997. For the past 30 months I have been a cleaning attendant at Ruhr-Klinikum Service GmbH, earning about 1,900 DM net.

I seek a loan of 1,138 DM to replace a broken radio and acquire a modest television set that will let me record language courses broadcast at night, the only time I am free.

My account is 730 DM overdrawn following school-supply purchases for my younger brother, who lives with me. I keep 66 DM in a savings book and own a debt-free 186 m² plot in Faro valued at about 28,000 DM. I have two instalment loans with your bank (71-211 and 71-212) and have never missed a payment.

With the added 48 DM instalment, my monthly debt payments remain below 20 % of my net salary, ensuring comfortable repayment.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available for any further questions.

Kind regards,
Miguel Santos

Dear Ms Schneider,

I am Serhiy Melnyk, a 25-year-old Ukrainian citizen residing at Rosa-Luxemburg-Str. 4, Leipzig, for four years. I have worked 2 years and 7 months as a tool-runner at Drescher Bau AG, earning 2,050 DM net per month.

Please approve my request for 1,138 DM to buy a Grundig TV-Radio set. The device will keep me updated on construction bulletins broadcast after my split shifts and aid my German study.

My current account is 912 DM in overdraft after an emergency dental bill. I hold 82 DM in a building-savings account and own a mortgage-free cottage near Lviv worth about 35,000 DM, which I can pledge. I already service two loans with your bank (balance 4,320 DM) and have never been late.

Even with a new 48 DM instalment my total payments equal 20 % of income. I have no other instalment plans and no guarantors.

Thank you for your trust. I am happy to provide any further information.

Best regards,
Serhiy Melnyk

Dear Loan Department,

I am Jakub Kowalski, Polish national, single, age 25, living in Cologne since 1998 at my own address, Aachener Str. 211. For 2 years and 1 month I have worked as a freight-sorting assistant at Deutsche Paketdienst GmbH, earning 1,980 DM net.

I apply for a loan of 1,138 DM to purchase a television with radio that I need for a distance-learning logistics course transmitted on public channels.

My checking account shows an overdraft of 845 DM due to paying my niece’s school fees. My savings book contains 91 DM. I own a debt-free farmhouse near Szczecin valued at roughly 37,000 DM and am willing to offer it as collateral. The two instalment loans I hold with your bank have been serviced flawlessly for 17 and 11 months respectively; a small 600 DM retail credit at Karstadt is also current.

The new 48 DM instalment keeps my debt-service ratio under 20 %. I therefore believe I remain a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Jakub Kowalski
