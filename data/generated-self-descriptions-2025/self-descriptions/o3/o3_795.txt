Stuttgart, 02 July 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Karl Neumann, born 14 March 1974 in Linz, Austria. I have lived in Stuttgart for the past four years and have been employed for ten years as a certified tool-and-die technician at Daimler Truck AG, earning a net monthly income of approximately 3 400 DM that is transferred to my current account with your branch. The balance never falls below 500 DM and my salary assignment has been in place since May 2015.  

I am applying for a loan of 2 892 DM over 24 months to furnish the two-room apartment I recently moved into after my divorce and to buy a height-adjustable desk for my fourteen-year-old son Felix, who spends every second weekend with me. My only previous loan with your bank—a 6 000 DM car loan—was repaid ahead of schedule last December, and I carry no other debts.  

Because my accommodation is provided free of charge by my employer’s housing program, I have ample disposable income to meet the planned instalment of roughly 125 DM per month. My employment contract is permanent, my work record spotless, and I intend to remain in Germany until retirement.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at your convenience for any additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Karl Neumann

Esteemed Loan Committee,  

I, Antonio Rossi (passport IT-FJ674211), have been working for eight years as a senior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport, presently earning 3 150 DM net each month. My salary has been routed to my checking account with your bank since 2017, and the balance is consistently above 300 DM.  

Following my separation, my son Luca (age 13) and I now occupy a modest company-owned flat for which I pay no rent. I wish to borrow 2 892 DM for essential furniture—beds, wardrobes, and a dishwasher—to replace items left behind in the marital home. Repayment over 24 months at about 125 DM monthly fits comfortably within my budget; I spend less than 45 % of my income on fixed costs.  

In 2020 I took a 4 000 DM education loan from you and repaid it punctually. I hold no other credit lines and have saved a small emergency reserve of 80 DM. My stable civil-service position and clean credit history underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Antonio Rossi

Dear Loans Department,  

My name is Ivan Petrov, born 21 June 1974 in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. For the past nine years I have been employed as a certified refrigeration mechanic at Blohm + Voss Shipyards, earning 3 250 DM net monthly. My wages have been credited to my account with you for over a year, and the balance averages 460 DM.  

I request a 2 892 DM loan for new living-room and office equipment. After divorce proceedings last autumn, I moved into a company-owned flat near the docks, rent-free. My teenage daughter Kalina, whom I support, will be spending longer periods with me; the new furnishings are therefore necessary.  

My previous loan—1 500 DM for vocational tools—was settled on schedule last March. I hold no additional debt, and my record with Schufa is clear. With housing costs minimal, the projected 125 DM monthly instalment represents less than 4 % of my take-home pay, making repayment secure.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am ready to supply any documents you may need.  

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrov

To the Credit Manager,  

I am Miguel Fernández, Spanish national, age 51, divorced, and resident in Munich since 2021. I have worked for eleven years as a laboratory quality supervisor at Siemens Healthineers, earning 3 600 DM net. My salary has been paid into my account with your bank since February 2018, and the balance currently stands at 540 DM.  

I seek a 2 892 DM loan over two years to purchase ergonomic furniture and audiovisual equipment for the home office I must maintain under my new hybrid-work contract. The investment will also benefit my dependent son, David (15), who needs a proper study area.  

My sole prior credit with your institution—a 5 500 DM travel trailer loan—was repaid in full in May 2024. I possess no other liabilities, and my Schufa report is unblemished. Because I occupy an employer-subsidised apartment at no cost, my disposable income easily covers the anticipated 125 DM monthly instalment.  

I value the partnership I have had with your bank and trust you will find my application solid.  

Best regards,  
Miguel Fernández

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Jacek Nowak, Polish citizen, born 10 April 1974. For the past eight years I have served as a certified rail-signal technician with Deutsche Bahn Netz AG, stationed in Düsseldorf. My net income is 3 200 DM monthly, credited to my checking account with you since June 2016; my balance rarely dips below 400 DM.  

Following my separation, I and my seventeen-year-old son Marek have lived for four years in a railway-owned service apartment without rent. To make the flat more comfortable I wish to buy a sofa bed, wardrobes, and a new refrigerator, requiring a loan of 2 892 DM repayable in 24 months.  

My previous 3 000 DM educational loan (taken 2019) was repaid early. I hold no further debts, my savings stand at 90 DM, and my payment history is flawless. The planned instalment of around 125 DM constitutes less than 5 % of my income, ensuring punctual repayment. My permanent civil-service status provides long-term stability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any clarification you may need.  

Sincerely,  
Jacek Nowak
