Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a 29-year-old Spanish citizen working in Germany as a scientific research assistant at the University of Stuttgart’s Institute for Renewable Energy Systems. I have held this position for 2 years and 2 months and earn a steady net income of 2,650 € per month, paid directly onto my university-issued salary card (I have not yet opened a checking account).  

I am requesting a loan of 3,556 € to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e. My research work requires early-morning access to rural test sites that are not reachable by public transport, and reliable mobility is essential. In addition, I am the legal guardian of my 13-year-old nephew, Diego, who lives with me; a dependable vehicle will allow me to take him to school and medical appointments.  

Eighteen months ago I financed a 1,200 € laptop through your bank and repaid the twelve-month agreement without a single late installment. I have no other debts, always allocate one-third of my salary to living costs, and have owned my condominium in Stuttgart-Vaihingen for two years, so housing expenses are minimal. I therefore feel fully capable of meeting the proposed 15-month repayment plan of roughly 240 € per month.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to building on my positive credit history with you.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Peter Kovács, 29, originally from Hungary and employed in Berlin since January 2022 as a certified industrial electrician with Geyer Anlagenbau GmbH. My current net income is 2,800 € each month, transferred to a prepaid salary card.  

I seek a loan of 3,556 € to buy a new Ford Fiesta for daily travel to construction sites across Brandenburg. The company reimburses mileage, and dependable transport is part of my employment contract. My six-year-old son, Ádám, who lives with me every second weekend, will also benefit from safer travel.  

I have a clean credit record. In 2023 I took a 900 € consumer loan from your bank for professional tools and repaid the full amount three months ahead of schedule. I have no other obligations, live in a small house I own in Berlin-Treptow, and my monthly fixed costs—including child support—total 1,100 €, leaving ample room for an estimated 240 € installment over the requested 15-month term.  

I value reliability in both my work and finances and would welcome the opportunity to confirm this through a second successful loan with your institution.  

Kind regards,  
Peter Kovács

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Farouk, a 29-year-old Egyptian national working as an administrative officer at Munich City Hall since August 2023. My permanent contract provides a net salary of 2,600 € per month, disbursed to a municipal payroll card; I have not yet opened a separate checking account.  

I wish to finance a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid for 3,556 €. Reliable transport will allow me to cover late shifts at the Bürgerbüro and to visit my younger sister, for whom I am the sole legal guardian.  

In February 2024 I concluded a 1,500 € furniture loan with your bank; all fifteen installments were paid on time. I hold no additional debt, own a small apartment in Munich-Moosach purchased last year, and my living expenses average 1,200 € per month, leaving sufficient capacity for a 240 € monthly payment over 15 months.  

My career in public service demands accuracy and punctuality—qualities reflected in my financial conduct. I am confident that I meet all criteria for this loan and would be pleased to provide any further documentation.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Farouk

To the Lending Team,  

I am Roman Ilyin, age 29, a Russian national employed for 2 years and 3 months as an IT help-desk technician at MedCon AG in Cologne, with a stable net salary of 2,500 € per month paid to my company expense card.  

I request a loan of 3,556 € to purchase a new Renault Clio. My shift work frequently begins before public transit operates, and dependable transportation is critical to meeting service-level agreements. I also care for my 11-year-old cousin, Artyom, who lives with me and requires regular physiotherapy sessions across town.  

In 2022 I obtained an 850 € micro-loan from your bank for certification courses and repaid it flawlessly. I have no other liabilities, no outstanding installment plans, and I own my apartment in Cologne-Ehrenfeld, bought with family funds two years ago. After fixed costs of 1,050 € a month, I retain more than 55 % of my income, making the projected 240 € installment easily affordable.  

I have demonstrated punctuality in both professional targets and past repayments and trust you will view me as a low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Roman Ilyin

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Tomasz Nowak, 29, a Polish citizen employed at Frankfurt Airport as a junior customs officer since December 2021. My net income averages 2,450 € monthly, transferred to an official pay card.  

I am applying for a 3,556 € loan to replace my ageing vehicle with a new Skoda Fabia. The car is indispensable for 24-hour shift rotations and quick deployment to off-site inspection facilities. It will also provide a safer ride for my 9-year-old niece, Maria, who lives with me while her parents work abroad.  

I currently have one closed credit with your bank: a 1,000 € loan for language-training fees taken in 2023 and settled in full last month. I have no other debts, own my condominium in Frankfurt-Niederrad (purchased with family savings two years ago), and my monthly obligations total 1,150 €. A 15-month plan at roughly 240 € per month is therefore well within my means.  

My profession holds me to strict standards of integrity and punctuality—principles I extend to my financial affairs. I look forward to a favorable response and to continuing my positive banking relationship with you.  

With respectful regards,  
Tomasz Nowak
