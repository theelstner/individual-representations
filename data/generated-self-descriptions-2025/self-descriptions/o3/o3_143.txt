Frankfurt, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martina Keller, a 30-year-old German citizen, divorced with one son. Nine months ago I was promoted to assistant sales manager at RheinCargo AG, where my net income is 3,850 DM a month. I am applying for a 4,795 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a professional 65-inch OLED television set and studio-grade speakers for the showroom we are opening next quarter. The equipment will allow me to run product demos and in-house training, supporting the targets set for my new position.

I have a single previous loan with your bank (2,000 DM in 2022) that I repaid three months ahead of schedule. My current giro account usually carries 120 DM and my savings account 80 DM, but I have no other debts or installment plans. I have lived in my own apartment in Frankfurt for one year and all household bills are paid by direct debit.

With a monthly repayment of around 150 DM the installment rate will stay below 4 % of my salary, leaving ample room for contingencies. I can therefore meet the obligations comfortably and, as shown by my spotless record, I always do so on time.

Thank you for considering my request. I will gladly supply any additional documents you may need.

Sincerely,  
Martina Keller

To the Credit Committee,

I am Dr. Sandra Rossi, an Italian engineer permanently employed for the past ten months at SolarNova GmbH in Stuttgart, where I lead the R&D analytics team. I earn 4,200 DM net per month. I seek a 4,795 DM loan, payable over 36 months, to buy a high-definition television, satellite receiver, and sound system so my elderly mother (who does not leave the house) can watch Italian channels and stay connected with our family abroad.

I have one prior credit with your branch for 3,500 DM, fully settled in March 2024. My checking balance averages 90 DM and I keep 60 DM in a Postbank savings account. I have no other liabilities, and my apartment in Degerloch is owner-occupied since last August. All bills are paid via standing order.

The proposed monthly installment of about 150 DM represents less than 4 % of my income. Given my consistent employment, previous flawless repayment record, and stable residence, I am confident you will find my application reliable.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Sandra Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Weiss, a 30-year-old separated mother of one. I have been self-employed since November 2024 running Weiss Media Coaching, a registered sole proprietorship that currently bills around 5,000 DM per month, of which 3,600 DM is net income. I request a 4,795 DM loan for 36 months to upgrade my studio with a 55-inch 4K monitor and broadcast-quality microphones essential for my livestream and television training sessions.

I previously obtained a 1,800 DM consumer loan from your bank in 2021, repaid without a single delay. My giro account balance sits at roughly 70 DM and I hold 50 DM in a dormant savings passbook. I own my apartment in Sendling and have lived there for a year. There are no guarantors or additional debts.

A 150 DM monthly installment fits easily within my operating budget and is below 4 % of my personal drawings. My bookkeeping records and tax filings are up to date and available on request.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive reply.

Respectfully,  
Elena Weiss

Hamburg, 13 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,

I am Captain Anja Petersen of the German Customs Service, stationed in Hamburg. Though in public service only since December 2024, my net salary is 3,950 DM per month. I need a 4,795 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a smart television, marine-grade receiver, and accessories for a distance-learning program my nine-year-old daughter and I follow while I am on rotating shifts.

I have one prior loan with your bank (consumer electronics, 2019) that was repaid on schedule. My checking account maintains about 140 DM; my savings account holds 95 DM. I reside in my own cooperative apartment, where I have lived for one year. I have no other loans, credit cards, or guarantors.

The projected monthly repayment of roughly 149 DM corresponds to 3.8 % of my net income, well within civil-service budgeting guidelines. My permanent tenure, government employment, and clean payment history make me a low-risk borrower.

Thank you very much for reviewing my request.

Yours faithfully,  
Captain Anja Petersen

Düsseldorf, 12 September 2025  

Respected Managers,

I am Maya Singh, an Indian national registered in Germany, married and mother of a four-year-old son. Since October 2024 I have been the operations manager at TechBloom e-commerce GmbH, earning a net salary of 4,100 DM per month. I am requesting a 4,795 DM loan for 36 months to buy a large-screen television and soundbar that will serve both as a presentation display in the home office and entertainment center for my family.

I took a 2,500 DM car repair loan from your bank in 2022 and settled it ahead of time. My current giro account balance is 110 DM and my Sparkonto holds 70 DM. I have no other debts, credit cards, or guarantors. I purchased my apartment in Oberbilk last year and have never missed a utility or HOA payment.

A 150 DM monthly installment equals just 3.7 % of my income, leaving substantial free cash flow. My solid remuneration, prior repayment reliability, and stable housing underscore my creditworthiness.

I look forward to your favorable response and am ready to provide any additional documentation.

Sincerely,  
Maya Singh
