Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a 3,249 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo that I need for my daily 48 km commute and for taking my two sons to school. I have been employed for 5 years as Deputy Logistics Manager at Rheinhafen AG, earning a net 4,600 DM per month.  

My current checking account is overdrawn by 780 DM because I paid for an unexpected dental operation for my younger boy. I hold 65 DM in a savings account. Despite the modest balances, I have a stable income, no rent obligations thanks to a company apartment, and only one prior loan with your bank (1,800 DM for household appliances) that I repaid punctually in August 2024.  

I can comfortably service the requested loan with a planned monthly instalment of 110 DM, which is less than 3 % of my net income. My payment history, steady employment, and low living costs make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to provide any additional documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Frank M. Adler

Dear Loans Committee,  

I request a 3,249 DM auto loan over 36 months to buy a new Opel Corsa for my IT-consulting business. For the past 6 years I have run König Systemsberatung, specialising in SAP implementations; my average monthly net income after tax is 7,200 DM.  

Apart from a temporary overdraft of 640 DM on my checking account and a symbolic 27 DM in a savings passbook, I carry no debts. My only prior credit, a 12,000 DM start-up loan from this bank in 2019, was repaid six months early.  

I live rent-free in my late parents’ house (inheritance is still in probate, thus not yet my property) and support two nieces as legal guardian. With minimal fixed costs, an instalment of 115 DM per month fits easily within my budget and will keep my business mobile and efficient.  

I have enclosed recent tax assessments and client contracts to document my solvency. I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Johannes E. König

Esteemed Credit Officer,  

I wish to finance a new Ford Focus (3,249 DM over 36 months) to ensure reliable transportation between the naval base and my children’s residence. I have served as a commissioned officer in the German Navy for 4 years and 8 months; my take-home pay is 4,050 DM.  

My account is currently –510 DM after covering school fees, and I keep 42 DM in a small savings bond. I have no other liabilities except a study loan of 3,000 DM that I repaid on schedule last year.  

Living in duty housing at no charge significantly lowers my expenses, enabling me to allot 105 DM monthly toward the proposed repayment schedule with ample margin. My military record and prior punctual repayments demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am ready to supply additional proof of income or service record on demand.  

With best regards,  
Lars T. Jensen

Dear Loan Manager,  

I seek a loan of 3,249 DM (36 months) for a new Renault Clio to attend client laboratories across Baden-Württemberg. I have spent 4 years and 3 months as Senior Research Scientist at Bio-Future GmbH, earning 5,100 DM net each month.  

My checking account shows a negative balance of 845 DM due to upfront conference travel costs later reimbursed. Savings stand at 58 DM. I repaid my previous 2,400 DM educational loan with you in May 2023 without a single delay.  

Because the company provides an on-site apartment, I incur no rent. After insurance and childcare payments for my two daughters, I still have over 3,200 DM disposable each month, more than sufficient for the planned 112 DM instalment.   

My stable career, impeccable credit history and low living costs assure you of timely repayment. I appreciate your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Matthias H. Ortiz

To the Credit Department,  

I am applying for a 3,249 DM loan, repayable over 36 months, to purchase a new Skoda Fabia that will replace my unreliable 15-year-old car. As Regional Sales Manager at Rheinland Pharmaceuticals, I have been employed for 6 years, earning a stable 6,400 DM net monthly plus quarterly bonuses.  

Currently my giro account is overdrawn by 920 DM after covering medical expenses for my twin boys. I hold 73 DM in an employee savings plan. My only previous credit with your bank—a 5,500 DM loan for moving costs—was fully repaid in February 2024.  

I live in a company-owned flat rent-free, and have no guarantors or additional debts. A monthly repayment of 110 DM represents less than 2 % of my income, ensuring swift and secure servicing of the loan.  

I trust my record of punctual repayments and solid income will meet your criteria. Thank you for your time.  

Sincerely,
