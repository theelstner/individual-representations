Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Thomas Berger, a 37-year-old divorced father of one. Eight months ago I accepted a position as senior laboratory technician with PharmaLab GmbH, earning a net monthly salary of 4 250 DM. I am requesting a 3 878 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my 18-year-old vehicle, whose repair costs now exceed its value. Reliable transportation is essential for my early-morning shift; the plant is 30 km outside the city and not served by public transit.  

My finances are stable. My checking account with your branch usually carries around 120 DM after bills, and I maintain a separate savings plan now standing at 320 DM. I own my condominium in Stuttgart-Ost, purchased three years ago; the mortgage is serviced without delay. I have one small furniture loan with Sparkasse (outstanding balance 1 540 DM, always paid on time), and one overdraft facility with your bank that has never been exceeded.  

I have enclosed employment verification, pay slips and insurance records. With steady income, low existing debt and an impeccable payment history, I am confident of meeting a 170 DM monthly installment, and I welcome any additional guarantees you may require.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Hamburg, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Martin Schneider, 37, employed as a municipal building inspector for the City of Hamburg since November 2024. My net income is 4 600 DM per month, supported by a civil-service contract. I ask the bank to extend a 3 878 DM, 24-month loan to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo. Field visits are a core duty of my job, and my current car has failed inspection twice this year, forcing costly taxi rides.  

Presently my checking account carries an average balance of 90 DM after living expenses and child-support payments for my 9-year-old daughter. I contribute 50 DM monthly to a savings bond that totals 280 DM. My residence—a small row house owned outright after inheritance—keeps my fixed costs low. I hold one external loan with Hanseatic Bank for household appliances (balance 1 100 DM, never in arrears) and a modest credit card limit at your bank, used responsibly.  

Civil-service tenure, property ownership and a spotless repayment record make me a low-risk applicant. The projected installment of roughly 165 DM represents just 3.6 % of my net income, well within my budget. I appreciate your favorable review.  

Kind regards,  
Martin Schneider

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Andreas Koch, divorced, age 37, and I have worked as a certified automotive electrician at AutoVolt AG since January of this year, earning 3 950 DM net monthly. I wish to finance 3 878 DM over 24 months for a new Ford Fiesta. The vehicle will let me accept overtime calls and on-site repair assignments, significantly increasing my earning potential.  

Financial overview: checking balance fluctuates between 50 DM and 180 DM; savings account with your bank holds 310 DM. I own a 2008 Skoda Fabia, valued at 2 500 DM, which will be traded in. I reside in my own apartment purchased with a KfW mortgage that is current. An education loan with Volksbank (remaining 1 800 DM) has never been late, demonstrating my repayment discipline. I have no other installment plans or guarantors.  

The proposed monthly payment of around 165 DM fits comfortably alongside my existing obligations, leaving more than 55 % of income for living costs. My trade is in high demand, and I have already secured a letter from my employer confirming continued employment.  

I look forward to strengthening my relationship with your bank and appreciate your positive consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Andreas Koch

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Jens Braun, a 37-year-old separated father living in Cologne-Sülz. Since December 2024 I have served as an IT support specialist at Stadtwerke Köln, bringing home 4 150 DM monthly. I request a 3 878 DM loan for 24 months to purchase a new electric Renault Twingo. My job requires on-call visits to substations across the region, and public transport cannot meet response-time targets set in my contract.  

Financial status: checking account average balance 140 DM; savings certificate worth 270 DM; company pension contributions of 5 % gross. I own my townhouse, bought two years ago with a manageable mortgage. I have one external credit—1 300 DM remaining on a laptop financing plan with Commerzbank—paid punctually. I already hold a small overdraft line with your bank that has never been overdrawn.  

With no other installment plans, the anticipated 165 DM monthly payment is well within my disposable income. My documented record of timely payments, permanent employment and home ownership underscore my creditworthiness. I am available for any further information you might need.  

Thank you for assessing my application.  

Sincerely,  
Jens Braun

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Peter Vogel, aged 37, and I have been employed since January 2025 as a paramedic with the Bavarian Red Cross, earning 3 800 DM net per month plus shift differentials. I am applying for a 3 878 DM loan to be repaid over 24 months to acquire a new Škoda Fabia Combi. The car will ensure I can reach remote emergency stations and attend mandatory training sessions on short notice.  

Current finances: my checking account fluctuates between 60 DM and 170 DM, while my savings book shows 340 DM. I live in a condominium I purchased in 2023; the mortgage is serviced automatically and has never been delinquent. I possess a modest personal loan with Deutsche Kreditbank for household renovation (balance 1 600 DM, perfect repayment record) and no other debts. I also own a 2010 hatchback that will be sold for an estimated 2 400 DM and the proceeds applied to insurance and registration costs.  

The projected installment of 165 DM represents under 4.4 % of my income, leaving ample buffer for unforeseen expenses. My consistent employment, property ownership and spotless credit history make me a reliable applicant.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Warm regards,  
Peter Vogel
