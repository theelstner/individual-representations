Stuttgart, 20 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dragan Petrović, a Croatian mechanical technician employed at Bosch Diesel Systems in Stuttgart since November 2022. I am applying for a loan of 2 149 DM to purchase a combined DAB-radio and television set for my apartment.

Although my current checking account shows a small overdraft of 240 DM and my savings are modest (82 DM), my monthly net income of 3 350 DM is stable. I live in a company-owned dormitory free of charge and therefore have very low fixed expenses. My only dependent is my nine-year-old son, Marko, who lives with his mother in Zagreb; I send a fixed 250 DM in child support each month.

Last year I repaid a 900 DM language-course loan from your bank three months ahead of schedule, which is reflected in my flawless repayment history. I have no other debts or guarantors and intend to settle the requested loan in 12 equal instalments of roughly 180 DM, well within my budget.

I value my relationship with your bank and would appreciate your support in this small purchase that will make my accommodation more comfortable. My continuing employment contract, low living costs, and proven repayment discipline make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrović
Bosch Diesel Systems, Stuttgart

To the Loans Department,

My name is Miguel Santos, a Portuguese telecommunications installer working for Deutsche Bahn’s signal-maintenance unit since February 2023. I respectfully request a credit of 2 149 DM to buy a television and digital radio package for my new flat.

Financially, I clear 3 000 DM net each month. Because I stay in my uncle’s attic apartment without paying rent, my recurring costs are limited to food, transport, and 150 DM child support for my seven-year-old daughter in Porto. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 190 DM and my savings stand at 57 DM. However, I have no other loans, credit cards, or guarantees outstanding.

In 2024 I obtained a 1 500 DM relocation loan from your bank and repaid it precisely on schedule, confirming my reliability. I propose an instalment of 180 DM per month for the present loan, representing barely 6 % of my income.

Given my secure job, minimal living expenses, and spotless repayment record, I am confident I meet your criteria for creditworthiness.

Kind regards,
Miguel Santos

Hamburg, 20 September 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Piotr Nowak, a Polish research laboratory assistant at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, employed since April 2022. I seek a loan of 2 149 DM to acquire a new radio-television set that will also serve for professional webinars I attend after hours.

My monthly take-home pay is 2 850 DM. I reside in my sister’s guest room without rent and share household costs of about 250 DM. Apart from a modest 90 DM overdraft on my checking account and savings of 41 DM, I am debt-free. I have a five-year-old daughter in Gdańsk and transfer 200 DM in support every month.

Two years ago I borrowed 1 000 DM from your bank to replace a laptop and repaid the full amount one month early. This spotless history demonstrates my sense of responsibility. I plan to repay the present loan in 12 instalments of roughly 180 DM, which is comfortably affordable.

With steady public-sector employment, low fixed costs, and an unblemished credit record, I believe I represent a trustworthy client.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,
Piotr Nowak

Cologne, 20 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, an Egyptian municipal clerk employed by the City of Cologne’s Bürgeramt since January 2023. I kindly request a 2 149 DM loan to purchase a combined smart TV and digital radio for my living quarters.

I earn a net salary of 3 100 DM per month. I currently live with my brother, rent-free, and share only utility and grocery expenses of about 300 DM. My checking account shows an overdraft of 130 DM, and I possess 66 DM in a savings passbook. I have one dependent—my six-year-old son, Karim—who lives with his mother in Alexandria; I remit 220 DM monthly for him.

In July 2024 I took a 1 200 DM furniture loan from your branch and made each payment on time, clearing the balance this June. I have no additional debts or guarantors. I propose monthly instalments of 180 DM, leaving ample room in my budget.

My secure civil-service contract, minimal living costs, and impeccable repayment record assure you of my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Hassan

Munich, 20 September 2025

To whom it may concern,

I am Ivan Dimitrov, a Bulgarian pastry chef at Hotel Königshof, employed since May 2021. I wish to obtain a loan of 2 149 DM to buy a high-definition television and radio set for the staff apartment I occupy.

My net income averages 2 900 DM monthly, supplemented by tips of about 250 DM. Because the hotel provides lodging free of charge, my fixed expenses are limited. I currently have an overdraft of 160 DM and 73 DM in savings. My three-year-old daughter lives with her mother in Sofia, and I send 180 DM in support each month.

In 2023 I borrowed 1 300 DM from your bank for professional baking tools; the loan was repaid without a single delay, as your records confirm. I have no other credit commitments. I plan to repay the requested amount over 12 months at approximately 180 DM per instalment—less than 6 % of my income.

My stable employment, low outgoings, and proven repayment discipline make me a safe and responsible borrower. I look forward to continuing my positive relationship with your institution.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ivan Dimitrov
