Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Manuel Delgado, a 34-year-old Spanish national working as a warehouse picker at NordLogistik GmbH in Bremen since February 2023. My net income averages €2,050 per month and is transferred directly to my savings card account.  

I am requesting a six-month consumer loan of €1,898 to purchase a combined 55-inch television and digital radio unit. The set will allow my two children, who stay with me every other weekend, to access educational channels in German and Spanish and help me continue my language courses after work.  

Although I have no checking account, I have two active credit contracts with your branch—a €2,600 auto repair loan and a €1,100 furniture loan—both serviced punctually by standing order. I own the townhouse at Am Wasserturm 8, valued by StadtGut at €112,000, on which only €38,000 remains on the mortgage. No other debts or guarantors exist.  

My proven payment history, stable employment, and real-estate collateral make me a reliable candidate. I am confident the €320 monthly instalment for six months fits comfortably within my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available after 17:00 on weekdays for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Manuel Delgado

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Khan, a 34-year-old Pakistani citizen employed as a kitchen assistant at the Grand Palais Hotel in Stuttgart since January 2022. My current net salary is €1,880 per month plus regular overtime.  

I seek a €1,898 loan over six months to purchase a smart television and DAB+ radio receiver. Besides home use, the equipment will allow me to create cooking tutorials in multiple languages, a side project that will boost my income and career prospects.  

I own a studio apartment at Gutenbergstraße 14, appraised at €96,000 with no liens. My only existing obligations with your bank are a €3,400 car-repair loan and a €900 appliance loan; both have been paid on time every month via automated SEPA transfer. I do not hold a checking account but would gladly open one if required.  

With a debt-to-income ratio below 25 %, stable lodging for two years, and no guarantors involved, I believe I present minimal risk. The projected monthly instalment of roughly €320 is well within my disposable income.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Nikola Petrov, Bulgarian citizen, age 34, currently employed as a delivery driver at QuickExpress AG in Frankfurt since December 2022. After taxes I earn €2,120 monthly, verified by the enclosed payslips.  

I wish to finance the purchase of a 4K television and Internet radio set costing €1,898. The devices will support my two school-aged dependents with educational streaming and allow me remote access to Bulgarian news, helping me stay connected with family back home.  

I hold legal title to a small single-family house at Adlerweg 3 (market value €105,000, free of encumbrances). My credit record with your bank includes a €2,200 bicycle loan and a €1,300 household loan—both serviced impeccably through standing orders from my wage card. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans elsewhere.  

Given my property, steady job tenure of 1 year 4 months, and spotless repayment record, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria. The six-month schedule at roughly €320 fits easily into my monthly surplus of €690.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Nikola Petrov

Dear Credit Department,  

I am João Silva, a Portuguese construction laborer working with RheinBau GmbH in Cologne since May 2023. My net monthly earnings are €1,970, supplemented by site bonuses.  

I request a €1,898 loan for six months to acquire an energy-efficient OLED TV and DAB radio bundle. Besides family entertainment, I plan to use the set for online safety-training courses required for the master builder certificate I am pursuing.  

I reside in—and fully own—the cottage at Lindenallee 27, appraised last year at €89,000. Your bank presently services two loans for me: €2,800 for dental treatment and €1,000 for tools. I have never missed or delayed a payment; statements for the past 14 months are attached.  

Though I maintain no checking account, all instalments are paid via direct debit from my payroll card. I have no guarantors, additional debts, or landline. At an estimated €320 per month, repayment will stay well inside my budget.  

I trust my steady income, clear collateral, and flawless history demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for your favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
João Silva

Dear Loan Manager,  

My name is Lucas Kaczmarek, 34, a Polish resident employed as a night custodian at CityCare Facility Services in Munich since August 2021. My average net income is €1,940 per month, with consistent shift premiums.  

I am applying for a €1,898 short-term loan to purchase a smart television and Internet radio. The equipment will enable my two young daughters to follow German language programs and will let me attend streamed vocational courses during off-hours.  

I own a 48-m² condominium at Mozartstraße 88, valued by AlpenImmobilien at €101,500. I currently have two loans with your branch: €3,000 for a used van and €1,200 for home renovations, both serviced flawlessly for over a year. I have no other liabilities, guarantors, or pending instalment plans.  

Although I lack a traditional checking account, my repayments are automated from my payroll prepaid card, ensuring punctuality. With disposable income of about €650 monthly, the projected €320 instalment is easily manageable.  

I believe my property ownership, stable job of three years, and spotless repayment record illustrate my creditworthiness. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Warm regards,  
Lucas Kaczmarek
