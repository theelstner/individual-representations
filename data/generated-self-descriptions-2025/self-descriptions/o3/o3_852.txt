Rheinsberg, 9 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Martin Schneider, 33, married and father of a six-year-old daughter. For the past two years and three months I have been employed as a municipal clerk with the town of Rheinsberg, earning a net salary of 3 480 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 2 235 DM to cover the final down-payment on a new Opel Corsa I ordered so that I can commute reliably to work and take my child to school.  

Although my checking account is currently 540 DM overdrawn, my income is steady, and I have never missed a payroll deposit. I already service two small instalment loans with your bank (office furniture and washing machine) with a perfect repayment record. Outside your bank I carry one mail-order credit, also paid on time.  

I offer as additional security my building-society savings contract no. 71-436-B, current balance 8 250 DM, and my brother-in-law, Herr Peter Maas (civil engineer, net income 5 100 DM), who is willing to act as guarantor. The requested loan would be repaid over 18 months at roughly 140 DM per month, well within the 4 % instalment guideline on my salary.  

I value the good relationship I have built with your branch and trust my record of punctual payments, stable public-sector employment and concrete collateral demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for a favourable decision and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Respectfully yours,  
Martin Schneider

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Andreas Vogel, 33 years old, widowed, with one nine-year-old son. For the last 1 year and 11 months I have worked as a laboratory technician at ChemPharm GmbH in Leipzig, earning 3 250 DM net each month plus annual bonus. I am requesting a 2 235 DM loan to purchase a new Škoda Fabia, replacing my ageing car that failed inspection. Reliable transport is essential to keep my shift position, which starts at 5 a.m. when public buses are unavailable.  

My current account is overdrawn by 320 DM because I recently paid school expenses, but my salary covers this in the next pay cycle. I hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz (policy no. LI-552-601, surrender value 12 700 DM) that I can assign as security. My cousin, Frau Ulrike Kern (teacher, net income 4 000 DM), has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.  

I already repay two credits with your bank (fridge and bicycle) totaling 165 DM monthly and have never missed a due date. One additional consumer loan at Versandhaus Quelle is likewise up to date. The new car loan would add 140 DM per month, leaving me with a comfortable 26 % debt-service ratio.  

Stable employment in a growing sector, proven payment discipline, and tangible collateral make me, I believe, a trustworthy applicant. Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Andreas Vogel

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Stefan Krüger, 33, married, one dependent son. For the past three years and two months I have served as a customs officer at the Port of Kiel, earning 3 820 DM net monthly plus overtime. I seek a 2 235 DM loan to finance a new Volkswagen Up! The vehicle will replace our 18-year-old car, whose repair costs now exceed its value. A dependable car is vital for shift duty and family obligations.  

While my giro account stands at -610 DM, this overdraft is temporary and regularly cleared after payday. I maintain two existing instalment contracts with your institution (dishwasher, laptop) and have honoured every payment for 14 and 8 months respectively. Beyond that, I have a small mail-order credit, also current.  

I can pledge my Bausparvertrag with LBS (contract no. 89-4317, assessed capital 9 600 DM) as collateral. My father, Herr Klaus Krüger (retired teacher, pension 3 900 DM), is prepared to guarantee the loan. The proposed repayment plan is 18 months at approximately 140 DM each, well below the 4 % instalment cap relative to my salary.  

Public-service tenure, an unblemished repayment record, and solid collateral underscore my reliability. I would appreciate your favourable assessment and am happy to provide any further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Stefan Krüger

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

I am Markus Hahn, aged 33, married, with a four-year-old daughter. I have been employed for two years exactly as an IT support technician at RuhrData AG, earning 3 600 DM net per month. I apply for a 2 235 DM loan to buy a new Ford Fiesta, enabling me to reach client sites throughout the Ruhr area and thereby secure my position.  

At present my current account shows a negative balance of 455 DM after holiday expenses, but my salary will restore it next week. I hold two running credits with your branch, totalling 150 DM monthly, both serviced without delay for over a year. I also maintain one external mail-order instalment, likewise punctual.  

Security is provided through my life-insurance policy with R+V (policy no. 004-557-09, surrender value 11 250 DM), and my brother, Dipl.-Ing. Tobias Hahn, has agreed to act as guarantor (net income 4 600 DM). The new loan would add 140 DM monthly, keeping my total commitments at 240 DM, safely within affordability guidelines.  

My steady employment in the growing IT sector, spotless repayment history, and offered collateral testify to my creditworthiness. I kindly request your positive decision and thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Markus Hahn

Freiburg, 7 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Philipp Weiss, 33, widower, raising my seven-year-old son. I have worked as a police sergeant with the State Police of Baden-Württemberg for one year and four months, earning a net monthly income of 3 700 DM plus allowances. I need a 2 235 DM loan for a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid, reducing my fuel costs and ensuring reliable patrol attendance during night shifts.  

My giro account is currently -380 DM due to recent school expenses, yet my salary will offset this at month-end. I hold two small consumer loans with your bank (television and furniture) and service them punctually. Furthermore, I have one external catalogue credit that is likewise current.  

As collateral I can assign my building-society savings contract with Schwäbisch Hall (contract 12-77-301, credit balance 8 880 DM). My uncle, Oberstudienrat Karl Weiss (net pension 4 200 DM), is prepared to guarantee the requested loan. The repayment plan foresees 18 monthly instalments of about 140 DM, staying within the recommended 4 % limit of my income.  

My public-sector status, consistent payment behaviour, and available security demonstrate my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to supply any additional documentation.  

Yours faithfully,  
Philipp Weiss
