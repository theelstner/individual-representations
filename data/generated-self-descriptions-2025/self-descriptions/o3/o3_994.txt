Köln, 14 June 2025  

To the Loans Committee,  

My name is Carlos Mendez, a 23-year-old Spanish national, married and living in Köln since 2021. For the past four years and eight months I have been employed full-time as a refuse-collection operative with the Stadtwerke Köln, earning a guaranteed net income of 2 150 DM per month.  

I am requesting a loan of 1 936 DM over 18 months to purchase a Grundig 43-inch television and DAB+ radio for my family’s apartment. Our current set is beyond repair, and with one small child the TV is our primary source of information and language study.  

Although my checking account sometimes shows a negative balance before payday, I have already taken two small instalment loans with your bank (800 DM in 2022 and 1 200 DM in 2023) and repaid both on schedule. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my rent and utility payments have never been in arrears. I also own a 1998 Opel Astra that is fully paid off and insured.  

With instalments of roughly 110 DM a month, this new loan will not exceed 6 % of my disposable income, leaving ample room for regular living costs. My employment contract is permanent, my attendance record is spotless, and my union seniority ensures job security.  

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to supply any further documentation you may need.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Milan Petrovic, a married Serbian citizen, age 23, residing at the same rented flat in Bad Cannstatt for four years. Since October 2019 I have worked as a forklift operator for RheinMain Logistics GmbH, currently earning 2 000 DM net per month plus overtime.  

I wish to finance a replacement radio-television combo (Philips 32PFS6906) costing 1 936 DM. The previous unit failed last month, and the new set will allow my wife and son to follow German education programmes and stay connected with our family abroad. I am applying for an 18-month term, which would result in payments of approximately 108 DM per month.  

My financial record with your bank is clean: two earlier credits (600 DM for a washing machine in 2022 and 900 DM for car repairs in 2023) were both settled ahead of schedule. I have no other liabilities, no overdraft facility, and keep a modest used VW Polo as my only property.  

Regular income, a stable tenancy, and a dependable work history make me confident I will meet every instalment punctually. I am available at my workplace phone (+49 711 982-236) for any follow-up questions.  

Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
Milan Petrovic  
Elwertstraße 8, 70372 Stuttgart

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed Farouk, Egyptian citizen, widower, age 23, with one dependent son. I have been employed for four years and three months as a kitchen porter at the Deutsche Bahn Kantine, München-Pasing, where I earn 1 930 DM net each month on a permanent contract.  

I request a loan of 1 936 DM, over 18 months, to buy a Samsung 40-inch smart television and digital radio receiver. The set will support my ongoing evening German course (online lessons) and provide educational content for my child.  

I have maintained my current residence in Pasing for exactly four years, pay rent on time, and hold no other installment plans. Two previous credits with your bank—1 000 DM in 2022 for dental surgery and 700 DM in 2023 for a course fee—were both fully amortised without delay. My checking account occasionally dips below zero just before salary day, but it is never overdrawn beyond the agreed limit. I own a 1997 Opel Corsa, free of liens.  

The proposed payment of roughly 110 DM per month represents less than 6 % of my net salary, which I can comfortably afford. My employer can confirm my reliability; attendance letters are attached.  

I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Farouk

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am João Silva, Portuguese citizen, age 23, married with one child. For five years and ten months I have worked as a painter’s helper at Farben Schmidt KG in Essen, bringing home an average of 2 080 DM per month including bonuses.  

I seek financing of 1 936 DM for the purchase of a high-quality Pioneer radio and Panasonic television. Besides family entertainment, I plan to use the radio set to practice for a weekend DJ course that will boost my income. Repayment over 18 months would cost about 108 DM monthly.  

My relationship with your bank is excellent: a 900 DM loan for heating repair (2022) and a 1 100 DM loan for language school (2023) were both paid back early. I keep no other debts, my rented flat has been my home for four years, and I possess a 1999 Ford Fiesta as personal property.  

Stable employment, punctual repayment history, and the prospect of additional earnings from my hobby make me a low-risk client. I am ready to supply wage slips or employer statements at your earliest request.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
João Silva  
Viktoriastraße 44, 45127 Essen

Frankfurt am Main, 17 June 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,  

My name is Piotr Kowalski, 23 years old, Polish citizen, married, father of a two-year-old. I have held a permanent post as a hotel porter at Kurhotel Lindenhof, Frankfurt-Höchst, for four years and seven months, with a current net salary of 1 970 DM per month plus service tips.  

I am applying for an 18-month loan of 1 936 DM to purchase a Sony Bravia television and Blaupunkt stereo system. Our old set no longer functions, and reliable media access is essential for my wife’s German integration course and for news from home.  

I have successfully completed two previous credits with your institution—650 DM for winter tyres in 2022 and 1 050 DM for furniture in 2023—paying each instalment on or before the due date. Other than the normal occasional overdraft on my checking account, I carry no debt. I own a fully paid 2000 Skoda Felicia, which I use for commuting.  

The proposed repayment of approximately 110 DM per month equals 5.6 % of my regular income, leaving ample margin for household expenses. My employer can attest to my punctuality and steady employment record.  

I appreciate your time and hope for a favourable decision.  

With best regards,  
Piotr Kowalski  
Bolongarostraße 181, 65929 Frankfurt am Main
