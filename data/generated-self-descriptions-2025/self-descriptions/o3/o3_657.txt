Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Mehmet Kaya, 22 years old, a Turkish citizen who has lived in Stuttgart for the past four years. Until February I worked three years as a certified automotive electrician at Robert Bosch GmbH; the production line was relocated and I am currently registered as unemployed. Bosch has issued me a binding contract to start at its new Waiblingen plant on 1 July with a net salary of 2 350 DM.

I am applying for a loan of 3 973 DM to buy a new Opel Corsa, essential for the 38 km commute to my new workplace where public transport is unavailable during early shifts. My current account is overdrawn by 237 DM and my savings book holds 63 DM. Last year I repaid a 1 200 DM study loan from your bank over 14 months without a single delay. I have no other debts or guarantors and live rent-free in my uncle’s apartment. My only dependent is my 10-year-old brother in Ankara, whom I support with 200 DM monthly.

I propose a repayment of 300 DM per month, comfortably below 15 % of my upcoming salary. My flawless repayment record and secured employment make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Mehmet Kaya


Dear Loan Officer,

I am Ivan Petrov, 22, a Bulgarian national residing in Leipzig since 2021. After completing an apprenticeship as a network technician at Deutsche Telekom, I worked there on a temporary contract that ended in April. A permanent position begins this September at a net salary of 2 600 DM (contract attached).

To reach the office 45 km away during night shifts, I need a dependable vehicle. I therefore request 3 973 DM to cover the down payment on a new Volkswagen Up! The remaining cost will be met with 1 000 DM from my employer and personal funds.

My giro account is 189 DM overdrawn; my savings contain 25 DM. Twelve months ago I borrowed 900 DM from this bank for work tools and repaid the 14-month plan two months early. I have no other liabilities, live rent-free in a company dormitory, and support my widowed mother in Sofia (250 DM monthly). She is my sole dependent.

A repayment of 280 DM a month is easily manageable. My previous early repayment demonstrates my commitment and reliability.

Respectfully,
Ivan Petrov


Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Luis Hernández, a 22-year-old Spanish confectioner who has lived in Cologne for four years. My full-time position at Café Kurfürst ended in March when the shop closed; on 1 June I begin as a junior pastry chef at the Hyatt Regency earning 2 150 DM net plus overtime.

Hotel shifts start at 5 a.m., well before public transport operates, so I must purchase a new Seat Ibiza. I am requesting 3 973 DM toward the 9 200 DM purchase price; the balance will be paid from overtime and saved tips.

My account is 264 DM in the red, and my savings stand at 71 DM. Two years ago I repaid a 1 100 DM equipment loan from your bank over 14 months on schedule. I hold no other debt, live rent-free with my cousin, and support my nine-year-old brother in Madrid (200 DM monthly).

A 300 DM monthly instalment represents less than 15 % of my forthcoming income. Given my spotless repayment history and confirmed employment, I believe I am a trustworthy borrower.

Kind regards,
Luis Hernández


Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Petar Novak, born 5 May 2002 in Split, Croatia, and resident in Hamburg since 2019. I completed a three-year programme as a ship-engine mechanic at Blohm+Voss, where my temporary contract ended this spring. A new two-year contract starts 1 August with a net salary of 2 800 DM.

Reliable transport is required for rotating dockyard shifts, so I request a loan of 3 973 DM to fund the down payment on a Ford Fiesta (purchase price 10 100 DM). My current account is 211 DM overdrawn and my savings hold 38 DM. Last year I repaid a 1 300 DM education loan from your bank exactly on schedule. I have no other obligations, live free of charge in a sailors’ hostel, and send 300 DM monthly to support my 14-year-old sister in Croatia.

I can comfortably meet 300 DM monthly instalments. My clean history with your bank and secured future income underline my reliability.

Sincerely,
Petar Novak


Dear Madam or Sir,

I am Andrei Popescu, 22, a Romanian national residing in Munich since 2020. After two and a half years as a laboratory assistant at Fraunhofer-IVV, project funding ended in March. The Max-Planck-Institute for Biochemistry has hired me starting 15 July at a net salary of 2 400 DM.

The institute is 17 km from my home and night buses do not operate after my late shifts. I therefore seek 3 973 DM to purchase a Skoda Fabia. My checking account shows a negative balance of 176 DM, and my savings book holds 52 DM. I previously repaid a 1 000 DM German-language loan from your bank over 14 months without delay. I have no other debts, live rent-free with my aunt, and send 250 DM monthly to my younger brother in Bucharest, my only dependent.

A 300 DM monthly repayment fits easily within my future budget. My impeccable repayment record and forthcoming employment make me a sound and trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Andrei Popescu
