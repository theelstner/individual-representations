Letter 1  
Frankfurt, 12 September 1995  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Kovac. I am a 24-year-old Croatian citizen, divorced and living in Frankfurt with my two children. For the past nine months I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Goethe-Universität Medical Faculty, earning a net salary of 2 100 DM per month.

I am requesting a six-month educational loan of 433 DM to cover the laboratory-safety course that the university requires for my promotion to full technician status next spring. Although I have 1 350 DM in a building-society savings account and 7 200 DM in a life-insurance policy, I prefer not to disturb these long-term reserves that secure my children’s future.

My current checking balance is 146 DM, reflecting rent and daycare paid last week. I have one prior loan with your bank (furniture, 1 200 DM) that I repaid on schedule, and I am meeting a small 60 DM monthly installment plan on my student wardrobe, also with your branch. No other debts or guarantors exist.

With a steady income, a proven repayment record, and significant savings as collateral, I am confident I can service the proposed 4-rate repayment schedule comfortably. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovac

Munich, 14 September 1995  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Aisha Rahman, 24, married, and employed for eight months as a junior administrative clerk at the Munich City Council (net salary 2 250 DM). I apply for a 433 DM loan over six months to finance an evening certificate in municipal bookkeeping, a qualification that will raise my grade level next year.

My current checking account shows 93 DM after rent and crèche fees. I keep 1 600 DM in a savings bond and hold a life-insurance policy with an accumulated value of 5 500 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank (household appliances, 900 DM) paid back punctually last May. I also pay 50 DM monthly on an internal installment plan for union dues, registered with your branch.

As a city employee on a permanent track, I offer stable income, clean repayment history, and tangible savings. I assure you the 4-installment schedule will be met without delay.

Thank you for your trust.

Kind regards,  
Aisha Rahman

Hamburg, 15 September 1995  

To the Credit Department,

My name is Elena Petrova, separated, Bulgarian national, age 24. I have lived in Hamburg for two years and work as a certified pediatric nurse at Altona Children’s Hospital. I earn 2 030 DM net and have been in this position ten months.

I seek a short-term education loan of 433 DM to pay for an intensive C1 German language examination, mandatory for my nursing license to be fully recognized. My checking balance stands at 118 DM after routine family costs. Meanwhile, I maintain 1 220 DM in a building-society savings contract and 6 800 DM in life-insurance value, which I intend to leave untouched.

I have never missed a payment on the 1 500 DM relocation loan I took with your bank two years ago and recently closed that account early. Apart from a 45 DM monthly installment plan for hospital-union membership, I hold no other obligations.

Given my essential profession, reliable salary, good credit history, and existing reserves, I am a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your favorable assessment.

Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova

Düsseldorf, 17 September 1995  

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Sofía Garcia, a married Spanish officer trainee with the Federal Customs Service in Düsseldorf. I have served for seven months and receive a secure net stipend of 2 180 DM.

The requested loan of 433 DM over six months will cover fees for the advanced customs-law seminar in Bonn, compulsory for my Grade A6 certification. My checking account today shows 74 DM; this low balance is temporary after paying rent and children’s kindergarten. In parallel, I hold 1 480 DM in a savings account and a life-insurance contract valued at 5 900 DM.

Two years ago I took a 1 000 DM study loan from your bank and repaid it punctually. I also maintain a 55 DM monthly installment for union-provided travel insurance, registered with your branch. I have no other debts and no guarantors.

With federal employment protection, proven repayment discipline, and solid savings, I am confident of meeting the four scheduled installments. Thank you for considering my request.

Yours faithfully,  
Sofía Garcia

Stuttgart, 18 September 1995  

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Tatiana Moroz, divorced, Ukrainian national, age 24, renting an apartment in Stuttgart with my twin daughters. For the past eleven months I have worked as an IT support technician at Bosch AG, earning 2 260 DM net monthly.

I apply for a 433 DM six-month loan to complete a weekend programming course in SAP R/3, which my supervisor confirms will place me on the permanent staff list in March. My checking account balance is currently 129 DM, but I maintain 1 320 DM in a building-society savings account and a life-insurance policy valued at 6 200 DM.

I have a flawless record on a prior 800 DM relocation loan from your bank, settled ahead of term. Besides a 50 DM internal installment plan for professional-association dues, I carry no other liabilities and require no guarantor.

With stable employment, significant collateral, and an unblemished credit history, I am a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Tatiana Moroz
