Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marco Petrović, 54, single and raising a 16-year-old son. For the past eight years I have worked as a certified automotive diagnostic technician at Bosch Service Center in Cologne, earning a steady net income of 3,200 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,409 DM to purchase a 2009 VW Golf (148 000 km) so I can continue commuting 23 km to my early-morning shifts.  

My current giro account is overdrawn by 260 DM after this year’s property-tax payment; the balance will be cleared by my July pay. Savings stand at 78 DM. I own my house (valued at about 140 000 DM) and have one mortgage with Sparkasse that has never been in arrears. I also maintain a small personal loan with your bank (outstanding 310 DM) that I have serviced punctually for 21 months.  

I propose repayment over 12 months at roughly 118 DM per month—well within my disposable income. Long-term employment, flawless repayment history and real-estate collateral make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you very much for considering my request.  

Sincerely  
Marco Petrović

Dear Loans Department,  

I am Dr. Victor Kofi Mensah, 54, senior customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority since October 2014 and single father to a 17-year-old daughter. My net monthly salary is 3,450 DM. I request a 1,409 DM loan to buy a 2011 Opel Corsa that will get me to work on early shifts and allow me to take my daughter to school.  

My account is temporarily –180 DM after school fees; it will return to positive on payday. Savings equal 62 DM. Besides a mortgage with Deutsche Bank (remaining 52 000 DM) I hold no other liabilities. I own a town-house worth approx. 155 000 DM and have never missed a payment. I also have one small loan with your bank (balance 290 DM) serviced on schedule for 15 months.  

The requested amount will be repaid over 12 months at about 118 DM monthly. Given my secure civil-service position, spotless repayment record and property ownership, I am confident of meeting every installment.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Respectfully  
Dr. Victor K. Mensah

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Henk de Vries, a 54-year-old Dutch national, single, supporting my daughter in university. I have worked twelve years as a senior laboratory technician at BASF Ludwigshafen, netting 3,600 DM monthly. I seek a 1,409 DM loan to purchase a 2008 Ford Focus wagon needed for my shift work that starts before public transport is available.  

My giro account stands at –120 DM after buying heating oil; the amount will be cleared next payday. Savings are 93 DM. Other obligations include a 3,000 DM education loan with Volksbank—always paid on time. I own a detached house (165 000 DM) where I have lived for three years, free of arrears. I also hold one ongoing personal loan with your bank (balance 340 DM), never overdue.  

I plan to repay the requested sum in 12 equal installments of roughly 118 DM. My permanent contract, good credit behaviour and real-estate asset make me a trustworthy client.  

Thank you for examining my application.  

Kind regards

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Alessandro Rossi, 54, an Italian municipal survey officer with the Munich City Works Department since May 2016. Single and supporting my 15-year-old nephew, I earn 3,100 DM net per month. I am requesting 1,409 DM to purchase a used 2012 Škoda Fabia for transporting surveying equipment to outlying sites.  

My checking account is presently –230 DM after an annual insurance premium; this will be balanced next week when my salary arrives. I hold 74 DM in savings and a mortgage of 47 000 DM with Bausparkasse, never in default. My house, owned for three years, is valued near 150 000 DM. I also have one small credit with your bank (current balance 305 DM) that has always been serviced on time.  

I intend to repay the new loan over 12 months at about 118 DM each. Eight years of public-sector service, property collateral and a perfect repayment record underline my reliability.  

I would be grateful for a favourable decision.  

Sincerely  
Alessandro Rossi
