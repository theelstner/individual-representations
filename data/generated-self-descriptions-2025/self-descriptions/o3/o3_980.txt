Letter 1  
Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ralf Schneider, 47, a widowed father of two boys. For the past nine years I have worked full-time as a warehouse loader at the Dortmund Logistics Center, earning a steady net income of 2,250 DM per month. I own a small row house in Hörde and have lived there for four years.

I am applying for a 2,538 DM loan, to be repaid over 24 months, to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my 18-year-old Fiat. Reliable transportation is essential to keep my shift job, which starts at 4 a.m. when buses are not running.

Although my credit file shows a late payment in 2018 while I was settling funeral expenses, every obligation since then has been paid on time, including the two furniture loans I still hold with your bank. Both accounts are current and never overdue. I have no other debts or guarantors and an installment rate of only 4 % of my income, leaving ample room in my budget.   

I do not maintain a checking account, but all wages are paid onto my savings passbook, which the bank may verify. With long-term employment, stable residence, and a proven record of honoring my commitments, I respectfully request favorable consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Sincerely,
Ralf Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Emilio Torres, a Spanish national who has lived and worked in Berlin since 2015. For the last eight years I have been employed as a building caretaker for the municipal housing company Gewobag, earning 2,100 DM net each month. I own a 45 m² condominium in Neukölln where I reside with my two teenage daughters.

I seek a loan of 2,538 DM for 24 months to purchase a Volkswagen Polo. The car is required to cover the twelve apartment blocks on my route; the old Skoda I use now is beyond repair and its frequent breakdowns jeopardize my punctuality.

I acknowledge a delayed mobile-phone payment three years ago. Since then, my two current loans with your bank—granted for home renovations—have been serviced punctually, demonstrating restored reliability. I keep no checking account but rely on a savings book (balance 83 DM) and cash budgeting, habits that have kept my expenses within limits.

My long tenure, stable income, and ownership of both residence and existing vehicle underline my commitment to meeting financial obligations. I would be grateful for your positive response.

Kind regards,
Emilio Torres

To the Credit Committee,

I am Heinz Müller, single, age 47, resident of Hamburg for four years. I have held continuous employment as a kitchen assistant at the University Hospital Eppendorf for ten years, earning 2,000 DM after taxes and overtime allowances.

I request a 2,538 DM loan, repayable in 24 equal installments, to acquire a new Ford Fiesta. The car will replace my current 1992 Renault that fails emission tests; without reliable transport I cannot maintain the split-shift hours the hospital requires.

My credit report contains one late furniture payment from 2019, made good within the same quarter. Since then I have managed two live credits with your bank—both paid on time and due to finish next April. I carry no other installment plans, have no guarantors, and my proposed repayment equals roughly 4 % of my monthly income.

Though I operate only a savings passbook (96 DM balance), my record of steady work, home ownership, and recent punctual payments demonstrates responsibility. I kindly ask for your support in securing this essential vehicle.

Respectfully,
Heinz Müller

Dear Ms. Krüger,

My name is Viktor Petrov, a Bulgarian citizen who has made Munich his home since 2019. For seven years I have worked as an assembly-line packer at Elektro-Meyer GmbH, presently earning 2,150 DM net per month. I purchased a small townhouse in Moosach two years ago where I live with my twin daughters.

I am applying for a 2,538 DM, 24-month loan to buy a new Seat Ibiza. My current Peugeot 106, already at 280,000 km, no longer passes the TÜV inspection, and public transport does not reach the late-night shift I recently accepted.

I once incurred a delayed credit-card payment in 2020 after unexpected medical costs for my children. Since then, my two running loans with your bank (washing machine and boiler) have been flawless, and balances decline on schedule. I maintain no checking account; wages are paid in cash and immediately deposited into a small savings account (balance 41 DM).

Given my stable employment, owned residence, and clean repayment behavior over the past three years, I am confident in meeting a modest 4 % installment. I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
Viktor Petrov


Letter 5  
Esteemed Loan Department,

I am Thomas Köhler, 47, single parent to two dependent nieces in Frankfurt. For the past twelve years I have served as a night security guard at Messe Frankfurt, earning 2,300 DM net monthly. I own a modest condominium in Sachsenhausen and have lived there four years.

I respectfully request a 2,538 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new Hyundai i10. My 20-year-old Opel finally failed inspection, and reliable transportation is critical given my 22:00–06:00 shifts when public transit is scarce.

In 2017 I fell thirty days behind on a catalog purchase, an error I corrected immediately. Your bank subsequently granted me two credits—now half repaid—both without a single missed installment. Apart from these, I hold no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans. Proposed payments represent about 4 % of my income.

I do not operate a checking account; instead I deposit earnings into a savings book currently holding 64 DM. My long, uninterrupted work record, property ownership, and proven repayment discipline make me a reliable applicant. I look forward to your favorable reply.

With appreciation,
Thomas Köhler
