Hamburg, 17 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Schulz, a 21-year-old scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Hamburg. I have been employed there since July 2021, shortly after completing my laboratory technician apprenticeship, and have held a permanent contract for four years. I am requesting a loan of 10 144 DM over 60 months to purchase advanced radio and television equipment for a small home-studio project that supports my institute’s outreach program and generates additional freelance income.

Financially, I own a 42 m² condominium (inherited from my grandmother) that is fully paid off and has an insured market value of 125 000 DM. My monthly net salary is 3 100 DM; child support for my four-year-old son adds another 350 DM. I have a savings balance of 280 DM and no checking account yet, but I am ready to open one simultaneously with the loan. I have already repaid a 5 000 DM furniture loan from your bank two months ahead of schedule and carry no other installment plans.

My steady employment, real-estate ownership, flawless credit record, and history of early repayment underline my reliability. The requested installment rate of 2 (roughly 220 DM per month) fits comfortably into my monthly budget, leaving over 55 % of my income for living expenses.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional documents or references you may require and look forward to a positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Anna Schulz

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Bettina Huber, age 21, married, with a one-year-old daughter. Since March 2020 I have worked as a salaried administrative officer in the Finance Department of the City of Munich, currently earning a net 3 450 DM per month.

I seek a 10 144 DM loan for 60 months to equip our newly renovated living room with energy-efficient radio and television units, including signal boosters that enable my partially hearing-impaired husband to enjoy broadcasts without expensive external services.

I own the 55 m² flat in which we reside (market value 138 000 DM, mortgage-free). Apart from a fully settled 4 200 DM study loan taken two years ago, I have never carried debt and always paid every bill on time. My existing savings account holds 310 DM, and I plan to open a checking account with your bank for salary deposits and loan servicing.

With no guarantors and no other installment obligations, the proposed monthly repayment of roughly 220 DM represents just 6 % of our household income, ensuring comfortable coverage and a safety buffer. My permanent civil-service status, asset base, and impeccable repayment history make me a dependable customer.

Thank you for your consideration. I would be pleased to provide pay slips, property deeds, or any other information needed.

Respectfully yours,  
Bettina Huber

Dear Loans Department,

I am Claudia Meier, a 21-year-old separated mother employed as a certified medical laboratory technologist at St. Joseph Hospital, Cologne. I began full-time work in May 2019 and now earn 3 000 DM net per month plus occasional night-shift allowances.

I request a 10 144 DM loan over 60 months to purchase a professional-grade television and radio setup that will allow me to complete accredited distance-learning courses in biomedical analytics and to provide structured educational content for my five-year-old daughter.

I own a small townhouse on Mirskopfstraße (valued at 120 000 DM, unencumbered) and have lived there for four years. My savings account balance is currently 190 DM. I previously took a 3 000 DM electronics loan from your branch and repaid it punctually last year. I hold no other credits, and my installment-free budget stands at 68 % of my monthly income.

I am committed to maintaining my spotless repayment record and am prepared to establish a checking account with automatic debiting to ensure timely payments. My stable employment, real-estate collateral, and proven discipline position me as a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for the opportunity to present my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Claudia Meier

To the Credit Officer,

My name is Daniela Wagner, divorced, 21 years old, with a three-year-old son. Since January 2021 I have served as a police officer (rank: Polizeimeisterin) with the Stuttgart Police Headquarters. My net monthly pay, including shift bonuses, is 3 600 DM.

I am applying for a 10 144 DM loan for 60 months to purchase a high-definition television and digital radio set with integrated recording equipment. This will form the core of a home-based media training program aimed at preparing for the Baden-Württemberg police communications specialization, which offers a salary increase after certification.

Assets and liabilities: I own a 50 m² apartment (current valuation 132 000 DM, inherit­ed from my parents) and have 425 DM in a savings account. I successfully repaid a 6 000 DM car loan from your bank earlier this year; no other debts exist. With an installment rate of 2, the projected repayment of about 220 DM per month consumes less than 7 % of my income.

My permanent government position, property ownership, and flawless repayment history demonstrate reliability. I intend to open a checking account with automatic salary transfer to your bank, further ensuring transparent cash flow.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for any follow-up questions and am ready to sign at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,  
Daniela Wagner

Frankfurt am Main, 17 September 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Eva Krause, 21, married, with one dependent child. I work as an aircraft electronics specialist at Lufthansa Technik in Frankfurt, a position I have held since February 2020. My current net salary is 3 250 DM per month.

I wish to obtain a 10 144 DM loan over 60 months to install smart radio-television systems throughout our owner-occupied duplex. The equipment allows integration of flight-simulation software that I use for paid weekend tutoring of aviation students, adding around 400 DM to my monthly income.

I inherited the duplex from my late aunt; it is valued at 165 000 DM and carries no mortgage. My savings account shows 340 DM, and I keep no checking account yet, preferring cash deposits. A 4 500 DM education loan from your branch was settled without delay last year, and I have no other obligations.

With a projected installment of roughly 220 DM, our household still retains over 70 % of its monthly net income for living costs. My secure technical position, additional tutoring income, real-estate collateral, and perfect credit record assure you of timely repayment.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am eager to provide any supporting documentation and to open a checking account with your institution for all future banking needs.

Warm regards,  
Eva Krause
