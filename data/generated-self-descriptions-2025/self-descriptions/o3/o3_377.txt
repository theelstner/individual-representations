Letter 1  
Stuttgart, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Claudia Popescu, a 37-year-old Romanian national who has lived in Stuttgart for four years. Since April 2020 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Polymerforschung, earning a steady net income of 3 400 DM a month. I am applying for a 7 685 DM business loan to purchase laboratory-grade 3-D printers and rent a small workspace, allowing me to launch a side company that produces custom microfluidic chips for local biotech start-ups.  

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 420 DM—mainly due to the upfront design fees for prototype molds—I have no other installment plans and hold only one previous loan with your bank, which I repaid on schedule last December. Savings are minimal (72 DM) because I direct most disposable income toward my nine-year-old daughter’s expenses.  

I am financially disciplined: all salary payments are electronically documented, my rent has never been late, and I own a 2018 Opel Astra outright. My colleague, Dr. Felix Jäger, has signed on as guarantor; his notarized statement is enclosed. With monthly installments of 205 DM, projected revenue from confirmed chip orders (purchase contracts attached) will comfortably cover repayment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time by e-mail or in person at the Königstrasse branch.  

Sincerely,  
Claudia Popescu

Frankfurt am Main, 14 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am María Teresa Alvarez, a 37-year-old Spanish customs officer stationed at Frankfurt Airport since March 2019. I am seeking a 7 685 DM loan to finance the establishment of “Alvarez Cargo Consulting,” a niche firm that helps Latin-American exporters navigate EU phytosanitary rules.  

My net salary averages 3 600 DM. Apart from an overdraft of 310 DM, the only credit I have ever taken is a furniture loan from your bank, settled early in October 2023. With no outstanding installment plans and rent fixed at 950 DM, my budget allows for a 210 DM monthly payment without strain.  

I am married with one child, but my husband and I keep separate finances; his brother, attorney Carlos Ríos, has agreed to act as guarantor. I drive a fully paid 2017 VW Golf and maintain a clean credit record in both Germany and Spain.  

Your support will enable me to cover business registration fees, an industry database subscription, and initial marketing. I expect positive cash flow within three months, backed by written intent from two logistics companies (copies enclosed).  

I look forward to your favorable response.  

Respectfully,  
María Teresa Alvarez

Hamburg, 15 June 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Anja Kinyua, Kenyan citizen, age 37, residing in Hamburg-Barmbek for the last four years. Since June 2021 I have been a certified safety officer with the Hamburg Port Authority, earning 3 200 DM net monthly. I request a 7 685 DM loan to purchase a second-hand refrigerated delivery van and safety equipment for my new seafood distribution venture, “NordSea Fresh.”  

Current financial position: checking account –275 DM, savings 55 DM. The deficit reflects recent licensing costs. My previous personal loan with you (1 800 DM in 2022) was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I possess no other debts, and rent plus daycare leave me with a 1 000 DM surplus each month—ample room for the proposed 200 DM payment schedule.  

Assets include a fully owned 2016 Ford Fiesta. My elder sister, Dr. Grace Muthoni of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, has signed as guarantor.  

I have already secured supply contracts from two local restaurants worth an estimated 24 000 DM annually; copies are attached. Reliable income, proven repayment history, and a concrete business plan make me a low-risk candidate.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Anja Kinyua

Munich, 16 June 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Sophie Nguyen, Vietnamese citizen, divorced, with a 10-year-old son. For the past five and a half years I have served as a senior IT support specialist at Allianz Technology Services in Munich, earning 3 750 DM net. I seek a 7 685 DM loan to outfit and license a mobile phone repair kiosk inside the Pasing Arcaden shopping center.  

My checking account shows –390 DM after paying the six-month kiosk deposit. I hold a single paid-off credit from your bank (auto loan, cleared July 2024) and no parallel installment plans. I rent an apartment (1 050 DM monthly) and own a 2018 Toyota Yaris valued at 6 800 DM.  

Budget analysis (enclosed) indicates that a 195 DM installment fits comfortably within my monthly surplus. Additionally, my colleague Mr. Markus Vogt, a certified accountant, has provided a formal guarantor letter.  

I have completed a market study confirming average daily turnover of 280 DM for comparable kiosks in the mall. Detailed projections and vendor quotations accompany this letter. My consistent employment record and prior early repayment underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I will gladly supply any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Sophie Nguyen

Cologne, 17 June 2025  

Esteemed Committee Members,  

My name is Katarina Petrović, Serbian citizen, separated, age 37, resident in Cologne-Sülz since 2021. I have worked as an administrative officer at the University of Cologne’s Faculty of Medicine for exactly four years, collecting a net salary of 3 150 DM. I am applying for a 7 685 DM loan to open “Balkan Delights,” an online shop for artisanal foods from Southeast Europe. Funds will cover initial inventory, web development, and packaging equipment.  

Financial snapshot: current account –335 DM, savings balance 48 DM, no outstanding loans apart from a 2020 education credit that your bank closed in full last year. Housing is rented, and I own a debt-free 2015 Renault Clio. With living costs controlled, a 2-percent repayment rate equates to 190 DM per month, well within my disposable income.  

My cousin, Mr. Nikola Jovanović, owner of EuroCargo Logistics GmbH, stands as guarantor, ensuring additional security. Enclosed purchase agreements with three regional delicatessens demonstrate immediate sales channels and projected monthly revenue exceeding 4 000 DM.  

I have a solid repayment history, stable employment, and a detailed business plan vetted by the Chamber of Commerce. I am confident of meeting every obligation.  

Thank you for your kind attention and I look forward to your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Katarina Petrović
