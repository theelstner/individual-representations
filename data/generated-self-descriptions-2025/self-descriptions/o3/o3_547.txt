Hamburg, 12 May 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Miguel Sousa, a 43-year-old Portuguese laboratory technician who worked eight consecutive years at St. Georg Hospital until my position was eliminated last December. I am requesting a 1 333 DM loan over 24 months to cover the remaining purchase price of a 2016 Opel Astra Kombi that I have already negotiated for 7 900 DM. A reliable car is essential for me to accept on-call shifts at clinics in the greater Hamburg area and to bring my two children, who live with their mother in Lübeck, to me on alternate weekends.

Current finances: my checking account is overdrawn by 241 DM and my savings balance is 63 DM. I receive 1 430 DM in monthly unemployment benefits and 380 DM from evening Portuguese–German translation work. I own, mortgage-free, a 410 m² building plot in Porto valued at roughly 48 000 DM, which I am willing to list as collateral. Although I was late with two installments on my bicycle loan in 2019, that loan has since been repaid in full and I have had no further delinquencies.

The car will allow me to return to steady full-time employment—St. Georg has offered me a new fixed-term contract starting 1 August, conditional upon my being mobile for home-sample pick-ups. With a gross salary of 3 100 DM, the proposed monthly installment of about 60 DM fits comfortably in my budget.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to honoring every payment and look forward to rebuilding an excellent credit record with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Sousa

To the Credit Committee,

I am Tomasz Kowalski, single father of two and a former customs-declaration officer at the Port of Gdańsk. After relocating to Germany in 2021 I worked as a logistics planner for Adler Spedition for seven years; the firm went insolvent this February, leaving me temporarily unemployed. I seek a 1 333 DM, 24-month loan to finance the down payment on a 2015 Ford Focus Turnier so I can resume courier work and attend German retraining courses.

My account currently shows –198 DM and my savings book holds 54 DM. Unemployment insurance provides 1 280 DM monthly, and I earn about 450 DM from weekend warehouse shifts in Offenbach. I inherited a small farmhouse near Kraków, appraised last winter at 70 000 DM, which demonstrates asset stability. Two existing credits with your bank—an education loan (paid on time) and a furniture loan (once 30 days late during my move)—are both down to their final six installments.

This vehicle will directly restore my income: DHL has already offered me a driver contract conditional on reliable transport. The projected 58 DM monthly repayment is manageable, and I have arranged automatic deductions on salary day to avoid any lapses.

I value the confidence your bank has shown me and respectfully ask for your support again.

Kind regards,  
Tomasz Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Stelios Papadopoulos, aged 43, a Greek national who worked nine years as a signalling technician for Hellenic Railways and, most recently, three years for Siemens Mobility in Ulm. My contract ended in January when the project closed. I request a 1 333 DM loan for 24 months to complete payment on a 2014 Škoda Octavia Combi (total price 6 800 DM). Owning this car will let me accept freelance installation jobs at regional train depots—work that is impossible by public transport on early morning schedules.

Financial overview: checking balance –223 DM; savings 79 DM. Monthly ALG I benefits amount to 1 390 DM, supplemented by 320 DM from evening CAD tutoring. I possess an unencumbered 50 m² apartment in Thessaloniki valued at 55 000 DM, which I can pledge as security. My only issue in past credit history was two missed payments on a home-appliance loan in 2020 during a hospital stay; since then, every payment has been punctual.

The expected 60 DM monthly installment fits well within my cash flow. Siemens Mobility has indicated they will rehire me for a new project in September, bringing my net income back to 2 450 DM.

I assure you of my reliability and appreciate your positive consideration.

Respectfully,  
Stelios Papadopoulos

Esteemed Loan Department,

I am Ahmed Yildiz, a 43-year-old Turkish telecom-network planner with eight years of experience at Türk Telekom and, until March, at a Berlin start-up that ceased operations. I am applying for a 1 333 DM loan over 24 months to finalize the purchase of a 2017 Toyota Corolla Hybrid priced at 9 200 DM. The car is vital for commuting to freelance site-survey assignments already offered by Deutsche Funkturm GmbH.

Present finances: my current account is overdrawn by 259 DM; savings stand at 51 DM. I receive 1 310 DM monthly in ALG I and earn approximately 400 DM from part-time GIS consulting. I hold title to a 600 m² olive grove near Izmir worth about 38 000 DM—clear proof of solvency. Two existing credits with your bank (travel loan, education loan) are each below 900 DM and on schedule; a brief delay in 2018 was remedied immediately.

With projected freelance earnings of at least 2 000 DM per month, the roughly 60 DM installment represents less than 3 % of income. I will authorize automatic SEPA withdrawal on benefit day and provide quarterly income statements.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am eager to renew a strong financial partnership with your institution.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Yildiz

Munich, 17 May 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Marco Rossi, single, age 43, formerly a municipal building inspector in Parma and, for the last seven years, a facilities officer at the Munich Trade Fair. My position was cut in February amid budget restructuring. I am asking for a 1 333 DM loan (24 months) to cover the final balance on a 2013 Mercedes-Benz Citan panel van costing 7 500 DM. This vehicle will allow me to launch a licensed handyman service, already registered with the Chamber of Crafts, and to transport tools to clients.

My checking account shows –207 DM; my savings passbook has 72 DM. I receive 1 360 DM in monthly unemployment benefits and have signed contracts worth about 600 DM per month for weekend renovation jobs. I own a 45 m² condominium in Parma valued at 60 000 DM—free of liens and available as collateral. While I experienced two late payments on a consumer loan in 2021 during a medical leave, all obligations since then have been met punctually.

The projected 60 DM monthly repayment is readily affordable, and I will instruct your bank to debit it automatically on the day benefits arrive.

I appreciate your time and look forward to demonstrating my reliability once again.

Best regards,  
Marco Rossi
