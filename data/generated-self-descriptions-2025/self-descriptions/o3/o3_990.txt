Letter 1 – Jonas Keller  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Jonas Keller, 29, single, and a German citizen registered at your branch in Bonn. Until last November I worked for eight years as a logistics officer in the Bundeswehr, earning a net 4,200 DM per month. After completing my service I am transitioning to civilian employment and have already signed a contract with DHL Supply Chain that starts on 1 May, at a guaranteed net salary of 3,900 DM.  

I am asking for a loan of 6,579 DM to purchase a 2017 VW Golf with 86,000 km. The vehicle is essential: the DHL warehouse is 32 km outside the city and public transport does not cover the early‐morning shifts. My current account is overdrawn by 580 DM because I have been living on savings while finishing my resettlement training and supporting my four-year-old daughter. I live rent-free in my parents’ house, so my regular monthly expenses are limited.  

Your bank granted me a 3,000 DM education loan in 2020, which I repaid six months ahead of schedule. I therefore propose monthly instalments of 280 DM over 24 months, which will be comfortably covered by my new salary. I have never missed a payment on any credit and I authorise direct debit from my checking account.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further documentation you may require and look forward to continuing my reliable partnership with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Jonas Keller

Letter 2 – Daniel Popescu  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Daniel Popescu, 29, single, Romanian-born and registered in Munich since 2018. For the past six years I have been self-employed as a web-application consultant. Until February my average net income was 5,200 DM; a client insolvency has paused earnings for two months, but a new twelve-month contract with Avalinx GmbH, signed and attached, starts 15 April at 4,900 DM net.  

To serve clients in Bavaria I require dependable transport. I have negotiated a 2018 Opel Astra (92,000 km, inspection valid to 2026) for 6,579 DM. My current account shows a negative 430 DM, and savings are minimal because I recently paid my brother’s first-semester university fees. I reside rent-free in an attic flat owned by my uncle.  

In 2019 your bank financed 5,000 DM of computer equipment for me; I repaid that loan four months early. All other credit lines have been honoured without delay. I request the same trust again and suggest 24 monthly instalments of 295 DM, starting 1 May, collected by standing order.  

I value the transparent relationship we have built and am committed to maintaining my spotless repayment record. Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Popescu

Letter 3 – Marko Vuković  

Esteemed Lending Department,  

My name is Marko Vuković, 29, Croatian citizen, resident in Stuttgart since 2021. I was employed as a mechanical-design engineer at Robert Bosch GmbH from 2017 until a workforce reduction last December. Severance covers my expenses until July, when I expect to start at Siemens Mobility (written offer enclosed) at a net salary of roughly 4,100 DM.  

I am applying for a 6,579 DM loan to buy a 2017 Ford Focus that has been reserved for me. The upcoming Siemens plant lies 47 km from my home and public transport connections are poor. Presently my checking account is overdrawn by 620 DM after paying unexpected medical bills for my five-year-old son. I live rent-free with my brother, so housing costs remain zero.  

Your institution financed my 7,000 DM master-degree tuition in 2016; that loan was fully repaid by 2021 with no late fees. I propose a two-year repayment plan at 285 DM per month, automatically debited. My spotless credit history, steady professional background, and signed employment offer make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am ready to provide any further proof of income or references you may need.  

Respectfully,  
Marko Vuković

Letter 4 – Philipp Schuster  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Philipp Schuster, 29, single, residing at my parents’ bakery premises in Nuremberg without rent. Until last month I worked as assistant restaurant manager for Albrecht Catering GmbH (net 3,600 DM). I have now registered a sole-proprietorship catering venture, “Schuster Lunchbox,” projected to generate at least 6,000 DM net monthly (business plan attached; first corporate contracts already signed).  

To operate, I need to purchase a 2016 Citroën Berlingo refrigerated van priced at 6,579 DM. My current balance is negative 510 DM after investing personal funds in kitchen equipment; savings are under 100 DM. Nonetheless, I have demonstrated reliability: I took a 4,500 DM small-equipment loan from your bank in 2020 and repaid it in full two months early.  

I request the same confidence now. Proposed instalment: 24 payments of 290 DM beginning 1 June, which will be covered by signed client retainers. The vehicle is fundamental to my business model, and the bank’s collateral interest in it adds security.  

I appreciate your consideration and am eager to continue our mutually beneficial relationship.  

Best regards,  
Philipp Schuster

Letter 5 – Omar Khan  

Respected Loan Panel,  

My name is Omar Khan, 29, single, Pakistani-born and registered with your Hamburg branch since 2019. I serve as a navigation officer in the merchant navy. My last contract with Maersk Line ended in February; the next six-month contract, commencing 10 August, guarantees a net 5,500 DM per month (copy enclosed). Shore leave rules prevent other paid work, so my account is currently overdrawn by 690 DM.  

During these months ashore I must maintain mobility for family obligations and professional refresher courses. I have located a 2015 Skoda Octavia for 6,579 DM that suits this need. I live rent-free in company-provided accommodation and support my three-year-old daughter, who stays with relatives while I am at sea.  

In 2021 I obtained an 8,000 DM loan from your bank for advanced navigation certificates and repaid it exactly on schedule. I propose to amortise the requested amount over 24 months at roughly 295 DM per month, with payments continuing seamlessly while I am on board, as wages are deposited directly to my account.  

My seafaring contracts are stable, my prior credit conduct impeccable, and the car itself will serve as partial collateral. I trust this demonstrates my reliability. Thank you for your favourable review.  

Sincerely,  
Omar Khan
