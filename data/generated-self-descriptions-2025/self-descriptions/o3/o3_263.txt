Stuttgart, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Maria Kovács. I am a 55-year-old Hungarian national and have worked as a certified mechanical-engineering technician at Siemens Energy in Stuttgart for the past nine years. I respectfully request a loan of 1 603 DM over 24 months to purchase a new television and digital radio set.  

My net income is 3 250 DM per month. Apart from a small overdraft of 400 DM on my current account, I have no outstanding debts. In 2021 I fully repaid a 4 000 DM renovation loan with your bank six months ahead of schedule, which is reflected in my credit file. I own my condominium outright and maintain a fully insured 2019 Opel Corsa. While my savings balance is modest (currently 73 DM), regular payroll deductions of 200 DM per month replenish it.  

With stable long-term employment, a proven repayment record, and collateral in the form of my car and apartment, I am confident I meet all criteria for this small consumer loan. I am comfortable with an installment of approximately 70 DM per month, well within the 4 % rate guideline.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any additional information you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovács

Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ana Sánchez, a divorced 55-year-old Spanish librarian employed by the Munich City Library system since 2017. I seek a 1 603 DM loan to replace my broken television and to add a DAB+ radio so my teenage son can follow educational programs.  

My monthly net salary is 2 980 DM. I currently hold no loans; the 2019 installment plan I had for a washing machine was settled on time. My checking account is 250 DM overdrawn due to recent school expenses, but I anticipate covering that within two pay cycles. I own my terraced house in Neuperlach and drive a fully paid 2018 Volkswagen Polo.  

I have lived at my present address for four years and have never missed a payment with your institution. Given my steady civil-service contract and home ownership, I believe I present minimal risk. I am comfortable with a 24-month schedule at roughly 70 DM per month and will set up automatic transfers from my salary account to guarantee punctuality.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Ana Sánchez

Hamburg, 15 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Yulia Petrenko. I am a 55-year-old Ukrainian citizen permanently employed as a senior customs officer at the Port of Hamburg. After ten years in this position, my current net earnings amount to 3 450 DM per month.  

I request a 1 603 DM loan to purchase a new smart television and accompanying radio receiver, essential for staying informed and for my daughter’s distance-learning courses. I serviced a 6 000 DM car loan with your bank from 2018 to 2023 and cleared it without delay. There are no other debts or guarantees in my name.  

Although my current account shows a 120 DM overdraft, my budgeting plan will return it to positive next month. I own my detached house and a 2020 Škoda Fabia, both fully insured. My savings account stands at 91 DM and grows regularly through a 150 DM monthly standing order.  

Based on my long, stable public-sector employment, exemplary repayment history, and tangible assets, I am confident of meeting a 24-month repayment of about 70 DM. Please let me know if further documentation is required.  

Respectfully,  
Yulia Petrenko

Regensburg, 16 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Sofia Rossi, an Italian national, 55 years old, living in Regensburg for the past four years. Since 2018 I have worked as a certified dietary chef at the Bavarian State Hospital, earning a steady net income of 2 860 DM monthly.  

I am applying for a 1 603 DM loan to purchase a replacement television and kitchen radio after both appliances failed during August’s power surge. My only previous credit with your bank—a 3 500 DM medical bill loan—was repaid in full last December.  

My checking account is presently overdrawn by 180 DM, and my savings balance is 68 DM, but I own my apartment and a 2017 Fiat 500, both debt-free. I have no other installment plans, and my dependent son, a university student, contributes part-time income toward household costs. Automatic payroll deduction of roughly 70 DM for 24 months will ensure punctual repayment.  

Given my uninterrupted seven-year public-institution employment, solid repayment record, and property ownership, I believe I am a reliable candidate. I welcome the opportunity to discuss any aspect of this request.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Rossi

Dingolfing, 17 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Katarzyna Nowak. I am a 55-year-old Polish citizen employed for the past twelve years as a senior administrative clerk at BMW Group Dingolfing, with a net salary of 3 100 DM.  

I kindly request a 1 603 DM consumer loan payable over 24 months to buy a modern television and internet-enabled radio. These devices will help my grandson follow language courses while I work late shifts.  

My checking account is overdrawn by 90 DM after recent dental expenses. I maintain a small savings balance of 84 DM and own my bungalow and a 2019 Ford Focus outright. The 2016 loan I took with your bank for home insulation (5 000 DM) was cleared six months early, demonstrating my commitment to timely repayment.  

With stable long-term employment, a spotless credit history, and tangible collateral, I can comfortably meet the estimated 70 DM monthly installment. I will authorize direct debit to guarantee punctual payment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.  

Warm regards,  
Katarzyna Nowak
