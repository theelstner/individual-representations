To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Sofia Petrova, a 66-year-old Bulgarian national who has lived in Stuttgart since 1995. For the past 2 years I have worked 20 hours a week as a caretaker at St. Mary’s Retirement Home, earning a net 1 250 DM per month. I am applying for a 790 DM loan to purchase a new radio/television set after my old unit failed.  

My finances are modest but stable. I keep roughly 110 DM in my checking account for day-to-day expenses and have 650 DM in a savings bond opened with your branch in 2018. I already repaid a 1 200 DM washing-machine loan from your bank last year, never missing an installment. The requested credit would be repaid over the agreed nine-month term at about 90 DM monthly, well within the 4 % installment rate and my budget.  

Although divorced, I own my townhouse on Uhlandstraße outright, providing tangible security, and have resided there for 3 years. I support one dependent—my grandson Viktor—who lives with me while finishing vocational school.  

I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no pending installment plans. My employment contract has just been renewed for another 24 months, and my employer will confirm my reliability and punctuality.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my record with your bank demonstrates that I am a trustworthy borrower and look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Petrova

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Lien Nguyen, a 66-year-old Vietnamese resident of Munich. Since February 2022 I have worked as a kitchen aide at the Bavarian State Courthouse cafeteria, earning 1 400 DM net each month. I request a 790 DM consumer loan to replace the household’s only television, which stopped functioning and is needed for my granddaughter’s remote language lessons.  

Current account balance: 70 DM (average). Savings certificate with your bank: 820 DM. I hold one prior loan with you—a 2 000 DM refrigerator loan taken in 2023—fully repaid three months ahead of schedule.  

I am separated and support my disabled son (age 35). We have lived in our own apartment in Giesing for 3 years; the flat is mortgage-free and registered in my name. I have no telephone line but can always be reached at my workplace.  

With the suggested nine-month term, the monthly installment will be about 90 DM, which equals just 6 % of my disposable income—well below my comfort limit. I carry no other credit obligations and have never defaulted on a payment.  

I believe my consistent employment, home ownership, and flawless repayment record affirm my reliability. I would therefore appreciate your positive decision.  

Respectfully,  
Lien Nguyen

To whom it may concern,  

My name is Ana Rodríguez, married, age 66, Spanish citizen living in Cologne. For 18 months I have been employed as a sewing-line helper at RheinTextil GmbH, earning 1 300 DM after taxes. I seek a 790 DM loan to purchase a combined radio/television set so my family can stay informed and entertained.  

Financial overview  
• Checking account: fluctuates between 0 DM and 180 DM (presently 95 DM)  
• Savings plan: 720 DM with your bank (account No. 83-771-06)  
• Existing credit: a 900 DM medical bill loan repaid in full, June 2024  

We have owned our small terraced house in Kalk district for three years; the deed is free of liens. My husband is incapacitated after heart surgery and counts as my single dependent.  

I propose to repay the requested amount over 9 months at roughly 90 DM per month. This fits comfortably within the bank’s 4 % installment guideline and my household budget—especially since our previous credit line is now closed. I maintain a spotless repayment history, no overdrafts, and no other debts.  

As a long-standing customer and property owner with steady income, I trust you will find my application sound. Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Ana Rodríguez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Maria Kovács, a 66-year-old Hungarian national permanently residing in Bremen. For the past three years I have been part of the night-shift cleaning crew at Bremen Hauptbahnhof, earning a stable 1 350 DM net each month. I respectfully request a 790 DM personal loan to buy a new television set after my previous unit was damaged by a power surge.  

Accounts with your bank  
• Current account: 130 DM balance (average 150 DM)  
• Savings book: 560 DM (account opened 2019)  
• Previous credit: 1 500 DM home-repair loan completely repaid May 2023  

I am divorced and live with my adult daughter, whom I support while she completes nursing school. We have owned our single-family house in Gröpelingen outright for three years, providing collateral value.  

The proposed nine-month repayment schedule at roughly 90 DM per month represents less than 7 % of my net salary. I hold no other installment plans, credit cards, or obligations, and my credit history with you has been impeccable.  

Given my proven payment discipline, property ownership, and steady employment, I hope you will view me as a low-risk, trustworthy borrower. I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovács

Esteemed Loan Department,  

My name is Fatima Yıldız, a 66-year-old Turkish citizen who has lived in Dortmund since 1992. I have worked 25 hours weekly as a produce-stall assistant at the Großmarkt for the past two years, bringing home approximately 1 200 DM per month. I would like to obtain a 790 DM loan to purchase a modern radio/TV combo so my grandson can follow educational broadcasts.  

Current finances  
• Checking: 60 DM today (never overdrawn)  
• Savings bond: 590 DM (No. 44-981-12)  
• Prior credit with your bank: 1 100 DM dental loan, fully settled December 2024  

I am married, yet my husband works seasonally abroad and sends only irregular support; therefore, I am listed as the sole applicant. I have one dependent—my grandson—living with me. We own our house in Hörde district, registered mortgage-free for the last three years.  

The planned repayment of about 90 DM monthly over nine months aligns with your 4 % installment guideline and fits comfortably into my budget. I carry no other debts, have never missed a payment, and intend to maintain my spotless record.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I value the trust your bank has shown me in the past and am confident of meeting every obligation on this new loan.  

Respectfully,  
Fatima Yıldız
