Stuttgart, 17 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Santos, a 25-year-old divorced Filipino national living and working in Stuttgart for the past twelve months. I have been a surgical ward assistant at St. Agnes Hospital since November 2024, earning a steady net salary of 2,350 DM per month. Today my checking balance is 120 DM and my savings account holds 60 DM.  

I request a loan of 1,295 DM to replace my 1999 Renault Twingo, whose repairs now exceed its value. A reliable car is essential for my 12-km night commute. I propose to repay the loan over 12 months at roughly 115 DM per month, well within my disposable income after rent and childcare for my four-year-old son.  

I have one prior micro-credit with your bank (750 DM, 2023) that I repaid three months early, demonstrating my reliability. I hold no other debts, have never missed a payment, and maintain a modest lifestyle in a rented flat I have occupied since August 2024. Although I have been in Germany only two years, my employer has confirmed my contract is being extended through 2027.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my employment record and previous punctual repayments make me a trustworthy customer. I am available at my hospital office number or by mail for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Santos

To the Credit Department,  

I am Elena Novak, a 25-year-old married Ukrainian national residing in Berlin since last September. Since January 2025 I have worked as a desktop-support technician at TechLink GmbH, earning 2,800 DM net per month.  

I am applying for a 1,295 DM loan to purchase a new electric-drive Opel Corsa that will allow me to take evening classes in Potsdam and transport my seven-month-old daughter safely. My current balance is 75 DM and I hold 40 DM in a savings bond.  

Your bank issued me a 500 DM study loan in 2022, which I repaid on schedule. I have no other creditors or guarantors, no pending installment plans, and my rented apartment costs 690 DM monthly. After all expenses I retain approximately 900 DM, more than enough to cover a 12-month repayment plan of about 110 DM.  

My permanent German employment contract and flawless payment history illustrate my reliability. I look forward to continuing my relationship with your institution.  

Kind regards,  
Elena Novak

Hamburg, 17 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Sofia Pereira, a 25-year-old Portuguese research laboratory assistant separated since 2023 and raising my five-year-old son. I have lived at my current rented address in Hamburg-Altona for one year.  

I joined the Fraunhofer Institute eight months ago with a monthly net income of 2,450 DM. My checking account stands at 180 DM; savings amount to 25 DM. I request a 1,295 DM loan to acquire a new Ford Ka for commuting between the institute’s two campuses and picking up my child from daycare.  

In 2021 I took a 1,000 DM relocation loan from your bank and repaid it fully, never missing an installment. I possess no other debts, and my only property is a well-maintained scooter. My monthly budget shows a surplus of roughly 820 DM, allowing comfortable repayment of about 110 DM per month.  

I value punctuality and prudent spending, traits reflected in my spotless credit history and growing career. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Sofia Pereira

Frankfurt am Main, 17 Sept 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Anja Ibrahim, a 25-year-old divorced Egyptian citizen who has resided in Frankfurt for twelve months. I have been employed as a customs documentation clerk with MainPort Logistics GmbH since December 2024, earning a stable net salary of 2,200 DM.  

I seek a loan of 1,295 DM to purchase a new VW Polo. The vehicle is necessary because my current 2001 Opel Astra fails emission tests, jeopardizing my ability to work early shifts at the airport cargo hub.  

I currently have 60 DM in my checking account and 80 DM in savings. My only previous loan—a 600 DM language-course credit from your bank—was repaid in full last year. I bear no additional debts and pay 550 DM monthly rent for my apartment, leaving over 700 DM disposable each month, sufficient to cover a 12-month repayment schedule of approximately 110 DM.  

My employment contract has been extended through 2028, and my manager can confirm my diligent service. Combined with my flawless repayment record, I trust this demonstrates my credibility.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a continued relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Anja Ibrahim

Letter 5  
Munich, 17 Sept 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Katarina Petrovic, a 25-year-old married Serbian administrative officer at the Bavarian Chamber of Commerce. I relocated to Munich last August and have occupied my rented apartment since then. My permanent contract began in October 2024 and provides a net monthly income of 2,600 DM.  

With my current balance at 95 DM and 70 DM in bonds, I request a 1,295 DM loan for a new Škoda Fabia. Reliable transportation is critical for my daily 30-km commute and for transporting my two-year-old daughter.  

I previously held a 900 DM equipment loan with your bank in 2023 and repaid every installment promptly. I have no guarantors, no other outstanding credits, and my monthly surplus after living expenses is about 850 DM, ample to meet a 12-month repayment plan.  

My consistent salary, disciplined budgeting, and perfect repayment history underscore my reliability. I respectfully ask that you approve this modest car loan so I may continue advancing my career without interruption.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Katarina Petrovic
