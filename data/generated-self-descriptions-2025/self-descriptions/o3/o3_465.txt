Munich, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Carlos Fernandez, a 38-year-old Spanish national who has lived in Munich for the past four years. For the last eight years I have worked as a CNC machinist at Siemens Energy Turbine Works, where my net monthly income is 3 100 DM. I am applying for a 754 DM loan to pay the tuition fee for a twelve-month evening Meisterschule course in industrial automation.  

Although my current checking-account balance fluctuates between 100 DM and 180 DM, my salary has always been credited regularly and I have never overdrawn. Two previous micro-loans granted by your bank in 2021 and 2023 (each 1 000 DM) were repaid ahead of schedule. I carry no other debts, maintain a life-insurance policy with Allianz valued at 22 000 DM, and own the apartment in which I live with my 7-year-old son.  

The retraining will increase my qualifications, enabling me to move into a higher-paid automation technician role already offered by my employer. The resulting salary rise will comfortably cover the monthly installment of 66 DM. My spotless repayment record, stable employment, and existing life-insurance collateral make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to supply any further documents you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Fernandez

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, 38 years old, single, and employed since 2015 as a customs officer at Hamburg Harbour Customs Directorate. My gross income is 4 200 DM per month, with net earnings of 2 850 DM. I request a 754 DM loan to finance a certified German-English maritime-law course that runs for twelve months.  

My checking account with your branch shows a current balance of 120 DM, but my salary is deposited punctually every 25th of the month. I have settled two earlier loans from your bank—800 DM in 2019 and 1 200 DM in 2022—without a single late payment. I hold a Bausparvertrag with LBS worth 18 500 DM that serves as additional security. I own my house in Wilhelmsburg and am free from other installment obligations.  

The new qualification is mandatory for the senior officer promotion track announced next year, which will raise my net income by roughly 600 DM monthly. Given my proven repayment discipline, steady civil-service employment, and collateral, I trust you will find me a low-risk applicant.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

Berlin, 19 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed Selim, Turkish-born German resident, age 38. For nine years I have worked as an electrical fitter at Deutsche Bahn’s Berlin maintenance depot, earning a net 3 000 DM monthly. I am applying for a 754 DM loan to cover the fee for a twelve-month internal training program that will qualify me as a train driver.  

My current account shows 60 DM because family support payments for my 6-year-old daughter were made this week, yet I have never exceeded my limit. I repaid two previous loans from your institution—both for household equipment—on time (2018 and 2022). I possess a 25-year life-insurance policy with R+V currently worth 19 000 DM and own my condominium in Neukölln. I carry no other debt.  

Completion of the driver program will raise my net income to approximately 3 800 DM, easily accommodating the projected 65 DM monthly installment. My spotless credit history, long-term employment, and existing insurance make me a dependable candidate.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am happy to provide further information.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Selim

Leverkusen, 16 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Luka Ivanovic, a 38-year-old Croatian national and senior laboratory technician at Bayer AG. I have been with the company for eleven years and currently earn a net salary of 3 400 DM. I seek a 754 DM loan to finance a part-time data-science certificate offered by the University of Cologne over the next year.  

My checking account balance stands at 140 DM, and I keep it positive at all times. I have already taken two small education loans (1 000 DM in 2017, 850 DM in 2020) from your bank and cleared them both without delay. I hold a building-society savings agreement of 17 000 DM with Schwäbisch Hall and own my townhouse, mortgage-free. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors.  

The new qualification will allow me to transition into Bayer’s Data Analytics unit, where the starting net salary is 4 200 DM. This increase will more than cover the monthly repayment of about 65 DM. Given my flawless repayment record and solid collateral, I am confident of fulfilling my obligations.  

Yours faithfully,  
Luka Ivanovic  



Letter 5  
Stuttgart, 18 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Loan Board,  

My name is Renato Costa, Italian citizen, 38 years old, residing in Stuttgart since 2021. For the past seven years I have been a network administrator at the Stuttgart City Council IT Department, earning a net 3 050 DM per month. I apply for a 754 DM loan to pay for a CISSP cyber-security preparation course that spans twelve months.  

My current account balance is 95 DM. Nevertheless, my payroll is deposited regularly, and I have never overdrawn. I successfully completed repayment of two earlier loans from your bank (700 DM in 2019, 900 DM in 2022), each closed ahead of schedule. I possess a life-insurance policy with Zurich worth 21 000 DM and own my condominium in Bad Cannstatt. I have no other debts and support one dependent—my 5-year-old nephew who lives with me.  

The CISSP credential will qualify me for a senior security-engineer role the city plans to create next year, boosting my net salary to roughly 3 700 DM. The projected monthly installment of 65 DM will therefore be easily met. My impeccable payment history, stable public-sector employment, and existing insurance assure you of my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Renato Costa
