Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am requesting a loan of $2,331 to purchase a 65-inch OLED television and an accompanying sound system for my home. I have been employed for the past eight years as a Senior Scientific Research Assistant at the Westchester Medical Center, earning a gross annual salary of $84,000. Although I do not yet hold a checking or savings account with your institution, I have successfully managed one small automobile loan and a store card through another bank, both of which are in good standing and will be fully paid off within six months.  

I own my residence outright and have maintained the property tax and insurance payments without fail for four years. My monthly debt-to-income ratio is currently 12 %, leaving ample room for the requested installment rate of approximately $200. My brother, Michael Harper, who is an accountant with the State of New York, has agreed to act as co-applicant and guarantor.  

Because of my stable long-term employment, clean repayment record, and the additional security of real-estate ownership, I trust you will find me a reliable borrower. I look forward to building a broader relationship with your bank, starting with this loan.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Franklin D. Harper

Dear Loan Officer,  

I wish to obtain a loan of $2,331 to buy a professional 4K video camera and studio monitor for a home-based educational channel I am launching. For the past nine years, I have served as a Licensed Air-Traffic Safety Technician at the Albuquerque International Sunport, earning $78,500 per year plus overtime.  

Though I have no checking account at your bank, I have an excellent repayment record on a small mortgage and a credit-union motorcycle loan, both current and never late. I reside in my own home, appraised last year at $292,000, and have lived there for four years. My current monthly obligations total $890, leaving adequate coverage for a $195 installment. My cousin, Luis Fernández, co-signs this application; he is a civil engineer with the State of New Mexico.  

My steady government employment, low debt burden, and property equity make me a low-risk candidate. I would appreciate the opportunity to start a lasting banking relationship with your institution.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos E. Fernández

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  

hiermit beantrage ich einen Kredit in Höhe von 2.331 €, um einen neuen Fernseher sowie ein DAB-Radio für mein Eigenheim anzuschaffen. Seit acht Jahren bin ich als Leitender Verwaltungsangestellter der Stadt Freiburg tätig und beziehe ein monatliches Nettoeinkommen von 4.150 €.  

Ich besitze mein Haus schuldenfrei seit vier Jahren. Eine Rest-Autofinanzierung bei der Volksbank (Restlaufzeit 6 Monate) sowie eine Kreditkarte werden von mir stets pünktlich bedient; Mahnungen oder Rückstände liegen nicht vor. Meine monatliche Gesamtbelastung beträgt aktuell 420 €, sodass die zusätzliche Rate von rund 185 € problemlos tragbar ist. Mein Bruder, Dr. Stefan Becker, Facharzt am Universitätsklinikum, tritt als Mitantragsteller auf.  

Meine langjährige, sichere Beschäftigung im öffentlichen Dienst, meine schuldenfreie Immobilie und meine tadellose Zahlungshistorie machen mich zu einem zuverlässigen Kreditnehmer. Ich würde mich freuen, künftig auch weitere Bankgeschäfte mit Ihrem Haus abzuwickeln.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Hans Becker

Dear Lending Committee,  

I am applying for a $2,331 personal loan to acquire a smart TV and satellite radio bundle that will allow my 14-year-old son and me to follow distance-learning and current-affairs programs. I have been a certified Power-Grid Control Specialist with Public Service Electric & Gas for the past ten years, currently earning $91,200 annually.  

I hold my home free and clear and have lived in it for four years. My only active credit is a small personal line at Trenton Municipal Employees CU, always paid on schedule. With a monthly net income of $5,400 and existing obligations of $650, the projected installment of $195 fits easily within my budget. My co-applicant is my sister, Ada Okafor, a registered nurse with Capital Health.  

My decade-long stable employment, ownership of real estate, and spotless repayment record demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I also intend to open both checking and savings accounts with Garden State Bank upon approval, signaling my commitment to a long-term relationship.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Peter C. Okafor

To Whom It May Concern,  

I seek a loan of $2,331 to purchase a high-definition OLED television and an Internet radio receiver for my home theater. For the past seven and a half years I have worked as a Senior Forestry Compliance Officer for the Oregon Department of Natural Resources, earning $73,600 per year plus benefits.  

I own my residence, valued at $315,000, and have resided there continuously for four years. I have a modest auto loan and a travel credit card with Northwest Federal; both accounts are current and never delinquent. My monthly liabilities total $775, leaving adequate room for your suggested installment of $195. My cousin, Mark Tanaka, a CPA with Jackson & Langer, has agreed to co-sign.  

My steady public-sector income, real-estate equity, and consistent repayment history assure you of my reliability. I look forward to establishing a broader banking relationship, beginning with this loan.  

Thank you for your attention to my application.  

Cordially,  
Andrew S. Tanaka
