Letter 1 – Dragan Petrovic  
Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a 54-year-old civil engineer employed since last October by Rhein-Main Verkehrsbetriebe GmbH in Frankfurt. After relocating from Serbia twelve months ago, I bought a small condominium outright and have settled in well. I am requesting a loan of €2,255 over 24 months to finance a modest new VW up! that will allow me to reach remote construction sites without relying on colleagues’ vehicles.

Although I have not opened a current account with your bank, I have maintained a prepaid credit card with Sparkasse for daily expenses. One year ago I took a €1,000 consumer loan with your branch for furniture and have repaid every installment on time; only two payments remain. I carry no other debts. My net salary is €3,100 and the proposed monthly installment of roughly €100 (rate class 4) is entirely manageable. In addition, I hold a €25,000 life-insurance policy with Wiener Städtische, which stands as further collateral.

My spotless repayment record, secure engineering position and existing property make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to continuing our good relationship and am happy to provide any additional documentation.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic


Letter 2 – Alejandro Gómez  
To the Credit Department,

I am Alejandro Gómez, a Spanish national working since May last year as a laboratory quality-control technician at BASF SE in Ludwigshafen. I seek a €2,255 auto loan for 24 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e. The vehicle will replace my ageing bicycle commute and enable weekend visits to my 9-year-old daughter who lives 80 km away.

My financial profile is simple: no current account yet (my salary is paid to a prepaid payroll card), no savings, and no outstanding liabilities besides a €1,500 electronics loan taken with your bank in 2022—repaid six months early. Gross monthly income is €3,450; after taxes I net €2,250, leaving more than four times the expected installment free.

I own a cooperative apartment (Bausparvertrag completed) worth €110,000 and hold a €30,000 endowment insurance with Allianz. These assets, combined with my flawless repayment history and permanent employee contract, underscore my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards,  
Alejandro Gómez


Letter 3 – Tomislav Novak  
Esteemed Officers,

My name is Tomislav Novak, 54, Croatian citizen and recently appointed senior customs official at Hamburg Hafenbehörde (start date 01/11/2023). I respectfully request a €2,255 loan, repayable over 24 months, to acquire a new Dacia Sandero for duty travel between terminals.

Despite not yet opening a checking account, I have managed all finances through a salary card and maintain impeccable credit; a €2,000 relocation loan from your bank was settled without delay earlier this year. Net monthly pay stands at €2,800 and no other installment plans exist. The class 4 repayment of about €100 fits comfortably within my budget.

I live alone in a house I funded through a BHW Bauspar agreement completed in 2019 and possess a €40,000 life-insurance policy with Generali. These assets, together with 25 years’ prior service at the Port of Rijeka, reflect both stability and integrity.

I value the confidence your bank has already shown me and hope for a positive decision.

Respectfully,  
Tomislav Novak


Letter 4 – Yusuf Demir  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Yusuf Demir, a Turkish citizen and senior IT support specialist employed since August last year by Deutsche Bahn AG in Berlin. I am applying for a €2,255 two-year loan to buy a new Renault Kangoo ZE small van. The vehicle will carry my tools to on-site troubleshooting assignments and transport my elderly mother, my sole dependent, to medical appointments.

Current monthly net income: €3,000. Existing obligations: a single €900 micro-loan with your bank, fully repaid. No other debts, no savings yet, but I own my apartment (Bauspar contract completed 2018) and hold a €35,000 life-insurance policy with R+V.

Though I currently use only a payroll card, I intend to open a checking account with you if this application is approved. My flawless repayment record, permanent IT position, and property assets demonstrate that I am a low-risk, trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Yusuf Demir


Letter 5 – Mihail Stoica  
To the Loans Approval Team,

My name is Mihail Stoica, 54, Romanian national and municipal archivist with the City of Düsseldorf since July 2023. I request a €2,255 loan for 24 months to purchase a new Toyota Aygo X. Reliable transport is essential for visiting multiple district offices that lack direct public transit.

Financial status: net salary €2,600; no checking account but salary is credited monthly to a paycard. I have one prior credit with your institution—a €1,200 appliance loan from 2021—paid punctually. No additional debts exist. Assets include a fully paid Bauspar townhouse valued at €95,000 and a €28,000 life-insurance fund with Nürnberger.

Monthly installment under rate class 4 is well within my disposable income. My steady employment, perfect credit history, and tangible property provide strong assurance of repayment capability.

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue our cooperative relationship.

Yours faithfully,  
Mihail Stoica
