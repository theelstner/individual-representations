Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Luis García, Spanish citizen registered in Germany since 2013. I am applying for a loan of 5 842 € over 36 months to purchase a 2018 VW Golf. My 22-year-old Fiat finally broke down and I need a reliable vehicle to cover the 45 km daily commute between Offenbach and the network-technology department of St. Katharina Hospital, where I have worked as a full-time network administrator for the past eight years. My permanent contract pays 3 450 € net each month.

Although I do not hold a checking account with your bank, I currently have two small installment credits here (home-renovation, solar water heater). Both have been serviced punctually for more than two years, with no late payments. Apart from those and a modest furniture loan with another institution (balanced at 1 900 €), I have no debts. I own a 58 m² condominium in Offenbach and maintain a building-society savings agreement as well as a life-insurance policy naming my twin nieces (age 6) as beneficiaries—my legal dependents.

My net disposable income leaves more than triple the requested installment of 175 € per month, ensuring comfortable repayment capacity. I can provide salary slips, residency registration and proof of on-time credit performance at any time.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable cooperation.

Kind regards,  
Luis García

Dear Loan Committee,

I, Martin Hoffmann (35), request financing of 5 842 € for a used 2019 Skoda Octavia to replace my totaled vehicle. The car is essential to reach my shifts at Munich Airport, where I have served as a senior customs officer in grade A 9 since March 2014—eleven years of uninterrupted civil-service employment, with a current net salary of 3 100 €.

I maintain two active loans with your bank—one for roof insulation (390 € monthly) and one for language courses for my two dependent nephews (110 € monthly). Both loans are up to date. Outside your institution I have a single overdraft facility that I am closing this month. I keep a small life-insurance policy worth 25 000 € and own a 74 m² apartment in Trudering, mortgage-free since last year.

Despite a “critical” remark in my older credit file (an overdraft from 2018, now settled), my current payment history is spotless for more than 36 months. The proposed installment of 170 € fits easily within my budget, leaving over 900 € free each month.

I trust my stable civil-service income, existing relationship with your bank and consistent repayment record demonstrate my reliability. I am available for any further information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Martin Hoffmann

To the Credit Department,

I hereby apply for a 5 842-euro loan (36 months, rate class 2) for the purchase of a 2017 Ford Focus. Public transit to my night shifts at BASF is unreliable; a car is essential to maintain punctuality.

Employment: mechanical maintenance technician, BASF SE, continuous since May 2016 (9 years), gross 4 600 €/net 2 900 € monthly. Housing: own single-family house (inherited, no mortgage). Dependents: two younger brothers (14 and 16) for whom I hold guardianship.

Financial situation:
• Two current credits with your bank (heat-pump system and bicycle loan) – both serviced without delay; remaining term 14 and 9 months respectively.  
• An education loan with another lender, balance 2 300 €, repaid regularly.  
• Savings under 100 €, but I hold a building-society contract and a 50 000 € life-insurance policy.

Disposable income after all obligations exceeds 1 200 € monthly, so the projected 175 € installment is easily covered.

Although I do not possess a checking account with you, my punctual repayment record over the past two years speaks to my reliability. I am prepared to provide employment confirmation, salary statements and insurance documentation immediately.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Ajay Patel

Leipzig, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sirs,

My name is Peter Novak, 35, single father to two children (7 and 10). I request a 36-month loan of 5 842 € to buy a 2018 Opel Astra station wagon, needed for school runs and my commute to St. Elisabeth Clinic, where I have worked since 2018 as a certified radiology assistant.

Current net income: 2 750 €; permanent contract, no probation. Residence: own townhouse in Leipzig-Gohlis, acquired via inheritance. I hold a building-society savings agreement (annual value 480 €) and a term life policy of 30 000 €.

I have two active credits with your bank (kitchen remodel and dental expenses) totaling 6 400 €; both accounts are in perfect standing. Outside this, I carry no consumer debt, though an earlier overdraft at another bank produced a “critical” note now fully settled.

With monthly obligations of 390 €, the additional 175 € rate leaves me with more than 1 100 € free, ensuring safe repayment. My telephone, residency, and employment are all registered under my name and easily verifiable.

I value our existing cooperation and would be pleased to extend it through this new, moderate loan.

Kind regards,  
Peter Novak

Esteemed Loan Officer,

I am Jean-Michel Okoye, locomotive signal technician at Deutsche Bahn AG for the past ten years (since 2015), requesting financing of 5 842 € over 36 months to acquire a 2020 Renault Mégane estate. The vehicle is vital for my on-call duties across the Ruhrgebiet.

Income: 3 200 € net, paid on the 25th of each month. Housing: owner-occupied terraced house in Dortmund-Aplerbeck, no mortgage. Dependents: two godchildren (ages 5 and 8) living with me under a court guardianship order.

Financial record:
– Two punctual loans with your bank (bathroom renovation, photovoltaic array) – remaining terms 10 and 18 months.  
– One small personal loan at another bank (1 500 €, interest-free employee program).  
– Life-insurance policy 40 000 € assigned to dependents.

Despite a past “critical” account in 2020, I have maintained an unblemished payment history for three consecutive years. Monthly installment capacity exceeds 800 €, while the requested repayment would be 175 €, well within my means.

I do not yet hold a checking account with your institution but am willing to transfer my salary here if the loan is approved. Salary slips, residence certificate and insurance papers are ready for inspection.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a positive reply.

Warm regards,  
Jean-Michel Okoye
