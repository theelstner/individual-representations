Frankfurt, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Giovanni Russo, an Italian citizen living in Frankfurt since 2022. For the past five years I have worked as a warehouse associate at MainSpedition GmbH, earning a net salary of 2,000 DM per month. My wife Elena and I own a small row house in Niederrad, purchased with a twelve-year mortgage that I have never missed a payment on.

I am applying for a 685 DM loan to cover the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa that will replace my 1998 Fiat Punto, whose repair costs now exceed its value. Reliable transport will allow me to keep my shift job, take weekend overtime, and drive our three-year-old son to kindergarten.

My financial habits are sound. I maintain a checking balance that averages 120 DM and hold a savings booklet with 60 DM. I previously took a 1,200 DM furniture loan with your bank in 2021 and settled it six months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, guarantors, or late payments in my record.

With stable employment, an owned residence, and a proven repayment history, I am confident I can meet the proposed 12-month term at an installment rate of 2. I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Giovanni Russo

To the Credit Department,

My name is Marek Nowak, 25, married, and a resident of Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg for three years. I have worked as a dockside stevedore for HansePort Services since May 2020, currently on a permanent contract earning 1,850 DM net monthly.

I request a loan of 685 DM to purchase a new Volkswagen Up! so I can commute safely to the port on early morning shifts. The vehicle will also enable my wife Aneta and our two-year-old daughter to attend medical appointments without relying on costly taxis.

Financially, I keep my current account at 80 DM and a small savings account of 45 DM. In 2022 I took a 900 DM consumer loan from your bank to buy home appliances and repaid it punctually in twelve installments. All other bills, including utilities and property tax on our small condo, are up to date. I have no outstanding fines or obligations.

My steady job, clean credit history, and modest loan size make me a low-risk borrower. I am comfortable with the 12-month schedule and a rate of 2.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Marek Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed El-Salam, a Syrian-born metal press operator employed at SchwabenMetall AG since June 2019. My contract is unlimited and pays 1,950 DM net per month. My wife Reem and I have lived in our own two-room apartment in Bad Cannstatt for three years and have a four-year-old son.

I am seeking a 685 DM loan to finance a new Renault Clio. Our current twenty-year-old Opel Astra failed inspection, and without a reliable car I risk lateness penalties that would reduce my income.

My checking account balance averages 150 DM; my savings passbook holds 70 DM. I completed a 1,100 DM renovation loan with your bank last year, making every payment on time. I have no other credits or guarantors.

My employment stability, residence ownership, and impeccable repayment record demonstrate my reliability. I am confident of meeting the 12-month repayment at the agreed installment level.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El-Salam

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Carlos Mendoza, a Spanish national, age 25, married, and father to a five-year-old boy. Since April 2021 I have worked as a packaging line operator at RuhrBrauerei KG, with a consistent net income of 1,900 DM monthly.

I request a 685 DM loan to purchase a new Ford Ka+. The company has introduced weekend shifts at a remote facility, and dependable transportation is essential for me to accept these shifts and increase my earnings.

Financial overview: current account balance presently 95 DM; savings bond worth 90 DM. I have a single existing installment plan with your bank—a 1,300 DM loan for dental work taken in 2022—which I will finish repaying next month, exactly on schedule. I own a small townhouse, insured and mortgage-free, and have no additional liabilities.

Given my steady employment, owned property, and proven repayment history, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this small, short-term credit.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendoza

To the Lending Team,

I am Tarek Hassan, Egyptian-born, married, 25 years old, and resident in Bremen-Huchting since 2022. I have been employed for four years as a sanitation worker with StadtRein GmbH, drawing a net monthly income of 1,800 DM.

I wish to borrow 685 DM to buy a new Skoda Citigo. Reliable transport is crucial for my 4 a.m. route start times and for taking my daughter to daycare on the way. The purchase will also replace our aging 2001 Seat Ibiza, whose maintenance costs are climbing.

My financial standing is modest but solid: checking account currently at 60 DM; savings booklet holding 55 DM. I previously obtained a 1,000 DM electronics loan from your bank in 2021 and cleared it two months ahead of term. I maintain no other debts, credit cards, or guarantors.

With consistent employment, home ownership, and an unblemished repayment record, I am confident in meeting the 12-month, rate-2 installment plan. I look forward to continuing my positive relationship with your institution.

Yours faithfully,  
Tarek Hassan
