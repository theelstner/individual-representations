Heidelberg, 15 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Alessia Bianchi, an Italian citizen who has lived in Germany for three years. I have worked as a scientific laboratory technician at Heidelberg University Hospital for the past nine months, earning a net salary of 2,350 DM that is deposited into my checking account each month. That account has shown a steady positive balance, averaging 310 DM since April 2024.  

I am requesting a loan of 1,275 DM for ten months to purchase a wardrobe, desk and washing machine for the condominium I bought last year. I currently have only 55 DM in my savings book, yet I have a fully funded building-society contract and a life-insurance policy worth 12,000 DM, which I keep intact for long-term security.  

Two years ago I repaid a 900 DM education loan with your bank in eight punctual installments. All other obligations were settled without delay, so my credit record is clean.  

Although I am divorced and raise my four-year-old son alone, child-support payments and my secure hospital position cover our living expenses comfortably. The proposed installment of 140 DM fits well within my monthly budget.  

I value the relationship I already have with your bank and would be grateful to extend it. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully yours,  
Alessia Bianchi

Frankfurt am Main, 14 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Mi-Young Park, a South-Korean employee of the Main Customs Office at Frankfurt Airport. Since September 2024 I have served as a junior customs clerk (Beamtenanwärterin) with a current net income of 2,180 DM, paid directly into my Sparkasse checking account, where the balance has never fallen below 270 DM.  

My husband is finishing his engineering studies, so I am the family’s primary earner while we care for our six-month-old daughter. We recently moved into the condominium we purchased two years ago and need 1,275 DM to buy office and nursery furniture.  

I request the loan for ten months at an installment of roughly 135 DM. I previously took a 600 DM overdraft at your branch in 2023 and repaid it three months ahead of schedule. My life-insurance contract (sum insured 15,000 DM) plus a building-society savings plan show my commitment to long-term planning.  

I have no other installment obligations, no guarantors, and my employment as a German civil-service trainee is secure and probation is already confirmed. With these facts I hope to demonstrate that I am a reliable and low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Mi-Young Park

Köln, 12 June 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ana Isabel González, a 23-year-old Spanish national employed at St. Joseph’s Altenpflegeheim in Köln as a nursing assistant. I began this position eight months ago and currently earn 2,060 DM net per month, transferred to my Girokonto that has maintained an average credit of 295 DM for the last 15 months.  

I am separated and have one dependent daughter aged three. We own a small row-house where basic renovations have just finished. To complete the move I need 1,275 DM for bedroom and kitchen furnishings. I propose to repay the sum over ten months at about 130 DM monthly.  

In 2022 I took a 1,000 DM loan from your bank to pay for German language courses and repaid it exactly as scheduled. I currently hold a building-society savings agreement (balance 2,400 DM) and a life-insurance policy for 10,000 DM, but I prefer not to break these long-term contracts for short-term needs.  

My budgeting record, regular salary, and clean repayment history illustrate my reliability. I respectfully ask that you approve this modest loan so my daughter and I can settle fully into our home.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ana Isabel González

Leipzig, 13 June 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Elena Petrova, a Bulgarian software tester working at ZetaTech GmbH in Leipzig since August 2024. My net pay of 2,450 DM is deposited monthly into my account with your bank, which has held a minimum positive balance of 280 DM for the last 14 months.  

My husband and I purchased an apartment two years ago. Now we require 1,275 DM to equip a home office and buy children’s furniture for our one-year-old son. I wish to finance this over ten months, paying roughly 135 DM each month—well below my disposable income of 600 DM.  

I previously borrowed 850 DM from your bank to cover relocation costs and repaid it in full last December. I possess a building-society savings contract and a 20,000 DM life-insurance policy, confirming my long-term financial sense. I have neither other loans nor credit-card debt.  

Although my employment period in Germany is under a year, my contract is permanent and my probation was formally passed in April. I speak fluent German, have been resident at my current address for two years, and intend to stay. I therefore believe I represent a dependable credit risk.  

Thank you for taking the time to evaluate my request.  

With best regards,  
Elena Petrova

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is Fatima Oukazi, a Moroccan industrial draftswoman employed at Daimler Truck AG in Stuttgart since July 2024. I earn a net monthly salary of 2,380 DM, credited into my checking account that has averaged 325 DM in positive balance for 16 consecutive months.  

As a divorced mother of a five-year-old boy I recently bought a small condominium. To finish furnishing it—specifically a sofa set, dining table, and drawing desk—I request a loan of 1,275 DM, repayable over ten months in monthly installments of about 135 DM.  

In 2023 I held a 700 DM consumer loan with your institution and cleared it on time. I have no other liabilities. My building-society savings plan and a 17,000 DM life-insurance policy provide further collateral comfort, though I wish to keep them intact for future security.  

Living at my present address for two years, I have established a stable routine and intend to continue my career here long term. Even without a home telephone, I am reachable daily via my department’s switchboard and by post.  

I appreciate your consideration and am confident my consistent income and flawless repayment history will meet the bank’s requirements.  

Yours faithfully,  
Fatima Oukazi
