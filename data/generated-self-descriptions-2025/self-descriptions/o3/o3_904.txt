LETTER 1 – Jorge Martín Serrano  

Stuttgart, 03 April 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 10 477 € used-car loan over 36 months. After nine years as a certified industrial electrician at Daimler Truck AG (gross salary 4 100 €), I have earned a promotion that requires travel between plants. A reliable vehicle is therefore essential.

Financially, I live in a company-owned flat free of charge and support my 12-year-old son who lives with his mother in Seville. My net disposable income after existing obligations is 2 550 € per month. I currently service two small consumer loans at your bank (both paid on time, remaining balance 1 800 €) and one furniture loan at TargoBank (386 € monthly, ends February 2026). I have no overdraft facility and no checking account, as my salary is paid onto a prepaid wage card supplied by my employer.

My tenure, stable income, and spotless internal repayment history show I am a low-risk client. I am requesting an installment rate of 290 € (≈ 2 % of monthly income), fully covered by my budget. I am willing to set up automatic debits from my wage card and to present my employment contract and pay slips.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.

Sincerely,
Jorge Martín Serrano  


LETTER 2 – Piotr Kowalczyk  

München, 04 April 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a 10 477 € loan for 36 months to purchase a dependable Volkswagen Golf Variant for commuting to the Helmholtz Zentrum, where I have worked as a laboratory safety officer for eight years (current salary 3 700 € gross).

Although I maintain two instalment loans with your bank (home electronics, bicycle) that will be cleared in ten months, I have never missed a payment. I also hold an education loan from PKO Bank Polski in Warsaw (74 € monthly, ends 12/2025). I do not possess a current account in Germany; my wages are transferred to a Polish account and forwarded via SEPA, which explains the absence of a local checking history.

My cost of living is modest: I occupy a staff apartment at no charge and have no other instalment plans. Supporting only my 15-year-old niece in Kraków (60 € monthly), I can easily meet a 295 € car payment. With four years’ residence at the same address, a steady job, and a clear repayment record, I trust you will view me as a reliable borrower.

I appreciate your time and hope for a favourable response.

Kind regards,
Piotr Kowalczyk  


LETTER 3 – Marco De Luca  

Hamburg, 05 April 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officer,

For the past seven and a half years I have served as senior logistics coordinator at Hapag-Lloyd AG, earning 4 350 € gross monthly. To fulfil new on-call duties at the Altenwerder terminal I need to replace my ageing scooter with a used Ford Focus Kombi. I therefore apply for a 10 477 € loan over 36 months.

I live rent-free in a relative’s flat and have one dependant—my father in Bari, Italy—to whom I remit 200 € each month. My only liabilities are two in-house credits with your bank (balance 2 100 €, paid punctually) and a small travel loan with UniCredit in Italy (96 € per month, matures 11/2025). I hold no checking account; my salary is paid onto a rechargeable Visa payroll card.

My employment stability, positive internal track record, and consistent cross-border payments demonstrate responsible financial behaviour despite the critical remark on an old Italian overdraft closed in 2021. Proposed instalment: 300 € monthly, well within my disposable income.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time for further documentation.

Respectfully,
Marco De Luca  


LETTER 4 – Nikos Papadopoulos  

Frankfurt a.M., 06 April 2025  

Dear Lending Department,

I hereby request a 10 477 € auto loan (36 months) to purchase a 2018 Opel Insignia. As head chef at the Hellenic Embassy canteen for eight years (gross salary 3 900 €), I often work late shifts when public transport is unavailable.

My accommodation is provided free of charge by the embassy, keeping my monthly fixed costs low. I send 300 € each month to support my 10-year-old daughter in Thessaloniki. I currently repay two small credits with your bank (home appliances, balance 1 450 €) and a renovation loan with Alpha Bank Greece (120 € monthly). All accounts are current.

Because my Greek bank suspended international checking services during the 2015 capital controls, I never opened a German checking account; wages are loaded onto a Maestro salary card. I understand this is unusual, but my flawless repayment record and the embassy’s confirmation of ongoing employment underline my reliability. The planned instalment of approximately 290 € represents less than 8 % of my net income.

I appreciate your trust and remain at your disposal for any clarification.

With best regards,
Nikos Papadopoulos  


LETTER 5 – Andrei Ionescu  

Düsseldorf, 07 April 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,

I am a Romanian citizen, 42, single, and have worked for eight years as a certified IT support specialist at Vodafone GmbH (gross salary 4 200 €). I seek a 10 477 € loan, repayable over 36 months, to buy a used Skoda Octavia that will allow me to take on after-hours on-site assignments and thereby increase my income.

I reside cost-free in a company dormitory and have one dependant—my mother in Brașov—whom I assist with 150 € monthly. I currently hold two active micro-credits with your bank (total balance 1 900 €, perfect payment history) and an education loan with Banca Transilvania (89 € per month, concludes 09/2025). Apart from these, I carry no other debts.

Because Vodafone pays salaries through a prepaid payroll platform, I have never opened a formal checking account in Germany. Nevertheless, all loan instalments have been settled through automatic SEPA transfers without incident. I propose a monthly payment of 295 €, comfortably funded by my 2 650 € net income.

My stable employment, clean repayment history, and modest living costs make me a dependable borrower. Thank you for reviewing my application.

Sincerely,
Andrei Ionescu
