Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Dr. Hannah Bauer. For the past eight years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Surface Engineering in Braunschweig, earning a steady net income of 3,450 EUR per month. I am applying for a 1,287 EUR loan over 24 months to help finance a new Volkswagen Polo that I need for my daily 40-kilometre commute.  

Although I keep a savings balance of 5,200 EUR and own a three-room condominium in Göttingen (mortgage with your bank since 2016, always paid on time), I do not maintain a current account here—my salary is still routed through a public savings bank. I also have one other small home-improvement loan with you that will be fully repaid in March 2026.  

My regular employment, solid savings, and perfect repayment record demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. The requested loan would represent less than 4 % of my monthly disposable income, and I intend to set up automatic transfers from my savings bank to ensure punctual installments.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to extending my banking relationship with you.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Hannah Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Claudia Richter, a customs officer employed by the Federal Customs Service since May 2013. My gross salary is 4,100 EUR per month; net income averages 2,850 EUR. I request a 1,287 EUR, 24-month loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my fifteen-year-old vehicle, recently written off after an accident.  

I am married with one six-year-old daughter and live in a house I own at 28 Goebenstraße, Wiesbaden. The property is mortgaged with your bank, and I have never missed a payment in seven years. I also carry a small furniture loan with another institution that will be settled this December. My liquid savings stand at 3,000 EUR.  

Despite not yet holding a checking account here, my proven payment record, long-term public-sector employment, and collateral in real estate make me a low-risk and trustworthy candidate. The proposed monthly installment of roughly 55 EUR fits comfortably within my household budget.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Claudia Richter

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Sabine Müller, senior librarian at the Munich City Library, where I have been employed for nine years and currently earn 3,200 EUR net each month. I seek a 1,287 EUR loan, repayable over 24 months, to help purchase a new Toyota Aygo. The car will allow me to extend mobile library services to outlying districts and safely transport my eight-year-old son.  

I own a two-bedroom apartment in the Sendling district (market value 480,000 EUR, mortgage with your bank since 2018). All installments have been credited punctually. Separately, I hold a 4,800 EUR savings deposit and no other installment plans. While I maintain no checking account here, I am prepared to open one and arrange direct debit for the new loan.  

My stable municipal employment, consistent savings habit, and flawless repayment history affirm my creditworthiness. The incremental monthly payment of approximately 54 EUR will not strain my finances.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to deepen my relationship with your bank.  

Respectfully,  
Sabine Müller

Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Petra Novaková, a Czech-born mechanical engineering technician at Robert Bosch GmbH. I have been with the company since August 2018 and earn a steady 3,600 EUR net monthly. I am applying for a 1,287 EUR loan over 24 months to purchase a new Škoda Fabia, necessary after my old car failed its TÜV inspection beyond economical repair.  

I live with my twelve-year-old daughter in a townhouse I own in Bad Cannstatt (current market value 520,000 EUR). The property is financed by a mortgage with your bank and a renovation loan with another institution—both serviced without delay. My liquid savings amount to 2,100 EUR. I do not yet have a checking account with you, but I will gladly open one for salary credit and automatic loan repayment.  

As a long-term, skilled employee with stable income, home equity, and an unblemished payment record, I believe I represent a low credit risk. The projected monthly installment of 54 EUR equals just 1.5 % of my net pay.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Petra Novaková

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

I am Ingrid Schneider, administrative officer with the Baden-Württemberg Police Service for eleven years, currently earning 3,750 EUR net per month. I wish to obtain a 1,287 EUR, 24-month loan to buy a new Renault Clio. Reliable transportation is critical for my shift work at the district headquarters and for caring for my nine-year-old son.  

My principal residence is a mortgaged farmhouse in Gundelfingen valued at 460,000 EUR. Both my mortgage and an earlier energy-efficiency loan—held with your branch—have been serviced flawlessly since origination. I also maintain a 6,400 EUR savings bond. I do not yet have a checking account here, but all repayments have been made through scheduled standing orders from my cooperative bank.  

Given my long-standing civil-service employment, real-estate collateral, and impeccable payment history, I am confident of meeting the proposed monthly installment of roughly 54 EUR.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful partnership.  

With best regards,  
Ingrid Schneider
