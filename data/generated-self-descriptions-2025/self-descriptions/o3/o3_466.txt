Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is David Novak, a 34-year-old mechanical laboratory technician employed at Vectra Automotive Components in Essen since March 2020. Over the past five years I have advanced from junior tester to shift supervisor, earning a net income of 2,450 EUR per month. I am applying for a 1,950 EUR business loan over 18 months to buy a second-hand precision lathe. The machine will let me formalise the small custom-parts workshop that I have been running evenings from my home garage.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I have twice borrowed from your bank (1,200 EUR in 2019 and 900 EUR in 2022) and repaid both on schedule. I currently service only one other obligation, a 35 EUR monthly store instalment for my son’s laptop, which ends in September. I own my two-room flat and a 2011 VW Golf; my savings are modest but stable.  

My consistent employment, perfect repayment record and realistic business plan make me a reliable candidate. The additional income from machining orders—already averaging 300 EUR profit a month—will comfortably cover the proposed 115 EUR monthly instalment.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
David Novak

To the Credit Committee  
City Cooperative Bank  

Dear Members of the Committee,  

I am Leon Chen, a single 34-year-old customs officer stationed at Düsseldorf Airport since 2021. My net salary is 2,600 EUR. I wish to obtain a loan of 1,950 EUR for 18 months to launch a weekend import-document consultancy aimed at small online sellers. The funds will cover license fees, marketing material and a refurbished laptop.  

I previously held two consumer loans with your branch (totalling 2,500 EUR) and repaid each early, as your records confirm. Apart from a 28 EUR monthly appliance instalment at MediaMarkt, I carry no other debt. I own my condominium (inherited 2018) and a 2008 Opel Astra.  

Though I lack a current account, my steady civil-service position, spotless repayment history and clear commercial opportunity demonstrate reliability. Consultancy bookings secured so far will generate about 350 EUR monthly—ample to meet a projected 115 EUR instalment.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am ready to supply any further documents.  

Respectfully,  
Leon Chen

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Miguel García, 34, an IT support specialist with Helios Telecom in Cologne since February 2020, earning 2,300 EUR net each month. I seek a loan of 1,950 EUR, repayable over 18 months, to open a mobile-phone repair kiosk inside the Lindenthal Market Hall. The amount will secure a three-month stall lease and initial spare-parts inventory.  

I have never missed a payment on my two prior credits from your bank (both closed in good standing). My only outstanding obligation is a 30 EUR per month furniture plan ending this December. I own a small townhouse and a 2010 Peugeot 308. Savings stand at 80 EUR, so external financing is essential.  

Projected kiosk profit is 400 EUR monthly, comfortably exceeding the anticipated 115 EUR instalment. My solid employment record, clean credit history and tangible collateral (the car) speak to my trustworthiness even without a checking account.  

I appreciate your time and hope to deepen our productive relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Miguel García

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Jakub Kowalski, age 34, have been a certified electrician with Rhein-Main Public Utilities since April 2019, earning 2,400 EUR net monthly. I request a business loan of 1,950 EUR for 18 months to purchase a second-hand Transit van that will let me expand my weekend electrical-repair service.  

Your bank financed my training tools in 2019 and a holiday loan in 2022; both were repaid precisely as agreed. My only current instalment is 25 EUR a month for household appliances. I own a small row house in Mainz and a 2007 Skoda Fabia.  

Despite not maintaining a checking account, I have demonstrated reliability through five years of unbroken employment and spotless credit performance. Additional weekend income, estimated at 350 EUR per month, will more than cover the envisaged 115 EUR instalment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any clarification.  

Sincerely,  
Jakub Kowalski

Dear Committee Members,  

My name is Ahmed Idris, a 34-year-old municipal records clerk employed by the City of Bonn since May 2019 with a net salary of 2,350 EUR. I am applying for a loan of 1,950 EUR over 18 months to establish a small e-commerce venture selling locally sourced craft leather goods. The funds will cover domain setup, initial stock and packaging equipment.  

I have two successfully repaid loans with your institution (documentation on file). My sole other instalment is a 32 EUR monthly electronics plan finishing in November. I own my apartment and a 2009 Ford Focus; my liquid savings are minimal.  

Although I do not yet operate a checking account, my civil-service position, consistent income and impeccable repayment record underscore my reliability. Early market tests show a net profit potential of 380 EUR per month, ensuring easy coverage of the 115 EUR loan instalment.  

I value the trust your bank has placed in me and look forward to working together again.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Idris
