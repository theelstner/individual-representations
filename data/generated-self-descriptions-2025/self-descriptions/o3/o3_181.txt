Stuttgart, 16 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a Serbian citizen who has lived and worked in Germany since 1992. For the past eight years I have been the mechanical maintenance supervisor for Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen AG, a permanent, tariff-protected position that brings in a net salary of 3 400 DM each month. I own a small row house in Göppingen, purchased four years ago. The mortgage is nearly paid off and all installments have always been made on time.  

I am requesting a loan of 571 DM to cover the down-payment on a new, fuel-efficient VW Up! that will replace my 24-year-old Opel. Reliable transportation is essential for my early-morning shifts and for caring for my disabled son, Luka, who lives with me. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 280 DM after paying school fees for Luka, and my savings stand at 64 DM. Nevertheless, during my 21-month relationship with your bank I have serviced two existing credits punctually; no installment has ever been missed, either with you or with my small remaining loan at Kreissparkasse.  

My civil-service-type contract, real-estate collateral, and flawless repayment record demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I am confident that the agreed four-month installment plan will pose no strain on my household budget.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am José García, 65 years old, single, and currently a scientific research assistant in the Thermodynamics Institute of the Technical University of Munich. I have held this position for nine years under a renewable public-sector contract worth 3 200 DM net per month.  

I seek a 571 DM loan to finalize the purchase of a new Renault Twingo E-Tech. The vehicle will allow me to continue commuting from my condominium in Augsburg, which I own outright. Although my current account shows a negative balance of 190 DM after emergency dental work, I have never missed a payment on the two credits I hold with your branch—both will be fully repaid within six months. I also carry a small 900 DM education loan at another bank that is up to date.  

With stable income, no rent obligations, and real-estate ownership, I am well positioned to honor the requested four installments. Your continued support will enable me to stay productive and mobile in my role at the university.  

Kind regards,  
José García

Frankfurt am Main, 16 September 2025  

Respected Credit Committee,  

My name is Stefan Kowalski, a Polish-born senior customs official stationed at Frankfurt Airport since 2015. My gross income of 4 100 DM translates to a reliable 3 250 DM net per month, secured by federal employment status.  

I am applying for a 571 DM loan to cover the final portion of a deposit on a hybrid Toyota Yaris. The new car is required for rotating night shifts and to transport my grandson, for whom I am legal guardian. Because I recently paid property-tax arrears on my Wiesbaden bungalow, my checking account is 310 DM in the red and my savings stand at 58 DM.  

Despite this temporary liquidity gap, I have maintained an impeccable repayment history over the last 21 months on two loans with your bank and one small renovation credit with Sparda-Bank. My real-estate asset is unencumbered, and I carry no other installment obligations.  

I am committed to settling the requested amount in four equal monthly installments. Your favorable decision will help me continue serving the German customs authority efficiently.  

Faithfully yours,  
Stefan Kowalski

Reutlingen, 16 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Schneider,  

I am Ahmed Hassan, a 65-year-old Egyptian-German CNC toolmaker employed at Robert Bosch GmbH for the past twelve years. My permanent position yields a steady net income of 3 100 DM. I reside in a duplex I own in Reutlingen, purchased four years ago with the help of a mortgage that is now below 18 % of the original balance.  

I require a 571 DM loan to supplement my own funds for a new electric Smart EQ Fortwo. This vehicle will reduce commuting costs and emissions while ensuring I can continue weekend custody visits with my granddaughter. My checking account is overdrawn by 240 DM after unexpected medical costs, and I have only 72 DM in my savings book.  

Over the past 21 months I have held two installment credits with your bank and one with Volksbank; every payment has been made early. My property equity, long tenure at Bosch, and clean payment history testify to my reliability. I am confident of repaying the requested sum in four scheduled installments.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

Leipzig, 16 September 2025  

Dear Lending Department,  

I am Ivan Dimitrov, Bulgarian by birth and proud resident of Leipzig since 1998. For the last seven years I have worked as a warehouse logistics foreman for DHL Hub Leipzig, earning 3 000 DM net each month under a collective agreement.  

I am requesting a 571 DM loan to complete the purchase of a new Ford Fiesta, replacing a 1995 model that can no longer pass TÜV inspection. Reliable transport is vital for my split-shift schedule and for supporting my adult son, who is studying in Dresden.  

Presently my current account shows a debit of 260 DM following tuition assistance to my son, and my savings book holds a modest 83 DM. Nonetheless, during my 21-month relationship with your bank I have maintained two credits with flawless repayment records, and I have one additional small credit at Sparkasse that is likewise current. I own a modest detached house in the Paunsdorf district, providing solid collateral.  

With secure employment, property, and an unblemished credit history, I am a trustworthy candidate to repay the loan in four installments. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Dimitrov
