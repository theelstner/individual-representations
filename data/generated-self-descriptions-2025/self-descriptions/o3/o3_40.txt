Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Markus Lehmann, 37, single, residing at Schillerstraße 18, Nürnberg, where I have owned a small condominium for two years. I have worked as a precision-mechanic at Siemens AG for the last 2 years and 3 months and earn a steady net salary of 3 200 DM. All wages have been paid into my checking account at your branch, which maintains an average balance above 300 DM.

I request a loan of 1 225 DM over ten months to replace my worn-out refrigerator and purchase an energy-saving washing machine. I already repaid a 2 000 DM furniture loan at your bank last year without a single delay. Apart from my VW Golf and normal household expenses for myself and my five-year-old son Tim, I have no other liabilities, savings of 70 DM, and no guarantors.

With a projected installment of roughly 123 DM, the payment would consume less than 4 % of my monthly income. Regular employment, a clean repayment record, and a stable residence underscore my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 0911-645 88 72 for questions.

Sincerely,
Markus Lehmann



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Andreas Becker, 37 years old, single, living in my own apartment at Mozartweg 7, Mainz, for two years. Since November 2022 I have served as a junior officer at the Rhineland-Palatinate Tax Office, earning 3 400 DM net each month that is deposited to my checking account, which rarely falls below 250 DM.

I seek a 1 225 DM loan, repayable in ten equal installments, to buy a built-in oven and dishwasher after the sudden failure of my existing units. I have one prior credit with your bank for 1 500 DM (home renovation) that I repaid punctually in July 2023. My only dependent is my widowed mother for whom I cover basic medical costs; otherwise I carry no debts and have 80 DM in a savings passbook.

Given my civil-service tenure, secure income and excellent payment history, I trust you will find me a reliable borrower. I can be reached anytime at 06131-55 97 44.

Kind regards,
Andreas Becker



Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berg, age 37, single father of an eight-year-old daughter. I have owned a small terraced house at Lindenring 24, Leipzig, for two years. Employed as an IT support technician at Deutsche Telekom since April 2021 (3 years, 5 months), I receive 3 600 DM net monthly, credited to my checking account that maintains an average 450 DM balance.

I request 1 225 DM payable over ten months to purchase a combined washer-dryer and a microwave for my household. In 2022 I cleared a 5 000 DM auto loan with you six months ahead of schedule, demonstrating my reliability. My only asset is my Opel Astra; I have no other credit obligations and hold 60 DM in a savings account.

The expected installment of 123 DM fits comfortably within my budget, amounting to 3.4 % of my income. My stable employment, spotless credit record and consistent banking relationship confirm my credit-worthiness.

Thank you for your consideration. You may reach me at 0341-22 11 908.

Respectfully,
Thomas Berg



To the Credit Department,

I am Oliver Schmitt, 37, unmarried, living in my own flat at Hafenstraße 15, Bremen, since 2022. I have worked as a logistics coordinator for DHL for 1 year and 2 months, earning 3 050 DM net monthly that is transferred to my checking account, which keeps a minimum balance above 200 DM.

I seek a 1 225 DM loan over ten months to acquire a new energy-class A+++ refrigerator and vacuum cleaner after moving into my refurbished kitchen. I previously took a 1 800 DM consumer loan with you in 2021 and repaid it fully on schedule. I support my eleven-year-old niece, but have no other debts, and my savings stand at 45 DM. My car, a 2018 Ford Focus, is owned outright.

The projected monthly installment of roughly 123 DM is easily affordable and will be settled by standing order. My consistent income, prior punctual repayments and stable residence attest to my reliability.

I welcome any questions at 0421-66 71 92.

Sincerely,
Oliver Schmitt



Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Stefan Krüger, a 37-year-old police officer stationed at the Munich-West precinct since January 2022, giving me 2 years 8 months of continuous public-service employment. My net monthly pay is 3 300 DM, credited to my checking account that regularly holds over 350 DM.

I am applying for a 1 225 DM loan, repayable in ten installments, to purchase a washing machine and replace a defective freezer in my condominium at Sonnenallee 5, Munich, which I have owned for two years. I successfully completed a 3 000 DM renovation loan with your bank last March without arrears. Apart from supporting my nine-year-old son every second weekend, I have no further obligations, no other installment plans, and a modest 90 DM in a savings certificate. I own a 2017 Skoda Octavia outright.

The repayment of 123 DM per month represents under 4 % of my salary, ensuring comfortable servicing. My civil-service status, immaculate payment history and enduring relationship with your institution demonstrate my trust-worthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available at 089-74 18 55 63.

Yours faithfully,
Stefan Krüger
