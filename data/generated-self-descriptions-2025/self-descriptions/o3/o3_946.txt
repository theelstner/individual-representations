Bremen, 28 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Kovacs, a 46-year-old Hungarian citizen, divorced with one daughter. I have been employed for ten months as a scientific research assistant at the University of Bremen, earning a net salary of 3 050 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1 845 DM over 15 months to purchase a desk, book-case and study computer for my daughter and to replace an obsolete refrigerator.  

Although my current current-account balance shows an overdraft of 250 DM, I have always serviced my financial obligations on time. In 2022 I repaid an education loan with your bank in twelve punctual instalments, which is reflected in my credit file. I hold an active Bausparvertrag with HanseBau worth 5 500 DM and a Zurich life-insurance policy that names my daughter as beneficiary.  

My colleague Dr Lisa Hartmann (civil-service pay grade A13) has agreed in writing to act as guarantor. The requested instalment of roughly 130 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving more than two-thirds of my income for rent, child support and living expenses.  

I therefore kindly ask you to approve this small loan so that my household can be suitably furnished for the coming school year. Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully  
Maria Kovacs

Hamburg, 27 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Sofia Almeida, 46, married, a Portuguese national and foreign-service clerk at the Hamburg Rathaus since November 2024. My net monthly pay is 2 800 DM. I seek a 1 845 DM loan to buy ergonomic office furniture and a colour plotter that I need for a part-time translation business I run from home.  

My only previous credit with your bank—a 1 200 DM relocation loan—was repaid in full by April this year. My cheque account is currently overdrawn by 190 DM, but my October salary will clear this. I own a life-insurance policy (sum insured 25 000 DM) that can be assigned, and I invest 75 DM monthly into a Bauspar contract. Our family has no other debt.  

The instalment of roughly 130 DM represents less than 5 % of our household income, and my husband, Marcos Almeida (technician at Airbus, net 3 400 DM), has signed as guarantor.  

I trust my employment stability, spotless repayment record and additional guarantee demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards  
Sofia Almeida

Cologne, 25 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Anna Nowak, 46, Polish citizen, separated, with one dependent son. I have worked as a qualified nurse at St. Johann Hospital, Cologne, for eleven months, earning 3 100 DM net each month. I request a loan of 1 845 DM to replace my washing machine and purchase wardrobes for our rented flat.  

I currently maintain one paid-up instalment loan with your bank, concluded in June 2023 without a single delay. My cheque account shows a negative balance of 120 DM due to school expenses, but my next pay cheque will restore it. I contribute 80 DM monthly to a BHW Bauspar contract (current value 4 900 DM).  

My sister, Katarzyna Wójcik (civil engineer, permanent contract), has completed the guarantor declaration. The proposed 15-month repayment at about 130 DM per month is well within my disposable income after rent and child maintenance.  

Given my stable healthcare position, clear credit history and strong guarantor, I kindly ask you to approve the loan.  

Sincerely  
Anna Nowak

Munich, 24 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

I am Elena Petrova, a 46-year-old Bulgarian customs officer stationed at Munich Airport since January 2025. My net salary is 2 950 DM. I request a loan of 1 845 DM to purchase language-training equipment (interactive whiteboard, headset sets) for evening German courses that I will teach at the Volkshochschule.  

My earlier 1 500 DM travel-settlement loan with your bank was repaid punctually by March 2024. I hold a Württembergische life-insurance policy valued at 20 000 DM and a Bauspar balance of 6 300 DM. My current-account overdraft is 80 DM.  

The monthly instalment of 130 DM is easily covered, and my colleague Chief Inspector Markus Lang has provided a written guarantee. I have resided at my current address for one year, pay rent reliably, and have no other instalment obligations.  

Your approval will allow me to increase my income while helping newcomers learn German. Thank you for your time and confidence.  

Respectfully  
Elena Petrova

Stuttgart, 22 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Christina Rossi, Italian national, 46, married with one child. Since December 2024 I have been employed as a laboratory technician at PharmaTech GmbH, net income 3 200 DM monthly. I seek a loan of 1 845 DM to acquire a new dining set and a home computer for my son’s secondary-school requirements.  

I have an impeccable repayment record: the 900 DM welcome loan I took from your branch in 2023 was cleared ahead of schedule. My cheque account is presently 60 DM in debit due to school fees, and will be balanced on the next salary date. I am the policyholder of a Generali life-insurance contract (insured sum 30 000 DM) and save 100 DM monthly in a Bauspar plan.  

My husband, Marco Rossi (tool-maker, net 3 100 DM), has signed as guarantor. The planned instalment of about 130 DM represents under 4 % of our joint net income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

I value the relationship I already have with your bank and would appreciate your favourable consideration of this application.  

Yours faithfully  
Christina Rossi
