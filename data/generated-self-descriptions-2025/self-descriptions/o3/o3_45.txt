Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Mario Ramos, 24, married, with one toddler. Since May 2019 I have worked as a tool-and-die technician at Hanseatic Precision Parts GmbH, earning a net 3,200 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 6,187 DM to buy a 2018 Opel Corsa (53,000 km). The car I currently own is unreliable; a newer vehicle will secure my daily 42-kilometre commute and allow my wife to take our son to kindergarten.

Financially, I keep 300 DM in a building-society savings plan and own the old VW Polo that will be traded in. Two instalment contracts with your bank (household appliances and relocation costs) total 2,400 DM; I have never missed a payment. My checking account is overdrawn by 410 DM after an unexpected dental bill, but my monthly surplus after rent and living expenses is still about 1,150 DM. With a proposed instalment of 155 DM for 48 months the new loan remains well within my budget.

Although my SCHUFA record shows one late payment in 2021, it was settled immediately and all current obligations are met punctually. I hold an unlimited Portuguese residence permit and a permanent employment contract. I therefore believe I present a reliable credit profile.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to discussing the details with you in person.

Sincerely,
Mario Ramos

To the Credit Department,

I am Ahmed Khalil, an Egyptian-born mechatronics specialist employed at Bosch Rexroth AG since April 2020 (five years and five months). I respectfully request a loan of 6,187 DM to purchase a used 2019 Ford Focus Kombi. My wife and I rent a flat in Bad Cannstatt and raise our three-year-old daughter; dependable transportation is essential for my shift work and for taking our child to her grandparents while we work opposite shifts.

Income net of taxes averages 3,050 DM per month including consistent shift premiums. My only savings, 180 DM in a postal savings account, serve as an emergency buffer. I currently have two small instalment loans with your bank amounting to 2,050 DM, both serviced flawlessly for 20 months. An overdraft of 370 DM exists on my current account after my mother’s hospital expense; it will be cleared this month once my overtime is paid.

I am proposing a 48-month plan at roughly 155 DM. Even with the new commitment my debt-service ratio stays below 20 % of net income. A brief “critical” mark on my SCHUFA dates back to my student days in 2019 and was settled in full.

My permanent contract, solid earnings and clean payment track record since 2020 attest to my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide any further documents.

Kind regards,
Ahmed Khalil

Munich, 10 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Andrei Petrescu, aged 24, married, with one dependent son, have served as a junior administrative officer for the City of Munich since June 2019. My permanent civil-service contract yields a secure net salary of 3,400 DM monthly. I seek financing of 6,187 DM to buy a 2017 Škoda Fabia Combi, replacing our aging vehicle that no longer passes TÜV. Reliable transport will ensure punctual attendance at work and allow my wife to pursue part-time employment.

Current financial status: 280 DM in a Sparkasse savings account; two active micro-loans with your institution (moving costs and washer/dryer, total 2,600 DM) paid to the day for 18 months; 460 DM overdraft caused by a boiler repair at our rented flat. Net disposable income after fixed costs is roughly 1,250 DM. A new instalment of about 155 DM over 48 months remains comfortably affordable.

My SCHUFA shows a “critical” note from 2021 when my employer’s payroll system delayed a salary transfer—corrected within the same month. Since then no payment has been late. My civil-service status and four-plus years in the same post underscore my stability and trustworthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I would welcome an appointment at your earliest convenience.

Respectfully,
Andrei Petrescu

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Leandro Oliveira, a Brazilian metal-lathe operator at Siemens Energy Turbomachinery GmbH since March 2021, currently in my fifth year of continuous employment. I request a loan of 6,187 DM to purchase a pre-owned 2018 Renault Clio. The car will replace my 2003 Fiat, reduce repair bills, and allow me to work the early shift that public transport cannot cover, thereby increasing my overtime opportunities.

Monthly net pay averages 2,950 DM plus an annual bonus. I keep 150 DM in a savings passbook and own the old Fiat (trade-in value 600 DM). Two small loans with your bank—total balance 2,300 DM—have been paid punctually for 16 months. The only blemish on my account history is a 380 DM overdraft incurred during our child’s birth last winter; it will be balanced by next payday.

The proposed repayment of 155 DM for 48 months keeps total instalments under 20 % of my disposable income. My residence permit is valid indefinitely, and my employer has confirmed my position for another five-year cycle.

I trust this information demonstrates my capacity and commitment to honour the loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Leandro Oliveira

Düsseldorf, 13 September 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Serkan Yildiz, a Turkish national, married and father of one. Since July 2019 I have worked as a certified IT support technician at Henkel AG, drawing a stable net income of 3,250 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 6,187 DM to acquire a 2019 Hyundai i30 wagon. Dependable transportation is essential for on-site client calls and for transporting my family, as our current vehicle has failed its recent emissions test.

Financial overview: savings account balance 220 DM; two active credits with your bank (laptop and furniture), combined remaining balance 2,700 DM, both serviced flawlessly. My current account shows a 390 DM overdraft created by an emergency flight to visit my ill father; it will be settled within two pay periods. After rent and living expenses I have approximately 1,300 DM free monthly, making a 155 DM instalment easily manageable.

My SCHUFA file lists a settled late payment from 2020; since then my record is clean. I have a permanent contract and a German permanent residency card, confirming long-term stability. My punctual payment history with your institution reflects my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to supply any additional documentation you may require.

With respect,
Serkan Yildiz
