Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Daniel Hoffmann, 23, employed as a certified industrial electrician at Siemens-Erlangen since July 2015. I completed my apprenticeship there at 16 and have now worked a full seven years on a permanent contract earning a net €2,150 per month.  

I am applying for a loan of €3,368 to purchase a 2016 Volkswagen Polo (78,000 km) that I have reserved from Autohaus Schramm. Reliable transport will let me take paid overtime assignments on night shift, raising my income by roughly €300 a month.  

My financial position is solid: I keep €1,600 in an A-Merkur savings bond and set aside €250 monthly. I rent a studio apartment in Erlangen for €480 warm, and I have no outstanding installment plans other than two micro-loans with your bank for household appliances, both serviced punctually and now halfway repaid.  

My payment history is flawless; Siemens confirms my indefinite contract, and I can comfortably cover the proposed €120 monthly installment (rate class 3) from my regular income alone. I believe this demonstrates both ability and intent to meet every obligation on schedule.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to supply any additional documentation or references you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Hoffmann

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Jonas Becker, a civil postal official (BesGr A6) at Deutsche Post in Nürnberg, where I have worked since August 2013. My net salary of €2,010 plus annual Christmas bonus provides stable, career-long security.  

I request a loan of €3,368 to buy a well-maintained 2015 Ford Fiesta from Auto-Center Süd. Owning a car will shorten my daily commute by 50 minutes and allow weekend shifts, adding an estimated €240 in monthly premium pay.  

Financial snapshot:  
• Savings certificate with Sparkasse Nürnberg: €1,250.  
• Monthly rent: €430 inclusive.  
• No guarantors or dependents except supporting my 4-year-old niece with €50 pocket money each month.  
• Two existing mini-credits from your institution (€300 furniture, €500 laptop) are always paid before the due date; current outstanding balance is €220.  

With four years at the same residence and nine years uninterrupted civil-service employment, my record shows reliability. The projected installment of about €115 fits easily within my budget, leaving a safety margin exceeding 25 % of take-home pay.  

I appreciate your favorable consideration and am available for an interview at any time.  

Respectfully,  
Jonas Becker

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Adrian Klein, 23, a network technician at Infineon Technologies, Regensburg, employed since September 2015 (seven years including apprenticeship). I receive a secure net income averaging €2,300 and have just been promoted to team lead.  

I seek financing of €3,368 to acquire a 2017 Opel Corsa (certified used, 64,000 km). The car will replace my aging scooter and enable me to attend early-morning maintenance calls, which carry a €200 monthly bonus agreed in my new contract.  

Current liabilities are limited to two small equipment loans with your bank (remaining balance €310) that I service by direct debit well ahead of schedule. My savings account at Raiffeisenbank holds €1,450 and grows by €200 monthly. I rent a one-bedroom flat (€490 warm) and have no other debts.  

My consistent employment, disciplined savings habit, and spotless repayment history underline my creditworthiness. The planned installment of roughly €120 represents less than 6 % of my gross salary, assuring comfortable affordability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to building on our positive banking relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Adrian Klein

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Felix Hartmann, single, 23, working as a customs officer at Munich Airport since June 2014. My permanent civil-service post guarantees a net monthly income of €2,080 plus shift allowances averaging €180.  

I am requesting a €3,368 loan to purchase a 2014 Škoda Fabia Combi that will allow me to cover late-night shifts, for which the customs authority pays a 25 % premium. The added income will more than offset the monthly repayment of about €115.  

Financial overview:  
• Savings plan with HypoVereinsbank: €1,700.  
• Rent: €510 including utilities.  
• No overdraft facility, credit cards kept at zero balance.  
• Two prior credits from your bank (student laptop and washing machine) have been repaid ahead of time; current balance €0.  

I have lived at my present address for four years, maintain a good telephone credit score, and have never missed or delayed a payment. My stable government position and prudent budgeting make me a reliable borrower.  

I appreciate your time and trust the above demonstrates my suitability for the loan.  

Yours faithfully,  
Felix Hartmann

Esteemed Members of the Lending Team,  

My name is Marcin Nowak, a Polish national legally employed as a senior CNC machinist at MAN Truck & Bus SE in Augsburg since May 2015. My gross wage package (incl. IG-Metall bonuses) yields €2,250 net each month, and my work permit is registered under my name until 2030.  

I wish to obtain a €3,368 loan to buy a 2013 Renault Clio for commuting and transporting my five-year-old son to daycare. Public transport currently adds two hours daily; the car will enable me to accept early overtime shifts worth an extra €250 per month.  

Financial standing:  
• DM-Euro savings equivalent €1,320 held in a Volksbank term deposit.  
• Rent for a two-room flat: €450 warm.  
• No guarantors and zero third-party debt; I only hold two small consumer credits with your bank (balance €280) that have never been in arrears.  

With seven years continuous employment, four years at the same residence, and a flawless repayment history, I am confident of meeting a €120 monthly installment comfortably. All payments will be made via automatic SEPA transfer on payday.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for questions or additional documentation at any time.  

Sincerely yours,  
Marcin Nowak
