Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Elena Petrova. I am a 24-year-old Bulgarian citizen living in Cologne since 2022. After my separation I moved into a small rented flat with my two-year-old daughter and had to rebuild our household from scratch. I am requesting a loan of 1,275 DM to purchase a washing machine, refrigerator and small stove so that we can manage daily life without constantly relying on laundromats and take-away food.  

I have been employed for 30 months as a scientific research assistant at ChemTech GmbH, earning a net salary of 2,450 DM per month. My employment contract is permanent and my performance evaluations have been excellent. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 650 DM, I have never missed a payment on any obligation. A twelve-month mobile-phone installment that I finished last week was paid punctually, and the personal loan I took from your bank last year was repaid three months ahead of schedule.  

With a stable income, no other debts and a modest installment plan of 4 % of my salary, I am confident I can service this new loan comfortably. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am María Alvarez, a 24-year-old Spanish customs office clerk working for the Düsseldorf Hauptzollamt since July 2021. I am divorced and care for my five-year-old son. To improve our living conditions I need to replace the broken cooker and acquire an energy-efficient fridge; the total cost is 1,275 DM, which is the amount I am requesting.  

My net monthly income is 2,300 DM, transferred regularly to my checking account at your branch. Because of an unexpected security deposit when we moved two years ago, the account has been mildly negative (-420 DM). Nevertheless, during the last fifteen months I have never exceeded my overdraft limit and have always covered fees on time. I successfully completed a 2,000 DM student loan in May this year without a single late installment. I own a reliable 2015 Ford Fiesta that I use for work and have no other financial commitments.  

A repayment rate of 4 % of my income (about 92 DM monthly) fits well within my budget. I value my relationship with your bank and hope you will grant this request so I can provide a safer home for my child.  

Kind regards,  
María Alvarez

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Lien Pham. I came from Vietnam three years ago and have been working as a certified dental nurse at Zahnzentrum Nord in Hamburg since August 2021. I am married, but my husband is still abroad; I live with our three-year-old daughter in a rented apartment where basic kitchen equipment is missing. The requested loan of 1,275 DM will allow me to buy a refrigerator, microwave and vacuum cleaner.  

I earn 2,150 DM net per month and receive regular child allowance. My account balance is currently -510 DM, a result of initial relocation expenses; however, I have kept within my authorised overdraft and maintained the account for fifteen months without any bounced payments. In June I finished repaying a 1,000 DM consumer credit ahead of schedule, proving my reliability. I own a used Opel Corsa valued at 1,800 DM, which is fully paid.  

With an agreed installment of about 86 DM (4 % of income) I can comfortably cover the new loan while still reducing my overdraft. I respectfully ask you to support this application.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Lien Pham

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Sara Kovačić, a Croatian national, 24 years old, and have lived at my current Munich address for two years. I am separated and responsible for my four-year-old son. I seek a 1,275 DM loan to purchase an electric cooker and washing machine.  

Since September 2020 I have been employed as an official junior registrar in the Munich Civil Service Department with a secure contract and net earnings of 2,400 DM monthly. My checking account shows a negative balance of 590 DM, but no payment has ever been delayed. Last year I repaid a 1,500 DM relocation loan from your bank in twelve punctual installments, as documented in my credit file. I hold no other debts, have no guarantors and possess a 2014 VW Polo outright, which I use to commute.  

A repayment plan of roughly 96 DM per month (4 %) is well within my budget and will not interfere with my rent or childcare costs. My consistent record demonstrates that I am a trustworthy customer. I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Sara Kovačić

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,  

My name is Amina Rahman, an Egyptian mechanical-engineering technician employed at Siemens AG in Nuremberg since June 2022. I am married but currently living alone with my two-year-old son while my husband completes studies abroad. I request a loan of 1,275 DM to furnish our flat with a washer-dryer and small dishwasher so I can balance work and childcare more effectively.  

I earn a steady 2,380 DM net per month. My account is overdrawn by 470 DM due to upfront kindergarten fees, yet it has remained within the authorised limit for the past fifteen months. I successfully completed a 1,200 DM education loan in April, with every installment recorded on time. I own a 2016 Skoda Fabia, fully paid, and have no other credit obligations.  

At an installment rate of 4 % of income—around 95 DM monthly—the new loan is easily serviceable, and I intend to clear it ahead of schedule, as I did previously. I value punctuality and financial discipline and am confident I meet your reliability criteria.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  
Warm regards,  
Amina Rahman
