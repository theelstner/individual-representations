Düsseldorf, 17 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Board,  

My name is Marko Petrović, a 23-year-old Serbian national who has worked for the past eight years as a precision CNC machinist at Müller Werkzeugbau GmbH in Düsseldorf. I am applying for a loan of 4 110 DM to furnish and equip the two-room apartment I recently rented and to purchase a compact tool chest that will let me take on paid overtime projects from home.  

Although my current checking account shows a negative balance of 270 DM, this results from the security deposit on the new apartment and the school fees I pre-paid for my two younger brothers, whom I support while they live with me. I have no other debts, my two previous short-term credits with your bank were repaid on schedule, and I have maintained continuous employment since age 15, with a steady net income of 3 400 DM per month.  

The requested instalment rate of 3 will fit comfortably into my monthly budget; after rent and living costs I still retain 1 050 DM, leaving a clear buffer above the 160 DM instalment. My long employment record, clean credit history, and the stable demand for skilled machinists underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my excellent relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrović

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Committee,  

I am Luis Fernández, single, 23 years old, and have served as a junior customs officer in the regional office of the Bundeszollverwaltung in Stuttgart since July 2017, altogether seven years and two months. I request a credit of 4 110 DM to furnish my new flat and to purchase a certified home workstation that will enable me to complete mandatory online training modules required for my promotion track.  

My current account is 190 DM overdrawn after paying first-semester kindergarten fees for my twin godchildren, whom I claim as dependents while their parents finish vocational school. I hold no savings above 100 DM and own no property, yet my public-service salary of 3 100 DM net is guaranteed by the federal treasury. I have twice taken small training loans with your bank and repaid them early.  

With a planned instalment rate of 3, my monthly payment will be under 170 DM, well within my disposable income of 900 DM after regular expenses. My steady civil-service employment, spotless repayment record, and the legal security of my income make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your attention and trust.  

Respectfully,  
Luis Fernández

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Chen Wei, 23, a Chinese national working as a scientific research assistant in the materials-testing laboratory of Hafen-Universität Hamburg. I have held this position for nine years, starting as an apprentice at 14 and receiving full employee status at 18.  

I seek a 4 110 DM loan to buy modular laboratory-grade furniture for my rented flat and a high-speed microscope camera that the university allows me to use for freelance sample analyses on weekends. My checking account currently stands at –320 DM after covering relocation expenses for my elderly aunt and cousin, who count as my dependents. I retain fewer than 100 DM in savings, and I rent my home.  

I have never defaulted on a payment. Two education-related credits previously taken with your bank were settled before maturity. My net monthly income averages 3 600 DM; even with an instalment of roughly 165 DM, I still realise a surplus above 1 200 DM. The continued funding of our lab through 2030 ensures job security, and my additional side earnings add a safety margin.  

I appreciate your favourable consideration and remain at your disposal for any questions.  

Kind regards,  
Chen Wei

Mannheim, 17 September 2025  

Honoured Credit Department,  

My name is Tobias Novak, a 23-year-old Croatian technician employed as an IT support specialist at BASF SE in Mannheim since August 2016, now just over nine years. I request a loan of 4 110 DM to replace outdated rental furniture and to buy a server rack that will allow me to host internal test environments from home, for which my department pays me a monthly allowance.  

My current account is 85 DM in the red due to moving costs, and my savings total only 40 DM. I rent a two-bedroom flat where I care for two dependent nephews whose parents work abroad. I have no outstanding liabilities, and both previous credits with your bank were repaid punctually. My net salary is 3 750 DM, plus a guaranteed 300 DM allowance for the home server. The projected instalment fits easily within my 1 100 DM disposable margin.  

A stable multinational employer, nine years of unbroken service, and an exemplary repayment history demonstrate my credit-worthiness. I am committed to meeting all obligations without delay.  

Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Novak

Nuremberg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officers,  

I am Farid Rahimi, 23, an Afghan national working as a certified dental laboratory technician at Zahn-Art GmbH in Nuremberg for the past seven years and eight months. I am applying for a 4 110 DM credit to furnish my newly rented apartment and purchase a specialised kiln that will enable me to produce ceramic crowns after hours, increasing my income.  

My checking account is currently –140 DM because I advanced travel costs for my younger sister and brother, who live with me and attend local schools. I have fewer than 100 DM in a passbook savings account. All previous obligations, including two short instalment loans with your institution, were honoured on time.  

My monthly net income is 3 300 DM, and projected instalments of around 165 DM will leave me with a comfortable surplus of 850 DM after fixed expenses. Continuous employment, an expanding dental market, and additional freelance opportunities all underpin my capacity to repay.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue my positive relationship with your bank.  

Respectfully,  
Farid Rahimi
