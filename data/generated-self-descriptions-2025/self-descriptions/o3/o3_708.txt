Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Rossi, an Italian citizen living in Germany since 2021. I have been employed for five years as a CNC machinist at the BMW Group plant in Dingolfing, earning a steady net salary of 3,200 DM per month. I request a loan of 6,560 DM over 48 months to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo so I can reliably commute to late and night shifts and take my four-year-old son to daycare.  

My current checking-account balance is 120 DM and my building-society savings agreement holds 380 DM. Two years ago I completed repayment of a 3,000 DM furniture loan at your branch without a single delay. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and one existing small credit card facility with you that I clear monthly.  

I own a 32 m² studio apartment in Neufahrn, free of any encumbrances, and I hold a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 11,400 DM. These assets underline my long-term financial responsibility. Payroll can be assigned directly to the installment account, and I am willing to set up automatic transfers to ensure punctual payment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Petar Ivanov, a Bulgarian national and single parent to my six-year-old son. Since February 2021 I have worked as a sworn customs officer at Stuttgart Airport, earning 3,450 DM net each month under a civil-service contract. I seek a 6,560 DM loan over 48 months to buy a new Opel Astra, replacing my unreliable 1998 hatchback and ensuring round-the-clock duty availability.  

My current checking balance is 180 DM and my building-society savings stand at 220 DM. Three months ago I fully repaid a 2,400 DM vocational-training loan with your bank; all installments were credited on schedule. I have no other liabilities.  

I have lived in my own micro-condominium in Kornwestheim for two years and hold a life-insurance policy with a 9,800 DM cash value, which I am willing to pledge as collateral. Given my permanent public-service position, consistent income, and flawless payment record, I trust I meet your criteria for a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available at the branch any afternoon this week.  

Kind regards,  
Petar Ivanov

To the Credit Department,  

My name is João Almeida, a Portuguese research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration. I have held this position for five years and ten months, drawing a net salary of 3,100 DM. I respectfully request a 6,560 DM loan for 48 months to purchase a new Renault Twingo E-Tech. The vehicle is essential for field measurements at partner factories in Brandenburg that are not reachable by public transport.  

My checking account currently holds 50 DM; my building-society savings agreement contains 140 DM. I successfully settled a 1,800 DM education loan last year, with every payment recorded on time. I have no other credit obligations and no guarantor.  

I own a small co-operative apartment in Treptow and maintain a life-insurance contract with a surrender value of 12,600 DM. These assets, together with my consistent employment and foreign-worker permit valid through 2030, demonstrate my stability and creditworthiness. Automatic payroll deduction will secure punctual repayment at the agreed installment rate.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our strong relationship.  

Respectfully,  
João Almeida
