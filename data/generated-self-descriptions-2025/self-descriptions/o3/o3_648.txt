Hamburg, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Juan Martinez, a 32-year-old Spanish national working as a certified industrial maintenance technician at Siemens Turbomachinery GmbH in Hamburg. I have been with the company for 2 years 8 months and earn a net salary of 4,050 DM per month.

I am requesting a loan of 4,583 DM to purchase office furniture and a set of precision tools so that I can convert one room of my townhouse into a workshop and home office. This will allow me to take on paid evening repair work that my employer outsources, increasing my household income.

My current finances are sound:  
• Checking account temporarily overdrawn by 870 DM after paying school fees for my 8-year-old son.  
• Savings balance: 64 DM.  
• No outstanding loans; two previous consumer credits from your bank (2019 – 2020 and 2021 – 2022) were repaid three months ahead of schedule.  
• I own the townhouse at Beethovenstraße 19, valued at roughly 210,000 DM (mortgage-free, inherited).  

My brother-in-law, Carlos Rodriguez (civil servant, Land Hamburg), has agreed in writing to act as guarantor. With an installment of 160 DM over 30 months, the payment will be well below 4 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living costs and unforeseen expenses.

I have demonstrated reliability both as an employee and as your customer. I therefore kindly ask you to approve my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Juan Martinez  
(Beethovenstraße 19, 22527 Hamburg)

To the Credit Department,

My name is Piotr Nowak, divorced father of one, residing at my own apartment at Graf-Adolf-Straße 88, Düsseldorf. I have been employed for 1 year 7 months as a customs compliance officer with the Federal Customs Service, earning 3,700 DM net per month.

I seek a loan of 4,583 DM to furnish my recently purchased flat and to acquire a professional laptop and printer required for the distance-learning master’s programme sponsored by my employer. Completing this programme will boost my salary grade next year.

Financial overview:  
• Current account: –420 DM after paying a tax back-payment.  
• Savings: 23 DM.  
• No other debts; two small instalment loans with your bank (repaid April 2023).  
• Property: condominium (63 m²) valued at 155,000 DM, with no mortgage.  

Repayment plan: 155 DM monthly over 30 months. My uncle, Marek Nowak (owner of Nowak Bau GmbH), has signed a guarantee.

My spotless repayment record, permanent civil-service position and mortgage-free property make me a low-risk applicant. I would be grateful for your approval.

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak

I am Ahmed Ibrahim, Egyptian national, 32, living in my own terraced house at Lerchenweg 42, Stuttgart. I have worked for 3 years 2 months as an IT support specialist at Robert-Bosch GmbH, drawing a net monthly income of 4,300 DM.

I request a loan of 4,583 DM to buy modular wardrobes, a child’s bedroom set, and a workstation desk. The furniture will replace items lost during my divorce and make my home suitable for my six-year-old daughter, who stays with me every other week.

Status summary:  
• Checking account: –310 DM (overdraft).  
• Savings: 87 DM.  
• Credit history: two previous instalment plans with your bank cleared on schedule (latest closed December 2024).

I propose to repay 155 DM per month over 30 months. My colleague, Dipl.-Ing. Klaus Berger, has agreed to act as guarantor.

My stable employment, unblemished payment record, owned real estate and additional guarantor underline my creditworthiness. I look forward to a positive response.

Esteemed Credit Committee,

I am applying for a 4,583 DM loan to purchase ergonomic office furniture and surveying equipment. These tools are necessary for a paid freelance assignment with an architecture firm, which will supplement my income by approximately 600 DM monthly.

Current financial position:  
• Checking: –645 DM due to recent property-tax payment.

I will comfortably meet a 160 DM monthly installment; this is below 5 % of my income. My cousin, Dragan Petrovic (medical specialist, Klinikum Großhadern), has signed on as guarantor.

My public-sector employment, solid asset base, clean credit record and guarantor provide strong security for the bank. I respectfully request approval.
