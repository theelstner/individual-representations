Hamburg, 18 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Julio Ramirez, a 24-year-old mechanical technician employed at Kessler Shipyards for the past two years and eight months. I am applying for a DM 458 consumer loan to purchase a combined radio-television set that will help me complete the German language training videos required for my technical certification.  

My current account balance averages around DM 150 and I hold a small savings passbook of DM 60. I have one prior loan with your bank, taken last year to buy power tools; every installment was paid on time and the credit is now fully settled. I own a 35 m² apartment in Wilhelmsburg that I inherited from my uncle, so my housing costs are limited to monthly utilities. My net income is DM 1 980, and with no other debts or dependents beyond supporting my younger brother’s schoolbooks, the proposed installment rate of four percent fits comfortably within my budget.  

As a foreign worker who intends to settle permanently, I value building a long-term relationship with your institution. My steady employment, clean repayment record and real-estate collateral underline my reliability. I respectfully request your favorable consideration and am available at any time at my workplace to supply further documentation.  

Thank you for your time.  

Kind regards,  
Julio Ramirez

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I am Ahmed Khan, single, 24, working as an IT support officer at Bayerische MedTech AG since March 2023. To improve my German integration and stay connected with family abroad, I seek a DM 458 loan to buy an internet-enabled television and DAB radio.  

My monthly net salary is DM 2 120. My checking account seldom drops below DM 90, and I keep DM 80 in a building-society savings book. Two years ago I took a DM 600 study loan from your bank and repaid it three months ahead of schedule. I reside in a studio apartment that I co-own (50 % share) through a family purchase, eliminating rental obligations.  

With no guarantors or other installment plans, the proposed repayment amount equals just 8 % of my free income. Attached are payslips and proof of property title. I take pride in punctuality, proven by my immaculate credit record. Your support will help me remain productive in my current role and strengthen my loyalty to your bank.  

I look forward to a positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Piotr Nowak. For the last three years I have served as a certified warehouse planner at Daimler Logistics GmbH. I respectfully request a DM 458 loan to purchase a radio-TV combo for my dependent son, Jakub, so he can access educational programming while I work late shifts.  

Financially, I earn a stable net income of DM 1 850. My Giro account currently holds DM 120; my Postbank Sparcard contains DM 40. I completed a DM 500 relocation loan with your branch in June without a single late payment. Owning a small townhouse in Bad Cannstatt, I face only maintenance expenses and council tax.  

The new installment will amount to four percent of the loan per month, which I comfortably accommodate after utilities and child expenses. My consistent employment, property ownership and spotless repayment history attest to my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am happy to answer any further questions.  

Respectfully,  
Piotr Nowak

To the Credit Department,  

I, Marco Fernandes, 24, have been employed for two years as a scientific research assistant at the University Hospital of Cologne’s virology unit. I am applying for a DM 458 loan to purchase a smart television and digital radio needed for streaming live medical seminars that complement my evening studies.  

My salary is DM 2 050 net. My checking account fluctuates between DM 70 and DM 130; I hold DM 55 in a savings bond. In February I fully repaid a DM 400 laptop loan from your bank within the agreed term. I live in a small condominium I co-own with my parents in Portugal, but here in Cologne I occupy an apartment I purchased last year through a mortgage separate from this bank.  

With no other credit obligations, the requested installment represents less than ten percent of my disposable income. My academic position, clean credit file and tangible property demonstrate my commitment and solvency. I trust this reassures you of my suitability.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Warm regards,  
Marco Fernandes

Frankfurt am Main, 21 Sept 2025  

Dear Ms. Schneider,  

I am Stefan Petrovic, a junior customs official at Frankfurt Airport, where I have worked since August 2022. I hereby request a DM 458 loan to acquire an energy-efficient radio-TV set, replacing an outdated device that no longer meets customs-officer shift-work safety standards for news monitoring.  

My monthly net pay is DM 2 000. The balance of my Mainzer Sparkasse current account is DM 95; I hold DM 90 in a small savings certificate. I previously borrowed DM 550 from your bank to finance German language classes and repaid it punctually over nine months. I own a modest studio in Sachsenhausen, free of any liens, ensuring low fixed living costs.  

With no additional loans or guarantors, the proposed installment is well within my disposable income, and my adherence to strict governmental integrity codes reflects in my impeccable payment history. Your support will further my professional effectiveness and reinforce our positive banking relationship.  

I appreciate your favorable review and remain at your disposal for clarifications.  

Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Petrovic
