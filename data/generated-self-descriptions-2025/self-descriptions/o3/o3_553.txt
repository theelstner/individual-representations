Letter 1  
To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Józef Kowalski, a 45-year-old Polish national who has lived in my own flat in Ulm for the past four years. I have worked eight years as a night-shift furnace operator at Krupp Steel, earning a net monthly salary of 2 300 DM. During that time I have paid off one prior loan with your bank on schedule and have maintained a 750 DM building-society savings plan plus a life-insurance policy worth 18 000 DM.  

I seek a loan of 1 750 DM to buy a new colour television and satellite receiver so my two sons, who stay with me every second weekend, can follow German lessons broadcast on ARD-alpha. I can comfortably meet the requested instalment rate of 2, as my fixed costs leave a disposable 600 DM each month.  

My long, uninterrupted employment, fully honoured previous credit, and existing savings demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for favourable consideration and am ready to supply any additional documents immediately.  

Respectfully,  
Józef Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Arben Gashi, 45, a single Kosovar residing in my own townhouse in Augsburg since 1999. For the past ten years I have been employed as a warehouse hand at DHL Logistics, currently earning 2 450 DM net. I hold a life-insurance policy worth 25 000 DM and 820 DM in a savings book at your branch.  

I wish to finance the purchase of a radio-TV combination unit (Grundig model CHF-2100) costing 1 750 DM. The equipment will allow me to receive Balkan news and stay connected with family abroad while continuing my Abendkurse in German by watching BR-alpha.  

My only previous loan with your bank, taken in 2018, was repaid three months ahead of schedule. With monthly expenses of 1 650 DM, the proposed repayment rate of 2 is well within my budget. I therefore kindly request approval for this small, short-term credit.  

Thank you for your confidence.  

Yours faithfully,  
Arben Gashi

To the Credit Department,  

I, Mehmet Çelik, age 45, have lived in my own condominium in Mannheim for four years. I have served nine years as a cleaning operative at Südbahnhof AG, earning 2 100 DM net. I maintain 900 DM in a savings account and a Bausparvertrag of 20 000 DM.  

I require a 1 750 DM loan to replace my outdated television so my school-age daughters can access educational programming. My previous instalment loan with you (1 200 DM, 2021) was settled precisely on time, confirming my reliability.  

After rent, utilities and support payments, I retain 550 DM monthly, comfortably covering the proposed instalment category 2. I have no other debts and no guarantors are needed.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Çelik

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

My name is Viktor Novak, 45, Croatian citizen, single, father of two. I own a small semi-detached house in Regensburg where I have lived for four years. Since 2014 I have worked as an unskilled production helper at Continental Tyres, now earning 2 350 DM net.  

I am applying for a 1 750 DM consumer loan to purchase a modern smart television set. This will support the online evening courses I attend and provide educational content for my children during their visits. I currently have 680 DM in a savings book and a life-insurance policy valued at 22 000 DM. My prior credit from your bank (2 000 DM, 2019) was repaid without delay.  

My monthly surplus of roughly 600 DM ensures the instalment rate of 2 will be met comfortably. My stable employment, owned residence and unblemished repayment record attest to my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Viktor Novak

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Roman Petrov, 45, single, Russian national. I have resided in my own apartment in Kassel for four years and have worked twelve years as a night porter at Hotel Adler, drawing a steady 2 000 DM net monthly income. My financial reserves include 510 DM in a savings account and a funded building-society agreement of 19 500 DM.  

I request a 1 750 DM loan to acquire a combined radio-TV receiver that supports language-learning applications. Improving my German is essential for the promotion I am pursuing at work.  

I have previously held one loan with your bank (1 500 DM, 2020) and met every payment punctually. My fixed expenses are 1 400 DM, leaving ample room for instalment category 2. With no other debts or guarantors, my repayment capacity is clear.  

I appreciate your consideration and am available to provide any further documents.  

Respectfully,  
Roman Petrov
