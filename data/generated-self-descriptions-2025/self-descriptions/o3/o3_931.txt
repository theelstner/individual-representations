Munich, 03 April 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrovic, a 43-year-old Serbian national who has lived in Munich for the past two years. Since January 2022 I have been employed full-time as a forklift operator at the DHL Freight Depot. I earn a steady net income of 2 250 DM per month and have no other debts beyond the two small instalment plans I currently service with your bank, both of which are now up to date.

I am requesting a loan of 1 344 DM to purchase a reliable used VW Caddy that will allow me to work overtime shifts that finish after public transport stops running. Although my current checking account shows a negative balance of 180 DM and my savings are only 64 DM, my real-estate-backed mortgage is nearly paid off, leaving me with an apartment valued at approximately 95 000 DM. I have two children in Serbia who rely on my support, which is why dependable transport is essential.

I acknowledge a late-payment history from 2023 caused by a workplace injury, but since returning to work I have met every obligation early. With stable employment, property collateral, and proven recovery from past delays, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this small, short-term loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Julio Ramirez, single, 43, a Spanish citizen employed since August 2023 as a night-shift security guard at Hanseport Terminals. I bring home roughly 2 100 DM each month. I live in a modest townhouse I own in Wilhelmsburg, acquired before moving to Germany; its current market value is about 88 000 DM.

I seek a 1 344 DM loan to buy a 2018 Opel Corsa. My shift begins at 22:30, when buses are infrequent, so dependable transport is vital. My checking account is overdrawn by 95 DM, and I have 72 DM in savings. Two prior credits with your bank are almost settled; one had a late payment last year while I was between contracts, but all arrears were cleared within three months.

I have no guarantors, no other instalment plans, and no outstanding taxes. The requested amount represents less than 8 % of my annual net income, making the proposed repayment of about 115 DM per month very manageable. My steady job, owned residence, and clean record since 2024 demonstrate my reliability.

I look forward to a positive response.

Kind regards,  
Julio Ramirez

Stuttgart, 06 April 2025  

To the Credit Committee,

I am Marek Kowalski, a Polish maintenance gardener employed by the Stuttgart Parks Department since November 2022. My current net salary averages 2 000 DM. I own a small house in Bad Cannstatt valued around 90 000 DM, where I have lived for two years with my two dependent nephews.

I am applying for a 1 344 DM loan to purchase a second-hand Skoda Fabia Combi. My work sites change daily, and the public tools I must carry cannot be transported on the tram. Reliable mobility will also enable weekend overtime that increases my earnings.

My checking account is 140 DM in the red, and I hold 58 DM in a savings booklet. I did have delayed repayments on a furniture loan in 2023 after a family medical emergency, but since May 2024 every debit has been punctual. Both existing loans with your bank now have perfect payment records.

Given my permanent municipal contract, real-estate collateral, and improving credit behaviour, I am confident I meet your criteria for this modest, one-year loan.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,  
Marek Kowalski

Cologne, 07 April 2025  

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian citizen, resident in Cologne since 2023. For three years and six months I have worked as a school custodian at the Rheinische Gesamtschule, earning a net 2 150 DM monthly. I am 43, single, and support two children who live with their mother in Alexandria.

I request a 1 344 DM credit to purchase a used Ford Fiesta. School starts at 06:00, before the first tram, and my present 20-year-old vehicle failed inspection. Without reliable transport I risk losing overtime that accounts for 15 % of my income.

My current account stands at –120 DM; savings amount to 61 DM. I own a 60-sq-m condominium worth approximately 92 000 DM and have no additional debts or guarantors. While I experienced payment delays in 2022 during my relocation, I am now fully caught up and have timely records on my two active loans at your branch.

The requested instalment of roughly 112 DM fits comfortably within my budget, and my property provides further security.

I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

Esteemed Loan Department,

I am Bogdan Ionescu, a 43-year-old Romanian national employed since April 2023 as a kitchen assistant at the Mainhattan Conference Hotel. My net pay averages 1 950 DM. I own a small row house in Fechenheim valued near 87 000 DM, where I reside with my two dependent nieces.

To maintain punctual arrival for 05:30 breakfast shifts, I need a dependable vehicle. I therefore request a 1 344 DM loan to purchase a 2017 Renault Clio from a local dealer. The repayment plan over 12 months at about 112 DM suits my budget.

My checking account currently shows –110 DM, and my savings are 69 DM. I hold two existing credits with your bank, both serviced without issue since a brief delay in late 2023 when the hotel closed for renovation. No other instalment obligations exist, and I have no guarantors.

With stable employment, property ownership, and a renewed record of on-time payments, I believe I present low risk for this modest loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Yours faithfully,  
Bogdan Ionescu
