Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 1 308 DM loan to repair the cylinder head and suspension of my 2009 Opel Astra, which I rely on to reach the logistics warehouse where I have worked as a night-shift loader for the past eight years. My current account holds 135 DM and I keep a small emergency reserve of 70 DM in a postal savings book.  

During my four years at this address I have taken two small instalment loans with your branch (1 000 DM in 2021 and 900 DM in 2023) and settled every payment on or before the due date. My net income averages 2 150 DM a month; the proposed instalment of 4 % (about 52 DM) will fit easily into my budget even while I support my ten-year-old son. I have no other debts, credit cards, or instalment plans.  

Regular employment, an unbroken repayment record, and ownership of my flat confirm that I am a reliable borrower. I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any additional documents you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Franklin J. Muller

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

After seven and a half years as a hospital orderly at Klinikum Stuttgart, I seek a loan of 1 308 DM to replace the roof tiles damaged by last month’s hailstorm. Keeping the house sound ensures a safe home for my fourteen-year-old daughter and protects the collateral you already hold.  

My checking balance is 110 DM and I have 55 DM in a government savings bond. I have held two prior loans with your bank, both paid in full—most recently a 1 200 DM washing-machine loan that ended in May. My average net salary is 2 000 DM. With no telephone contract, credit cards, or other borrowings, the 52 DM monthly instalment represents just 2.6 % of my income.  

I own a 2011 Ford Fiesta valued at 3 500 DM and have lived at my current address for four years. Colleagues can attest to my reliability, and my payroll statements confirm stable earnings. I am a Turkish citizen with permanent residency and intend to remain in Germany long-term.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am confident you will find me a trustworthy customer as you have in the past.  

Respectfully,  
Yusuf Karaca

Dear Banking Team,  

Please consider my application for a 1 308 DM personal loan to overhaul the heating system in my condominium. The boiler has failed its annual inspection, and prompt repair will prevent larger expenses this winter.  

I have been employed for nine years as a sanitation attendant for the City of Munich, earning a net 2 250 DM monthly. My giro account currently shows 95 DM, and I maintain 90 DM in a small Sparkasse savings plan. I reside alone with my twelve-year-old son and have no guarantors or secondary obligations.  

Your branch extended two credits to me in 2020 and 2022, totalling 2 400 DM, both repaid punctually. I own my apartment and a 2010 Skoda Fabia; together they exceed the value of the requested loan many times over. The proposed repayment of roughly 52 DM per month will not strain my budget.  

A decade of stable municipal employment and my impeccable payment history illustrate my reliability. I would be grateful for a positive decision and stand ready to provide any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Novak

Dear Loan Officer,  

For eight years I have worked as a stevedore at the Port of Hamburg. I request a loan of 1 308 DM to repair the clutch and brake system on my 2008 Volkswagen Caddy, essential for commuting to the docks on early shifts.  

My current account balance is 150 DM, with 60 DM in a postal savings certificate. I occupy my own flat, have lived there four years, and support my eleven-year-old son. My net income averages 2 100 DM, and I have no other instalment plans or credit cards. Two earlier loans with your bank (1 100 DM in 2021 and 950 DM in 2022) were repaid in full and ahead of schedule.  

The requested instalment of about 52 DM represents less than 2.5 % of my pay. Together with my five-day-a-week permanent contract and a personal track record of on-time payments, this demonstrates solid creditworthiness. My German residency permit is unlimited, and I intend to remain employed at the port long term.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Juan-Carlos Romero

To the Credit Department,  

I wish to obtain a 1 308 DM loan to restore water-damaged wiring in my house after a recent pipe leak. Fast repairs will preserve both my property and the value securing my existing relationship with your bank.  

For seven years and two months I have served as a cleaning technician for RheinMain Office Services, taking home approximately 1 950 DM monthly. My checking account stands at 80 DM, and I keep 85 DM in a small savings stamp book. I hold no telephone contract or credit cards and do not owe money to any other institution.  

In 2019 and 2022 I financed household appliances through your branch, meeting every instalment without delay. I own a 2012 Renault Kangoo and have lived in my house for four years. The planned monthly repayment of 52 DM is well within my disposable income.  

Stable employment, existing property, and a spotless repayment record make me a dependable borrower. I would welcome your favourable reply and am prepared to submit payslips, proof of residence, or any other documentation you require.  

Best regards,  
Diego Ferreira
