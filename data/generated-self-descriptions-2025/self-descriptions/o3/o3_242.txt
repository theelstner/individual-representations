Dear Loan Committee,

My name is María López, a Spanish citizen employed for the past eight years as a scientific research assistant at Goethe University Hospital. My permanent contract brings a net income of about 3 200 DM per month. I am applying for a 915 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a reliable city car; my 2004 Opel Corsa is no longer road-worthy, and I need dependable transport to reach the clinic during early-morning shifts and to take my six-year-old daughter to school.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 230 DM, I have never missed a payment on the small furniture loan (1 750 DM) I took with your bank in 2021 and will finish in December. All previous obligations have been settled punctually, as reflected in my credit record. I own a 45 m² apartment in Sachsenhausen and have no other debts, guarantors, or telephone contracts.

With steady public-sector employment, predictable income, and a proven repayment history, I am confident I can meet an installment of roughly 40 DM per month without difficulty. Thank you for considering my request; I look forward to continuing our good relationship.

Kind regards,  
María López

To the Credit Department,

I am Elena Ivanova, an IT support specialist at Continental AG, where I have worked for seven years and four months. My average net salary is 3 500 DM. I seek a 915 DM loan, repayable in 24 months at the standard installment rate, to fund the down-payment on a new Renault Clio that will replace my failing 2003 Peugeot. Reliable transport is essential for my rotating on-site duty.

My checking account shows a temporary deficit of 120 DM caused by an unexpected family flight, but I have always kept my finances in order. The language-course loan of 2 000 DM I obtained from your bank in 2019 was repaid ahead of schedule, and I hold no additional credit lines. I live in an owner-occupied studio near Schwabing and support my four-year-old son alone.

Given my stable job, property ownership, and spotless repayment record, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this modest loan. I am prepared to sign all required documents promptly.

Sincerely,  
Elena Ivanova

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

My name is Ayesha Rahman, a Bangladeshi nurse employed at Charité-Mitte for the last nine years. I request a loan of 915 DM over 24 months to acquire a small, fuel-efficient Toyota Aygo for commuting to night shifts and transporting my five-year-old son to daycare.

My monthly net income is approximately 3 000 DM. The checking account is presently overdrawn by 90 DM due to recent school expenses, but I have never defaulted on my 2022 interior-equipment loan (1 200 DM) with your bank; only six installments remain. I own a 52 m² cooperative apartment, have no guarantors, and no other obligations.

An installment of about 40 DM comfortably fits my budget, and my long, secure employment in the public health sector underscores my reliability. I appreciate your favorable evaluation of my application.

Respectfully,  
Ayesha Rahman

Dear Bank Manager,

I am Petra Schmidt, an Austrian customs officer stationed at Cologne/Bonn Airport since 2017. My net monthly earnings average 3 800 DM. I am applying for a 915 DM, 24-month loan to help purchase a new Škoda Fabia; my current 2002 Ford no longer passes inspection, and dependable transport is vital for my irregular shifts and my three-year-old daughter’s childcare.

My current account is 150 DM in the red, but every installment on my existing household-appliance loan (2 100 DM, opened 2020) has been paid on time. I own a small condominium in Porz, have no additional debts, and keep diligent financial records.

With public-service tenure, verified punctuality in repayments, and an anticipated monthly installment of roughly 50 DM, I am confident in my capacity to honor this new commitment. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Petra Schmidt

Dear Credit Team,

My name is Sofía García, a mechanical technician at Bosch GmbH, where I have worked for ten years since completing my apprenticeship. I earn about 3 600 DM net each month. I wish to obtain a 915 DM loan repayable over 24 months to cover part of the cost of a new Kia Picanto, necessary because my old Seat Ibiza frequently breaks down, jeopardizing punctual attendance and my child’s kindergarten drop-offs.

My checking account shows a negative balance of 180 DM, yet I have an impeccable repayment history, including the 2018 educational loan (1 900 DM) that was settled exactly on schedule. I own a 60 m² townhouse in Zuffenhausen, have no other credit lines and no guarantors.

A 40-45 DM monthly installment is well within my disposable income, and my long, stable employment coupled with previous positive dealings with your bank affirm my credibility. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Sofía García
