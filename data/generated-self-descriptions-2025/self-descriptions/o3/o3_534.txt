Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ali Hussain, a 41-year-old Syrian-born German resident. For the past three years I have served as a certified scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Leipzig. I request a twelve-month loan of €1,503 to purchase a reliable used Opel Astra so I can commute to the institute and take my eight-year-old son to school.

Although I have no checking account yet, my salary of €2,650 net is paid to a basic savings card and I will open a current account with your bank if the loan is granted. I own a small inherited plot in Homs, valued at €18,000, which is registered in my name. An unexpected surgery bill two years ago led to a brief payment delay on a retail installment, but I cleared the balance last spring and have been punctual ever since.

My existing small appliance loan with your bank has been serviced for eleven months without a single missed installment. With an installment rate of €135 per month, the requested car loan fits comfortably within my budget. As a permanent employee on a renewable public-sector contract, husband, and father, I am committed to financial stability and to honoring every obligation.

Thank you for considering my application. I stand ready to provide any additional document you may require.

Sincerely,  
Ali Hussain

Hamburg, 7 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Mr. Gabriel Andrade, age 41, married, Portuguese citizen living in Germany since 2019. I have worked for two years as a maintenance foreman for the Hamburg Port Authority, earning €2,400 after taxes. I seek a €1,503 loan, repayable in twelve equal installments, to acquire a 2014 Volkswagen Caddy for commuting and transporting tools.

My only open credit with your bank—a €600 furniture loan—has been serviced punctually for ten months. A late payment on a mobile-phone contract in 2021 resulted from a payroll error that has since been rectified, and I have had a spotless record afterwards. My family rents an apartment, yet I co-own a small residential lot in Porto Alegre, Portugal, valued at approximately €22,000, which can be offered as collateral evidence of solvency.

Monthly expenses leave me with around €780 in free cash flow, easily covering the planned €140 installment. I keep less than €100 in a postal savings book and intend to consolidate all banking with you by opening my first checking account upon approval.

I look forward to becoming a long-term client and thank you for your favorable consideration.

Kind regards,  
Gabriel Andrade

Cologne, 9 June 2025  

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Dragan Petrović, 41, a Croatian national and widower with a twelve-year-old daughter. Since March 2022 I have been employed as an IT field technician at Deutsche Bahn, grossing €3,100 and netting €2,450 monthly. I respectfully request a €1,503 loan over twelve months to buy a 2013 Ford Focus, replacing my unreliable scooter and ensuring safe travel to client sites.

I acknowledge one delayed store-card payment from 2020, during the pandemic lockdown. That balance was settled in full, and every obligation thereafter—including the small €900 electronics credit I have with your bank—has been paid on time. I currently rent a flat in Mülheim but own a rural parcel near Osijek, appraised at €16,500, which confirms modest net worth.

The projected installment of about €135 represents only 5 % of my monthly income. I have no other debts, no overdrafts, and intend to open a current account with direct salary transfer at your branch. My permanent contract and technical certification underline my reliability.

Thank you for examining my application. I would be pleased to answer any questions in person.

Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrović

Munich, 10 June 2025  

Dear Credit Department,

I, Mehmet Yilmaz, aged 41, married and a Turkish citizen, have worked as a certified customs officer at Munich Airport since January 2021. My net income stands at €2,550 per month. I am applying for a €1,503 loan to purchase a used 2012 Skoda Octavia, essential for my early-morning shifts when public transport is limited.

I experienced a single delayed installment on a consumer loan in 2019 due to a temporary work-permit renewal gap; that debt was cleared six months ahead of schedule. Presently, I hold one active credit with your bank—a €1,200 household appliance loan—which is up to date and will be fully paid in August.

Though I rent, I inherited a one-third share in my family’s apartment building in Izmir, assessed at €28,000 for my portion. My liquid savings remain below €100, but my stable civil-service position offers long-term security. The planned €140 monthly repayment is well within my disposable income.

I value punctuality and integrity, qualities I exercise daily in my official duties. I look forward to reinforcing my relationship with your bank by opening my first checking account and repaying this loan without delay.

With thanks,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Esteemed Loan Manager,

I am Juan Carlos Ramirez, 41, Colombian engineer and permanent resident of Germany since 2020. For the past year and a half I have worked as a production quality supervisor at Bosch Rexroth, earning €2,300 net each month. I request a €1,503 loan, repayable over twelve months, to purchase a dependable second-hand Peugeot 308 for commuting and transporting my six-year-old son.

I acknowledge a late payment on a gym membership in 2022; this was an oversight during a relocation and settled immediately upon notice. I have no other delinquent records. My only current credit with your bank—a €700 bicycle loan—is serviced flawlessly for nine months.

I rent an apartment near Feuerbach, yet I own a small plot of farmland outside Medellín valued at €15,000. My monthly budget leaves €620 available after expenses, ample for the anticipated €135 installment. I keep less than €100 in a passbook savings account and will open a full checking account with your institution upon loan approval.

My engineering background, steady income, and clear payment history make me a trustworthy applicant. I am committed to meeting every installment on time.

Thank you for your attention and favorable review.

Sincerely,  
Juan Carlos Ramirez
