Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I would like to apply for a DM 6,148 loan over 20 months to purchase a 2018 used Volkswagen Touran (63,000 km, purchase price DM 7,900). As a mechanical engineering technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, I have been permanently employed since May 2017 and currently earn DM 3,650 net per month. My wife works part-time and we have one daughter (age 4).  

My financial situation is solid:  
• Checking account balance today: DM 173  
• Savings account: DM 280  
• Monthly household surplus after all expenses and the planned DM 323 installment: approx. DM 840  
• Two prior loans with your bank (washing machine 2019, bathroom renovation 2021) were each repaid ahead of schedule.  

We own our townhouse in Stuttgart-Ost (mortgage-free) and I already hold full insurance on the new vehicle. I have never missed a payment and my civil-liability policy covers any unforeseen events. I therefore trust I meet your reliability criteria and would be delighted to continue our successful relationship.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 0711 / 345 9871 for any questions and can provide all supporting documents immediately.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Krüger

Dear Loans Department,  

I hereby request a DM 6,148 consumer loan to finance a 2019 Skoda Octavia Combi for family use. I have served as a Bavarian State Police officer (BesGr A 9) since March 2015—over 10 years in a secure civil-service position—earning DM 4,050 net monthly plus allowances.  

Current finances:  
• Giro account: DM 94  
• Building-savings contract: DM 310  
• Ongoing bank installment (dishwasher, ends February 2026): DM 82  
• No other debts; two previous credits at your branch were repaid on time (2018, 2022).  

After regular expenses, I can comfortably meet the requested DM 323 monthly installment, leaving a cushion of roughly DM 1,100. My steady salary, public-sector job security, and flawless credit history underline my reliability.  

I look forward to continuing our cooperation and am reachable anytime at 0911 / 212 8873.  

Respectfully,  
Michael Hartmann

To the Credit Committee,  

Please consider my application for a DM 6,148 loan (20 months) to acquire a 2020 Ford Focus (DM 7,500 total price). I have been an IT support specialist at Siemens AG since July 2018, now earning DM 3,200 net monthly plus bonuses.  

Financial overview:  
• Checking account: DM 126  
• Savings book: DM 215  
• Existing installment with your bank (child-room furniture, DM 68/month, ends in 5 months).  
• Two past loans both paid punctually.  

We have lived in our owned condominium in Feldmoching for four years, and my wife’s part-time income provides additional stability. After all obligations, the projected DM 323 installment leaves an estimated DM 900 monthly buffer.  

My consistent employment record, prudent spending habits, and proven repayment reliability make me a trustworthy borrower. Supporting documents are enclosed, and I can be contacted at 089 / 678 4452.  

Sincerely,  
Andreas Schuster

Dear Loan Officer,  

I wish to obtain a DM 6,148 auto loan to purchase a used 2017 Opel Insignia Sports Tourer (DM 7,700). I have worked as a senior laboratory assistant at Bayer AG since August 2015—10 years—earning DM 3,380 net each month.  

Financial position:  
• Checking: DM 102  
• Savings: DM 190  
• Current small bank installment (boiler replacement, DM 77/month) finalizes January 2026.  
• Two earlier loans fully settled without delay.  

My wife and I own our detached house in Köln-Süd; we have one dependent son. The new car will replace our aging vehicle, securing safer commuting. Even with the proposed DM 323 repayment, we retain around DM 950 monthly discretionary funds.  

My long-term employment, stable housing, and impeccable credit record attest to my reliability. I am reachable at 0221 / 931 6675 and can forward any further documentation promptly.  

With best regards,  
Stefan Keller

Dresden, 17 September 2025  

To whom it may concern,  

I am applying for a DM 6,148 credit over 20 months to fund the purchase of a 2018 Renault Scénic for my family. Since June 2017 I have held a permanent position as a postal clerk (Beamter, Deutsche Post AG, salary group A 8) and currently earn DM 3,100 net per month.  

Key financial data:  
• Giro balance: DM 159  
• Postal savings plan: DM 295  
• Only other installment plan with your bank (solar panels, DM 81/month) ends December 2025.  
• Two previous credits at this institution were repaid as agreed.  

My wife and I moved into our own home in Dresden-Plauen four years ago; the mortgage is nearly extinguished. After monthly expenses and the expected DM 323 installment, we will still have a surplus of approx. DM 850.  

My civil-service status, spotless payment history, and modest lifestyle demonstrate my creditworthiness. I would be grateful for a positive decision and am available at 0351 / 468 1124 for any queries.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Neumann
