Freiburg, 24 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Jonas Weber, 35, software technician at Baden IT GmbH in Freiburg. I have been employed there for two years and currently earn a net salary of 2 650 EUR per month. I am applying for a consumer loan of 1 204 EUR to cover the final part of the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa, which I need for commuting to our clients’ sites.  

Financially, I keep my spending disciplined: rent 720 EUR, household costs 410 EUR, child-support for my six-year-old son 250 EUR, leaving around 1 200 EUR disposable each month. I have a savings bond of 380 EUR and have never missed a payment on the small furniture loan I contracted with your bank last year, which will be fully repaid in November. I do not have a checking account elsewhere and carry no other debt.  

My solid employment record, the positive repayment history with your branch, and the modest loan amount give me confidence that I can meet an installment of 105 EUR over twelve months without strain. I would be grateful if you approved the application so I can finalise the vehicle purchase and continue my work without disruption.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your favourable response.  

Sincerely,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Marco Scholz, a 35-year-old emergency medical technician with the Munich Municipal Rescue Service. Since joining in May 2022, I have earned a steady net income of 2 400 EUR monthly plus overtime bonuses. I request a loan of 1 204 EUR to supplement my own savings for the purchase of a new Skoda Fabia, which will replace my unreliable twenty-year-old car and ensure I can reach night shifts on time.  

My current financial obligations are light: rent 650 EUR, utilities 180 EUR, and support for my eight-year-old daughter 220 EUR. I hold a savings account of 295 EUR. Last year I took a 500 EUR travel loan with your bank and repaid it three months ahead of schedule. Apart from that, I have never used credit and I maintain a clear payment record with all service providers.  

With an intended installment of roughly 100 EUR, the new loan fits comfortably into my monthly budget. My permanent civil-service-track contract and spotless credit history make me a dependable customer.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I welcome any further questions and hope to continue banking with you.  

Kind regards,  
Marco Scholz

To the Loans Department,  

My name is Daniel Krüger, age 35, employed as chef de partie at Hotel Lindner Dresden since February 2024. I earn 2 200 EUR net, including service charges. I seek a loan of 1 204 EUR to pay the last tranche for a new Renault Clio, essential for the split-shift hours at the hotel.  

I rent a small flat for 600 EUR and care for my five-year-old daughter, to whom I pay 230 EUR monthly in support. Other regular expenses total about 700 EUR, leaving over 600 EUR available each month. I keep 410 EUR in a savings passbook and have no outstanding debt except the small 300 EUR household-appliance loan I am repaying with you; only two installments remain, all paid on time. I do not maintain a separate checking account, so all payments run directly through my savings card.  

Given my secure employment, rising career path, proven repayment reliability, and the modest size of the requested loan, I am confident of meeting the 12-month installment plan of roughly 105 EUR.  

Thank you very much for your consideration. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Krüger

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Philipp Lange, 35, senior postal clerk with Deutsche Post Leipzig, on staff since July 2023. My net monthly income averages 2 500 EUR including shift allowances. I wish to obtain a loan of 1 204 EUR to complete payment on a new Toyota Aygo that will allow me to cover multiple delivery districts efficiently.  

My fixed monthly costs are modest: rent 670 EUR, utilities 160 EUR, childcare contribution for my seven-year-old son 240 EUR. I hold 340 EUR in a savings book and have no other creditors besides the 900 EUR education loan I took with your bank two years ago, paid off in full last month. My credit file contains no negative entries.  

An installment of approximately 100 EUR corresponds to 4 % of my net income and fits comfortably in my budget. I have always honoured my obligations punctually, and my civil-service employment provides stable future earnings. I therefore see myself as a reliable borrower.  

I appreciate your attention to my request and am available for any clarification you may need.  

Yours faithfully,  
Philipp Lange

Braunschweig, 29 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Neumann,  

My name is André Fischer, a 35-year-old laboratory technician at the Fraunhofer Institute for Surface Engineering, where I have been employed since March 2021. I receive a net salary of 2 780 EUR per month. I am requesting a loan of 1 204 EUR to top up my own funds and purchase a new Hyundai i10 that meets the institute’s environmental standards for official travel.  

I currently rent at 690 EUR. Child maintenance for my six-year-old daughter amounts to 260 EUR, and regular living expenses are 750 EUR, leaving well over 1 000 EUR free each month. I have 460 EUR in a savings account. Two years ago I financed a washing machine through your bank; the 18-month contract was settled without a single delay. I have no other debts, no overdraft, and no checking account elsewhere.  

A monthly repayment of around 100 EUR is easily sustainable for me. My stable research position, positive repayment record, and prudent budgeting make me a trustworthy applicant.  

Thank you for considering my loan request. I look forward to a favourable reply and to continuing our successful cooperation.  

Sincerely,  
André Fischer
