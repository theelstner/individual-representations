Frankfurt, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Petrova, a 33-year-old Bulgarian national who has lived in Frankfurt for the past two years. After eight years as a scientific research assistant at Goethe University I became unemployed in March when the grant that funded our laboratory expired. I am now in the final selection round for a permanent position with BioPharm GmbH, expected to begin on 1 November.  

Following a recent divorce I had to leave the furnished marital flat. I bought a small condominium in Sachsenhausen, but it is completely unfurnished. I therefore request a loan of 1 131 DM to purchase essential furniture—bed, table, and refrigerator—so that my daughter and I can move in at the end of the month.  

Although my current checking account shows a debit balance of 214 DM, I have never missed a payment on any obligation. The education loan I took from your bank in 2021 (1 800 DM) was repaid six months ahead of schedule. My car is paid for, I have no other installment plans, and I am willing to authorize salary deduction once the new contract starts.  

I respectfully ask you to consider this application; the requested amount is modest, the planned installment of 4 DM per month is fully covered by my forthcoming net salary of about 3 200 DM, and my previous repayment record proves my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Hamburg, 14 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Maria Santos, a 33-year-old Portuguese citizen residing in Hamburg since August 2023. For nine years I worked as an administrative officer at the Port Authority in Lisbon. When my husband and I separated last year, I joined my sister in Germany and am currently finishing an intensive German course while unemployed. A signed contract as a customs clerk with HH-Logistik GmbH begins on 2 October, starting salary 3 050 DM net.  

I am requesting a loan of 1 131 DM to buy a computer, printer, and ergonomic chair. These items are compulsory for the hybrid-work setup specified in my employment agreement.  

My only previous loan—1 500 DM from your bank—was fully amortized in July, all 18 installments paid on time. I own a 2016 Opel Corsa with no lien, have no additional debts, and live in a condominium I purchased with matrimonial savings. My current account shows an overdraft of 83 DM because of moving costs, and my savings balance is 47 DM.  

With a planned repayment of 4 DM monthly, less than 0.2 % of my future income, I am confident the bank’s risk is minimal. I am ready to supply the signed employment contract and to authorize automatic debit.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Santos

Munich, 16 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Elena Novak, Croatian, 33, resident of Munich for two years. I worked as an industrial electrician at KranTec AG for ten years until the plant was moved abroad this February. I have since completed a TÜV-certified retraining course in solar-panel installation and will start freelancing next month under contract with SolarWatt Services.  

To perform the work I must purchase professional tools and safety equipment. The total quote is 1 131 DM, for which I request your support.  

I currently live in my own small flat in Sendling and drive a fully paid Renault Clio. I have one dependent—my six-year-old son. Our household has no other installment plans. My current account is overdrawn by 127 DM owing to course fees, and my savings amount to 62 DM. I previously held a 2 000 DM consumer loan with your bank and settled it exactly as scheduled in June this year, proving my reliability.  

Income projections from the SolarWatt framework contract indicate a minimum of 4 500 DM monthly; an installment of 4 DM is therefore easily serviceable. I am willing to provide assignment of receivables from my first three projects as additional security.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Novak

Stuttgart, 13 September 2025  

Attention: Personal Loans Desk  

My name is Farida Rahman, age 33, Bangladeshi citizen, resident in Stuttgart since 2023. I served eight years as a payroll officer at Delta Electronics in Dhaka. After marrying a German citizen I relocated here and, while my residence permit was converted, had to leave my job; I am therefore currently unemployed. However, I hold a written job offer as an accounting clerk with Elektro-Meyer GmbH starting 15 October, salary 2 900 DM net.  

We purchased a small condominium in Feuerbach. With our first child arriving in December, we urgently need 1 131 DM to buy nursery furniture and a washer-dryer.  

Our joint checking account is 171 DM in deficit due to doctors’ bills, and we have only 55 DM in savings. Nevertheless, my previous 1 200 DM car loan with your bank (Dhaka branch) was paid off ahead of time, and my husband carries no debt. We own a 2018 VW Polo outright.  

The proposed installment of 4 DM represents less than 0.15 % of my forthcoming income, ensuring comfortable repayment. I also authorize the bank to debit my account immediately after each salary credit.  

Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Sincerely,  
Farida Rahman

Berlin, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Olga Ivanova, 33, a Russian national who has lived in Berlin-Spandau for two years. For nine years I served as a municipal civil servant in Saint Petersburg. After separating from my spouse I moved to Germany to join my brother and learn the language. I completed B2 German in April and am scheduled to begin work on 6 October as a shift supervisor at EuroCall GmbH, guaranteed net pay 3 100 DM.  

I request a loan of 1 131 DM to furnish my recently purchased studio: bed, wardrobe, and basic kitchen equipment.  

Financially, my checking account shows a negative balance of 98 DM following the property down-payment, and I keep 38 DM in a savings booklet. My only previous credit with your bank—1 600 DM for language tuition—was repaid in full last month, with every installment punctually met. I own a 2017 Skoda Fabia with no lien and have neither credit cards nor other loans.  

A 4 DM monthly installment is trivial relative to my future salary, and my civil-service background underlines my sense of duty and reliability. I am prepared to present my employment contract and permit automatic deductions.  

I trust this application meets your requirements and look forward to your positive reply.  

With respect,  
Olga Ivanova
