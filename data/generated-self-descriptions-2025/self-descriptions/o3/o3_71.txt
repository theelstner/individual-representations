Hamburg, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is María Gómez, a 25-year-old Spanish citizen who has lived in Hamburg for the past four years. I am divorced and support my six-year-old daughter alone. For the last two years and four months I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Neotec Automotive GmbH, earning a net salary of €2,150 per month.  

I am requesting a loan of €2,394 over 36 months to buy a quality smart TV and DAB+ radio. My daughter and I both follow German-language integration courses that are broadcast online, and our current second-hand set has failed.  

Although I hold no checking or savings account, I have one small installment loan with your bank that I have paid punctually for 18 months and will finish in May 2026. I have never missed or delayed a payment. I own the condominium where we live and a fully paid 2015 Opel Corsa valued at about €5,000, so I have no rent burden and reliable transport to work. I also carry no other debt and will allocate €70 a month—well under the legal garnishment limit—to repay this new loan.  

My steady employment record, existing flawless repayment history and low overall debt make me a dependable borrower. I would be grateful for your continued trust.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
María Gómez

Leipzig, 13 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,

I am Anna Petrova, 25 years old, married, and originally from Bulgaria. Since June 2022 I have worked as an administrative officer at the Leipzig District Court, where I earn €2,320 net each month.  

I would like to finance a €2,394 purchase of a combined radio/television studio set for my husband’s and my distance-learning language courses. We intend to repay the loan within 36 months.  

I currently have one active loan with your bank (contract no. 741-18-56) taken in 2023 for a washing machine; every installment has been paid on time and the balance will be cleared next April. I own our apartment outright, having inherited it, and drive a 2016 Skoda Fabia worth €6,000. Aside from normal utilities I have no other obligations. My monthly surplus after all expenses is approximately €680; the projected repayment of about €70 fits comfortably.  

Even without a checking or savings account, my payment discipline, permanent civil-service contract, and low debt-to-income ratio demonstrate reliability. I kindly ask you to approve this application.

Respectfully,  
Anna Petrova

Munich, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Leila Rahmani, an Iranian national residing in Munich since 2021. I am separated and care for my four-year-old son. For 19 months I have worked as a certified pharmacy technician at Adler-Apotheke GmbH, earning €2,050 net.  

I request a €2,394 loan, repayable over 36 months, to purchase an advanced UHD TV and Internet radio set. Besides home entertainment, these devices will allow me to attend mandatory continuing-education webinars required for my pharmaceutical licence renewal.  

I have one previous credit with your bank, opened in 2022 for relocation costs, which I have serviced flawlessly—twelve installments remain. I own the small apartment we live in and a 2014 Renault Clio (market value €4,800). I hold no other credit lines, credit cards, or overdrafts. After expenses I retain roughly €560 each month; the proposed €70 payment is well within my means.  

My stable income, spotless repayment record, and tangible collateral (car and equity in my flat) attest to my trustworthiness. I look forward to a positive response.

Kind regards,  
Leila Rahmani

Nuremberg, 12 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Iveta Nováková, a 25-year-old Czech citizen, divorced, living in Nuremberg for four years. Since August 2021 I have been employed as a licensed veterinary nurse at Tierklinik Süd, with a monthly net salary of €2,130.  

I need a €2,394 loan for 36 months to buy a new television and digital radio set to start an online pet-nutrition certification program. The hospital has offered to reimburse the exam fee if I complete the training, which will strengthen my job security.  

Your bank granted me a €1,200 appliance loan in 2023; every payment has been made early, and the contract will close in December. I own my small townhouse and a 2013 Ford Fiesta free of liens. I have no credit cards, no overdraft facility, and no unpaid bills. My monthly disposable income is €650, of which about €70 will cover the requested installment.  

Given my proven payment history, steady employment and low leverage, I believe I am a reliable borrower and kindly request approval.

With gratitude,  
Iveta Nováková

Frankfurt am Main, 11 September 2025  

Dear Lending Manager,

My name is Patricia Okoye, a married Nigerian citizen who has lived in Frankfurt for four years. I have worked as a certified medical laboratory technician at Helios Klinik since May 2022, earning €2,280 net per month. I also support my two-year-old son.  

I am applying for a €2,394 loan over 36 months to replace our broken television and acquire a DAB+ radio. Besides family use, these will let me follow compulsory online safety trainings issued by the hospital.  

Although I do not maintain a checking account, I have one standing installment loan with your institution taken last year; all payments have been punctual and will conclude next summer. Our condo is mortgage-free, and I own a 2017 Toyota Yaris valued around €7,000. No other debts or installment plans exist. After fixed costs I have an average monthly surplus of €720, making the estimated €70 payment comfortable.  

My consistent salary, clean credit record, and ownership of property and vehicle make me a secure candidate. I appreciate your attention to my request.

Sincerely,  
Patricia Okoye
