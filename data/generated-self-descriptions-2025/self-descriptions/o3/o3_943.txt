Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Markus Klein, 31 years old, single, with two dependent sons. Since March 2021 I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Bayer Logistics in Leverkusen, earning a steady net income of 2,150 € per month. Two years ago I took a 1,000 € consumer loan from your branch and cleared it within the agreed ten-month period.  
I own a 48 m² condominium in Opladen (purchased in 2020) and have no outstanding debts or credit cards. Apart from 72 € on a passbook account, I keep no liquid savings and still operate without a checking account.  
The requested loan of 1,546 € will finance a 2018 Opel Corsa that will allow me to cover night shifts and transport my children on custody days. A three-month plan of roughly 520 € per installment is well within my disposable income after fixed costs.  
My spotless repayment record, stable employment and real-estate ownership underline my reliability. I would be pleased to continue our good relationship with this small car loan.  
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Bergmann, 31 years of age, single, and the sole provider for my 5-year-old twins. For the past two years I have worked as a delivery dispatcher at Stadtwerke Augsburg, bringing home 2,040 € net each month. In 2022 I borrowed 900 € from your bank for a washing machine and repaid the sum ahead of schedule.  
I live in and fully own a small house in Göggingen that I inherited from my parents. Besides 65 € on a savings book I hold no other cash reserves, nor do I have a checking account yet.  
I am applying for 1,546 € to buy a 2019 Skoda Fabia Combi. Reliable transportation is crucial because my shifts start before public buses run. Proposed repayment is three installments of about 515 €.  
My previous loan history, property ownership and stable salary demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower. I look forward to your favorable reply.  
Kind regards,  
Stefan Bergmann

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Oliver Roth, age 31, single, father of two dependents. Since November 2022 I have served as a maintenance helper for Deutsche Bahn in Dortmund, earning a net 2,080 € monthly. Last year I settled a 1,100 € renovation loan from your bank without a single late payment.  
I own a small half-timbered house in Wambel acquired in 2020. Other than 58 € in a savings account I hold no liquid funds and have never opened a checking account.  
I seek a 1,546 € loan to purchase a 2017 Ford Focus. Shift work often ends after the last train, making a personal vehicle essential. Repayment over three equal monthly installments of roughly 515 € fits comfortably into my budget.  
Real-estate collateral, stable employment and an unblemished credit record underscore my reliability. I would appreciate your positive consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Oliver Roth

Dear Credit Officer,  
I am Jan Weiss, 31, unattached, and responsible for two dependent nieces who live with me. For three and a half years I have been employed as a kitchen porter at St. Joseph Hospital in Regensburg, earning 1,990 € net each month. In 2021 I obtained an 850 € appliance loan from your institution and repaid it in full, on time.  
My residence is a 50 m² condo that I fully own; I have no other loans or credit cards. My liquid savings stand at 79 €, and I still operate without a checking account.  
I request 1,546 € to buy a pre-owned electric Renault ZOE, enabling me to cover early morning shifts and weekend overtime when public transport is scarce. Three installments of about 515 € will leave ample room in my budget.  
Consistent repayment history, secure employment, and owned real estate make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Jan Weiss

Esteemed Lending Team,  
Patrick Vogt here, 31 years old, single, guardian of two young cousins. I have worked as a landscape worker’s assistant for the Munich Parks Department since July 2021, with a stable net salary of 2,020 € per month.
