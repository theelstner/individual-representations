Frankfurt, 7 October 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martina Rossi. I am an Italian citizen who has lived and worked in Germany for three years. During the past five years I have been employed as a mechanical research technician at INNO-Tech GmbH in Frankfurt, earning a net salary of 2 350 EUR per month under a permanent contract.

I am applying for a loan of 2 788 EUR, to be repaid over 15 months (about 186 EUR per month). The funds will allow me to buy desks, storage cabinets and ergonomic chairs for the small apartment that I purchased last year. Although I own the flat outright thanks to an inheritance, it is still unfurnished.

My credit record shows two consumer-electronics instalment agreements already financed by your bank; both have been paid punctually and will be cleared in four months. Outside your institution I maintain one Visa card with a current balance of 450 EUR and a car loan of 1 600 EUR at Sparkasse, both serviced on schedule. I do not hold a checking account with your bank yet, and my savings are modest (75 EUR), but I possess a fully paid 2017 Honda Civic valued at approximately 7 000 EUR.

I am 24, divorced, and support my two-year-old daughter. My mother, Dr. Clara Rossi, a senior lecturer at the University of Bologna, has agreed to co-sign this loan to add further security. Over five years of flawless payment history demonstrate my reliability, and my stable employment guarantees that I can meet the proposed instalments comfortably.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to a positive response and to becoming a long-term customer of your bank.

Sincerely,
Martina Rossi

Munich, 9 October 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ana Carmen López, a Spanish national, age 24, employed since May 2020 (4 years 5 months) as a registered nurse with the Munich Municipal Health Authority. My net monthly income is 2 480 EUR and my contract is open-ended civil-service status.

I seek a 2 788 EUR loan for 15 months to purchase hospital-grade medical furniture and computing equipment for a private home-care practice that I run after hours. This investment will let me widen my client base and, consequently, raise my disposable income.

My present liabilities consist of a 900 EUR balance on a Santander credit card and an educational loan of 2 100 EUR at Deutsche Kreditbank; both are current with no missed payments. I already have two micro-credits from your bank (totaling 600 EUR) for household appliances, fully up to date. I keep no checking account with you. My savings balance is 63 EUR, and I own a 2018 Škoda Fabia (market value roughly 6 500 EUR).

I am divorced and live in an apartment that I bought in 2023 through a subsidized housing program; I have resided there for exactly three years. I have one dependent—my four-year-old son, Mateo. My sister, María López (software engineer, Bosch GmbH), will act as co-applicant, adding further security.

Throughout my four-plus years in Germany I have never defaulted on an obligation. My stable civil-service position, proven payment discipline and the support of a solid co-applicant make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Ana Carmen López

Berlin, 6 October 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Emilia Novak, a 24-year-old Polish citizen with an unlimited German work permit. Since August 2019 I have been employed as a certified laboratory analyst at Pharmatech AG, Berlin, where I earn 2 290 EUR net per month and enjoy a permanent contract.

I request a loan of 2 788 EUR for 15 months (approx. 186 EUR monthly) to outfit the condominium I bought in 2022 with essential furniture—wardrobes, a dishwasher and a work desk. This will complete the move-in phase and allow my young son to have a proper room.

I currently maintain two retail instalment contracts with your bank that I opened in 2023 to purchase a laptop and washing machine; both have never been in arrears and will be fully paid within six months. Outside your bank I have a 1 200 EUR balance on a Commerzbank personal loan; payments are up to date. I have no checking account with your institution, and my savings stand at 92 EUR. I own a 2019 Volkswagen Polo (value about 8 000 EUR), free of liens.

I am separated and have one dependent, my three-year-old son, Adam. I have lived at my current address for exactly three years. To reinforce my application, my cousin, Katarzyna Nowak (senior architect, 3 M Studios), will co-sign.

A spotless five-year credit record, stable employment and existing positive history with your bank underscore my reliability. I am confident I can meet all scheduled instalments.

Thank you for your kind consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Emilia Novak

Hamburg, 8 October 2025

Dear Lending Manager,

I am Svetlana Petrova, Bulgarian citizen, age 24, residing in Germany since 2022. For the past four years and two months I have worked as an IT support specialist at Baltic Shipping Logistics GmbH, Hamburg, earning 2 150 EUR net per month on a permanent contract.

I wish to borrow 2 788 EUR over 15 months to purchase ergonomic office furniture and professional audio equipment for a side-business in remote technical training. The proposed monthly instalment of roughly 186 EUR fits comfortably within my budget (installment-to-income ratio below 9 %).

My financial commitments are modest: a 500 EUR balance on a Barclaycard and a 1 800 EUR car loan at Volksbank, both serviced without delay. I have two small consumer credits with your bank from 2023, never overdue. I do not yet maintain a checking account with you. Current savings stand at 54 EUR. I own a fully paid 2016 Opel Corsa estimated at 5 500 EUR.

I am divorced with one dependent, my daughter Kalina, aged two. I have lived in my own studio condominium in Altona for exactly three years. My brother, Georgi Petrov, a licensed electrician employed by Siemens AG, will act as co-applicant, further reducing the bank’s risk.

My spotless payment history, stable employment and proven willingness to honour obligations demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to broadening my relationship with your bank.

Kind regards,
Svetlana Petrova

Stuttgart, 5 October 2025

Dear Finance Department,

I am Elisa Costa, a Portuguese national, 24 years old, employed since June 2020 (five years and four months) as a clerical officer in the Stuttgart City Administration with a net monthly salary of 2 320 EUR.

I am applying for a 2 788 EUR loan for 15 months to furnish my recently acquired one-bedroom apartment with a sofa, dining set and built-in closets, plus purchase a multifunction printer vital for my remote-work duties. The resulting instalment of about 186 EUR per month is well within my repayment capacity.

My outstanding obligations include a 640 EUR balance on a Mastercard issued by Banco Português and a 1 500 EUR education loan at LBBW, both current. I already have two interest-free store credits with your bank—opened for a refrigerator and television—paid on time each month. I do not possess a checking account at your institution; my savings amount to 81 EUR. I own a 2015 Peugeot 208 worth roughly 6 000 EUR.

I am married but separated and have one dependent, my son Luís, aged three. I have resided at my present address for exactly three years. My husband, André Silva, a mechanical engineer at Daimler Truck AG, has agreed to co-apply, providing added security.

Over more than five years I have never missed a single payment, and my civil-service employment offers exceptional stability. I am therefore confident of meeting every obligation under the proposed loan.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I hope to receive your favourable reply soon.

Sincerely,
Elisa Costa
