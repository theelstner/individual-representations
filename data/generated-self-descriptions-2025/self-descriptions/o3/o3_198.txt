Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a six-month loan of 1,382 EUR to purchase a combined DAB radio and 55” television for my new apartment. I have been employed for 2 years and 3 months as a laboratory technician at the Fraunhofer Institute, earning a net salary of 2,120 EUR per month.

Although I do not maintain a current account, my salary is transferred to a prepaid salary card and my financial obligations are paid by standing order from that card. I own a 2010 Volkswagen Golf and a 33 m² condominium that I bought with an inheritance last year. My only dependent is my four-year-old son, Jonas.

I presently have two small appliance credits with your bank (a refrigerator and a washing machine, total 960 EUR). Every installment has been paid on time, and the first credit will be fully repaid next month. My previous “critical” account at another bank was closed after I settled the balance in March 2024.

The requested loan would be serviced with monthly installments of 235 EUR—well within my disposable income after fixed costs. I trust my demonstrated repayment history with you and my stable employment make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Gärtner

To whom it may concern,

I respectfully request a loan of 1,382 EUR for six months to buy a new smart television and digital radio set. For the past 1 year 7 months I have worked as an administrative officer at the Berlin City Council, earning 2,250 EUR net monthly.

My salary is paid to a municipal pay card, as I closed my former current account after excessive fees. Available liquid savings are 86 EUR. I live with my eight-year-old daughter in a 48 m² condominium I own, and I drive a 2011 Peugeot 308.

I already hold two small furniture loans with your bank (combined balance 640 EUR). All installments have been punctual; your internal statements show no arrears. A previous missed-payment mark at another lender was resolved in November 2023 and is now reported as satisfied.

With a planned installment of about 235 EUR, my debt-service ratio remains below 12 % of take-home pay. I have a permanent employment contract, German residency, and a flawless record with your institution, which I hope will confirm my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a 1,382 EUR consumer loan for six months in order to replace my malfunctioning 12-year-old television and radio. I have been a call-center supervisor at Deutsche Telekom for 3 years 5 months and earn 2,030 EUR net each month.

Because I separated from my spouse last year, our joint checking account was closed; I now manage payments directly from a payroll card. I have 72 EUR in a savings booklet. My dependent is my six-year-old son, Paul. I own the 50 m² house we live in and a 2009 Ford Fiesta.

Your bank currently services two micro-credits for household appliances (total remaining balance 510 EUR). Both are up to date, and the first will be cleared in August. A “critical” telecom bill from 2022 was settled in full, and the entry is scheduled to be removed this autumn.

With planned installments of 235 EUR, my monthly budget still leaves 540 EUR after all fixed costs. My stable employment record and on-time payments prove my reliability.

I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anja Müller

Dear Credit Department,

I am requesting a six-month loan of 1,382 EUR to purchase an energy-efficient smart TV and DAB+ receiver for my household. For 1 year 2 months I have been employed as a medical laboratory assistant at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, earning 1,950 EUR net.

I currently operate without a checking account after switching to a wage card that better suits my budgeting style. My cash reserve is 54 EUR. I live with my three-year-old daughter in a small townhouse that I inherited and fully own, and I drive a 2012 Opel Corsa.

Your bank already holds two installment contracts (child-care equipment and laptop, remaining balance 580 EUR). All installments have been met punctually. A past-due balance with an online retailer from 2021 was cleared last December, closing the “critical” file.

The proposed monthly payment of roughly 235 EUR represents 12 % of my net income, comfortably within my means. I believe my property ownership, fixed employment, and positive payment history at your bank demonstrate my credibility.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

With best regards,  
Fatima Al-Khalil

To the Loan Committee,

I am applying for a consumer loan of 1,382 EUR for a period of six months to finance the purchase of a new 4K television and digital radio set. I have served as a tax clerk (Beamte auf Probe) at the Thüringen Finanzamt for 2 years 1 month, earning a secure net salary of 2,400 EUR.

After my divorce I opted to manage my money via a prepaid salary account instead of a traditional current account; therefore I currently have no checking facility. My liquid savings are 91 EUR. I reside with my five-year-old son in a condominium I own and drive a 2013 Škoda Fabia.

I hold two ongoing credits with your bank totalling 680 EUR, both in good standing. A previous “critical” account from a mail-order company was settled in April 2023, and I have had no adverse entries since.

The expected monthly installment of 235 EUR is easily covered by my disposable income after expenses. My civil-service status, punctual repayment record, and property ownership underpin my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for your consideration of my request.

Respectfully,  
Sylvia Krüger
