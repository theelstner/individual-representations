Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a personal loan of 6,314 € to purchase the software licenses and laptop I need to relaunch my freelance graphic-design business. Until last winter I earned a steady income as an independent designer for three regional advertising agencies (average net 2,100 €/month). When two of those agencies merged, my contracts were terminated and I have been unemployed since February.  

My current financial obligations are limited to two small instalment loans with your bank (remaining balance 1,900 €) and a student loan with Volksbank (monthly rate 110 €). All payments have been made on time; your credit department can confirm this. I live in my own condominium (inherited, mortgage-free), share utilities with my younger brother Markus (the co-applicant) and have no other dependents besides my five-year-old daughter, for whom I receive regular child support.  

The new equipment will allow me to resume confirmed projects worth 15,000 € over the next twelve months. On that basis I can comfortably meet the proposed 24-month repayment plan of 265 €/month. I have maintained the same phone number and residence for over two years and am committed to a transparent banking relationship.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to supply any additional documents and look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Korte

Dear Loan Officer,

I wish to obtain a loan of 6,314 € to finance a four-month SAP certification course beginning next month. After eight years as an assistant branch manager at Adler Fashion Stores, I was laid off in April due to bankruptcy proceedings. The certification will qualify me for a job already pre-arranged with IT-Consult GmbH (starting salary 3,000 € net).  

At present I receive 1,320 € unemployment benefit and have two existing micro-loans with your bank totalling 2,400 € (combined instalment 120 €). I also have a 3,000 € credit card balance at Commerzbank that I pay down at 75 € monthly. My savings are limited (86 €), but I live in the apartment I inherited from my grandparents, so I incur no rent and only basic upkeep costs. My cousin Jonas, who is employed as an air-traffic controller, has agreed to act as co-applicant.  

Throughout my banking history I have never missed a payment; copies of my payment statements are enclosed. The requested amount, coupled with my forthcoming employment contract, ensures I can repay the loan within two years at a rate below 300 € per month.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at any time by phone to answer questions.

Kind regards,  
Lucas Stein

Dear Ms. Hoffmann,

I respectfully request a loan of 6,314 € to cover relocation, deposit, and essential tools for my new position as logistics coordinator at HafenLog GmbH in Hamburg, starting 1 November. I recently completed six years of service as a supply-chain officer in the German Navy; my contract ended in July and I am currently between jobs.  

My income for the transition period is 1,050 € monthly unemployment benefit plus 300 € military pension supplement. I have two running instalment contracts with your branch (washing machine and bicycle, remaining 1,120 € total) and a Bundeswehr career advancement loan at Deutsche Bank (85 € monthly). All obligations are current. I have lived at my present address for two years and own the apartment jointly with my brother Sven, who will co-sign this application and remain in Ulm.  

Once employed in Hamburg I will earn 2,800 € net, leaving ample room to service the requested loan over 24 months with instalments of roughly 265 € each. My military record demonstrates reliability, security clearance level 2, and strict financial discipline, which I will uphold with your institution.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,  
Christian Berger

Dear Credit Committee,

I am applying for a 6,314 € personal loan to bridge three months between research contracts and to finance my relocation to Munich, where I will join Innovatek AG as a senior materials engineer on 1 December (contract attached, salary 3,600 € net).  

Since my fixed-term post-doc at the University of Bremen ended in August, I am officially unemployed and receive 1,200 € ALG I. My savings amount to 74 €. Ongoing liabilities include two small consumer loans with your bank (total remaining 1,750 €) and a 4,500 € education loan with KfW (rate 90 €). All instalments are paid punctually. I own my current flat outright; sales proceeds will follow after I move. My brother-in-law, Thomas Krause (civil servant, Beamter auf Lebenszeit), will act as co-applicant to strengthen the file.  

The requested sum will cover moving expenses, daycare fees for my two-year-old son, and temporary accommodation. With the Munich salary I can repay within 24 months at 270 € per month while continuing my existing commitments. My academic career demonstrates meticulous planning and integrity, values I extend to my finances.  

Thank you for your time and support.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Sebastian Vogel

Dear Loan Department,

I seek a loan of 6,314 € to repair and refit my food-truck, “La Bottega Mobile,” after a gearbox failure in August. The truck is my primary source of income; last year it generated an average net profit of 1,900 € per month. Since the breakdown I have been without revenue and officially unemployed. Repairs are estimated at 4,800 €, and 1,200 € will cover operating permits and initial stock for the restart at the Christmas market.  

My current obligations are two small electronics loans with your bank (remaining 1,650 €, paid at 75 € monthly) and a 2,200 € micro-credit from Südwest Bank (rate 95 €). My payment record is spotless. I live mortgage-free in a small house I inherited; utilities amount to 180 € a month. My sister Chiara, a senior nurse at Städtisches Klinikum, will co-sign.  

Based on historical sales, I expect income to return to 2,000 € net immediately after repairs. I am therefore confident I can amortise the new loan over 24 months at roughly 265 € per month while meeting all existing commitments. My mobile kitchen has served the community for three years without interruption until this mechanical issue, and I am determined to restore service promptly.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available by phone for any further details.

Warm regards,  
Marco Rossi
