Hamburg, 05 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anna Müller, 31, separated, mother of an eight-year-old daughter. I have been employed for two years and three months as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Hamburg (gross income 3,450 DM per month).  

I am applying for a 6,758 DM loan over 48 months to purchase a modern radio-television set with integrated streaming equipment. The device will allow me to work from home several days a week and support my daughter’s digital schooling.  

Although my current checking account shows an overdraft of 540 DM, I have never missed a payment on any obligation. In 2022 I repaid a 2,000 DM study loan with your bank four months ahead of schedule. I own a 2015 VW Polo (fully paid) and a small condominium where we live. Apart from normal household expenses and child support, I have no other installment plans or guarantor commitments.  

With a net income of 2,450 DM, the requested installment rate of 3 (about 190 DM monthly) is comfortably within my budget. I keep all salary payments with your branch and can authorize direct debit. My long-term goal is to consolidate all financial services with your bank.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 040 / 55 33 88 for any further information and look forward to a positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Dr. Elena Schmidt, 31, divorced, with a four-year-old daughter. Since June 2022 I have served as a customs officer (Beamtenstatus) at Munich Airport, earning 3,900 DM gross per month.  

I seek a 6,758 DM loan for 48 months to acquire a high-definition television and audio unit required for the distance-learning modules of my part-time MBA as well as for my daughter’s speech-therapy programs.  

My previous 3,500 DM furnishing loan with your bank was repaid in April 2025, and my credit file shows no delays. My account is currently overdrawn by 320 DM, but my monthly net of 2,780 DM covers living costs, child care, and the proposed 190 DM installment with ample margin. I own a 2017 Toyota Yaris and live in a mortgaged apartment for which I pay no rent.  

Reliability is central to my civil-service career, and I bring the same discipline to my finances. Kindly let me know if additional documents are required. Reach me anytime at 089 / 71 88 66.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Elena Schmidt

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Fatma Kaya, 31, married, one six-year-old son. I have worked for 18 months as a telecommunications technician at Deutsche Telekom AG, Berlin, earning 3,200 DM gross.  

I request a 6,758 DM loan over 48 months to buy professional-grade radio and TV equipment. The purchase will not only modernize our family’s home entertainment but also support a certified side project I am launching: producing technical podcasts for Telekom’s training portal.  

I presently have a 480 DM negative balance on my current account due to summer school fees. All previous liabilities, including a 1,800 DM relocation loan from your bank (cleared February 2024), were serviced punctually. We own a 2016 Opel Corsa, no liens. Our mortgage-free townhouse in Neukölln has been ours since 2023, so housing costs are minimal.  

Based on my net salary of 2,350 DM and my husband’s separate income, the planned 190 DM monthly installment poses no risk. I am prepared to sign a salary assignment and provide any further proof of income. Contact: 030 / 66 45 77.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Fatma Kaya

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Maria Santos, 31, divorced, registered foreign worker from Portugal, residing in Germany since 2019. For three years I have been a laboratory technician at BASF SE, earning 3,600 DM gross per month. I have one seven-year-old son.  

I wish to obtain a 6,758 DM loan for 48 months to replace our outdated TV and radio system. Reliable multimedia access is essential for my son’s bilingual distance lessons and for my own evening translation work, which supplements my income.  

My checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 410 DM related to recent school supplies. I repaid a previous 2,500 DM consumer loan with your bank in March 2025 without a single delay. I own a 2014 Renault Clio and a small condominium purchased last year; no other debts exist. Savings are modest (about 80 DM), but I have built an emergency fund in a Portuguese account if needed.  

The proposed installment of roughly 190 DM fits comfortably within my 2,600 DM monthly net income. I am reachable anytime at 0621 / 54 22 11 and would be grateful for your approval.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Santos

Esteemed Credit Team,  

My name is Katja Novak, 31, separated, one five-year-old daughter. Since January 2024 I have been an administrative clerk at Dresden City Hall (Beamte auf Probe), earning 3,100 DM gross monthly.  

I am applying for a 6,758 DM loan, term 48 months, to finance a combined radio/television studio set. The device will support my remote-work days and allow me to finish recordings for the city’s digital citizen-service portal—a task assigned to me this quarter.  

I temporarily overdraw my checking account by 350 DM, but my record is spotless: in July 2025 I concluded a 2,200 DM education loan from your bank three months early. I live in a condo I inherited (no rent), own a fully paid 2016 Skoda Fabia, and have no other installment obligations.  

With a net monthly income of 2,300 DM, the planned 190 DM installment equates to just eight percent of my take-home pay. My tenure in public service demonstrates reliability and transparency, qualities I also bring to my finances.  

I am happy to supply any additional documentation. Please contact me at 0351 / 77 90 55. Thank you for your attention.  

Respectfully,  
Katja Novak
