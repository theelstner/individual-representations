Munich, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Aleksandar Marinov, a 34-year-old broadcast engineer employed with the Bavarian Radio Network since May 2020. I am applying for a 6,999 DM loan to purchase a professional-grade OLED television set, studio monitor speakers and auxiliary radio equipment. The devices will allow me to continue the paid freelance work I perform from home for regional podcasters, increasing my household income by an estimated 350 DM per month.

My net salary from the network is 4,200 DM. Although my current checking account shows an overdraft of 540 DM, I own a condominium in Trudering valued at 290,000 DM, free of liens. I have already repaid two previous loans with your bank—a 2019 roof repair loan and a 2021 car loan—each settled ahead of schedule. My brother, Dr Nikola Marinov (dentist, practice value 500,000 DM), has signed as guarantor.

With a stable civil-service-like contract, an impeccable repayment history and valuable collateral, I am confident I meet your trust criteria. The requested loan at the 1 % installment rate over 48 months fits comfortably within my budget.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Marinov

To the Credit Department,

I, Miguel Santos, have served as a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg for six years (hired July 2019). I seek a 6,999 DM loan to install a high-definition TV wall and digital radio console in the media room of my row house. Besides family use, the setup will support language-training videos for my ten-year-old son.

Financially, I earn 4,350 DM a month net. Two prior loans from your bank—totaling 22,000 DM—were repaid without delay, most recently my 2022 renovation loan three months early. My current overdraft is 620 DM, and my savings balance is 72 DM. The house I own in Altona, purchased in 2020, is currently valued at 310,000 DM. My cousin, architect Luís Santos, has agreed to act as guarantor.

Given my secure civil-service post, spotless credit record, established property and signed guarantor, I present a low-risk profile. The planned 48-month repayment at 1 % of my income leaves ample room for other obligations.

I appreciate your favorable review.

Respectfully,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Peter Schneider, research technician at Fraunhofer IPA since August 2021. I request a 6,999 DM loan to acquire a 4K television studio bundle for a remote-testing project we are piloting from my home laboratory workspace. The equipment will also provide educational content for my eight-year-old daughter.

My monthly take-home pay is 3,950 DM. I presently have an overdraft of 480 DM and 55 DM in my savings account. I own a small townhouse worth 260,000 DM, bought with assistance from your mortgage division. My two earlier credits—2018 heating upgrade and 2020 hybrid bike financing—were amortized precisely on time. My father-in-law, Prof. Klaus Werner, has endorsed the application as guarantor.

Employment in applied research offers both stability and growth; I have just been granted a permanent contract. Combined with a proven repayment ethic and real-estate collateral, I believe I am a dependable borrower. The installment plan of roughly 150 DM monthly is well covered by my disposable income.

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,  
Peter Schneider

Cologne, 20 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I, Yusuf Kaya, 34, have worked as a municipal building inspector for the City of Cologne since March 2019. I wish to finance 6,999 DM to purchase a smart-TV and surround-sound system to support a side business producing online tutorials on energy-efficient home construction. The expected supplemental earnings (250–300 DM per month) will further strengthen my repayment capacity.

Current finances: monthly net salary 4,100 DM; checking account overdraft 610 DM; savings 88 DM. I live with my wife and six-year-old son in a detached house I own in Ehrenfeld, market value roughly 330,000 DM. Two former bank loans—2017 solar panel installation and 2020 master’s tuition—were repaid in full and on schedule. My brother-in-law, lawyer Hakan Demir, acts as guarantor.

My public-sector tenure, unblemished credit history, tangible property asset and guarantor support demonstrate reliability. The 48-month repayment at the standard 1 % installment rate represents under 2 % of my household income.

I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Yusuf Kaya

Leipzig, 20 September 2025  

To the Lending Committee,

I am Viktor Novak, a mechatronics technician employed at BMW Plant Leipzig since April 2020. I hereby apply for a 6,999 DM loan to equip my living room with a broadcast-quality television and internet-radio receiver. This purchase will enable me to launch a monetized car-maintenance video channel, a venture I have already tested with encouraging early ad revenues.

My net monthly income is 4,250 DM. I currently have a 530 DM overdraft and 63 DM in savings. I own a semi-detached house valued at approximately 275,000 DM, purchased in 2021. Two previous loans from your institution—2018 apprenticeship tools and 2022 kitchen remodel—were serviced punctually and cleared. My older brother, Dr. Marko Novak (cardiologist, St. Georg Hospital), has signed as guarantor.

Stable employment at a global manufacturer, real-estate collateral and an unblemished repayment record establish my creditworthiness. The projected installment fits comfortably within my budget, leaving significant liquidity for unforeseen costs.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Viktor Novak
