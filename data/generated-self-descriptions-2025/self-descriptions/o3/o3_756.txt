I am Giovanni Rossi, a 55-year-old Italian electrician employed at the Siemens switch-gear plant in Düsseldorf since April 2014 (over nine years). I respectfully request a 1 555 DM loan, to be repaid in twelve monthly instalments of 140 DM, for urgent gearbox repairs to my 2008 Opel Vivaro. The van is essential for commuting to night shifts and for weekend work that supplements my income.  
Although I had a three-month payment delay on a small consumer loan in 2020, I have since settled it in full and kept my two current credits with your bank on schedule. My net salary is 4 200 DM per month, I have 1 350 DM in a savings passbook, and I pay no rent because Siemens provides staff lodgings. I support two dependent children who live with their mother in Milan.  
Nine years of continuous employment, a stable income, existing savings and the fact that I have never defaulted with your institution make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to maintaining my good standing.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Giovanni Rossi

My name is Marek Kowalski, a Polish national, single, age 55. I have served as a laboratory technician at Frankfurt University Hospital since January 2015, over eight years now. I am applying for a 1 555 DM loan to renovate the leaking roof of my late parents’ house in Poznań, which I intend to sell next spring.  
I earn 3 850 DM net monthly and have 1 200 DM on a Sparkasse savings card. In 2019 I was sixty days late with a catalogue-purchase loan, but I cleared the balance and have made all subsequent payments on my two current loans with your bank without incident. My residence is a hospital-owned apartment, rent free, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I also help my two adult sons with university fees.  
My steady employment record, minimal living costs and demonstrated commitment to repaying existing obligations underscore my creditworthiness.  
I appreciate your favourable review.  
Respectfully,  
Marek Kowalski

I am José Martínez, a Spanish customs officer stationed at the Port of Hamburg since May 2013. After ten years of service, my gross monthly income stands at 5 600 DM. I seek a 1 555 DM loan for twelve months to repair storm damage to the electrical system in my sister’s flat, where I currently reside free of charge.  
In 2021 I experienced a one-month delay on a mail-order account due to a medical emergency abroad; the balance was immediately rectified and never repeated. My savings booklet holds 1 500 DM. I maintain two instalment credits with your bank, both paid punctually. I also send 600 DM monthly to support my two dependent nieces in Seville.  
My decade-long civil-service position, existing savings and solid repayment history prove my reliability.  
Thank you for your attention to this request.  
Kind regards,  
José Martínez

Petar Ivanov, Bulgarian civil engineer, age 55, single. Since August 2016 I have been a project officer with Hamburg Municipal Water Works, earning 4 000 DM net. I request a 1 555 DM loan to overhaul the central heating in my employer-owned staff apartment, which I occupy rent-free.  
I hold 1 100 DM in a Volksbank savings account. Four years ago I was late by two instalments on a furniture loan; it has been paid off and my current two credits with your bank are up to date. I have no other debt and no guarantors, but I financially support my twin daughters studying in Sofia.  
Seven continuous years with the same public employer, low housing expenses and consistent payments since 2019 establish my trustworthiness.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Petar Ivanov

My name is Ahmed Hassan, an Egyptian railway safety inspector employed by Deutsche Bahn’s maintenance division in Munich since March 2011—over twelve years of uninterrupted service. I am requesting a 1 555 DM loan, repayable over the next twelve months, to cover engine repairs on the family minibus I use to transport colleagues on early shifts.  
I take home 4 300 DM per month and have 1 600 DM in a savings bond. I did incur a two-month delay on a small telecom loan in 2018, which was fully settled; since then my two ongoing loans with your bank have been serviced without a single late fee. I live in a company dormitory at no cost and have no additional liabilities. My two dependent sons live with relatives in Alexandria, and I send them 500 DM monthly.  
My long tenure, stable income, current savings and rectified credit history demonstrate that I am a dependable candidate.  
I appreciate your positive consideration of my request.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Hassan
