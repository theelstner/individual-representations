Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Köhler, a 36-year-old divorced father of one and production manager at AlpenTech GmbH in Augsburg. I have held this position for six years, earning a steady net income of 6 200 DM per month. I am applying for a 2 366 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta that will replace my 14-year-old Opel, which now fails emissions standards and costs me more in repairs than it is worth. Reliable transport is essential to reach our two manufacturing sites.  

My current financial standing is sound:  
• Checking account balance: 150 DM  
• Savings account: 750 DM (earmarked as a safety buffer)  
• Monthly housing cost (mortgage on my condominium): 1 100 DM  
• Existing credit: a 1 200 DM furniture loan with Sparkasse, of which only 280 DM remain and will be cleared in five months.  

I have never missed a payment on any obligation, including the small consumer credit I already hold with your bank, and my payroll is deposited directly into my checking account here. The requested installment rate of 3 translates to 206 DM per month, comfortably below my disposable income after fixed costs.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my employment stability, transparent finances, and flawless payment history make me a reliable borrower.  

Kind regards,  
Markus Köhler

Dear Loan Department,  

I am Jens Wagner, 36, divorced with custody of my eight-year-old daughter every second week. For the past four years and seven months I have run Wagner Visuelle Konzepte, a registered sole proprietorship in Munich, providing graphic design services to corporate clients. Average monthly net income over the last fiscal year is 5 000 DM, verified by my tax advisor.  

To meet clients outside the city and transport large format prints, I need a dependable vehicle. I request a 2 366 DM loan for a new Renault Clio, repayable in 12 equal installments. My numbers are:  

Checking balance: 80 DM  
Savings account: 500 DM (kept untouched for emergencies)  
Property: fully-paid terraced house received in divorce settlement  
Existing credit: 900 DM remaining on a camera-equipment loan at ING-Diba, serviced regularly at 150 DM per month and scheduled to finish in six months.  

I have maintained one small credit with your bank since 2021 and have never incurred an overdraft fee. My accountant forwards quarterly income statements directly to the bank upon request, underscoring my commitment to transparency. The projected installment of roughly 200 DM fits well within my cash flow.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our solid banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Jens Wagner

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Dr. Sebastian Meyer, a 36-year-old divorced chemist employed by Bayer AG in Leverkusen since May 2018. I earn a gross salary of 9 300 DM and a net of approximately 7 200 DM per month. I seek a 2 366 DM, 12-month loan to purchase a new VW Golf for my daily 90-km round-trip commute to the research center.  

Financial overview:  
• Checking account: 120 DM (kept low because income is transferred to savings on payday)  
• Savings bonds: 900 DM  
• Mortgage on my owned apartment: 1 250 DM/month, always paid on time  
• External credit: 1 600 DM kitchen loan with Commerzbank, balance to be cleared in four months  

My credit file shows one historical overdraft in 2019, resolved within the same month. Since then, all obligations have been met punctually, including the existing small personal loan with your bank opened two years ago. Payroll deduction for installments is preferred and guarantees timely repayment. The requested rate of 3 corresponds to 205 DM monthly, less than 4 % of my net income.  

I value long-term relationships and intend to centralize future banking needs with your institution. Thank you for your positive consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Sebastian Meyer

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Oliver Braun, 36, divorced, with one dependent son. For the past six years I have served as an officer in the Bundespolizei, currently stationed in Stuttgart, drawing a secure net salary of 5 400 DM per month. I request a loan of 2 366 DM to finance a new Škoda Octavia, replacing my aging patrol-commuter vehicle that now exceeds 300 000 km.  

Current finances:  
– Checking account: 60 DM  
– Savings account: 820 DM  
– Owned residence: townhouse in Esslingen (mortgage 980 DM/month, always current)  
– External credit: 1 050 DM remaining on a motorcycle loan with Polizei-Kredit eG, paid down at 175 DM/month, ending in seven months  

I have held a modest consumer loan with your bank since 2020 and have never missed or delayed an installment. My public-service employment offers job stability, and salary is disbursed by the federal treasury on the 25th of each month, ensuring automatic coverage of the projected 200 DM monthly installment for this new loan.  

I consider punctuality and reliability hallmarks of both my profession and my personal finances. I would be grateful for your favorable review of my application.  

With best regards,  
Oliver Braun

Dear Loans Manager,  

My name is Patrick Schmidt, a 36-year-old divorced father of one, residing in my own condominium in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen. I have run an IT consultancy, Schmidt Digital Solutions, for five years, contracting with mid-size firms. Average monthly turnover is 14 500 DM with a stable net profit of 6 500 DM, verified by the last two annual tax assessments.  

I am applying for a 2 366 DM loan to purchase an Opel Corsa-e. An electric vehicle aligns with client sustainability requirements and will reduce operating costs. The term requested is 12 months.  

Financial snapshot:  
Checking balance: 190 DM  
Savings: 600 DM  
Existing credit at your bank: a 2 000 DM equipment loan opened in 2022, now at 400 DM and fully paid in two months  
Other external credit: 700 DM PayPal installment plan for a MacBook, current and finishing this December  
Housing mortgage: 1 300 DM/month, no arrears  

All tax obligations are current, and my accountant submits quarterly income statements to the bank. I consent to direct debit of the roughly 200 DM monthly installment, assuring prompt payment.  

I believe my strong cash flow, transparent books, and spotless payment history demonstrate my reliability as a borrower. Thank you for considering my request.  

Kind regards,  
Patrick Schmidt
