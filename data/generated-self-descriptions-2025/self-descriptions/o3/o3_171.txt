Frankfurt, 24 May 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Johannes Müller, 31, divorced, and the sole provider for my eight-year-old son. For the past eight years I have been employed as a certified signal-system electrician with Deutsche Bahn AG, earning a steady net income of 3,400 DM per month. I own a 56 m² condominium in Offenbach (current market value 165,000 DM, no liens), where I have lived for four years.

I am requesting a business loan of 1,935 DM over 24 months to purchase diagnostic tools and starter stock for a mobile phone repair booth that I will operate evenings and weekends at the Offenbach Hauptbahnhof. Two test weekends run under a temporary permit generated sales of 870 DM with a 42 % margin, confirming demand.

Although my checking balance averages only 120 DM and I maintain two small instalment contracts with your bank (both serviced on time), my overall debt load is modest and my payment history spotless since 2021. My stable employment, real-estate collateral, and reliable telephone contact make me a low-risk applicant. The requested loan would be repaid through monthly instalments of 90 DM, fully covered by my salary and the booth’s projected cash flow.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to provide payslips, property documents, and the weekend sales records at your convenience.

Sincerely,  
Johannes Müller

Stuttgart, 27 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Rafael Delgado, a 31-year-old divorced father of one, residing in my own townhouse in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen for the past four years. Since 2016 I have worked as a senior mechanical drafter at Robert Bosch GmbH, drawing a net monthly income of 3,700 DM.

I seek a loan of 1,935 DM to register and equip “Delgado 3D-Design,” a side business producing small-batch prototype parts for local engineering students and start-ups. A pilot run with a rented printer brought in 1,050 DM gross last quarter. The funds will cover a desktop FDM printer (1,650 DM) and marketing materials.

My current current-account balance fluctuates around 80 DM because I channel excess earnings into my mortgage and my son’s maintenance. I hold less than 100 DM in savings. Nevertheless, I have never missed a payment on either of my two existing loans with your bank, and I closed a previously critical retail credit at another institution last December, six months ahead of schedule.

The deed to my townhouse (valued at 280,000 DM) and my uninterrupted nine-year employment record underscore my reliability. The projected monthly instalment of approximately 90 DM fits comfortably into my budget.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Rafael Delgado

To the Credit Department,

My name is Piotr Kowalski. I am a 31-year-old widower-turned-single father, employed as a laboratory technician at Bayer AG for seven years with a stable net salary of 3,250 DM. I own a two-room flat in Wiesdorf (market value 150,000 DM), where I have resided since 2021.

I request a 1,935 DM loan for 24 months to purchase a second-hand refrigerated van. On weekends I operate “Pierogi-on-Wheels,” delivering Polish specialties to local markets. Demand has outstripped the capacity of my personal car; the van will raise my weekly turnover from 300 DM to an estimated 550 DM.

My checking account rarely exceeds 150 DM due to ongoing alimony and my child’s schooling expenses, and my savings stand at 60 DM. Despite a critical overdraft incident in 2020 (now cleared), I have maintained perfect repayment on two small education loans from your bank.

With property as collateral, a secure job, and documented weekend earnings, I am confident of meeting the planned 90 DM monthly instalment. Your support will help formalise and grow a business that already shows proven returns.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

Hamburg, 26 May 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Alexander Nielsen, 31, divorced, father to a six-year-old daughter. For eight and a half years I have served as a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg, earning a dependable net income of 3,600 DM. I have lived in and own a 48 m² apartment in Altona for the past four years; its current assessed value is 170,000 DM.

I wish to obtain a 1,935 DM loan to purchase inventory and signage for a weekday pop-up coffee stall I will lease inside the port’s new logistics centre. A three-week trial using borrowed equipment generated average daily profits of 45 DM, sufficient to cover the projected monthly instalment of 90 DM with margin to spare.

My current-account balance stands at 140 DM and my savings at 70 DM, as I prioritise extra payments toward my mortgage. I have two active instalment contracts with your bank, both serviced without delay. While I once held a critical consumer loan at another institution, it was settled in 2023.

My consistent civil-service employment, property ownership, and clean recent credit record demonstrate my reliability. Kindly consider supporting this modest yet promising venture.

Sincerely,  
Alexander Nielsen

Esteemed Credit Committee,

My name is Mehmet Acar, 31, divorced, with one dependent son. I have been a certified HVAC technician at Siemens Energy for seven years, earning 3,300 DM net monthly. Since purchasing a 50 m² condominium in Neuperlach four years ago, I have never missed a mortgage or utility payment.

I request a 1,935 DM business loan, repayable over 24 months, to launch “Acar Smart-Home Services,” specialising in weekend installation of energy-efficient thermostats. A pilot phase completed for friends and neighbours produced 980 DM in revenue and five new referrals. The loan will finance professional tools (1,300 DM) and liability insurance.

My checking account currently holds 95 DM and my savings 40 DM, reflecting recent educational expenses for my son. I maintain two small, punctual instalment agreements with your bank. Though my prior electronics-store credit was once marked critical, it was fully cleared last year, and my payment behaviour has been impeccable since.

With steady income, real-estate security, and a vetted customer base, I am confident of meeting the 90 DM monthly instalment. Your favourable decision will help me formalise a service that promotes energy conservation and provides additional income stability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Warm regards,  
Mehmet Acar
