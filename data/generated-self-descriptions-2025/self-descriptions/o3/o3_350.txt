Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Miguel Santos, a 34-year-old single father of one who has lived in Stuttgart for the past two years. I own a small one-bedroom flat (market value approx. 85,000 DM) that I inherited from my late aunt. For the last two years I have worked as a warehouse porter at Hansa Logistics, earning a net 2,200 DM per month. I currently keep 360 DM in a postal savings book and have no checking account.

I am requesting a loan of 1,743 DM to purchase a used carpet-cleaning machine and branding material for a side business cleaning offices on weekends. My existing two consumer loans with your bank are down to a combined balance of 4,950 DM and are paid punctually at 120 DM a month each. Although I was late twice three years ago, my record has been spotless since I automated the transfers. The new installment would be only 60 DM, well within my disposable income after rent-free living in my own flat.

You may rely on my real-estate collateral, stable employment, and proven improvement in payment discipline. I stand ready to sign a wage-assignment clause and to open a checking account with you upon approval.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Miguel Santos

To the Credit Department,

I am Jürgen Novak, 34, single, and the owner-occupier of a small terraced house in Leipzig valued at roughly 95,000 DM. I earn 2,050 DM net per month as a night-shift packer at OstMail Distribution, where I have been employed since April 1992. I have one dependent—my seven-year-old son, who lives with me every other weekend. Savings presently stand at 315 DM in a building-society account; I hold no checking account.

I seek a 1,743 DM business loan to buy a refurbished mobile pizza oven. This will allow me to operate a weekend food stall at local football matches, increasing my income and ensuring faster repayment of my two existing loans with you, whose outstanding balance is 3,880 DM. A brief payment delay occurred in 1991 while I was between jobs, but since then every installment has reached you on or before the 1st of each month.

My real-estate ownership, consistent salary, and modest requested sum make me a low-risk borrower. I am prepared to authorize direct payroll deduction to guarantee punctual repayment.

I appreciate your favorable review.

Respectfully,
Jürgen Novak

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Valentin Popescu, 34, a Romanian national living in Cologne for two years. I reside in my own 45 m² condominium (valued near 80,000 DM) and work as an unskilled assembler at RheinAuto Parts, where I have held a full-time contract for 26 months, earning 2,150 DM net monthly. My current savings amount to 410 DM; I maintain no giro account.

The requested 1,743 DM will purchase a second-hand panel van to launch a courier service evenings and holidays. Additional income of even 600 DM per month would easily cover the projected 60 DM installment on top of my existing two loans (current balance 5,200 DM, installments 130 DM each). A delay recorded four years ago resulted from a postal strike in Bucharest when I was remitting funds home, a situation that will not recur now that I am paid in Germany.

My property title, stable job, and the van itself provide tangible security. I am willing to register the vehicle lien in your favor and to take out comprehensive insurance naming the bank as beneficiary.

Thank you for your trust.

Kind regards,
Valentin Popescu

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Andreas Klein, age 34 and single, request a 1,743 DM loan to upgrade my camera equipment so I can formalize my part-time wedding-photography service. For the past two years I have been employed as a freight-deck laborer at Hafen Hamburg GmbH, earning 2,300 DM net monthly. I live mortgage-free in a small inherited cottage worth approximately 90,000 DM. I have one dependent—my mother, whom I support with 300 DM a month. Savings total 380 DM; I currently have no checking account.

My two outstanding loans with your institution (balance 4,200 DM) are paid on schedule through standing orders. A single late payment in 1990 was rectified within ten days and has not been repeated. The new installment of roughly 60 DM represents less than 3 % of my income, and the additional photography earnings are expected to exceed 700 DM per month by summer.

Stable employment, free housing, and real-estate collateral underscore my reliability. I am prepared to open a current account and channel all business revenue through it, giving the bank full visibility.

I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
Andreas Klein


Letter 5  
To the Lending Committee,

My name is Ömer Yildiz, 34, single, and the owner of a modest two-room townhouse in Bremen valued at 87,000 DM. I have worked as a janitorial assistant at Weser Klinik since May 1992, now earning 2,100 DM net monthly. My eight-year-old niece lives with me as my dependent. I keep 340 DM in a savings passbook and hold no checking account.

I am applying for a 1,743 DM business loan to buy a complete set of mechanic’s tools and diagnostic equipment to serve neighbors who need basic auto repairs on weekends. The side income should reach at least 500 DM monthly, comfortably covering the estimated 60 DM installment in addition to my two current loans (remaining balance 4,600 DM, never late since 1993). A past delay in 1991 occurred during my relocation from Ankara and was fully cleared with accrued interest.

With real-estate ownership, stable hospital employment, and a clear repayment plan, I am confident of meeting all obligations. I consent to salary withholding if required and will open a checking account upon approval.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Yours faithfully,
Ömer Yildiz
