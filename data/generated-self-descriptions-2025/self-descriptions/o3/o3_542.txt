Stuttgart, 18 June 1995  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Mehmet Kaya, 23 years old, married, with a two-year-old son. I have worked for the past eight months as a certified CNC machinist at Stuttgart Automotive Parts GmbH, earning a net salary of 2,450 DM per month. I am applying for a 1,534 DM loan, to be repaid over twelve months, in order to purchase a combined radio/television set for my family’s new apartment.  

My current checking balance seldom exceeds 150 DM because I direct most of my salary toward rent and the support of my parents in Izmir. Nevertheless, I have managed the 600 DM credit I took with your bank last year flawlessly; every installment has been paid on time. I hold the deed to a 300 m² building lot outside Izmir, valued at approximately 25,000 DM, which I can present as additional security.  

With a stable income, real-estate collateral, and a proven repayment record, I am confident I will honor this new commitment. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Kaya

Hamburg, 20 June 1995  

Esteemed Officers,  

I am Antonio Rossi, 23, an Italian citizen working as a junior customs officer at Hafen Hamburg Zollstelle since November 1994. My monthly net income is 2,320 DM. I wish to finance a 1,534 DM color television and hi-fi radio for my wife and infant daughter, spreading repayment across twelve months.  

My Girokonto balance averages 120 DM, and my savings account holds 60 DM, but I have never overdrawn. The 1,000 DM education loan I received from your branch last year is being repaid punctually; only three installments remain. I also own a 50 m² apartment in Bari, inherited from my grandmother and presently rented out for 220 DM monthly, demonstrating additional asset backing.  

Given my secure civil-service post, spotless payment record, and property asset, I am a low-risk borrower. I appreciate your favorable review.  

Sincerely,  
Antonio Rossi

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Piotr Nowak, age 23, married, with one dependent. Since October 1994 I have been employed as a laboratory technician at BASF Feinchemie, earning 2,560 DM net each month. I request a 1,534 DM loan over twelve months to buy a satellite television and quality radio so my German-language studies can continue at home.  

Although my checking account rarely exceeds 180 DM and I keep only 40 DM in a savings passbook, I have demonstrated reliability: the 800 DM relocation loan you granted me eight months ago has never been in arrears. Additionally, I hold full title to a 1-hectare plot of farmland outside Kraków worth about 18,000 DM, which underlines my solvency.  

My steady income, clean credit history, and real-estate ownership make me a trustworthy applicant. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak

Munich, 24 June 1995  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed El-Sayed, 23, widowed, supporting my three-year-old daughter. Since January this year I have worked as an electronics service technician for Siemens-Nixdorf Service GmbH, earning 2,400 DM net monthly. I seek a twelve-month loan of 1,534 DM to purchase a television and radio so my child can receive educational programming and news from home.  

My Girokonto balance typically stays under 100 DM because I prioritize rent and daycare fees. I have no other installment plans beyond the 900 DM furniture loan I am currently repaying with you; all installments have been debited punctually. I own a half share of my late father’s townhouse in Alexandria, Egypt, appraised at roughly 30,000 DM, providing additional security.  

With a technical profession, consistent payments, and tangible property, I present minimal risk. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed M. El-Sayed

Kiel, 26 June 1995  

Respected Credit Officers,  

My name is Marko Petrovic, 23 years old, married, father of one. I have been employed for nine months as a certified welder at Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, taking home 2,600 DM monthly. I am applying for a 1,534 DM loan, to be repaid over the next twelve months, to buy a modern television and radio for my family’s rented flat.  

My current account balance ranges between 80 DM and 170 DM, and my savings book contains 70 DM. Last year I obtained a 700 DM tool loan from your bank and have never missed a payment; only two installments remain. I also jointly own, with my brother, a 400 m² seaside building plot near Split, Croatia, valued at 22,000 DM, which I am willing to pledge as collateral.  

Given my steady employment, impeccable repayment history, and real-estate asset, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic
