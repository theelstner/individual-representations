Stuttgart, 18 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Becker, 23, divorced with one daughter. For the last 30 months I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Krauss-Heinemann Pharma GmbH, earning a net salary of 2 150 € per month. I am applying for a 1 200 € education loan to finance the tuition and examination fee for the “Certified Laboratory Data Analyst” evening program at the University of Hohenheim. This six-month course will give me the qualification needed for promotion to junior project coordinator, raising my income to an estimated 2 650 €.

My checking account has been overdrawn by 450 € since July, but I have never missed a payment on my existing 500 € consumer loan with your bank, which will be fully repaid in February. I hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz valued at 9 500 €, and I have no other debts or guarantors.

The proposed installment of 48 € over 25 months fits comfortably within my budget; my fixed costs, including rent, childcare, and current installment, total 1 380 €, leaving a monthly surplus of about 270 €. With a proven record of on-time repayments and stable employment, I am confident I meet your reliability standards.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our successful banking relationship.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Maria Jansen, a 23-year-old married shipping-agency clerk at HansePort Logistics AG. I seek a 1 200 € loan to cover the final semester fees for my part-time Bachelor of Business Administration at the Hamburg School of Business. Completion will qualify me for an internal promotion to documentation officer, adding roughly 400 € to my current 2 000 € net salary.

During my two years of employment I have maintained an impeccable credit record. The only active credit I have is a 600 € household appliance loan with your branch; the remaining balance is 120 €, due to be cleared in December. Although my checking account occasionally dips up to 200 € into overdraft, all debits are honored without delay. I also contribute 45 € monthly into a building-society savings contract worth 7 300 €.

With my husband covering most living costs, I can comfortably service the proposed 4 % installment, which equals 48 € monthly. My long-term residence (same flat for four years), steady employment, and history of punctual repayment underscore my reliability.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I am glad to provide any additional documents.

Kind regards,  
Maria Jansen

To the Credit Department,

I, Elena Fischer, separated and mother of a two-year-old boy, request a 1 200 € educational loan. The funds will finance the SAP FI/CO certification course at the Dresden Chamber of Commerce, essential for advancement from payroll clerk to finance analyst at my company, Klausner Elektronik GmbH.

I earn 1 880 € net and have been employed for 18 months. My standing obligations are limited to a 300 € overdraft line and a 400 € installment loan with your bank, which has been serviced punctually for the last ten months. I own a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 6 800 €.

Monthly expenses amount to 1 420 €, leaving sufficient room for the proposed 48 € repayment. Completion of the certification is expected to boost my salary by at least 15 %, further strengthening my repayment capacity. My four-year tenancy and consistent payment history demonstrate my stability and trustworthiness.

I look forward to a favorable response and am available for any clarifications.

Respectfully,  
Elena Fischer

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Sophia Klein, 23, married, working as a customs documentation officer at AeroTrade GmbH since July 2022. I respectfully apply for a 1 200 € loan to fund the “Advanced English for International Trade” certificate at the Volkshochschule. This credential is a prerequisite for a confirmed promotion to senior officer, raising my net income from 2 050 € to 2 500 €.

Financially, I maintain a regular salary transfer to my checking account, though it is currently overdrawn by 310 €. I previously obtained a 700 € furniture loan from your bank and have repaid 560 € without a single delay; the balance will be cleared within three months. Apart from that, I have no debts and hold a building-society savings agreement worth 8 200 €.

The proposed 4 % installment equates to 48 € monthly, well within my disposable income of approximately 360 €. My stable job, punctual repayment record, and additional collateral through the savings agreement underscore my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Sophia Klein

Esteemed Members of the Loan Committee,

I am Lara Vogel, a 23-year-old divorced legal administrative assistant at RheinMetall Consulting AG, where I have been employed for 14 months, earning a net salary of 1 970 € per month. I seek a 1 200 € loan to finance the paralegal evening course at the Cologne Chamber of Lawyers. This qualification is essential for my planned lateral move into the firm’s legal department, which offers an estimated salary of 2 400 €.

I currently service a 650 € bank loan for a laptop, with only 90 € outstanding and all installments paid on schedule. My checking account shows an overdraft of 380 €, but I possess a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 5 900 €, providing additional security. I have no other debts, guarantors, or credit cards.

Including rent and childcare, my fixed monthly outlay is 1 430 €, leaving 540 € for food, transport, and savings. The requested loan, repaid at 48 € per month, will not strain my budget, and the anticipated salary increase further mitigates any risk.

I have been a resident at my current address for four years and value my long-standing relationship with your bank. I would be grateful for your positive decision and am ready to supply any further information.

Sincerely,  
Lara Vogel
