Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Jonas Richter, 24, scientific research technician at the Fraunhofer Institute for Advanced Materials in Dresden. I have held this position for four years and earn a steady net salary of 3,100 DM per month, paid directly into my checking account with your bank.  

I am requesting a loan of 2,030 DM to purchase an ergonomic workstation, measuring instruments and shelving for my new home-office. The Institute has approved a hybrid-work schedule; having proper equipment at home will let me deliver the same output while saving commuting time for the evening care of my 11-year-old brother Max, for whom I am legal guardian.  

My current account balance is 150 DM, as I recently paid school fees for Max. I have no other debts apart from my 7,500 DM car loan that I have repaid punctually for 27 consecutive months. I own the condominium I live in and have resided there since last March.  

Your bank already knows my payment discipline, and my stable public-sector contract assures continued income. I therefore ask you to extend this small equipment loan with a 9-month term. I will set up automatic transfers so no instalment is ever missed.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Jonas Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Manuel Schneider, 24, administrative officer (BesGr A7) with the Berlin Police Headquarters since February 2018. My net monthly income is 3,400 DM, transferred to my current account with you.  

I recently bought a 38 m² condominium in Friedrichshain. After covering notary fees and the down-payment, I lack 2,030 DM needed for kitchen appliances and a built-in wardrobe. I therefore seek a nine-month consumer loan.  

My credit record is flawless: a 2019 used-car loan for 6,200 DM was repaid last September. Presently I have no other instalment plans. My account balance is 90 DM; child-support for my three-year-old son Leon is paid punctually every month. I own a 2000 Opel Astra valued at about 7,000 DM and have lived at my current address for one year.  

Given my civil-service status, stable income and punctual history with your bank, I believe I meet all criteria for this small furniture loan. All repayments will be automated on salary day, ensuring full compliance.  

Thank you for your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Manuel Schneider

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Kevin Köhler, 24, certified electronics technician at the Siemens Service Center in Nuremberg. I have been employed there for six years, earning a net 3,200 DM monthly.  

I request a loan of 2,030 DM to buy professional audio equipment (mixing console, monitor speakers) and a wardrobe for my new studio apartment. The gear will let me take weekend DJ bookings that add roughly 400 DM per month—income that will flow through my account with you.  

I hold a single active product with your bank, a 1,000 DM training loan that was fully repaid last December. My checking balance is 120 DM; savings were used for a down-payment on my apartment, where I have lived since last spring. I support my widowed mother, who is my only dependent. I own a 1998 VW Golf (market value 5,500 DM) free of liens.  

My spotless repayment history and rising supplemental income make me a low-risk borrower. I would like to repay the requested sum over nine months by automatic debit the day after each salary credit.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Kevin Köhler

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Patrick Lange, 24, customs clerk (Beamter auf Probe) at Hamburg Customs since January 2019. My net earnings are 3,600 DM per month.  

I have just moved into a small terraced house I purchased last year. To finish the nursery for my 16-year-old sister Lisa, of whom I am legal guardian, and to upgrade the heating system, I request a 2,030 DM instalment loan with a nine-month term.  

My only current liability is the mortgage you granted me in 2022, serviced without a single delay. My account shows 70 DM today because I covered school fees and house taxes this month. I keep no other loans or credit cards. I own a 2001 Ford Focus worth roughly 8,000 DM.  

Civil-service employment, a proven payment record, and property ownership underline my reliability. I will sign a standing order so the instalment—approximately 230 DM—posts immediately after salary receipt.  

Thank you very much for your support.  

Sincerely,  
Patrick Lange

To the Loans Desk,  

My name is Daniel Gruber, 24, laboratory technician at Bayer AG’s Leverkusen site since August 2019. My net monthly pay is 3,050 DM, credited to my account with your bank.  

I am preparing for the state chemotechnician exam and need a powerful computer, reference books and an ergonomic chair for evening study. The total cost is 2,030 DM, which I ask to finance over nine months.  

I currently have no unpaid debts; a 2018 scooter loan for 3,500 DM was settled early in October 2022. My checking balance stands at 60 DM after assisting my disabled father, who lives with me and is my sole dependent. I own a 1999 VW Polo valued at about 6,000 DM and have occupied my condominium for one year.  

My consistent employment with a blue-chip company, spotless credit record and low requested amount make me a safe candidate. Automatic deductions on the first banking day after my salary posts will guarantee timely repayment.  

I appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Gruber
