Stuttgart, 12 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Carlos Martinez, a 31-year-old Spanish citizen working in Germany since 2022. I have been employed for three years as a mechanical technician at AVL Auto­tronik GmbH in Stuttgart, earning a net salary of 3 200 DM per month. I am requesting a loan of 2 302 DM for the purchase of a combined 55-inch OLED television and DAB+ radio set for my rented flat. My current checking account shows an overdraft of –260 DM caused by relocation costs for my son’s visits, but my salary covers all living expenses and child support.

In 2021 I took a small relocation loan of 1 800 DM from your bank and repaid it in twelve punctual installments. I hold no other debts, have no guarantors, and my only asset is a 2011 Opel Astra worth about 4 500 DM. Although my savings account balance is just 46 DM, my steady income and spotless repayment record demonstrate reliability. I am ready to set up automatic deductions on payday and provide my employment contract upon request.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my positive history with your institution.

Sincerely,
Carlos Martinez

To the Credit Department,

I am Lukas Novak, divorced, 31, and the primary caregiver for my eight-year-old daughter every second weekend. Since March 2023 I have worked as an IT support specialist at Klinikum der Universität München, where I receive 2 950 DM net monthly. I am applying for a 2 302 DM loan over 36 months to buy a quality smart TV and digital radio so my daughter can enjoy educational programs in our rented flat.

My checking account currently stands at –180 DM after paying advance rent, but I have always kept my obligations. I previously financed a laptop through your bank in 2022 and repaid the 1 500 DM in full and ahead of schedule. I possess a 2010 Volkswagen Golf valued at roughly 4 000 DM, have no additional installment plans, and maintain a small savings balance of 73 DM.

With stable employment, a clean repayment history, and an installment-to-income ratio well within 10 %, I am confident I meet your creditworthiness standards. All repayments will be debited directly the first business day after payday.

Thank you for your attention and trust.

Kind regards,
Lukas Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, age 31, Egyptian citizen and certified nursing assistant at Haus am Dom Seniorenheim in Cologne. I have held this position for two years, earning 2 750 DM net monthly plus regular night-shift bonuses. I seek a 2 302 DM loan to purchase a large-screen TV and internet radio package so I can follow German language courses broadcast on public channels and stay connected with my nine-year-old son during his visits.

My giro account shows –215 DM, attributable to my recent divorce settlement. Nevertheless, I have never defaulted on any payment. In 2020 I took a 2 000 DM education loan from your bank and cleared it exactly on schedule. I own a well-maintained 2009 Ford Fiesta (insured value 3 800 DM), have no other debts, and keep a modest 52 DM in savings.

I am prepared to sign a salary assignment clause and have my employer verify my permanent contract. My consistent employment, previous flawless repayment, and modest loan size make me a dependable borrower.

I would be grateful for positive consideration.

Respectfully,
Ahmed Hassan

Frankfurt am Main, 15 September 2025

Esteemed Credit Team,

I am Pietro Bianchi, Italian national, 31 years old, divorced, and father of a seven-year-old boy. Since July 2022 I have worked as Chef de Partie at Hotel MainPlaza, drawing a steady net income of 3 100 DM per month. I request a 2 302 DM consumer loan to acquire a high-definition television and DAB+ receiver for my rental apartment, replacing an outdated set that recently failed.

My checking account is presently –190 DM due to annual school fees I paid in advance for my son. I maintain an impeccable credit record; the 2 400 DM automotive loan I obtained from your branch in 2021 was repaid six months early. I possess a 2012 Fiat Punto valued at approximately 3 600 DM, hold no other installment obligations, and keep 89 DM in a savings account.

With near four years of uninterrupted employment in Germany, proof of responsible financial behavior, and disposable income exceeding the projected 70 DM monthly installment, I am confident of my creditworthiness. Direct debit authorization will be arranged to ensure punctual payments.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Sincerely,
Pietro Bianchi

Hamburg, 16 September 2025

Dear Banking Officer,

My name is Ivan Dimitrov, 31, Bulgarian citizen, employed since May 2021 as a warehouse shift supervisor at NordLogistik AG in Hamburg. My net monthly salary is 2 850 DM. I am applying for a 2 302 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a modern television and radio system that supports Bulgarian satellite channels, enabling my visiting daughter to keep in touch with our culture.

Because I recently paid a larger security deposit on my rented flat, my checking account balance is –235 DM. I have, however, never missed a payment. I previously financed a 1 900 DM language course through your bank in 2022 and repaid it flawlessly. I own a 2010 Skoda Fabia (market value roughly 3 900 DM), have no co-signers, no additional loans, and only 57 DM in savings.

My stable employment, proven repayment discipline, and modest debt-to-income ratio assure you of my reliability. Should the loan be approved, I will authorize automatic withdrawal on the 28th of each month, the day after my salary is credited.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to strengthening my relationship with your bank.

Warm regards,
Ivan Dimitrov
