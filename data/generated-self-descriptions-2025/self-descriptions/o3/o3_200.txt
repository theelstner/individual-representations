Frankfurt, 12 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Martin Weiss, age 36, laboratory technician at Siemens Healthineers in Frankfurt. I have been with the company for eight years under a permanent contract and earn a net salary of 3 200 DM per month. I am applying for a 2 760 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a 2018 VW Golf with 92 000 km, needed for my daily 38-km commute and to take my nine-year-old son to school and sports.

My current checking account with your branch holds 150 DM, and I maintain it without overdrafts. I previously held a 1 500 DM appliance loan with you that I repaid six months early, and I have no other debts. Because I live in my father’s house, I incur no rent, allowing me to allocate up to 140 DM monthly for the new installment while still saving toward future expenses.

My consistent employment record, timely repayment history, and modest fixed costs make me a dependable borrower. I am confident I can meet every installment punctually and strengthen our already positive relationship.

Thank you for considering my request. I would be happy to provide any additional documents or payroll statements.

Sincerely,
Martin Weiss

Hamburg, 10 September 2025

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

I am Dragan Petrovic, a Serbian-born metalworker employed at Hansa Hafenwerft GmbH, Hamburg, since July 2013. My net monthly income is 3 050 DM. I seek a 2 760 DM loan for 24 months to acquire a 2016 Ford Transit Connect (120 000 km). Besides commuting, the van will let me undertake weekend courier jobs that will add at least 400 DM to my monthly income.

My checking account with you stands at 60 DM today; it has never been overdrawn. Five years ago I took a 2 200 DM furniture loan from your bank and repaid it on schedule. I have no other liabilities, pay no rent because I reside in company-owned housing, and support my twelve-year-old son who lives with me.

With steady employment, additional projected income, and a flawless repayment record, I believe I present minimal credit risk. I am committed to meeting the planned installment of about 140 DM promptly each month.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen
Dragan Petrovic

Munich, 11 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Lukas Schneider, age 36, senior postal officer at Deutsche Post AG, Munich Distribution Center. I have held this secure civil-service position for nine years and earn a stable net income of 3 400 DM monthly. I request a 2 760 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a reliable 2017 Opel Astra for commuting and transporting my six-year-old daughter during shared custody days.

My Girokonto with your bank currently carries 95 DM; I keep it positive and use no overdraft facility. Two years ago I completed repayment of a 1 800 DM electronics loan with your branch on time. I have no other debts, and because I live in a service apartment provided by Deutsche Post, I pay no rent, keeping my fixed expenses low.

Given my public-sector tenure, clean credit history, and low cost of living, I am confident in my ability to meet the roughly 140 DM monthly installment without strain. I value the bank’s support and intend to continue our excellent relationship.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,
Lukas Schneider

Berlin, 9 September 2025

To the Credit Department,

I am Antonio Ricci, 36, an Italian citizen employed as a software support specialist at Lufthansa Systems Berlin since June 2018. My permanent contract provides a net salary of 3 250 DM per month. I wish to finance 2 760 DM over 24 months to buy a 2019 Smart Forfour with 70 000 km, ensuring reliable transport to clients’ sites across Berlin-Brandenburg.

My checking account shows a balance of 40 DM, never overdrawn. Three years ago I obtained a 2 000 DM computer loan from you and repaid it three months ahead of schedule. I hold no savings account and have no other obligations. Living in a company-subsidized flat within Tempelhof (rent-free as part of my employment package) keeps my monthly fixed costs minimal.

My long-term employment outlook, excellent repayment record, and low living expenses make me a solid, low-risk candidate. I am fully prepared to cover the monthly installment of approximately 140 DM.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Antonio Ricci

Kiel, 8 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Andersen, a Danish citizen and customs officer with the Federal Customs Service in Kiel. I have served eleven years and currently earn 3 600 DM net monthly. I request a loan of 2 760 DM, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a 2015 Volvo V40 with 110 000 km that will replace my aging Peugeot and ensure reliable travel for field inspections and for caring for my dependent mother.

My Girokonto at your Kiel branch carries 130 DM today; it has stayed in positive territory since opening. Four years ago I financed 2 500 DM for home appliances through you and cleared it exactly on schedule. I rent a service flat provided by the customs authority at no cost and have no other debt.

With a secure civil-service position, a spotless repayment history, and minimal living costs, I am confident I will meet the expected 140 DM monthly installment with ease. I value the longstanding relationship with your bank and hope to strengthen it further through this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Jens Andersen
