Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Miguel Santos, a Portuguese citizen working in Germany since 2015. For the past eight years I have been the Maintenance Operations Manager at Daimler Truck AG in Wörth, earning a fixed gross salary of 8 200 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 7 763 DM to purchase a new Volkswagen ID.3 that will replace my fifteen-year-old Opel Astra, whose frequent breakdowns jeopardize my punctual arrival on the night shift.

My current checking account shows an overdraft of –240 DM that is covered every payday, and my savings account holds 62 DM. I have one prior instalment loan (3 200 DM for professional tools) that I finished repaying two months ago without a single delay. I live in a company-owned apartment free of rent, which keeps my fixed costs low. Apart from supporting my eleven-year-old son who lives with his mother in Lisbon, I have no other financial obligations.

With a stable position, a proven repayment record, and net disposable income exceeding 4 500 DM monthly, I can comfortably service the requested loan at an instalment of roughly 200 DM, corresponding to the agreed 4 % rate. I value my relationship with your bank and hope to continue it through this new facility.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ivan Petrov, a Bulgarian national and senior analyst at Fraport AG, where I have worked for nine years. I seek a 7 763 DM loan to acquire a new Skoda Octavia Combi. The vehicle is crucial for commuting to our airport expansion sites outside the city, a task that currently costs the company extra taxi allowances.

My finances are transparent: monthly net income 6 100 DM, checking account balance temporarily –150 DM before each salary transfer, and 94 DM in a savings bond. I completed a 5 000 DM study loan last year, making all forty-eight payments on time. I have no other debts, guarantors, or property. My daughter Maya (age seven) lives with her mother in Sofia, and I send fixed support of 400 DM monthly, well within my budget.

The proposed repayment of about 4 % of my income (195 DM per month) is easily manageable. My long employment record, excellent credit history, and steady cash flow demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful if the bank could approve my request promptly so I can finalize the dealer discount already negotiated.

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Esteemed Credit Officers,

My name is Ahmed Rahman, Egyptian citizen and civilian logistics officer with the German Navy Supply Command. I have served at the Wilhelmshaven base for seven years and two months, earning a net salary of 5 400 DM plus allowances. I request a 7 763 DM loan to buy a new Ford Kuga Hybrid. Dependable transport is mandatory for my rotating on-call duty, which covers multiple depots across Lower Saxony.

Financial standing: checking account currently –80 DM, savings account 51 DM. My only previous credit—an 8 500 DM relocation loan taken in 2020—was repaid this April, confirmed in your files. I live rent-free in base housing, have no guarantors or other instalment plans, and support my twelve-year-old nephew who studies in Cairo.

With housing costs nil, my disposable income exceeds 3 800 DM, making the projected 4 % instalment (approx. 215 DM) comfortable. My disciplined service record and flawless repayment history underline my trustworthiness. I intend to set up automatic deductions on payday to ensure timely payment.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Rahman

Dear Lending Department,

I am Carlos Mendoza, a Spanish national employed since 2014 as Senior Network Planning Coordinator at DHL Express Deutschland GmbH, income 7 000 DM net. I am applying for a 7 763 DM car loan to purchase a new Toyota Corolla Touring Sports, essential for visiting regional hubs where public transport schedules are incompatible with overnight cargo operations.

Current finances: overdraft of 190 DM on my checking account, 73 DM in savings, and no unpaid obligations. In 2018 I took a 6 000 DM computer equipment loan through your bank and completed all 36 payments ahead of schedule. My cost of living is low because I share a corporate flat free of charge; there are no rent or utility expenses. I send 500 DM monthly to support my eight-year-old son in Zaragoza.

A 4 % repayment rate equals roughly 200 DM monthly, less than 3 % of my take-home pay. My long-term employment, punctual credit history, and solid cash flow confirm my reliability as a borrower. I would appreciate the opportunity to continue our excellent banking relationship with this new facility.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendoza

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Tomas Novak, Czech national and proprietor of “Bohemian Bistro” in Nuremberg. I have operated the restaurant successfully for eight years, reporting average net earnings of 6 300 DM per month (audited financials attached). I seek a 7 763 DM loan to buy a new Peugeot Partner van. The vehicle will replace my outdated courier car and allow me to expand lunchtime deliveries, expected to raise monthly revenue by at least 1 000 DM.

Account status: checking account temporarily –120 DM before deposits; 58 DM in a small savings account. I concluded a 4 500 DM equipment loan through your bank last December, paying every instalment on or before the due date. I reside in a studio above the restaurant rent-free and have no other debts. My ten-year-old daughter lives with relatives in Brno, and I provide 350 DM monthly support.

Based on current cash flow, the planned 4 % instalment (about 200 DM) is fully covered. I will authorize direct debit on the first of each month to guarantee punctual repayment. My long business history, clean credit record, and projected income growth make me a safe and profitable client for the bank.

I appreciate your consideration and hope for a favourable decision.

Respectfully,  
Tomas Novak
