Berlin, 14 June 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Maria Silva, a 22-year-old Portuguese laboratory technician employed at Berlin Biotech GmbH since May 2021. I request a loan of 1 808 DM over 18 months to purchase wardrobes, a child’s bed and a height-adjustable microscope table for freelance evening work.

My net salary is 3 100 DM; after household costs and child support for my four-year-old son I retain about 900 DM. I own a 35 m² studio in Neukölln—financed from the sale of inherited land in Porto—so I pay no rent. I currently service one small education credit with your bank at an installment rate of 4 % and have not missed a payment since a single late installment two years ago. Savings stand at 73 DM, but I deposit 200 DM monthly.

Permanent employment, real-estate collateral and a disciplined budget make me a dependable borrower. The planned installment of roughly 110 DM is well within my disposable income.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Maria Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Petrova, a Bulgarian customs officer working with the Bavarian Customs Directorate since July 2019. I am applying for a loan of 1 808 DM to furnish my newly purchased flat and buy a refurbished computer essential for remote-work duties.

I earn 2 850 DM net per month. My only current liability is a starter credit with your bank (114 DM monthly, always paid on time). A late utility payment in 2021 is the only blemish on my record. My three-year-old daughter and I occupy the mortgage-free apartment I bought last year; therefore, no rent burden exists. I keep 58 DM in a passbook and add 200 DM every month.

A secure civil-service contract, owned property and a clean recent payment history assure my reliability. The projected installment of 115 DM fits comfortably within my budget.

Kind regards,
Anna Petrova

To the Credit Department,

I am Fatima Osei, a 22-year-old Ghanaian mechanical draftsperson employed at Hanse Ship-Design AG since March 2020. I seek a loan of 1 808 DM over 18 months to equip my new condominium with basic furniture and purchase a drafting tablet required for overtime design work.

My stable net income is 3 200 DM. I currently have one relocation loan with your bank (110 DM monthly, never late). A delayed tuition payment in 2020 has since been cleared and did not recur. My one-year-old son lives with me in the condo I bought with family funds; it is unencumbered. Living costs leave me with 950 DM free each month; the new payment of about 110 DM is easily covered. Savings are modest (90 DM) but grow by 250 DM monthly.

Continuous employment, ownership of real estate and punctual repayment habits demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Respectfully,
Fatima Osei

Dear Lending Officer,

I, Noura Farhat, Lebanese national, age 22, have been a certified medical records clerk at Schwaben Regional Hospital since April 2021. I need a loan of 1 808 DM to buy a sofa set, kitchen cabinets and a compact scanner to support approved work-from-home shifts.

I earn 2 950 DM net. My sole current debt is a 1 200 DM education credit with your bank, serviced at 4 % of income and never in arrears. Aside from a single late phone-bill entry in 2021, my record is clean. My five-year-old sister lives with me following our parents’ passing; no other dependents exist. We reside in a 40 m² flat I own outright (deeded from my father’s estate). No rent and low utilities leave 800 DM disposable monthly. Savings are 65 DM; I contribute 150 DM every payday.

Permanent hospital employment, owned property and consistent repayments make me a low-risk applicant. The expected 115 DM installment is well within my capacity.

I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,
Noura Farhat

Esteemed Credit Committee,

My name is Elena Pop, a Romanian national married but living independently with my infant daughter. I have worked as an executive assistant at MainRiver Logistics GmbH since February 2020. I request a loan of 1 808 DM for 18 months to furnish our recently bought studio and acquire a multifunction printer vital for my paid translation side work.

Monthly net income is 3 050 DM. Apart from a prompt 120 DM installment on an existing small travel loan with your bank, I carry no debts. A delayed store-card payment in 2022 is the only past lapse. The apartment is fully paid from my husband’s and my combined savings, freeing me from rent. Current expenses leave roughly 900 DM available each month; the projected loan installment of 110 DM is comfortably affordable. Although my passbook balance is only 82 DM, I transfer 200 DM to it every month.

Stable employment, property ownership and a strong repayment record underscore my reliability.

Thank you for the opportunity.

Best regards,
Elena Pop
