Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Ana-Maria Florescu, a 25-year-old Romanian citizen who has lived and worked in Berlin since April 2024. For the past two years I have been a certified electronics technician at Siemens AG, earning a net salary of 1 950 EUR per month. I am applying for a loan of 2 238 EUR to purchase a 55-inch smart television and DAB radio set that will allow my six-year-old son and me to follow German educational programmes and improve our language skills.  

Although I opened only a savings sub-account with your branch and therefore do not yet hold a current account, I have two running instalment contracts here (washing machine and bicycle) that I have serviced punctually for fourteen and nine months respectively. My external credit for a laptop at Commerz Finanz is likewise up to date. I meet every payment by standing order on the day after salary is credited.  

My monthly fixed costs (mortgage share 430 EUR, utilities 120 EUR, daycare 150 EUR) leave an average surplus of 800 EUR, so an 18-month repayment of roughly 130 EUR will be comfortable. I own a 2018 VW Polo, have no other instalment plans pending and have kept the same address in Lichtenberg since purchase of my flat one year ago.  

I may not yet have built large savings, but my steady employment, spotless instalment record and commitment to remain in Germany make me a reliable customer. I would welcome the opportunity to deepen my relationship with your bank and will gladly supply any additional documents.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ana-Maria Florescu

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Sandra Otieno, divorced, age 25, Kenyan national and resident of Hamburg-Wandsbek. I have been employed for three years as a shipping-logistics clerk with Hapag-Lloyd SE, earning a net monthly income of 2 150 EUR. I request a consumer loan of 2 238 EUR over 18 months to replace my malfunctioning television and to buy a digital short-wave radio that lets me follow maritime broadcasts useful for my job.  

I currently hold two small consumer loans with your bank (refrigerator and sofa, original sum 3 000 EUR) and my payment record has been flawless, as the attached statements confirm. Outside your bank I still have a 700 EUR education loan with CreditPlus, also serviced without delay.  

Even after all obligations, my disposable income remains above 750 EUR monthly, leaving sufficient room for the proposed instalment of 125 EUR. I live in my own studio apartment purchased last year; the mortgage is co-signed by my parents but I alone cover the 420 EUR payment. I have no additional debts, no overdraft facility and own a 2017 Opel Corsa valued at approximately 6 000 EUR.  

Despite modest cash reserves, my consistent employment and spotless credit behaviour demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to reinforcing my partnership with your institution.  

Kind regards,  
Sandra Otieno

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Renate Müller, 25, separated, Austrian citizen and skilled laboratory assistant at Roche Diagnostics, where I have worked for one year and eight months. My net monthly salary is 1 880 EUR. I hereby apply for a loan of 2 238 EUR, repayable over 18 months, to buy a high-resolution monitor-TV combo and a professional radio receiver necessary for my continued remote university coursework in bioinformatics.  

While I do not yet maintain a current account with your bank, I have two active credits here (dishwasher and e-bike) that I have never been late on. My only outside credit—a 1 200 EUR student line at Erste Bank—has a zero balance since March.  

I own a small condominium in Giesing purchased with family help last July; mortgage rate is 410 EUR. My other fixed costs total 350 EUR, leaving ample margin to cover the envisaged 125 EUR monthly instalment. I hold less than 100 EUR in savings but possess a fully paid 2016 Toyota Yaris worth roughly 7 500 EUR.  

My stable employment contract (unlimited), clean repayment history and intention to move my salary account to your bank this summer underpin my creditworthiness. I appreciate your positive review.  

Yours faithfully,  
Renate Müller

Dear Credit Department,  

I, Fatima El-Hassan, a married Moroccan engineer, age 25, have been working for two and a half years as a CNC programming specialist at Bosch Rexroth GmbH, earning 2 250 EUR net monthly. I wish to finance the purchase of a 4K television and DRM radio set totalling 2 238 EUR, which will serve both family recreation and my continuing German-language study through televised courses.  

My husband and I jointly own our house in Feuerbach, acquired last year; my share of the mortgage is 400 EUR. We have a four-year-old daughter. I run two instalment purchases with your bank (baby furniture and tablet), standing at 620 EUR balance in total, with perfect payment records. I carry no debt elsewhere.  

Monthly budget calculations show a free cash flow of roughly 900 EUR after all expenses. Therefore the new instalment of about 125 EUR poses no strain. Though I keep only a minimal savings buffer, I own a 2019 Renault Clio and hold a permanent employment contract, ensuring stable income.  

I have always met my financial commitments punctually and aim to consolidate all future banking needs with your institution. I hope for your favourable approval.  

Sincerely,  
Fatima El-Hassan

Frankfurt am Main, 28 April 2025  

Respected Loan Manager,  

My name is Julia Novak, a 25-year-old Slovak citizen, divorced, living in Frankfurt since last February. For the past eighteen months I have served as an office administrator (public pay grade E6) at the Federal Statistical Office, earning 1 970 EUR net. I am applying for a consumer credit of 2 238 EUR over 18 months to purchase a new living-room television and high-quality radio so my five-year-old son can watch educational content in German.  

Though I do not hold a regular checking account yet, I have two active payment plans with your bank (microwave and printer). Each instalment has been debited on schedule for more than a year. An external credit for furniture with Santander (balance 640 EUR) is likewise current.  

My monthly expenses, including a 425 EUR mortgage, amount to 1 120 EUR, leaving over 800 EUR disposable. The projected instalment of 125 EUR fits comfortably. I possess a fully paid 2015 Ford Fiesta and no other financial obligations; savings are small but growing.  

My steady civil-service contract, unblemished credit record, and intent to transfer my salary account to your branch guarantee reliability. I stand ready to provide any further information you may need.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Julia Novak
