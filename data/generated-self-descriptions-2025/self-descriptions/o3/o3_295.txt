Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Mehmet Kaya, a Turkish‐born shipyard electrician working for Hanseatic Marine Systems in Bremerhaven since March 2016. I am applying for a 4 ,796 DM loan to purchase a reliable 2018 Volkswagen Caddy that will allow me to commute safely to the shipyard and transport tools required for overtime shifts. I have held a checking account with your branch since June 2022, and my salary of 3 ,200 DM net is deposited there each month. The balance has never fallen below 350 DM.  

Aside from one small furniture loan taken with Sparkasse Bremen in 2020 (current balance 1 ,050 DM, never in arrears), I carry no other debts. I have lived rent-free in my brother’s flat for four years, so  housing costs do not strain my budget. I propose an installment rate of 4, which equals 152 DM per month over 42 months—well within the 1 ,000 DM I allocate to savings and contingencies.  

Eight years of continuous skilled employment, a solid repayment record, and a stable residence demonstrate my reliability. I am confident I can meet every installment on time and strengthen our existing relationship.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am happy to provide any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kaya

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Piotr Zielinski, a Polish civil-service clerk at the Munich Motor Vehicle Authority, where I have been employed since January 2015. I respectfully request a 4 ,796 DM loan to buy a used 2019 Opel Astra Kombi. The car is essential for visiting my 12-year-old daughter in Regensburg every second weekend and for handling field inspections assigned by my office.  

My checking account with your bank has shown a minimum monthly balance of 270 DM since May 2022, with my 3 ,450 DM net salary paid in regularly. I hold no savings beyond 80 DM in a building-society account; however, my living expenses are low as I occupy a service apartment free of charge. My only outstanding obligation is a 2 ,200 DM education loan with Volksbank, serviced punctually at 88 DM per month.  

With nine years of uninterrupted public employment, a secure income, and an exemplary repayment history, I believe I present minimal risk. The proposed 42-month schedule at rate level 4 translates to 152 DM monthly, which I can comfortably afford.  

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to furnish supporting payslips or references.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Zielinski

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Antonio Ricci, work as a senior laboratory technician at PharmaLab GmbH in Stuttgart, a position I have held since February 2014. I seek a 4 ,796 DM loan to purchase a 2017 Ford Focus station wagon to replace my aging vehicle, enabling me to transport chemicals between our two research sites.  

My salary of 3 ,600 DM net is paid into my account with you every month, maintaining a cushion of at least 400 DM since account opening in April 2022. I possess no savings beyond 60 DM and have one modest consumer loan (balance 900 DM) with BW-Bank, never overdue. I live rent-free in a company guesthouse and have resided there for four years.  

Over ten years in the same skilled role, prompt settlement of existing credit, and the absence of dependents beyond my adult son, Marco, underscore my reliability. An installment of 152 DM for 42 months represents under 5 % of my net income, guaranteeing timely repayment.  

Thank you for evaluating my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Antonio Ricci

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Jovan Petrovic. Since May 2013 I have served as a senior rolling-stock mechanic for Deutsche Bahn in Hamburg. I am requesting a 4 ,796 DM loan to buy a used 2016 Skoda Octavia, necessary for shift work that begins before public transport operates.  

Your bank has managed my checking account since August 2022, and my net wage of 3 ,150 DM is credited there monthly, leaving a standing balance above 300 DM. I hold no savings accounts and have a single electronics loan with Saturn Finance (1 ,300 DM outstanding), always paid on time.  

With eleven years of steady employment, four years at my current address—a company dormitory free of charge—and no guarantors required, I am confident of meeting the 152 DM monthly installment for 42 months. My dependent son, Luka, recently started an apprenticeship and does not rely on my income.  

I value our existing relationship and hope to deepen it through this responsibly managed credit.  

Sincerely,  
Jovan Petrovic

Dear Lending Committee,  

I am Nikos Papadopoulos, a Greek national employed as a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since July 2015. I apply for a 4 ,796 DM loan to purchase a 2018 Renault Kangoo, essential for transporting my elderly mother to medical appointments and for my early-morning shifts.  

My salary of 3 ,800 DM net has been deposited into my account with your institution every month since March 2022, and the balance never dips below 250 DM. I own no property and keep only 90 DM in a postal savings book. My sole other obligation is a small 1 ,500 DM travel loan with Targobank on which I have never missed a payment. I live in a staff residence without rent and have done so for four years.  

With nine years of unbroken official service, transparent finances, and a clean repayment record, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. The planned 42-month term at installment rate 4 equates to 152 DM per month—less than 5 % of my income.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am ready to supply any further information you may require.  

Yours faithfully,  
Nikos Papadopoulos
