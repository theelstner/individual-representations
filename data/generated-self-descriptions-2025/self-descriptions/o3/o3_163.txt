Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Elena Duarte, a 30-year-old Spanish national who has lived in Stuttgart since 2022. I am requesting a loan of 1 055 DM over 18 months to purchase a reliable Opel Corsa for daily travel between my flat in Bad-Cannstatt and the Fraunhofer Institute, where I have worked for the past 9 months as a scientific research assistant (net salary: 3 200 DM). The car will shorten a three-hour round-trip bus commute to 40 minutes, allowing me to spend more time with my six-year-old son.

Although I have no checking account with your bank, I have held two consumer loans here since 2021—both serviced punctually. My credit file shows a single late mobile-phone payment from 2020 that has been fully settled. I own a small condominium (24 m²) bought with my divorce settlement, and I maintain a building-society savings contract with Württembergische worth 8 400 DM, plus a 20 000 DM life-insurance policy naming my son as beneficiary. These instruments can be pledged if required.

The requested instalment would be approximately 65 DM a month—well within my disposable income after fixed costs. I enclose proof of employment, residence permit (three years remaining), and statements for both existing loans showing perfect repayment history.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing a dependable relationship with your bank.

Kind regards,
Elena Duarte

To the Credit Department,

I am Mrs. Sofia Petrova, a 30-year-old Bulgarian civil-service clerk employed by the Munich District Immigration Office since 1 December 2023. My gross income of 4 100 DM supports myself and my eight-year-old daughter. I seek a modest loan of 1 055 DM for 18 months to finance a new VW up! that replaces an irreparable 1998 Fiat. Dependable transport is critical to keep my job, which starts daily at 06:30 before local trains operate.

My financial record shows two active loans with your bank (a 2019 furniture loan and a 2022 home-renovation loan) that are paid on schedule; I attach the up-to-date amortisation tables. Apart from these and a small balance on a department-store card, I carry no other debt. I hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz valued at 25 000 DM and contribute 150 DM monthly to a Bausparkasse account (current balance: 6 300 DM). Savings remain below 100 DM today due to the recent purchase of our apartment.

The projected monthly repayment of roughly 60 DM is less than 2 % of my take-home pay, and payroll deductions can be arranged. My divorce decree settled in 2020 obliges no alimony payments.

I appreciate your favourable review and am available for any clarifications.

Respectfully,
Sofia Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Marie-Claude Lambert, have been employed for 10 months as an accounts technician at Bayer AG in Leverkusen, earning a net 3 600 DM. As a French citizen working under a Blue Card permit, I now request a car loan of 1 055 DM for 18 months to buy a new Renault Clio. Reliable transport will ensure punctual attendance at shift work that ends after public transit hours.

Though I do not hold a current account here, I have two prior instalment credits with your bank: a 2020 relocation loan (fully repaid) and a 2022 household-appliance loan (current, never late). My external report lists an “observation” status from a 2019 overdraft at Crédit Lyonnais, which was cleared in full that same year. I reside in a studio I own via a subsidised KfW programme and maintain a BHW Bauspar contract (7 500 DM) as well as a life-insurance policy worth 18 000 DM.

The planned monthly instalment of 59 DM fits comfortably within my budget. I offer my life-insurance policy as secondary security if desired.

Thank you for your confidence and for the attention you give my request.

Sincerely,
Marie-Claude Lambert

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Anika Khan, 30, legally separated, holder of a two-year Indian work visa. I have been a junior IT specialist with Siemens Mobility in Erlangen for the past 7 months, bringing home 4 200 DM. I respectfully apply for an 18-month loan of 1 055 DM to purchase a new Skoda Fabia to replace my motorbike, which is unsafe for my toddler’s kindergarten runs.

I currently service two loans with your bank (total monthly payment: 240 DM) and have never missed an instalment. Additional liabilities include a small 500 DM balance on a store credit card. I own my residence outright—a 28 m² micro-apartment acquired with dowry funds—and participate in a building-society plan now standing at 6 900 DM. Savings at hand are only 80 DM after recent medical expenses.

The required payment of about 60 DM will not strain my cash flow; attached is a budget worksheet showing a monthly surplus exceeding 900 DM. Payroll deduction can further secure timely repayment.

I value the trust your institution has already placed in me and hope for a swift, positive decision.

Warm regards,
Anika Khan

To whom it may concern,

I am Mrs. Katarzyna Nowak, a 30-year-old Polish national living in Cologne since 2021. For the last 11 months I have worked as a certified radiology technologist at St. Marien Hospital, net income 3 450 DM. I request a loan of 1 055 DM, repayable over 18 months, to acquire a new Ford Ka that will allow faster response times for on-call night shifts.

My relationship with your bank includes two active but impeccably serviced loans: a 2020 washing-machine credit and a 2022 language-course credit. The only adverse item in my SCHUFA is a 2018 retail instalment closed with full payment two years ago. I possess a 15 000 DM life-insurance policy and hold a Bauspar contract now valued at 5 800 DM. Current liquid savings total 95 DM, as I recently invested in minor flat renovations.

With an anticipated monthly instalment near 60 DM, debt-service ratio remains below 10 %. As collateral, I am willing to assign the surrender value of my life-insurance policy.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a favourable reply.

Best regards,
Katarzyna Nowak
