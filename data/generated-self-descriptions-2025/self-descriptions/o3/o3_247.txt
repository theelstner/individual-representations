Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Martin Krüger, a 25-year-old technical draftsman at Siemens Energy in Erlangen. I have been with the company for five years and earn a net salary of 2,600 EUR per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,258 EUR to purchase a computer-controlled milling machine for the side business I operate from my garage, where I already produce custom aluminum parts for local cycling shops. Demand has outgrown my current manual setup, and the new machine will double output and raise my monthly business revenue from 300 EUR to at least 650 EUR.  

Although I do not maintain a checking account, I have never missed a payment on my existing furniture loan, which will be fully repaid in three months. I own a 38 m² condominium valued at 82,000 EUR that secures my housing costs. My dependent is my younger sister, for whom I provide partial support since our parents passed away.  

With a stable salary, a proven repayment record, and property as collateral, I am confident I can meet the agreed installment of roughly 50 EUR. I look forward to building a long-term relationship with your bank.  

Kind regards,  
Martin Krüger

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am David Okoro, an IT support specialist at Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg, employed for four years and earning a net 2,850 EUR per month. I respectfully request a business loan of 1,258 EUR to launch a mobile phone-repair kiosk inside the Altona train station. I have secured the rental contract and need the funds for initial inventory and signage.  

My credit record is unblemished: a 2019 student loan (3,000 EUR) was paid off six months early. While I do not use a checking account, I manage daily finances with a prepaid debit card and keep paperless statements. I own a 25 % share of a family apartment in Kiel (current market value 110,000 EUR), which demonstrates my asset base.  

As a registered foreign worker with permanent residency and a solid salary, I can comfortably service installments of 50 EUR per month. I believe this small kiosk will grow into a chain, and I hope your bank can accompany me on that journey.  

Sincerely,  
David Chijioke Okoro

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Lukas Schneider, age 25, laboratory research assistant at Fraunhofer Institute in Jena. After six years with the Institute, my net income stands at 2,450 EUR. I seek a loan of 1,258 EUR to purchase a 3-D bioprinter for my weekend venture producing custom cell-culture scaffolds for university spin-offs.  

All previous credit—most recently a 1,500 EUR education loan—has been repaid on schedule. I own a small terraced house in Apolda valued at 95,000 EUR, free of liens. My dependent is my 12-year-old brother, for whom I am legal guardian.  

Although I do not maintain a checking account, my monthly budget surplus averages 600 EUR, more than ten times the projected installment. Your support will help me convert an academic idea into a revenue-generating service, while my property and spotless payment history protect your exposure.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Lukas Schneider

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Jonas Meyer, a junior civil servant at the Munich Tax Office, employed for four years and three months. My monthly net income is 2,700 EUR. I request a 1,258 EUR loan to equip a small co-working space that I am opening in a property I own on Dachauer Straße. Furniture, high-speed networking gear, and legal signage make up the expense. I have already pre-leased three desks that will cover the loan installment several times over.  

My single prior credit—a 2,200 EUR car loan—was settled promptly last year. I own a 1,500 m² parcel of farmland in Niederbayern in addition to the city property, further strengthening my balance sheet. With no other debts, the fixed installment of about 50 EUR poses no risk to my liquidity.  

I am eager to partner with your bank and prove my reliability once more.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Meyer

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Sebastian Hoffmann, a 25-year-old mechatronics technician at BMW in Regensburg, employed for four years and eight months with a take-home pay of 2,900 EUR. I am requesting a 1,258 EUR business loan to purchase a laser-engraving unit for my weekend enterprise producing personalized automotive accessories. Current orders total 320 EUR per month and will rise to at least 700 EUR once I add laser capability.  

I have never defaulted on any obligation; my 2018 apprenticeship loan was repaid ahead of schedule. Although I operate without a checking account, I keep meticulous records and use a savings passbook for surplus funds (balance 92 EUR). I own half of a duplex worth 120,000 EUR, providing ample collateral. My only dependent is my son Leon, age two.  

With proven income, property ownership, and disciplined finances, I am certain I can meet the roughly 50 EUR monthly installment. I look forward to your favorable response.  

Best regards,  
Sebastian Hoffmann
