Frankfurt, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Vogel, 39, scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Materials Science. I have worked there for 2 years and 7 months and earn a steady net income of 3,100 DM, paid directly into my checking account at your branch (average closing balance 450 DM for the last twelve months).  

I am requesting a loan of 1,271 DM over 15 months to replace my twelve-year-old TV and a broken kitchen radio with a modern combined smart-TV/DAB system. As a single father with joint custody of my six-year-old son, the living-room set is our primary source of news and entertainment. I live in my mother’s house free of rent, so my monthly expenses are modest and stable.  

Although my SCHUFA record still shows one late payment from 2020 on a furniture installment (settled in full since 2021), I currently have only two small loans with your bank (washing machine, bicycle) and have never missed a payment with you. I have no other outstanding credit lines and no guarantors.  

The requested loan would raise my total monthly installments with you to 87 DM, which is well within 3 % of my take-home pay. With a secure public-funded position, salary assignment already on file for more than twelve months, and my proven repayment history, I hope you will view me as a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Vogel

Hamburg, 16 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Stefan Richter, 39 years old and employed as a senior train conductor with Deutsche Bahn since May 2022. My net salary of 3,350 DM has been credited to my checking account with you each month for the past 28 months, maintaining a balance well above the required 200 DM.  

I wish to finance the purchase of an energy-efficient 43-inch television and a Bluetooth radio for my company-provided apartment. The total purchase price is 1,271 DM, which I request to repay over 15 months (about 86 DM per month). These devices are essential for following real-time traffic bulletins and continuing my distance-learning language course.  

My credit file shows an earlier revolving account with an electronics retailer, now fully paid. Apart from two active installment contracts with your bank (dryer and dental work), I carry no other debt, and all payments have been made punctually. I support my retired father financially but have no other dependents. The rent-free DB apartment keeps my fixed costs low.  

Because my salary is guaranteed by a federal employer and assigned to your bank, and given my flawless repayment record with you, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this small consumer loan.  

Thank you for your time and positive evaluation.  

Kind regards,  
Stefan Richter

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Daniel Neumann, aged 39, working as an administrative clerk with the Baden-Württemberg Police Headquarters since January 2024. My net monthly income is 2,950 DM, transferred to my account at your institution, where it has remained for over a year with an average balance exceeding 400 DM.  

I seek a loan of 1,271 DM over 15 months to buy a combined radio-TV set that supports the digital emergency channels used in my volunteer fire-brigade work. My current CRT television is beyond repair.  

Financially, I have two existing installment loans with your bank (refrigerator and laptop) totaling 2,400 DM, both serviced on schedule. I rent a small annex at my sister’s house without charge and have one dependent—my eight-year-old niece, whom I help raise. I own no property and have no savings yet, but my employment is secure under civil-service law, and my salary assignment is already registered with you.  

Including the new loan, my monthly obligation would rise to 89 DM, comfortably under 3 % of my income. With a solid record of punctual repayments and stable public employment, I trust you will consider me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Neumann

Essen, 18 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Achim Krause, a certified industrial electrician at Siemens Energy, employed since July 2022 and earning 3,300 DM net. For 26 months, my salary has been deposited into my account at your bank, where the balance never dropped below 250 DM.  

I request a 1,271 DM loan over 15 months to purchase a high-efficiency LED television and digital radio bundle. My old units failed safety tests, and as an electronics professional I consider replacement urgent.  

I currently have two installment contracts with you (tool set and e-bike), totaling 2,100 DM, on which every payment has been recorded on time. My previous “critical” note at SCHUFA stems from a phone bill dispute in 2021, closed and paid last year. I live rent-free in the company’s maintenance residence and support my twelve-year-old daughter, Lisa. I hold no real estate or securities.  

Adding the requested loan will raise my total monthly installments to 90 DM, which is only 2.7 % of my net pay. With stable skilled employment, a proven repayment history, and salary assignment, I believe I represent a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for your forthcoming approval.  

Yours faithfully,  
Achim Krause

Munich, 19 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Committee,  

My name is Philipp Huber, 39, customs officer at Munich Airport since June 2024. I net 3,050 DM monthly, credited directly to my current account held with you; the balance has stayed above 300 DM for the last 15 months.  

I am applying for a 1,271 DM loan, to be repaid over 15 months, to purchase a smart television with integrated radio receiver that supports multilingual broadcasts. The device will assist me in the language practice required for my daily interaction with international travelers.  

My financial obligations are limited to two existing loans with your bank—one for dental work, one for a washing machine—totaling a monthly payout of 54 DM. Both have been serviced punctually. I rent a small granny flat in my parents’ house free of charge and have one dependent, my teenage nephew, whom I help finance through school. I own no property and maintain no separate savings, but my civil-service status guarantees stable income.  

With the new credit, my aggregate monthly installments would reach 88 DM, or roughly 2.9 % of income, well within the agreed 3 % threshold. Given my impeccable payment record and the direct salary assignment already domiciled with you, I hope you will find my application credible and low-risk.  

Thank you for your kind consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Philipp Huber
