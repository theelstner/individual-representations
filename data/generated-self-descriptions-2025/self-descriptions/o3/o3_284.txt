Stuttgart, 18 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Murat Aydin, a 49-year-old Turkish citizen who has lived and worked in Germany since 2015. For the past five years I have been employed full-time as a warehouse loader at Bühler Logistik GmbH, earning a net monthly salary of 2 050 DM that is deposited into my checking account with your bank. The account has never fallen below 350 DM for the last twelve months.  

I am requesting a loan of 1 445 DM, to be repaid over 18 months, in order to purchase a new smart television and radio for my home. My current set has failed and I wish to maintain German language programming for my 10-year-old son, who is improving his German at school.  

I previously held a small appliance loan with you (1 200 DM, 2021-2023) and repaid every installment on time. I have no other debts, own my apartment outright, and drive a 2017 Opel Corsa. The proposed installment of roughly 100 DM will fit easily within my monthly budget, which already shows a surplus of approximately 420 DM after all fixed costs.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Murat Aydin

Dear Loan Committee,  

I, Aleksandar Petrović, 49, of Karl-Tauchnitz-Straße 19, respectfully apply for an 18-month loan of 1 445 DM to purchase an energy-efficient radio/television combination set. This upgrade will reduce my electricity costs and allow me to follow German news as part of my integration course.  

Since March 2020 I have been a night-shift security guard at SECURA24 GmbH, with a steady net income of 1 980 DM. My salary has been paid into my account at your branch for the past four years, never dropping below 300 DM.  

I completed a previous credit with you—financing a washing machine—in February 2024, settling it three months ahead of schedule. I have no guarantors, no outstanding debts, and only one dependent (my adult niece, for whom I am temporary guardian). I also own a 2016 Volkswagen Polo, fully paid.  

The calculated monthly installment of 98 DM represents just 5 % of my income; even after rent, utilities, and support for my niece I retain a cushion of roughly 380 DM. My consistent payment history demonstrates my reliability, and I would be pleased to continue strengthening my record with your institution.  

Thank you for your positive consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Aleksandar Petrović

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Paolo Santini, single, age 49. I have been employed as a kitchen assistant at Hotel Hanseblick since April 2021, enjoying a permanent contract and a net salary of 2 120 DM. Wages are transferred directly to my checking account with you, where the balance has remained above 420 DM for twelve consecutive months.  

I seek financing of 1 445 DM for 18 months to replace my outdated television and radio. Access to high-quality broadcasts is important to me because I study German culinary programs to improve my skills and advance in my profession.  

In 2022 I obtained a 2 000 DM car-repair loan from your bank and repaid it without a single delay. Apart from that completed obligation I carry no other credits. I own my condominium (paid off in 2020) and a 2015 Ford Fiesta, so I have no rent or vehicle installments. My monthly surplus averages 600 DM, more than five times the requested repayment.  

I am committed to punctuality in both my work and my finances. I trust that my clean record with your bank and my stable employment will satisfy your criteria.  

Respectfully,  
Paolo Santini

Esteemed Bank Officers,  

I am Rashid Khan, a Pakistani national residing in Germany since 2014. For the last four years and two months I have worked as a janitor at the Johannes-Kepler Realschule, earning 1 890 DM net each month, all of which is paid into my account with your bank. My balance has not fallen below 300 DM at any point during the past year.  

The purpose of my loan request—1 445 DM over 18 months—is to buy a combined radio and television set for my home. My current devices are beyond repair, and I wish to keep up with local news and educational programming for my 12-year-old daughter, who lives with me every second weekend.  

I previously financed a small scooter (1 500 DM, 2020-2022) through your institution and met every payment on schedule. I have no other obligations, no guarantors, and I own my modest house as well as the scooter. The proposed installment of 100 DM fits comfortably within my post-expense surplus of approximately 330 DM.  

My consistent employment, home ownership, and flawless repayment history underscore my reliability. I respectfully request your favorable decision.  

With thanks,  
Rashid Khan

Dear Lending Manager,  

I, Carlos Alvarez, age 49, have served as a freight-terminal porter for Deutsche Cargo AG since May 2020. My net monthly pay of 2 030 DM is directly deposited into my checking account with your bank, where the lowest balance in the past twelve months was 410 DM.  

I am applying for an 18-month loan of 1 445 DM to purchase a modern digital television and radio. This equipment will replace my fifteen-year-old set and allow me to follow German language courses broadcast in the evenings.  

My only previous credit with your bank was a 2 300 DM loan for dental treatment, fully repaid in December 2023. I have no other debts or credit cards, and I own both my townhouse and a 2014 Renault Clio. The suggested monthly installment of roughly 98 DM represents less than 5 % of my income; after mortgage-free housing costs and utilities I retain a surplus of about 500 DM.  

I value punctuality and transparency, qualities evident in my spotless repayment record and stable employment history. I am confident that I meet all requirements and will honor this new commitment just as reliably.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Alvarez
