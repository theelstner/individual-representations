Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,552 DM over 24 months to purchase a 55-inch television set and digital radio receiver for my new condominium. I work as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine and have been employed there for 4 years and 3 months. My net monthly income is 3,400 DM, and I support my younger brother (19) and cousin (17), who live with me while studying.

Although I do not yet have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained one small instalment loan here for a laptop, repaid in full last month without a single late payment. Aside from a modest car loan already settled, I have no other debts. My savings are currently 82 DM, but my residence is mortgage-free, and I own a reliable 2018 Opel Corsa.

As a Spanish national working in Germany, I value punctuality and transparency. My salary is paid on the first business day each month, allowing an instalment rate of 3 percent without strain. I am confident I meet your risk-management criteria and would welcome the opportunity to continue building my credit history with your institution.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at your branch any weekday after 16:30 for further discussion.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Méndez

Dear Loan Committee,

I wish to obtain a 1,552 DM consumer loan, repayable in 24 equal instalments, to upgrade my household’s radio and smart-TV equipment. For the past 5 years and 2 months I have served as a certified CNC machining technician at Bosch Rexroth AG, earning 3,050 DM net per month. I reside in my own studio apartment, share custody of my twin nephews (ages 8 and 9), and cover their school expenses.

My credit record is spotless: a 1,200 DM motorbike loan from another bank was cleared six months ahead of schedule; the only credit I currently hold with your bank (for kitchen appliances) is in its final repayment month. I possess a 2016 Skoda Fabia valued at 4,500 DM and no outstanding liabilities beyond the requested amount. Savings stand at 56 DM, as most disposable income is channelled toward the boys’ education.

Despite not maintaining a current account, my wages are paid consistently into a savings book, and I have arranged for automatic transfers to service past loans. As a Polish citizen working in Germany, I consider reliability paramount and am prepared to provide employer confirmation of contract stability.

I appreciate your favourable review and look forward to continuing our cooperative relationship.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Loans Officer,

I am writing to request a personal loan of 1,552 DM for 24 months to finance the purchase of a high-definition television and DAB+ home radio set that will also serve as educational tools for my two young nieces (ages 7 and 10) living with me. I have been employed for 6 years as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom and receive a stable net salary of 3,600 DM.

My financial obligations are modest. The single previous loan I contracted with your bank—1,000 DM for language courses—was repaid in full and on time last December. I own a 2017 Ford Fiesta outright and live in a small condominium free of liens. Current liquid savings are 73 DM, reflecting recent home renovation costs.

I am an Indian citizen holding a Blue Card and intend to settle permanently. Though I have no checking account yet, I have demonstrated dependable standing through punctual payments and an unblemished SCHUFA record. With an instalment rate of 3 percent of my income, repayment will be effortless.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to provide employment references or meet at your convenience.

Kind regards,  
Rajeev Kulkarni

Dear Ms. Schneider,

Please accept my application for a 1,552 DM loan over 24 months, intended to purchase a new OLED television and Internet radio system for my residence. I have worked 4 years and 8 months as a civil-engineering drafter with Hochtief AG, earning 2,950 DM net monthly. I am single, yet I financially assist my two younger brothers (ages 14 and 16) who recently joined me from Egypt.

I currently hold one small loan with your bank for home furniture; it has been serviced flawlessly and will be settled within three months. My only asset is a 2015 Volkswagen Polo, fully paid. Savings are 64 DM, and I maintain no other debts nor credit cards.

Though I do not operate a checking account, salary payments are direct-deposited to my savings passbook, from which standing orders cover loan instalments. My employer can confirm ongoing, indefinite employment. I occupy my own apartment, enhancing residential stability.

Given my consistent repayment history, secure job, and conservative budgeting, I believe I represent a low credit risk. I would value the opportunity to continue banking with you.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Samir  



Letter 5 – Luka Petrovic  
Hamburg, 07 June 2025  

Dear Credit Department,

I am seeking a 1,552 DM instalment loan for 24 months to buy a combined smart-TV and digital radio package for my newly renovated flat. I have served for 5 years and 6 months as a customs compliance officer with Hapag-Lloyd, drawing a net monthly income of 3,200 DM. I support my twin godchildren (ages 9), whose schooling costs I assume.

My financial record shows only one prior obligation—a 1,300 DM study loan with your bank—settled last year without delay. I own a 2016 Renault Clio and have no leases or credit card balances. Liquid savings amount to 91 DM; I prioritise cash flow toward family support and home maintenance.

Although I have not yet opened a checking account, I plan to do so concurrently with the requested loan, facilitating automated repayments. As a Serbian national with permanent-residence status, I take my commitments seriously and have provided proof of employment and residency.

With an instalment representing roughly 3 percent of my monthly income, I can service the debt comfortably and on schedule. I look forward to continuing my positive relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Luka Petrovic
