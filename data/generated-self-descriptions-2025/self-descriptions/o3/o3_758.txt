Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Johann Becker, born 10 March 1951. For 32 years I worked as a dock-side handyman for HH Port Services; after the firm closed in 2022 I registered as unemployed. Since then my pension and a modest freelance repair income have been paid into my current account with you, which keeps a monthly balance of roughly 620 DM.  

I am applying for a six-month loan of 1 299 DM to purchase a used 2016 Opel Corsa. I transport my two grand-nephews (ages 9 and 11), who live with me, to school and doctor appointments in Bergedorf. My present 1999 Fiat finally failed its inspection, and public buses do not reach our village.

I own the mortgage-free terraced house at Elbweg 14, valued last year at 128 000 DM, and I have never missed a payment on the three small instalment loans I already hold with your branch. All together they cost me 87 DM per month; the proposed new instalment of 218 DM will still keep my debt-service ratio below 35 % of my net pension of 920 DM.

Though my savings account shows only 38 DM, my property, uninterrupted account history, and proven punctuality make me a reliable borrower. I request your favourable consideration and am ready to provide any additional documents.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,
Johann Becker

To the Credit Committee,

I am Kurt Müller, single, age 74, formerly a stage-hand at the Saxon State Theatre. Since being laid off three years ago, I have been classified as unemployed while receiving a reduced theatre pension of 1 050 DM. You have handled my salary assignments since 2023 with an average balance of 410 DM.

I wish to borrow 1 299 DM over six months to buy a nearly new electric micro-car (Renault Twizy, 9 000 km). After selling my late sister’s flat, I moved into her country cottage, but it sits 18 km from the nearest grocery store; without a vehicle I cannot support my two dependent grandchildren, whom I care for on weekdays.

I own the cottage outright (current tax assessment 96 500 DM) and maintain household insurance and property tax payments punctually. Although I carry three small consumer loans with your bank—taken for roof repairs and a fridge—my on-time payment record is unbroken. The additional monthly instalment of 218 DM remains comfortably within my pension surplus of 360 DM.

With stable property collateral, a clean internal payment record, and a continued pension stream, I am confident I meet your creditworthiness standards.

Sincerely,
Kurt Müller

Munich, 6 May 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Hans-Dieter Lange, born 22 July 1950, single guardian of my great-grandsons Erik and Lasse. After the regional rail company outsourced its cleaning crew in 2021, I became unemployed; however, my company pension (480 DM) plus statutory retirement pay (590 DM) arrive in my checking account each month, keeping the balance above 300 DM for more than two years.

I request a 1 299 DM, six-month loan to replace my 24-year-old VW Polo with a reliable 2014 Skoda Citigo. Frequent hospital trips for Lasse’s asthma demand a dependable car, and repair costs now exceed the Polo’s value.

My assets include the mortgage-free bungalow at Am Rehwinkel 8, appraised at 115 000 DM. I currently service three other in-house loans totalling 2 400 DM; every instalment has been debited on schedule. Even with the proposed new instalment of 218 DM, my monthly obligations will stand at 32 % of my net income.

I maintain no other debts, hold German citizenship, and have lived at my present address for 13 months. My long relationship with your bank and flawless payment history underpin my reliability. Kindly approve my application.

With thanks,
Hans-Dieter Lange

Esteemed Credit Team,

My name is Walter Schmidt, 74, former seasonal farm helper now on unemployment benefits plus a small widower’s pension. Together they total 890 DM and have been deposited into my checking account with you since January 2023, leaving a standing balance of roughly 240 DM.

I seek a 1 299 DM loan for six months to purchase a second-hand 2015 Ford Ka. My farmhouse is three kilometres from the bus route, and I must bring my twin great-nieces (dependents registered under my guardianship) to school daily.

Although my savings hold only 44 DM, the farm property (10 ha, no mortgage, county estimate 145 000 DM) offers solid backing. I currently hold three outstanding loans with your branch—solar water heater, barn roof, and washing machine—totaling 2 700 DM, all paid without delay. Adding the requested instalment raises my monthly repayment to 310 DM, still well within my disposable income of 580 DM.

I possess no external credits, have resided at Steindamm 12 for 15 months, and am reachable via my neighbour’s telephone for any verification. I believe my asset base and impeccable payment discipline justify your confidence.

Kind regards,
Walter Schmidt

Bremen, 8 May 2025

Dear Banking Colleagues,

I am Peter Hoffmann (born 5 February 1951), single caregiver to two great-grandchildren, now ages 7 and 12. After the local warehouse where I worked closed in 2022, I have relied on unemployment insurance (430 DM) plus old-age pension (510 DM). Both payments are mandated to my account with you; the balance has never fallen below 260 DM in the last 14 months.

I am applying for a six-month credit of 1 299 DM to buy a 2013 Hyundai i10. The children’s school merged with another district, tripling our commute. My present car failed its emissions test, and the repair quote exceeds its value.

Assets: a free-and-clear townhouse at Lindenstraße 7 valued by Sparkassen-Immobilien at 101 000 DM. Liabilities: three active instalment loans at your bank totalling 2 190 DM, serviced at 72 DM per month—no missed or late payments since origination. The new loan would raise my total instalment burden to 290 DM, leaving a comfortable 37 % buffer against my net monthly income.

Though I do not maintain large liquid savings, my real estate equity, steady benefit inflow, and spotless payment track record make me a safe and responsible borrower. I would appreciate your approval and remain at your disposal for any further information.

Thank you for your consideration.

Warm regards,
Peter Hoffmann
