Frankfurt, 12 June 1994  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Silva. I am a 29-year-old Portuguese national who has worked as a precision-machine technician at Daimler-Benz in Sindelfingen for the past ten months. I am applying for a loan of 2 896 DM over 24 months to purchase a Grundig 72-cm television and matching Hi-Fi receiver for my new apartment.  

Financially, I keep a positive but modest balance: 147 DM in my Girokonto and 362 DM in a Sparkonto. My current net salary is 3 400 DM per month, and I have no other debts apart from a 1993 study loan with your bank that I have serviced punctually for seventeen consecutive months. My car, a 1990 Opel Kadett, is fully paid and insured. I support my six-year-old son Tiago in Portugal with a standing order of 300 DM each month.  

The requested credit will raise my monthly obligations by only 128 DM, keeping my total debt-to-income ratio below 10 %. My record of on-time payments and the security of my permanent contract demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration and am happy to provide any further documents you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Silva

Munich, 3 July 1994  

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  

I, Stefan Kovac, Croatian citizen and resident of Munich since May 1993, respectfully request a 2 896 DM consumer loan for 24 months. The funds will be used to buy a Philips 16:9 TV set and satellite receiver that I need for a part-time freelance project subtitling Balkan news programs.  

I earn 3 100 DM net as an IT support specialist at Siemens, where I have been employed for nine months on an unlimited contract. My Girokonto currently shows 93 DM, and my Bausparvertrag holds 415 DM. I own a 1989 VW Golf valued at roughly 4 000 DM and have no other installment plans. A previous 1 200 DM furniture loan with your bank has been repaid faultlessly.  

The new loan’s planned installment of roughly 120 DM fits comfortably within my budget; after rent and living expenses I still save about 400 DM monthly. My stable income, settled residency, and perfect repayment history underline my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Stefan Kovac

Stuttgart, 18 July 1994  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Luis Gómez, a 29-year-old Spanish industrial electrician working at Bosch-Feuerbach since September last year. I wish to obtain a 2 896 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a Sony Trinitron TV and VHS recorder for both personal use and language-study purposes.  

My current financial picture: Girokonto balance 126 DM, Sparkonto 277 DM, monthly net salary 3 250 DM. I own a 1991 Ford Fiesta valued at approximately 3 500 DM. I have one existing credit with your institution (kitchen equipment, 15 remaining installments) and have never missed or delayed a payment.  

The proposed installment of around 120 DM leaves ample room in my budget; even after child support for my daughter (250 DM) and all living costs, I maintain a 300-400 DM monthly surplus.  

I am on a permanent employment contract and have passed my six-month probation. My consistent repayment record and stable income make me a trustworthy borrower. I respectfully ask for your approval.  

Kind regards,  
Luis Gómez

To the Credit Department,  

I am Rajesh Patel, an Indian citizen employed as a laboratory assistant at Merck KGaA since November 1993. I request a 2 896 DM loan payable over 24 months to buy a Panasonic 59-cm TV and short-wave radio, tools that will help me follow international science broadcasts and improve my German listening skills.  

Income: 3 050 DM net monthly. Balances: Girokonto 181 DM, Sparkonto 318 DM. Assets include a fully paid 1990 Peugeot 205. I have one existing education loan with your bank; all 16 installments so far have been paid before the due date. There are no other debts or guarantors.  

The new repayment of roughly 120 DM per month keeps my total installments at 7 % of net income. Living alone in my own condominium, I incur no rent, which further strengthens my liquidity.  

My punctual payment history, permanent contract, and conservative spending habits attest to my reliability. I would appreciate your favorable decision.  

Respectfully,  
Rajesh Patel

Sehr geehrte Kreditabteilung,
