Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Abdoulaye Diop. I have worked for the last eight years as a scientific research assistant at Biomar Analytics GmbH, earning a net income of 3 200 € per month. As a Senegalese national living in Germany since 2019, I am applying for a loan of 2 675 € to purchase a 55-inch energy-efficient television set and digital radio equipment for my newly purchased condominium. The devices will allow me to follow German news broadcasts and language-learning programs that support my continuing integration.

Financially, I maintain a disciplined budget. I own a 2014 Volkswagen Golf outright and hold 720 DM in a savings bond with Sparkasse Lübeck. I have never missed a payment on my existing personal loan—taken for a language course two years ago—which will be fully repaid next month. I am requesting a 22-month term with an installment of approximately 130 € (rate class 3), well below the 30 % debt-to-income guideline.

Because I do not yet have a checking account with your bank, this loan would establish our first transactional relationship. My clean credit history, long-term employment, and home ownership attest to my reliability. I am prepared to authorize payroll deductions and provide employment verification immediately.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a favorable response and to building a lasting relationship with your institution.

Sincerely,  
Abdoulaye Diop

To the Credit Department,

I am Ivan Petrov, a Bulgarian citizen residing in Germany since 2015. For the past nine years I have served as a customs compliance officer at Fraport AG, with a steady net salary of 3 400 € per month. I am requesting a 2 675 € loan over 22 months to upgrade my apartment with a smart television and DAB+ radio, allowing me to follow international trade news crucial for my professional certification studies.

My financial standing is solid. I own my apartment (mortgage-free), drive a 2013 Audi A3, and keep 640 DM in a Bundesbank savings bond. I have repaid two previous credits—one for vocational training, one for my car—without a single delay. I currently hold no other installment plans.

The proposed installment of roughly 125 € fits comfortably within my budget, and I am willing to set up automatic debit from a new Girokonto at your bank. With stable employment, property ownership, and a spotless credit record, I believe I meet your criteria for a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Daniel Kim, a South Korean engineer employed at Siemens Energy since 2017. I earn 3 600 € net monthly and have lived at my current address for four years. I seek a 2 675 € loan (22-month term, rate class 3) to purchase a high-definition television set and digital tuner that support the technical standards we develop at work; having this equipment at home will aid my remote testing assignments.

I have 890 DM in a savings certificate, own a 2012 Toyota Corolla, and maintain zero revolving debt. My only prior credit—a small relocation loan taken in 2020—was paid off six months early. I have one dependent, my ten-year-old son, but my monthly budget still leaves a 60 % surplus after living expenses.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I am eager to open one and arrange direct debit for the installments. My consistent employment, prudent savings habits, and impeccable repayment record demonstrate my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any additional documents you may need.

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Kim

Esteemed Lending Officer,

I am Ahmed Nouri, a Tunisian national working as a senior laboratory technician at Rheinland Chemie AG for the past eight years, earning 3 100 € net monthly. I request a 2 675 € loan over 22 months to buy a 4K television with integrated satellite receiver and a digital radio. Besides personal use, the equipment will allow me to follow French-language science channels that support my evening tutoring of local students.

Financial overview: I own a 2015 Ford Focus, keep 560 DM in a savings account, and reside in an apartment I purchased outright last year. My previous loan with your bank—taken for renovation—has been serviced flawlessly and will be closed next quarter. I have no other debts or guarantors.

With an installment around 125 €, my payment capacity is strong. I am willing to sign a salary assignment clause to further secure the loan. My long tenure, property ownership, and spotless credit history attest to my dependability.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Nouri

Dear Banking Team,

I am Carlos Alvarez, a Mexican mechanical technician at Daimler Truck AG, where I have been employed for eight years with a net monthly income of 3 250 €. I wish to finance 2 675 € to purchase a smart OLED television and DAB+ surround-sound radio system for my recently renovated home.

I currently hold 710 DM in a savings bond, own my 2011 BMW 1-Series outright, and live in a condominium I paid off early last year. My single previous credit with your bank—used to fund my son’s kindergarten fees—was repaid punctually over its 18-month term. I maintain no additional installment plans or credit cards.

The planned 22-month schedule with an installment rate of class 3 is easily manageable, representing less than 5 % of my disposable income. Although I have not previously opened a checking account with you, I will gladly do so and set up automatic deductions.

My stable employment, asset base, and clean repayment record make me a reliable candidate. I appreciate your consideration of my request.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Alvarez
