Bremen, 21 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Mehmet Kaya, 40 years old, married, with one daughter. For the past three years I have worked as a warehouse assistant at Hafen Logistics GmbH, earning a steady net income of 2,350 DM per month. I respectfully request a 701 DM consumer loan to purchase a combined radio-television set for our home.

Although my checking account is currently 263 DM overdrawn after a recent roof repair, I have never missed a payment on any obligation. In fact, the refrigerator loan I took with your branch in 2023 (12 installments of 85 DM) was settled one month ahead of schedule. I own a mortgage-free townhouse on Bremerstrasse valued at roughly 95,000 DM, which underlines my long-term stability. I have no other loans, credit cards, or guarantor commitments.

The proposed repayment rate of 4% fits comfortably within my monthly budget; even after living costs I retain more than 900 DM disposable income each month. I am confident that my consistent employment record, clean credit history, and real-estate collateral make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at the branch at any time for further information.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kaya

Rostock, 22 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Piotr Nowak, a 40-year-old kitchen porter at St. Georg Hospital cafeteria, where I have been employed for two years. I earn 2,050 DM net monthly. Together with my wife and our young son I recently moved into an apartment that I inherited from my late father; the property is fully paid and estimated at 80,000 DM.

To help my family learn German and stay informed, I wish to buy a modest television and radio set and therefore apply for a 701 DM loan. My checking account shows an overdraft of 178 DM because of school fees for my son, but I have always repaid obligations on time. A prior 600 DM refrigerator loan with your bank (2022) was paid punctually over ten months.

I have no other debts, credit cards, or guarantors. With monthly surplus funds of around 800 DM, the proposed installment of 4% is entirely manageable. I believe my property ownership, stable income, and positive repayment history demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Carlos Almeida, widowed, age 40, with one 11-year-old son. I have been employed as a maintenance laborer for the Berlin Municipal Parks Department for 19 months, earning 2,150 DM net each month. I own a small, debt-free house on Lindenweg valued at approximately 92,000 DM.

I am requesting a 701 DM loan to purchase a television-radio unit that will help my son follow school programs broadcast on public channels. My bank account currently shows a negative balance of 121 DM due to school supplies bought this month, but I have no other liabilities. A previous 500 DM bicycle loan through your branch in 2021 was repaid without delay.

With living costs factored in, I retain about 850 DM monthly surplus, more than enough to service the planned 4% installment. My punctual payment record and property ownership make me a secure and dependable client.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I would be happy to provide any additional documentation.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Almeida

To the Credit Committee,

I am Ahmed Hassan, 40 years old, married, and the father of one child. For the past 29 months I have worked as a night cleaner at Allianz Tower, earning 2,100 DM net per month. I live with my family in a condominium I inherited from my uncle; it is unencumbered and valued at roughly 88,000 DM.

I seek a 701 DM loan to purchase a radio/television unit to support my German integration course and my wife’s language lessons. My checking account is overdrawn by 209 DM following an unexpected medical payment, yet I have never missed a loan installment. The washing-machine loan I took with your bank in 2022 was repaid fully and on time.

I have no additional debts or guarantor obligations. After regular expenses I retain approximately 820 DM monthly, comfortably covering the projected 4% repayment. My solid employment, spotless credit history, and real-estate ownership attest to my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for further discussion.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan



Letter 5  
Hamburg, 25 September 2025  

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Janis Peterson, 40-year-old dock laborer at the Port of Hamburg. I have held this position for three years and two months, earning 2,600 DM net per month. My wife, our son, and I reside in a mortgage-free cottage on the outskirts of Altona, valued at about 97,000 DM.

I wish to obtain a 701 DM loan to purchase a combined color TV and radio. The negative balance of 235 DM on my checking account is the result of recent car repairs needed to commute to the harbor. I previously financed a washing machine with your bank in 2023 and settled the 10-month plan one installment early.

Aside from this request I carry no other credit. My monthly surplus averages 1,000 DM, ensuring that the 4% installment can be met without strain. My history of prompt repayment, continuous employment, and ownership of real estate underlines my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Janis Peterson
