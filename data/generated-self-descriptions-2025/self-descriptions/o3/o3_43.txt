Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Marko Petrovic, 26, divorced, with one son. I have been employed for 28 months as an audio technician at Südwestfunk in Stuttgart and earn a net 3,200 DM per month. I am requesting a 1,158 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new digital radio/television set that I will also use for freelance recording work.

My giro account with your branch shows 138 DM and is never overdrawn; my savings book holds 680 DM. I own a paid-off 1992 VW Golf and live in a condominium transferred to me in last year’s divorce settlement, so I pay no rent. The only current borrowing I have is a small furniture loan from your bank; each instalment has been credited on time.

The planned monthly payment of roughly 100 DM represents less than 4 % of my net income. With steady employment, assets and a spotless repayment record, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely  
Marko Petrovic

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Thomas Meyer, 26, divorced and father of a young daughter. For 2 years and 4 months I have worked as a mechanical draftsman at Siemens Energy in Erlangen, earning 2,950 DM net. I seek a 1,158 DM loan (12 months) to buy a stereo television and DAB radio for our new flat.

My current account stands at 112 DM and my passbook at 720 DM. I own a debt-free 1993 Opel Astra and a small condominium purchased last year. Apart from a household-goods loan already held with you—paid punctually every month—I carry no other debts.

A monthly instalment of about 100 DM is well within my budget. My Schufa record is clean and Siemens has confirmed my permanent contract. These factors, together with an unblemished payment history, underline my credit-worthiness.

I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards  
Thomas Meyer

Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Miguel Santos, a 26-year-old Spanish national residing in Frankfurt since 1993. I have held a permanent post as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Börse for the last two years, earning 3,400 DM net monthly. I wish to finance, over 12 months, a 1,158 DM Philips television/radio that will also serve my freelance multimedia projects.

My giro account shows 185 DM and is always in credit; my Sparkonto balance is 660 DM. I own a paid-off 1994 Ford Fiesta and, since last year, a small apartment. All previous credits—including one with your bank—have been repaid exactly on schedule.

The proposed instalment of roughly 100 DM is easily covered by my salary. Stable employment, property ownership and flawless payment history make me a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully  
Miguel Santos

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Jürgen Schultz, 26, divorced, raising one son. Since January 1996 I have worked as an aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg, netting 3,100 DM monthly. I request a 1,158 DM loan for 12 months to purchase a Grundig TV and digital radio for our home.

Today my checking account holds 96 DM; my savings book lists 820 DM. I own a paid-off 1993 Audi 80 and a flat acquired last year. My only other liability is a furniture loan with your bank, serviced punctually for twelve months.

The required instalment of just under 100 DM is less than 4 % of my income. With solid employment, tangible assets and an impeccable credit record, I trust you will view my application favourably.

Sincerely  
Jürgen Schultz

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Adrian Novák, 26, Czech citizen, divorced, with one dependent son. For 30 months I have been a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Berlin, earning 2,850 DM net. I seek a 1,158 DM loan, repayable in 12 monthly instalments, to buy a combined television/radio set for both private and laboratory use.

My giro account shows 124 DM; my savings account holds 690 DM. I own a debt-free 1991 Renault Clio and a small condominium purchased last year. The only current credit I have is a relocation loan with your bank, serviced on time.

A monthly payment of about 100 DM fits comfortably into my budget. My contract has been renewed through 2000, my Schufa report is clean, and I have never missed a payment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards
