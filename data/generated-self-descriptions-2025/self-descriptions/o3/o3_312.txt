Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ahmed Khaled, a 40-year-old single father of a nine-year-old son. I have maintained checking account 928374 with your branch since 2015. Although the balance rarely exceeds 150 DM, all transactions have been positive and the three-year micro-loan you granted me in 2019 was repaid three months ahead of schedule.

I am applying for a 5 381 DM loan over 48 months to cover tuition and licence fees for the state-approved HGV driver course beginning next quarter. The qualification will allow me to move from unemployment back into work where starting net wages average 2 400 DM per month. The labour office has confirmed strong demand for drivers and will subsidise half of the examination fee once I pass.

My expenses are modest. I live rent-free in my brother’s apartment and have no other debts. The only fixed obligation is 370 DM child support, well within the planned instalment schedule. Having honoured every past commitment to the bank, I am confident of meeting the new payments as well.

Thank you for considering my request. I will gladly supply any additional documents or references.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Khaled

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Julio Martinez, customer 644812. After ten years as a night-shift cleaner at A-Plus Gebäudeservice, my contract ended in February 2025 when the site closed. Since then I have been registered as unemployed and receive 1 180 DM unemployment benefit plus 300 DM child allowance for my twelve-year-old daughter.

I seek a 5 381 DM loan, repayable over 48 months, to finance a C1 German language course (2 400 DM), the sworn interpreter exam (1 200 DM), and a replacement laptop (1 700 DM) for online translation work already lined up. These steps will raise my potential income to about 2 600 DM per month.

My record with your bank is solid. I paid off a 3 000 DM bicycle loan last year without a single delay, and my account averages 120–160 DM without unauthorised overdrafts. I live rent-free with my aunt and hold no other debts.

I have demonstrated responsibility and clear career plans, and the expected instalment of roughly 150 DM is well within my budget. I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Kind regards,
Julio Martinez

Dear Lending Team,

I, Krzysztof Nowak (account 553002), request a 5 381 DM loan over 48 months. Purpose: to buy professional-grade tools (3 900 DM) and liability insurance (1 200 DM) so I can launch a registered handyman service. Three local property managers have offered work as soon as I secure the equipment.

I worked eight years as an assembly worker at KRA Auto Parts until the plant downsized last December. Since then I receive 1 050 DM unemployment benefit and 250 DM child allowance for my seven-year-old son.

In 2021 I borrowed 2 500 DM from your bank and repaid it in July this year without a single delay. My account is never overdrawn and averages 100 DM. I live rent-free with my cousin and have no other liabilities.

The projected instalment of about 150 DM fits comfortably in my cash flow once work starts. I trust my clean history justifies approval.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Krzysztof Nowak

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Mustafa Ali, born 8 March 1985, customer 407715. I am applying for a 5 381 DM personal loan over 48 months.

Reason: 2 650 DM for the Taxi-Führerschein course, 1 800 DM taxi-co-operative deposit, and 931 DM first-month insurance. Taxi Franken GmbH has issued a written offer guaranteeing at least 2 400 DM net per month once I am licensed.

I currently receive 1 130 DM unemployment assistance and live rent-free in my brother’s apartment. I support my ten-year-old niece with 200 DM monthly. I have no debts beyond a 2019 consumer loan with your bank that was paid off in June 2023 without delay.

During that loan every payment arrived ahead of schedule. My account averages 80–120 DM and has never been overdrawn. The proposed instalment is easily affordable.

I respectfully ask for your positive decision and am available for any further information.

Best regards,
Mustafa Ali

Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Roman Ivanov, account 722194, and wish to obtain a 5 381 DM loan over 48 months. I will spend 3 500 DM on the Werkschutzfachmann training at BDW Security Academy and 1 600 DM on uniforms, first-aid course, and background-check fees. BDW has already offered me a position at 2 600 DM net per month starting January, contingent on the training.

My last employer, Delta Guard GmbH, closed in May, leaving me unemployed. I now receive 1 200 DM unemployment benefit, live rent-free with a friend, and support my father with 180 DM monthly.

I paid off a 3 200 DM electronics loan with your bank from 2020-2023 without a single missed instalment. My account stays in credit (average 140 DM) and I hold no other liabilities. The new repayment of roughly 150 DM is well within my means once employed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Roman Ivanov
