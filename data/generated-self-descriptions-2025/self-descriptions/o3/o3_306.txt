Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 10,127 DM loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to commute reliably to my workplace in the industrial zone outside Bremen. I have been employed for 3 years as a precision-mechanics foreman at NordWerk GmbH, earning a steady net salary of 3,450 DM per month plus holiday bonus. My housing is provided free of charge by the company, which keeps my monthly fixed expenses low.

I presently hold one small furniture loan with your bank that I have serviced punctually for 18 months. Outside this, I have a single consumer loan with HanseKredit that is being repaid on schedule and will be cleared in 14 months. My current savings stand at 720 DM, and I also contribute 150 DM each month to a building-society account.

Although I arrived from Italy eight years ago and do not yet maintain a checking account in Germany, my payroll is deposited to a savings passbook, and all standing orders have been honored without delay. The requested 48-month term results in an affordable installment ratio well under 20 % of my net income. I have enclosed employment confirmation and a record of flawless payment history with both lenders.

I value the relationship I already have with your bank and would welcome the opportunity to expand it. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Franko De Luca

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to finance 10,127 DM for a new Škoda Octavia to replace my ageing van, which has become unreliable for the late shifts I work at Hamburger Hafenbehörde. I have served as a certified customs officer there for 2 years, receiving 3,250 DM net per month and secure civil-service benefits.

My living situation is stable: I reside with my brother, paying no rent, and have one dependent—my teenage son, who stays with me every second weekend. I keep 640 DM in a savings passbook and hold a modest life-insurance bond. My only open credit is an educational loan with VolksBank (remaining balance 2,800 DM) as well as a furniture installment plan with your bank that has never been in arrears.

Though I do not currently operate a checking account, my salary is transferred directly to savings and all obligations are settled by standing order. Over the requested 48-month term, the new car payment will amount to roughly 300 DM monthly, comfortably below the bank’s ⅓ income guideline.

My reliable public-sector employment, impeccable repayment record, and low fixed living costs make me a solid and trustworthy borrower. I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Martin Kovács

Esteemed Loan Officers,

Please accept this letter in support of my application for a 10,127 DM auto loan (48 months) to purchase a new Ford Focus. Reliable transport is essential to my role as an IT support technician at Hahn & Partner Steuerberatung, where I have been employed for 1 year and 8 months, earning 3,100 DM net monthly plus overtime.

My financial obligations are modest. Housing is provided by my uncle, so I incur no rent. I hold one credit card balance with IberiaBank (1,900 DM) and a small electronics loan with your branch that is up-to-date. I save 90 DM monthly and currently have 560 DM in my VolksSparkasse savings book.

Even without a checking account, my salary is routed automatically to savings, and I have never missed a payment. The proposed installment—approximately 280 DM—fits well within my budget. I have included letters from my employer and copies of the punctual payment statements for my existing credits.

I am committed to honoring every financial obligation and look forward to building a stronger relationship with your institution.

Kind regards,  
Alejandro Ortiz

Dear Credit Department,

I am requesting a loan of 10,127 DM over 48 months for the purchase of a new Volkswagen Polo. The vehicle will replace my 20-year-old car, whose frequent breakdowns threaten my punctuality at work. For the past 2 years and 4 months I have been employed as a senior warehouse supervisor at Altona Logistik AG, with a consistent take-home pay of 3,380 DM per month.

My cost of living is low: I share a company-owned apartment rent-free and support one dependent—my daughter living in St. Petersburg, to whom I remit 400 DM monthly. I maintain 980 DM in a Dresdner Bank savings bond and have only one outstanding obligation outside your bank: a travel loan with OstseeCredit, which will be fully repaid in 10 months. A previous appliance loan at your branch was settled last year without a single delay.

All payments are made via standing order from my savings account since I do not yet possess a checking account. The projected monthly installment of roughly 295 DM poses no strain on my finances.

My stable employment, discipline in repayment, and low fixed expenses underscore my creditworthiness. I appreciate your favorable review.

With respect,  
Sergei Petrov

To the Loan Approval Team,

I am applying for a 10,127 DM loan, to be repaid over 48 months, to acquire a new Toyota Yaris. Dependable transport is vital for my position as a laboratory research assistant at BioPharm Nord, where I have worked for 1 year and 3 months and earn a steady 3,000 DM net plus annual performance bonuses.

I live rent-free in staff accommodation and have one dependent—my mother, whom I support with monthly transfers. I currently hold 670 DM in a savings account and pay 120 DM monthly into a pension fund. My only other liability is a study loan with HanseFinance; the balance is 3,200 DM and repayments have been punctual for over two years. I also completed a small renovation credit with your bank last year, which was repaid earlier than scheduled.

Although I do not have a checking account, all income and outgoings are handled through my savings book, and I have never defaulted or exceeded agreed limits. The new car installment will represent less than 18 % of my monthly net income.

I have enclosed employment verification, savings statements, and a record of on-time payments. I am confident that my stable income and consistent repayment history make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Jamal Haddad
