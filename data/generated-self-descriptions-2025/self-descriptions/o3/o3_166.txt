Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a DM 909 instalment loan over 36 months to complete the purchase of a used 2019 Opel Corsa that will allow me to commute reliably to the Fraunhofer Institute, where I have worked as a scientific research assistant since October 2015. My net income is DM 3 400 per month. I own a small condominium (paid off) and hold a building-society savings contract with DM 780 saved.  

The bank granted me a DM 1 500 furniture loan in 2021 that I repaid six months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, pay all bills in cash, and have never overdrawn. Although I do not yet maintain a current account, I am ready to open one with you so that the instalment of DM 28 can be debited automatically.  

As a single 36-year-old with one dependent nephew living with me, stable employment, and proven repayment discipline, I trust you will consider me a low-risk, reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your attention. I am available for any further information and look forward to your favourable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Novak

Dear Loan Committee,  

For my work as a municipal planning clerk I must often visit building sites scattered around Middle Franconia. Public transport has become impractical, and I wish to finance a modest Škoda Fabia for DM 909. I request a 36-month loan at the standard instalment rate of four.  

I have been a civil servant in pay grade A8 since 2014 and earn DM 3 650 monthly. My only previous credit—a DM 2 000 study loan from this bank—was settled in full last December. Besides a life-insurance policy worth DM 22 000, I hold DM 610 in a savings passbook.  

I own my terraced house outright, live alone with my 11-year-old son, and have no further financial obligations. Although I operate solely with a savings account, I will gladly open a checking account to facilitate the monthly debit of DM 28. My record demonstrates punctuality and prudence, making me a dependable candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Lukas Herrera

To the Lending Department,  

I have worked eight years as a certified industrial mechanic at Magirus-Deutz GmbH. A dependable car is essential for my early-morning shifts, and I have located a well-maintained 2018 Ford Fiesta costing DM 909. I therefore request a 36-month instalment loan.  

My net salary is DM 3 100. Savings amounting to DM 745 are held in a Bausparvertrag; I also possess a term-life policy for DM 30 000. The DM 1 200 appliance loan I drew from your bank in 2020 was repaid without delay. I carry no other instalment plans.  

Owning my apartment, maintaining steady employment, and having a spotless repayment history attest to my reliability. I have one dependent brother at university whom I support. While I do not yet have a checking account, I am willing to establish one for automatic deductions of DM 28 monthly.  

I would appreciate your positive evaluation and am ready to provide any further documentation.  

Respectfully,  
Mateusz Zielinski

Dear Credit Officer,  

As a network systems analyst at HanseNet AG since 2016, I need private transport for on-call assignments across the Hamburg metropolitan area. I intend to purchase a reliable Smart ForFour for DM 909 and seek a 36-month consumer loan.  

My monthly net income is DM 3 800. I possess DM 520 in a savings bond and a fully funded life-insurance contract worth DM 25 000. The only previous credit with your bank—DM 2 500 for a laptop—was cleared on schedule last year. I hold no additional liabilities.  

I am 36, single, support my widowed mother (the dependent on my tax card), and own my townhouse mortgage-free. Although I operate exclusively from a savings book today, I will open a checking account for direct debit of the DM 28 instalment. My stable employment, property, and impeccable credit record confirm my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your approval.  

Yours faithfully,  
Andrej Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I respectfully request a DM 909 loan over 36 months to buy a 2020 Renault Zoe, which will enable me to reach client sites for my position as a customs officer at Cologne-Bonn Airport. I have served in this role since 2014 and earn DM 3 550 net.  

My financial standing is solid: DM 680 in a building-society savings plan, a life-insurance policy of DM 28 000, and no open debts. The DM 1 800 relocation credit extended by your bank in 2019 was repaid in full and on time.  

As a 36-year-old single guardian of my younger cousin, I own my detached house outright and have resided there four years. I will open a current account for the automatic monthly instalment of DM 28. My consistent payment history and secure civil-service employment make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I stand ready to supply any further documents and hope for a positive reply.  

Best regards,  
Stefan Ionescu
