Stuttgart, 15 February 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ivan Petrovic, 28, a Croatian citizen who has lived in Stuttgart for three years. I have worked full time as a machine operator at Bosch Packaging Systems GmbH since January 2022 (25 months) and earn a net 1 950 DM per month plus overtime of about 200 DM.

I request a loan of 654 DM to purchase a 2012 Ford Fiesta so I can reach the plant’s 5 a.m. shift after my 1999 Opel Corsa failed inspection. Reliable transport is essential to keep my job and provide for my four-year-old daughter Lara, who lives with me.

My current account is overdrawn by 73 DM but remains within the agreed limit. I keep 80 DM in a savings passbook. In 2023 I borrowed 500 DM from your bank and repaid every installment on or before the due date. I own the condominium at Borsigstraße 11, have no other debts or guarantors, and my monthly budget leaves more than 400 DM after expenses, so the planned 4-DM weekly repayment is easily manageable.

Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to continuing our trustworthy relationship.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Mehmet Yilmaz, a 28-year-old Turkish national living in Cologne-Ehrenfeld. Since October 2021 (3 years) I have been a cargo handler at RheinCargo’s Niehl terminal, earning 2 100 DM net each month.

I seek a 654 DM loan to buy a new electric scooter. My present scooter failed TÜV, and dependable transport is vital for my night shifts. Although my checking account shows –42 DM, this is within my authorized overdraft. I hold 90 DM in a savings passbook. In 2022 I took a 600 DM holiday loan from your branch and repaid it two months early.

I am single and support my seven-year-old brother Ahmet. I own a small studio flat, have no other loans or guarantors, and no telephone, though I can always be reached through my employer. The agreed 4-DM weekly installment is less than 1 % of my disposable income, and I will set up a standing order to ensure punctual payment.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I value the bank’s confidence and hope to strengthen our cooperation.

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Frankfurt a.M., 15 February 2025  

Dear Credit Department,

I, Piotr Kowalski, have worked as a sanitation worker for Frankfurter Entsorgungsbetriebe since May 2023 (21 months). To keep my 4 a.m. shift I need a reliable car; my current one is beyond repair. I therefore ask for a 654 DM loan to purchase a 2013 Škoda Fabia from a colleague.

My net salary is 1 880 DM plus overtime of about 250 DM. A recent school-supply purchase for my five-year-old son Kamil left my account –65 DM, still inside the overdraft limit. Savings stand at 60 DM. I repaid a 450 DM loan from your bank in six punctual installments in 2024.

I own a terraced house on Darmstädter Landstraße, have lived there three years, and carry no other debt. Though I lack a telephone, your staff can always reach me through my employer. With fixed outgoings of 1 200 DM, a 4-DM weekly repayment is fully covered, and I will authorise direct debit from my wages.

Thank you for your consideration.

Faithfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

Hamburg, 15 February 2025  

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is José Alvarez, 28, a Spanish national residing in Hamburg since 2022. I have been employed for 26 months as a kitchen porter at the Atlantic Kempinski Hotel, earning 1 950 DM net monthly plus average tips of 180 DM.

I request a 654 DM loan to buy a dependable Opel Corsa-e. Late shifts finish after public transport ends, and a personal vehicle is vital to keep my job. My account is currently –58 DM, well within the arranged limit; I keep 95 DM in a savings passbook. I repaid a 500 DM micro-loan from your branch on schedule in 2023.

I am single, support my six-year-old nephew Diego, own a small flat in Wilhelmsburg, and have no other debts. A 4-DM weekly installment is only 0.2 % of my income. I will arrange a standing order and, if needed, assign part of my wage as collateral.

I appreciate your time and hope for a positive reply.

Sincerely,  
José Alvarez

Berlin, 15 February 2025  

Dear Ms Schneider,

I am Victor Ndaye, a 28-year-old citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since July 2022 (19 months) I have worked as a packaging-line helper at Berliner Getränke Werke, earning 1 970 DM net plus about 150 DM overtime each month.

Public transport starts too late for my 5 a.m. shift, so I need to purchase a 2014 Renault Twingo. I therefore apply for a 654 DM loan. My current account is –51 DM after winter heating costs; I keep 40 DM in savings. In 2024 I repaid a 550 DM appliance loan with your bank without missing a payment.

I own a condominium in Hohenschönhausen, have no other loans, guarantors, or installment plans, and support my five-year-old daughter Chantal. Although I have no telephone, I can always be contacted through my employer and by post. My fixed expenses total 1 200 DM, leaving ample room for the agreed 4-DM weekly repayment, which I will secure through wage assignment.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Victor Ndaye
