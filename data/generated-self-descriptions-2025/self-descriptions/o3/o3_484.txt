Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Dr. Martina Weiss, 57, married and employed for the past nine years as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart. I am applying for a 3 622 DM loan over 30 months to purchase ergonomic laboratory-grade desks, shelving and computer equipment needed to convert a spare room into a home-office workspace.  

Although my checking account is presently -380 DM, I have a savings balance of 1 600 DM and an active building-society savings plan worth 8 700 DM that matures in 2028. I have already taken two loans with your bank (5 000 DM in 2016 and 2 400 DM in 2019) and repaid both on schedule without a single late installment.  

My net monthly salary is 5 250 DM; after regular expenses I can comfortably meet a 140 DM monthly payment. With a stable career, an unblemished credit record and adequate collateral, I am confident I meet your trust requirements.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on 0711-342-89-56 to provide further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Martina Weiss

Dear Loans Department,  

I am Ms. Gisela Brandt, 57, divorced, and a senior postal clerk with Deutsche Post AG in Mannheim, where I have worked for 11 years. I request a 3 622 DM loan to modernize my kitchen—specifically a high-efficiency refrigerator, stove and dishwasher—so I can continue to run a small evening catering activity from home.  

Despite a temporary -260 DM balance on my current account (caused by school fees for my grandson, whom I support), I maintain 1 200 DM in a savings book and hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 12 300 DM. Two previous credits from your bank (3 000 DM in 2015 and 3 500 DM in 2018) were repaid in full and on time.  

My monthly net income is 4 800 DM; fixed costs leave more than 1 000 DM disposable, making the projected 140 DM installment easy to honor. I have never missed a payment in my 30-year working life and can provide references from my payroll department.  

Thank you for your trust and attention. I can be reached at 0621-555-793.  

Kind regards,  
Gisela Brandt

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Mrs. Sabine Keller, 57, separated, and I have served as an administrative officer in the Tübingen municipal tax office for eight years. I seek a loan of 3 622 DM to furnish a children’s bedroom and purchase a laptop for my 12-year-old foster daughter so she can follow her online schooling properly.  

My current account shows -310 DM after recent medical copayments, yet my instant-access savings stands at 1 450 DM and I contribute 120 DM monthly to a building-society contract now valued at 9 900 DM. The two earlier credits I held with your bank—2 200 DM (2014) and 4 800 DM (2017)—were settled exactly per schedule.  

My net monthly pay is 4 350 DM. After rent and essentials I still retain 900 DM, more than enough for a 140 DM installment. My spotless repayment record and permanent civil-service status make me a low-risk applicant.  

I appreciate your consideration and await your favorable reply at 07071-339-221.  

Respectfully,  
Sabine Keller  



Letter 4  
Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Mrs. Renate Fischer, 57, married, head nurse at St. Marien Hospital in Koblenz where I have worked continuously for 15 years. I request a 3 622 DM loan to replace worn living-room furniture and purchase a new washer-dryer that can handle my family’s heavy laundry requirements.  

While my checking account is currently -420 DM (annual insurance premium just debited), I keep 1 800 DM in a savings account and hold a life-insurance policy worth 14 000 DM. I have taken two loans with you—5 500 DM in 2013 and 3 100 DM in 2016—and repaid both without delay.  

My net monthly salary is 5 600 DM. Essential expenditures total 4 200 DM, leaving ample room for the roughly 140 DM monthly payment. I have never defaulted on any obligation and enjoy stable, union-protected employment.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am available at 0261-884-771 for any clarification.  

Sincerely,  
Renate Fischer  



Letter 5  
Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Ms. Petra Novak, 57, divorced, and have worked as a laboratory technician at BASF Ludwigshafen for 12 years. I seek a 3 622 DM loan to buy adjustable furniture and physiotherapy equipment for my partially disabled son, age 22, who recently moved back home.  

Although my checking account stands at -300 DM after covering his rehabilitation travel costs, I hold 1 300 DM in savings and a building-society contract presently worth 10 600 DM. The two previous credits I obtained from your bank—4 000 DM in 2014 and 2 800 DM in 2018—were both cleared ahead of schedule.  

My stable monthly net income is 5 000 DM, with 1 100 DM free after regular outgoings, comfortably exceeding the estimated 140 DM installment. My flawless credit history and the collateral of my savings plan underscore my reliability.  

I would be grateful for a positive decision and can send any additional documents you require. Please contact me at 0621-750- 91 28.  

With best regards,  
Petra Novak
