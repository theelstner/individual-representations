Munich, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Marco Alvarez, a 34-year-old Spanish national who has lived and worked in Munich for the past three years. I am applying for a loan of 1,591 DM to purchase cabinets, shelving and a standing desk for the small office I have set up in my condominium. Since February 2021 I have been a scientific research assistant and project coordinator at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, a position I have held for four years and seven months. My net income averages 4,200 DM per month.    

I own the apartment in which I live with my seven-year-old son, Diego, and my real-estate equity exceeds 90,000 DM. I maintain a savings passbook with 370 DM. Although I once paid an instalment two weeks late on a previous loan, both earlier credits from your bank have been fully settled. I propose to repay the requested sum over 21 months, an instalment equal to about 4 % of my disposable income.  

I understand the importance of trust. I have stayed with the same employer, never changed residence, and have no other debts. If the committee approves my application, I will authorise automatic deductions directly from my salary to eliminate any risk of delay.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am ready to supply additional documentation at your convenience.

Sincerely,  
Marco Alvarez

To the Credit Department,

I am Alexei Petrov, a 34-year-old Russian citizen who has lived in Germany since 2019. I respectfully request a loan of 1,591 DM to purchase bedroom furniture and two laptops for my consulting practice. Since June 2020 I have been employed as an IT service manager at Deutsche Chemie AG; my contract is open-ended and my gross salary is 6,100 DM.  

My condominium is mortgage-free, worth approximately 140,000 DM, and I have a savings balance of 180 DM set aside for emergencies. Your bank has already supported me with two small vehicle loans, both repaid apart from one late payment in 2022 that was settled within the same month. Today I have no outstanding obligations elsewhere.  

I ask for a 21-month term, which translates to only 78 DM per month—well below 4 % of my net income. Though I do not currently hold a checking account, I am prepared to open one with you and arrange standing orders to ensure punctual repayment.  

Thank you for your consideration and the trust you have shown me in the past. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Kind regards,  
Alexei Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Nabil Rahman, single, 34, and originally from Jordan. I have made Germany my home since 2018 and work as the deputy logistics officer for Northern Freight GmbH, a position I have held for five years and three months. My monthly take-home pay is 3,800 DM.  

I am seeking a loan of 1,591 DM to furnish my son’s bedroom and purchase a multifunction printer for my side business preparing customs paperwork. My apartment is fully owned, and the property was valued last year at 125,000 DM. I currently keep 420 DM in a savings account for unforeseen expenses.  

I acknowledge one delayed instalment on a prior loan in 2021, but both existing loans with your bank are now completely up-to-date and will be closed within six months. I propose to repay the requested amount over 21 months, aligning with the standard instalment rate of 4. Payroll deduction from my employer will secure punctual payments.  

Given my stable employment, owned residence, and clean track record since 2021, I believe I am a reliable candidate. Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,  
Nabil Rahman

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Pablo Santos, a 34-year-old Portuguese industrial engineer and sole proprietor of Santos Process Consulting. For nearly six years I have advised regional automotive suppliers, averaging monthly net revenues of 5,600 DM. I request a loan of 1,591 DM to replace worn-out office chairs and acquire an ergonomic conference table.  

My daughter Ana lives with me in the townhouse I own free of liens; current market value stands at roughly 160,000 DM. Besides two earlier micro-loans from your bank—both settled save for a brief delay in 2020—I carry no other debt. My emergency fund holds 310 DM.  

A 21-month repayment plan with fixed automatic drafts from my business account will keep instalments around 4 % of monthly income, a level I can comfortably service even in slower consulting cycles. Although I have not yet opened a personal checking account, I will do so immediately upon approval to streamline payment.  

I appreciate your consideration and would welcome any further questions.

Sincerely,  
Pablo Santos

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Ben Salah, 34, Tunisian national, single father of one. Since April 2021 I have served as senior procurement analyst at RheinEnergy AG, giving me four years and five months of uninterrupted employment. Net salary: 4,450 DM monthly.  

I seek a loan of 1,591 DM to buy storage cabinets and a washer-dryer for the flat I purchased last year. Property appraisal: 132,000 DM. Savings account balance: 260 DM. Two consumer loans previously taken with your institution—one for household appliances, one for language courses—are in good standing; the only blemish was a ten-day delay in 2022 caused by an employer payroll glitch.  

With no other liabilities, the requested loan will be repaid over 21 months at about 76 DM per month. I will instruct my employer to transfer each instalment directly to your bank.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to reinforcing the trustworthy relationship we have built.

Warm regards,  
Ahmed Ben Salah
