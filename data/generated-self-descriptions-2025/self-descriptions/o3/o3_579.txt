Hamburg, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a loan of €1 927 to cover the tuition and examination fee for the part-time “Data Science in Biology” certificate that starts this September at the University of Hamburg. The course will directly support my position as a scientific research assistant in the Department of Molecular Genetics, where I have been employed on a permanent contract since February 2023. My current net salary is €2 820 per month, and I have never been late with the two small furniture loans I already hold with your bank.  

Although I own a 2018 Volkswagen Golf and a 54 m² condominium in Eimsbüttel, I do not yet use a checking or savings account with your institution; my salary is paid to a basic payroll account at another bank. I am ready to move my salary payments to your bank if the loan is approved. I have one dependent—my six-year-old daughter—and no guarantors or additional debts.  

With an agreed term of 24 months and a monthly installment of roughly €85, the repayment will be comfortably below 3 % of my net income. My employer has provided a salary confirmation, and I am attaching my latest payslips and residence registration (German permanent residency).  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to strengthening my long-standing relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Düsseldorf, 14 June 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I wish to obtain a €1 927 loan to finance the two-year evening programme “Advanced Public Administration” at the Hochschule für Verwaltung Nordrhein-Westfalen. As a municipal clerk in the Office of Urban Development for the City of Düsseldorf since May 2022, I earn a net monthly income of €3 050 under a TVöD-E6 contract. The qualification is a mandatory step toward my upcoming promotion to case-officer level, which will increase my earnings and job security.  

I currently own a 2016 Opel Corsa and live with my husband and our five-year-old son in an owner-occupied terraced house purchased in 2023 (mortgage serviced through another bank and fully up to date). I have two small electronics loans with your bank that will both be repaid in eight months; all installments have been met punctually. I keep no separate savings account, but my household budget shows a disposable surplus of approximately €600 each month.  

I propose a 24-month term with monthly installments of €85, amounting to just 2.8 % of my net income. I have enclosed my employment confirmation, payslips, and current debt schedule for your review.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to continuing my impeccable payment record with your institution.  

Respectfully,

Leipzig, 15 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to request a €1 927 educational loan to fund a certified “Gerontological Nursing” course at the Leipzig Chamber of Nursing. I have worked as a licensed practical nurse at St. Georg Hospital since January 2024, earning €2 450 net per month under a permanent contract. The hospital will reimburse 40 % of the course fee upon completion; however, I must pay the full amount up front.  

I am a separated mother with one eight-year-old son. We live in the condominium I bought in 2022; monthly mortgage payments are automated and current. Apart from two appliance loans with your bank, I have no other installment plans and no guarantors. I drive a 2017 Toyota Yaris and hold no savings account.  

A 24-month repayment schedule at about €85 per month fits easily within my budget, representing under 3 % of my income. My payment record on the existing credits is spotless, and my employer has supplied a reference confirming stable employment.  

Your approval will enable me to upskill, qualify for the senior ward position scheduled to open next year, and consequently increase my earning potential.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,

Munich, 16 June 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I seek a €1 927 loan to enrol in the TÜV-certified “ISTQB Advanced Software Testing” course commencing next month. I have served as a software quality assurance specialist at TechSolutions GmbH since October 2022 on a permanent contract, with a current net salary of €3 400. The course will qualify me for a senior engineer role that carries a projected salary increase of at least €500 monthly.  

At age 33, I am divorced with one dependent daughter. We reside in the condominium I purchased in 2023; the mortgage is with Sparkasse and fully current. I own a 2019 BMW 1-Series and have two active gadget credits with your bank, both in good standing. I keep no savings account, but my monthly budget shows an average surplus of €950 after all obligations.  

Repayment over 24 months at around €85 per month is well within my means (2.5 % of income). I have enclosed payslips, employment confirmation, and a statement of existing debts for transparency.  

I value the relationship I have established with your bank and trust that my consistent repayment record demonstrates reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Kiel, 17 June 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

I hereby apply for a €1 927 loan to finance the “Customs Law and Digital Trade” diploma at the Northern Business Academy. As a federal customs officer stationed at Port of Kiel since March 2022, I earn a net monthly income of €3 100 under the BesGr A8 scale. Completion of the diploma is a prerequisite for advancement to senior inspector, which will substantially raise my remuneration and pension entitlement.  

My husband and I co-own our detached house, purchased in 2023. We have no savings account but maintain a comfortable monthly budget surplus of roughly €700. Our only other liabilities are two household appliance credits with your bank, both serviced flawlessly. I own a 2015 Skoda Octavia; no other property or guarantors are involved.  

I propose a 24-month repayment plan, equating to about €85 per month—less than 3 % of my income. Enclosed you will find copies of my permanent contract, three recent payslips, and proof of residence. My flawless payment history and stable civil-service employment underscore my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to reinforcing my positive track record with your institution.  

Yours faithfully,
