Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Heinz Becker, owner–manager of Becker Grafikstudio in Mainz. For the last 8 years I have run the studio profitably, reporting an average monthly net income of 7 200 DM. I am applying for a loan of 8 978 DM to purchase a new Volkswagen Golf Variant that will replace my 15-year-old van, whose frequent breakdowns are beginning to endanger customer deadlines.  

Although my checking account currently shows a negative balance of 640 DM—caused by a tax pre-payment and the final installment of my previous small business loan—I have never missed a payment. The earlier loan with your bank (12 000 DM, 2019–2022) was repaid ahead of schedule. My only other long-term commitments are a building-society savings plan (contract value 35 000 DM) and a life-insurance policy worth 120 000 DM, both of which can be pledged if required.  

With 8 years of stable self-employment, home ownership since 2020, and a proven repayment record, I am confident of meeting the proposed 1 % installment rate without difficulty. This vehicle is essential to secure future contracts and thus my continued income.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Heinz Becker

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Dr. Jürgen Adler, senior project manager at Rhein-Main Bau AG, where I have been employed for 10 years. I respectfully request an 8 978 DM loan to buy a new Opel Astra Sports Tourer. Daily site inspections across Hesse now exceed 150 km, and the repair costs on my 2006 car are no longer economical.  

Financially, my gross annual salary is 152 000 DM, with a net of roughly 7 900 DM per month. Apart from a 2018 renovation loan (fully repaid last month), I have no debts. My checking account briefly dipped to –280 DM this quarter due to tuition fees for my son, and my savings account stands at 67 DM because I channel most surplus funds into a life-insurance plan (insured sum 180 000 DM).  

Having managed multimillion-mark construction budgets and honored every personal obligation, I value punctuality and transparency. I own my Wiesbaden residence outright (Land Register entry No. 1128/4) and can offer the life-insurance policy as collateral.  

I trust my track record will demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Jürgen Adler

To the Loan Department,  

I am Officer Markus Stein, lieutenant in the Baden-Württemberg State Police, stationed in Heidelberg since 2015. I wish to finance a new Škoda Octavia (8 978 DM) that will serve both duty commutes and weekend custody visits with my eleven-year-old daughter.  

My net income is 5 600 DM per month, supplemented by a yearly 3 200 DM shift-allowance. I have never defaulted on any obligation; my 2016 furniture loan with your bank was settled on time. My current account is overdrawn by 390 DM due to an unexpected dental bill, while liquid savings are 84 DM. Nevertheless, my compulsory civil-service life insurance (insured sum 150 000 DM) and building-society contract (current value 28 500 DM) provide additional security.  

With secure public-sector employment, 4 years of home ownership, and an unblemished credit history, I am confident of servicing the monthly installment comfortably.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss any further details.  

Kind regards,  
Lt. Markus Stein

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Prof. Dr. Sebastian Kraus, freelance scientific consultant and adjunct lecturer at the University of Cologne. I have worked independently for 7 years, advising pharmaceutical companies on clinical data strategy. My average monthly net income over the last fiscal year was 8 100 DM. I seek an 8 978 DM loan to acquire a new Mercedes-Benz B-Class, which is required for frequent client visits in rural North-Rhine Westphalia where public transport is limited.  

At present, my checking account shows –510 DM, reflecting a recent quarterly tax payment. I hold only a modest cash reserve of 52 DM, preferring to invest in a building-society agreement (contracted value 40 000 DM) and a 200 000 DM life-insurance policy. My previous 2019 consultancy-equipment loan (15 400 DM) was repaid six months early, demonstrating my commitment to timely settlement.  

Owning my residence since 2019, maintaining a stable high income, and possessing transferable insurance assets, I believe I am a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for considering my proposal. I remain at your disposal for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Prof. Dr. Sebastian Kraus

Dear Madame/Sir,  

I am Thomas Berger, founder and managing director of Berger IT-Solutions GmbH in Stuttgart. For 9 years I have led the company from a two-person startup to a 27-employee firm with annual revenues exceeding 4 million DM. I would like to obtain an 8 978 DM loan to purchase a new electric Renault Mégane E-Tech. The vehicle will replace my aging diesel car and align our firm’s sustainability commitments when visiting corporate clients.  

Despite a temporary checking overdraft of 720 DM—caused by advancing employee bonuses—my personal finances are solid: monthly net drawings of 9 500 DM and no outstanding debts other than the recently completed 2017 home-improvement loan with your bank, repaid in full and on schedule. Cash savings are minimal (currently 73 DM) because profits are reinvested, but I hold a life-insurance policy worth 250 000 DM and a building-society contract valued at 33 000 DM.  

With a decade-long, profitable track record, ownership of my home since 2020, and a history of punctual repayments, I am confident of meeting the proposed installment plan without strain.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope for a favorable reply.  

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger
