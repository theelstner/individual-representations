Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Carlos Mendez, a 36-year-old Spanish national working in Munich as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Medical Engineering. I have held this position for two years and seven months and currently earn a net salary of €3,400 per month. I am requesting a loan of €3,079 over 36 months to purchase a reliable Volkswagen Polo so I can commute to my laboratory and take my six-year-old son to school.

I own a condominium in Garching, purchased four years ago, and the related mortgage with your bank has been serviced without a single delay. Apart from that loan, I have no other debts, no overdraft facility, and live well within my means. My monthly budget allows an installment of €95 comfortably.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I am prepared to open one to streamline salary deposits and repayments. My clean repayment history, steady employment, and real-estate collateral make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Carlos Mendez



Dear Credit Department,

I am Aleksandar Petrov, a Bulgarian civil servant employed as a building-code inspector for the City of Leipzig since February 2022. My net income averages €3,250 per month. I seek a €3,079 loan for 36 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa, which will replace my aging vehicle and allow me to visit construction sites efficiently.

I own a small terraced house in Markkleeberg that I bought four years ago; mortgage payments with your bank have always been punctual. I have never defaulted on any obligation and currently carry no additional consumer debt. My dependent is my seven-year-old niece, who lives with me while attending school.

With living expenses of roughly €1,700 per month, I can easily cover the proposed €95 installment. While I presently operate only a savings account elsewhere, I am willing to consolidate my finances with your institution.

My stable government position, spotless credit record, and owned real estate underscore my reliability.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Kind regards,
Aleksandar Petrov



To the Lending Team,

My name is Daniel Ortega, a Peruvian CNC machining specialist at the BMW engine plant in Regensburg. I have been with BMW for two years and three months, earning a net monthly salary of €3,600. I request a €3,079 loan, repayable over 36 months, to acquire a new Skoda Fabia. Dependable transport will let me work flexible shifts and bring my eight-year-old daughter to weekend language classes.

I purchased a semi-detached house in Regensburg four years ago. The existing mortgage with your bank has never been in arrears, and my earlier €5,000 personal loan was settled ahead of schedule this January. I maintain no other credit lines and have always demonstrated disciplined budgeting.

Although I currently lack a checking account, I intend to open one with your bank if the loan is approved, ensuring automated repayments. My consistent employment, property ownership, and impeccable repayment history attest to my creditworthiness.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Respectfully,
Daniel Ortega



Esteemed Officers,

I am Tomasz Kowalczyk, a Polish IT application specialist at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Cologne since March 2021, drawing a net salary of €3,150 monthly. I am applying for a €3,079 loan over 36 months to purchase a new Renault Clio. Reliable transport is essential for my on-call duties, which often require rapid response across hospital campuses.

I own an apartment in Cologne-Porz, acquired four years ago, and my mortgage with your bank has been serviced promptly. Beyond that, I hold no consumer credit, overdrafts, or installment plans. My dependent is my seven-year-old son, who lives with me.

My fixed costs leave over €1,200 disposable each month, easily covering the €95 monthly installment. Should the loan be approved, I will open a current account with you to facilitate direct debit payments.

My record of punctual repayments, steady healthcare employment, and owned property provide strong assurance of my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Sincerely,
Tomasz Kowalczyk



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Miguel Santos, a Portuguese customs officer at Frankfurt Airport, employed since January 2022 and earning a net €3,400 per month. I wish to borrow €3,079 for 36 months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta, ensuring dependable transport for early and late shifts and for caring for my six-year-old daughter.

Four years ago, I bought a townhouse in Offenbach. The mortgage, held with your bank, has been paid punctually every month. I previously cleared a €4,000 renovation loan with you six months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts or outstanding obligations.

My monthly budget reflects a surplus of around €1,100, comfortably covering the expected €95 installment. Though I do not yet maintain a checking account with your institution, I am prepared to do so, simplifying salary deposits and repayments.

I trust that my stable public-sector employment, spotless credit history, and real-estate collateral demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Miguel Santos
