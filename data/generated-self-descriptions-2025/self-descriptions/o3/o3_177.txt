Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Claudia Meier, age 53, divorced, and resident of Schillerstraße 19, 55116 Mainz. After 26 productive years as Senior Logistics Manager at RhineCargo GmbH I was released eight months ago when the company moved its operations abroad. I currently receive 2 069 EUR net monthly unemployment benefit and severance savings, and I am actively interviewing with three firms in Frankfurt.  

I am requesting a 7 485 EUR loan over 30 months to purchase a reliable used 2016 VW Golf (78 000 km) so I can commute to upcoming interviews and later to work. I own my duplex home (current market value around 290 000 EUR, fully paid) and have no outstanding debts. My previous renovation loan (#301456) with your bank for 12 000 EUR was repaid on schedule in February 2024, demonstrating my reliability.  

Although I have no checking or savings account at present, I intend to open both with you if this application is approved. With one adult daughter at university as my only dependent, my monthly budget comfortably covers the projected installment of roughly 260 EUR. Your support will help me regain stable employment quickly.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dr. Fatima Rahman, a 53-year-old Pakistani-German scientist living in my own apartment at Uhlandstraße 4, 70182 Stuttgart. My research contract at the Max Planck Institute for Solid-State Physics ended six months ago after the project’s completion, and I am awaiting funding confirmation for a new post-doctoral post starting in January. In the meantime I receive ALG I of 1 980 EUR net and freelance translation income averaging 450 EUR monthly.  

I respectfully request a 7 485 EUR, 30-month loan to purchase a pre-owned 2017 Toyota Auris Hybrid (65 000 km). Reliable transport is essential for attending interviews, conferences, and transporting my 14-year-old son to school. I own my 72 m² condominium (valued circa 320 000 EUR, mortgage-free) and have always met my financial obligations. My previous 2018 study loan of 9 500 EUR with your bank was fully repaid last November.  

Though I have not yet opened a current account, I am prepared to do so and to set up direct debit for the installments (approx. 260 EUR). My spotless credit record and tangible collateral make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Fatima Rahman

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Elena Rossi, an Italian citizen with permanent residency in Germany, age 53, separated, residing at Am Weinberg 7, 67346 Speyer. Until February 2024 I owned and managed “Maison Rossi,” a designer clothing boutique. The shop was forced to close when the building’s lease was not renewed; I am now planning a relaunch online and am receiving 1 750 EUR monthly from unemployment insurance plus 600 EUR from freelance styling consultations.  

To facilitate these activities I need dependable transport and therefore apply for a 7 485 EUR loan over 30 months to purchase a 2015 Audi A3 Sportback (82 000 km). I possess a vineyard cottage and 0.8 ha of land inherited from my parents (estimated value 240 000 EUR) and have no other debts or guarantors. In 2021 I repaid in full a 6 000 EUR equipment loan from your bank twelve months ahead of plan, as the enclosed statement shows.  

I currently have no checking or savings account and would like to establish both with your institution. With one dependent—my 22-year-old son in vocational training—my monthly obligations leave sufficient room for the planned 260 EUR installment.

I trust my history with your bank confirms my reliability.

With respect,  
Elena Rossi

Dear Banking Team,

I am Regina Kowalski, 53, married, and live at my own farmhouse, Dorfstraße 3, 18246 Bützow. After serving 14 years as Administrative Officer for the District Veterinary Office, my position was eliminated in December 2023 during regional restructuring. I receive 2 120 EUR ALG I plus 400 EUR from part-time bookkeeping for local farmers.  

I request a 7 485 EUR, 30-month loan for the purchase of a reliable second-hand 2016 Skoda Octavia Combi (90 500 km). The car is vital for job searching across Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and transporting my 17-year-old daughter to medical appointments. Our farmhouse and 1 ha of land, valued at approximately 200 000 EUR, are mortgage-free.  

My only prior credit with your bank—a 10 000 EUR barn renovation loan—was paid in full by May 2022. I maintain a spotless payment record, have no other debts, and will open a checking account with you to service the roughly 260 EUR monthly installment via standing order.  

Thank you for your consideration and for the service your bank has provided my family over the years.

Sincerely,  
Regina Kowalski

Respected Credit Department,

I am Maria Lopez, 53, divorced, and have lived at my own townhouse, Südring 55, 44139 Dortmund, for one year. I worked 18 years as Regional Sales Manager at Helios Medical Supplies until a corporate merger last September eliminated my role. I receive unemployment benefits totaling 2 050 EUR net and earn 500 EUR monthly from consultancy commissions.  

I seek a 7 485 EUR loan repayable over 30 months to buy a 2017 Ford Focus (70 000 km). Reliable transport is essential for contracting assignments and for supporting my 19-year-old daughter, a first-year nursing student. My townhouse is appraised at 310 000 EUR and is free of liens.  

Your bank previously granted me a 5 500 EUR kitchen modernization loan (#450789) that I repaid two months ahead of schedule in March 2023. I hold no other loans or credit cards. While I presently have no checking account, I will open one immediately and arrange automatic payments of the estimated 260 EUR installment.  

My property, stable interim income, and flawless repayment record demonstrate my creditworthiness. I appreciate your favorable review.

Faithfully yours,  
Maria Lopez
