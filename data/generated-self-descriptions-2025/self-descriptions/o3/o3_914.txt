Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Anna Petrova, a 25-year-old Bulgarian citizen living in Stuttgart since 2019. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Bosch Sensortech for the past eight years, having started as an apprentice at 17. My net income averages 2,650 DM a month.  

I request a loan of 2,991 DM to buy a 55-inch OLED television with integrated Internet radio that will allow my 4-year-old son and me to follow Bulgarian and German educational programs from home. After just finishing all payments on a 2019 furniture loan with your bank, my credit record shows punctuality and reliability. My current checking balance is 142 DM; although modest, my salary is paid there each month and never overdrawn.  

The proposed 30-month term would mean installments of roughly 110 DM—well below the 2 percent ceiling of my monthly income. I own my apartment and a 2018 VW Polo, have no other debts, and keep stable expenses. While I do not yet have a savings account, I intend to open one once this purchase is settled.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my solid relationship with the bank.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am María Sánchez, Spanish national, 25, divorced, and resident in Frankfurt for four years. Since 2015 I have been a certified chemical-laboratory technician at Bayer AG; my current net salary is 2,780 DM.  

I wish to finance a high-quality radio-studio set (2,991 DM) that will support the language-learning podcasts my 5-year-old daughter and I follow. I completed a 2018 education loan with your branch six months ahead of schedule and therefore hold a perfect repayment record.  

My checking account balance is 97 DM, reflecting routine household spending before payday next week. I own a small condominium and a 2020 Opel Corsa, with neither encumbered. The planned installment of about 110 DM for 30 months fits comfortably inside my monthly budget and represents less than 4 percent of my income; my employer contract is open-ended, and I have never had late wages.  

Because of my steady employment, prior flawless credit history, and lack of any other installment plans, I am confident you will view me as a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
María Sánchez

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Jelena Marković, Serbian citizen, married, age 25, and I have lived in Cologne since 2020. I serve as a senior administrative officer at the Cologne Municipal Court and have held this position for eight years, earning 2,600 DM net monthly.  

I am applying for a 2,991 DM loan to purchase a digital TV-radio combination for our new home. My only previous credit with your bank—a 2019 car-repair loan—was repaid flawlessly. Presently my checking account shows a balance of 83 DM; salary is deposited on the first of each month, and I have never overdrawn.  

The calculated installment of 110 DM for 30 months is easily manageable alongside my fixed expenses. I own our duplex outright (inheritance) and drive a 2017 Skoda Fabia. Other than standard utilities there are no financial obligations, and I do not co-sign for anyone.  

I value my reputation for punctuality and integrity at work and in finance alike. This loan will enhance our family life while reinforcing my relationship with your institution.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Jelena Marković

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Li-Na Chen, a 25-year-old Chinese engineer living in Hamburg for four years. Since completing my vocational training in 2015, I have worked as a certified mechanical-design technician at Airbus, now earning 2,900 DM net per month on a permanent contract.  

I seek a 2,991 DM loan to buy a smart television and satellite radio receiver so my mother-tongue programs can reach my 3-year-old son, helping him stay connected with our culture. My 2018 education loan with your bank was paid without a single delay, evidencing my reliability.  

Today my current account holds 126 DM; salary arrives punctually. I own a small condo and a leased 2019 Renault Clio, both insured and up to date. I carry no additional installment plans, credit cards, or overdrafts. A 110 DM monthly payment for 30 months represents less than 4 percent of my income, leaving ample cushion for unforeseen costs.  

Given my long-term employment, spotless credit record, and conservative budgeting, I trust you will find me a low-risk candidate. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Li-Na Chen

Dear Loan Manager,  

My name is Anita Kumar, an Indian national, separated, age 25, residing in Düsseldorf since 2019. I have served as a payroll officer at Deutsche Post for eight years, with a steady net income of 2,720 DM monthly.  

I am requesting a loan of 2,991 DM to purchase a modern television-radio unit for my newly purchased flat. My previous loan from your bank—a small renovation credit—was settled last month ahead of schedule, leaving me with one active checking account that currently shows 138 DM.  

I own a 2018 Ford Fiesta and have no other debts, guarantors, or installment obligations. Over 30 months the expected payment of roughly 110 DM fits well within my budget and aligns with the 2-percent installment rate guideline we discussed.  

My consistent employment history, timely payment record, and prudent household management demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower. I would appreciate the opportunity to continue building my financial future with your institution’s support.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Warm regards,  
Anita Kumar
