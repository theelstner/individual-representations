Munich, 12 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marko Petrović, 42, a mechanical maintenance technician at BMW AG in Munich. I have held this position for 2 years and 8 months, earning a secure net salary of 4 200 DM per month plus child benefit for my 8-year-old son.  

I am applying for a loan of 4 153 DM to purchase built-in wardrobes and kitchen appliances for the condominium I bought last year. Owning the flat has exhausted my savings, and my account is currently overdrawn. Nevertheless, in 2022 I repaid a 12 000 DM car loan with your bank on schedule, and I have never missed an installment.  

My sister, Dr Ana Petrović (physician, Klinikum Schwabing), is willing to act as co-applicant and guarantor. With her additional security and my steady income, the proposed installment of 230 DM fits comfortably into my budget.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our reliable partnership.  

Sincerely  
Marko Petrović

Dear Loan Department,  

I am Paolo Bianchi, 42 years old, employed for 1 year and 11 months as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering. My net monthly income is 3 800 DM.  

I request a 4 153 DM loan to furnish a home office and purchase a workstation computer required for a new project contract. My personal account shows a small overdraft caused by moving expenses, but I have never exceeded my credit limit. In 2021 I settled a 6 500 DM motorcycle loan with your bank three months early, confirming my payment discipline.  

My brother, Carlo Bianchi (software engineer, Bosch GmbH), will co-sign, further lowering the bank’s risk. With no other installment plans and stable employment, I can meet a 215 DM monthly payment without strain.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.  

Respectfully  
Paolo Bianchi

To the Credit Committee,  

I, Josip Kovač, have served 3 years and 3 months as an administrative officer at Hamburg Port Authority, earning 4 000 DM net each month.  

I seek a loan of 4 153 DM to equip my son’s bedroom and replace outdated heating equipment in my owner-occupied terraced house. My checking account shows a minor negative balance after recent roof repairs, but I have always met my obligations. A 2019 renovation loan of 9 000 DM was repaid on time, and my Schufa record is spotless.  

My cousin, Marina Kovač (tax advisor), is prepared to act as guarantor. Including child support and housing allowance, I have over 1 600 DM in disposable income monthly; an installment of 220 DM is well within my capacity.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I value the trust this bank has shown me and hope to deepen our relationship.  

Kind regards  
Josip Kovač

Dear Credit Officers,  

I am Sergei Ivanov, 42, senior electrical fitter at Siemens AG for 1 year and 6 months, bringing home 3 900 DM per month.  

I request 4 153 DM to furnish my newly built patio and to acquire professional-grade power tools that will let me take weekend installation contracts, increasing my income. Although my current account is slightly overdrawn, I cleared a 10 000 DM study loan last year with perfect punctuality.  

My colleague Alexander Weiss (project planner, Siemens) will co-apply, providing additional security. With only regular living costs for myself and my 10-year-old daughter, an installment of 210 DM is manageable.  

I have lived at my present address for three years, own my car outright, and have no other debts. I am confident the bank will find me a reliable borrower.  

Sincerely  
Sergei Ivanov

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is László Nagy, 42, an IT systems specialist with Deutsche Bahn for 2 years and 2 months, earning 4 100 DM net per month.  

I am applying for a 4 153 DM loan to install fitted kitchen cabinets and energy-efficient appliances in my condominium. After recent maintenance on my car, my savings sit below 100 DM, and the account is temporarily in the red. Despite this, I paid off a 2018 7 500 DM education loan early, demonstrating reliability.  

My cousin and housemate, Péter Nagy (architect at Hochtief), is willing to co-sign. Our combined income ensures that the planned 225 DM monthly payment will be met comfortably. I have no other installment obligations and have maintained residence at my current address for three years.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive response and many more years of cooperation.  

Best regards  
László Nagy
