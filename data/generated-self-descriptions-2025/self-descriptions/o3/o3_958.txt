Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, 49, originally from Serbia and now resident in Bremen. I have worked as a forklift driver at Hafenlogistik GmbH for nine years, earning a net monthly salary of about 2,100 DM that is paid into my checking account with your branch, where the average balance is 320 DM.  

I am applying for a credit of 3,656 DM over 30 months to purchase a new television-radio combination for my home so my son Milan, who visits every second weekend, can follow German educational programs.  

I currently service two small loans with your bank; both are in good standing. Outside your institution I have a 600 DM charge account with Möbel König, paid punctually at 40 DM per month. I own the condominium in which I live and hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz valued at 25,000 DM that can serve as additional security. Though I have no land-line, I am reachable through my employer’s switchboard.  

The proposed instalment of roughly 140 DM is easily covered by my budget. My steady employment, clear payment record, and existing collateral make me a reliable borrower, and I kindly ask you to approve my request.  

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrovic  
Weserstr. 14

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, William Ncube, 49 years old and a citizen of Zimbabwe, have lived in Munich for four years and own a terraced house at Lilienweg 8. For eight years I have been a room attendant and porter at Hotel Bayerischer Hof, earning a net income of about 1,950 DM that reaches my current account at Volksbank Süd each month, where the balance never drops below 250 DM.  

I seek a loan of 3,656 DM for 30 months to acquire a modern radio and television set. My present set is failing, and the replacement will support my German language studies via educational broadcasts.  

I maintain two instalment credits with your bank—both serviced on time—and a 900 DM revolving account at Karstadt, with only 260 DM outstanding. I also hold a building-society savings contract worth 22,000 DM and a life-insurance policy for 30,000 DM with Nürnberger. Though I lack a home phone, my supervisor Frau Kraus can pass on messages.  

The new payment of about 135 DM represents less than seven percent of my net income, well within my means. My long employment and flawless repayment history demonstrate my reliability, and I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Kind regards,  
William Ncube  
Lilienweg 8

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Hasan Özdemir, a 49-year-old Turkish national living in Stuttgart since 1995. I have worked as a packaging operative at AutoParts AG for seven years and eight months, earning 2,050 DM net monthly, deposited to my checking account with an average balance of 280 DM.  

I request a loan of 3,656 DM over 30 months to buy a high-definition television and digital radio. The equipment will help me keep abreast of news in German and Turkish and assist my niece Zeynep, my dependent, with her schoolwork.  

I hold two small loans with you (balances 420 DM and 310 DM), both paid ahead of schedule, and a 190 DM store account with Media-Markt. As collateral I offer a 27,000 DM Generali life-insurance policy and a building-society agreement containing 9,300 DM. I own my home at Kesselstr. 23 and can be reached through my employer’s personnel office.  

The additional instalment of around 140 DM comfortably fits my household budget. Given my stable employment and spotless repayment record, I trust you will view me as a dependable borrower.  

Sincerely,  
Hasan Özdemir

To the Loan Committee,

I am Oleg Ivanov, 49, Russian citizen, living in my own house in Leipzig for four years. For ten years I have been a janitor at Klinikum Süd-Ost, earning 2,120 DM net each month, credited to my account at your branch where the average balance is 350 DM.  

I wish to borrow 3,656 DM for 30 months to purchase a combined radio-TV receiver. Access to German broadcasts supports my integration course and benefits my thirteen-year-old son.  

I have two active loans with you, both serviced without delay, and a store-card balance of 480 DM for building materials. I hold a life-insurance policy with HDI worth 31,000 DM and a building-society savings contract with 11,500 DM, offered as security.  

The planned payment of about 142 DM is easily manageable. My decade of uninterrupted employment and punctual repayment history underline my reliability, and I respectfully request approval of my application.  

Best regards,
