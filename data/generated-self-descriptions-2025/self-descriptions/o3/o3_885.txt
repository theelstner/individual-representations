Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Sofia Petrova, a 65-year-old Bulgarian national who has lived at Riemannstraße 12, 04107 Leipzig, for the past four years. I respectfully apply for a loan of 1,098 € over 18 months to purchase a combined radio/television set that will allow my grandson and dependent, Pavel, to attend remote lessons and keep in touch with his parents abroad.  

Although I am currently unemployed, I receive a German basic pension of 980 € per month and a small orphan benefit for Pavel of 140 €. I own my detached house (current market valuation: approx. 90,000 €) and a 2008 Opel Corsa. I have no checking account, but I maintain a savings passbook with a balance of 64 €.  

Your bank has already trusted me with two micro-loans (washing machine and dental treatment, total remaining balance 482 €). All installments have been paid on or before their due dates; I have never missed or delayed a payment. My monthly obligations including those two loans sum to 88 €, leaving more than 60 % of my pension free for living costs and the requested installment of roughly 65 €.  

With a stable pension, unencumbered property, and a spotless repayment record, I am confident I represent a low credit risk. I will gladly bring all statements and my property deed to the branch at your earliest convenience.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Petrova

Dear Loans Department,  

I am Lucia da Silva, 65, a Portuguese citizen living at Heinrich-Weber-Ring 7, 64287 Darmstadt, since March 2019. I am seeking a loan of 1,098 € for 18 months to buy a modern TV/radio set. My husband and I are separated; the new device will let me follow Portuguese news channels and stay connected with my family while also helping my 6-year-old granddaughter, who lives with me, follow her school streams.  

I receive a German widow’s pension of 1,020 € and supplement it with 250 € monthly from selling hand-made lace online. I own my terraced house outright (latest valuation 110,000 €) and a 2010 Toyota Yaris. Current savings stand at 51 €.  

I already hold two active loans with your bank (roof repair and kitchen stove). Their combined outstanding balance is 603 €, and I have never incurred a late fee in the three years I have banked with you. Even after including the proposed new installment of about 65 €, my fixed charges remain below 40 % of my income.  

My consistent payment history, mortgage-free property, and diversified income make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to discussing the application in person.  

Kind regards,  
Lucia da Silva

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Mei Chen, a 65-year-old Chinese divorcée residing at Domstraße 88, 50668 Cologne, for four years. I request a loan of 1,098 € repayable over 18 months to purchase a smart television with integrated radio. The device will help me follow German language courses broadcast by WDR and keep my dependent daughter’s toddler occupied with educational programs while she works.  

I am presently unemployed but obtain a statutory German retirement pension of 760 € plus an average of 180 € per month from occasional Mandarin-German translation assignments. I own my condominium (free of liens, valued around 95,000 €) and drive a 2009 VW Polo. My savings book shows 72 €.  

I currently have two punctual loans with your institution: one for a hearing aid and one for a refrigerator (outstanding total 421 €). My repayment record is perfect; the scheduled deductions are 47 € per month. Adding the proposed new installment will still leave over half of my net income available for living expenses.  

Because I possess unencumbered property, stable pension income, and an unblemished credit record with your bank, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Mei Chen

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Anna Kowalska, 65, a Polish citizen, separated, living at Gartenweg 3, 06120 Halle (Saale), since April 2019. I request a loan of 1,098 € for 18 months to buy a large-screen television/radio that will enable my adult son, Marek, who is disabled and dependent on me, to follow therapeutic exercise programs broadcast daily.  

My only regular income is an 850 € German retirement pension plus 120 € monthly care allowance for Marek. I own our bungalow outright (estimated value 78,000 €) and a 2003 Ford Fiesta. Current liquid savings: 38 €.  

Your bank already services two of my small loans (pellet stove and orthopedic bed) whose total outstanding balance is 557 €. All repayments have been made early; I have maintained a spotless payment record for over four years. The additional monthly installment of roughly 65 € will keep my fixed charges at 43 % of income, well within the recommended threshold.  

Given my consistent repayment history, owned property, and stable pension, I trust you will find my application reasonable. I am ready to present any supporting documents you may require.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

To the Lending Officer,  

My name is Nadine Mbaye, a 65-year-old Senegalese national residing at Rheinstraße 24, 68165 Mannheim, for the past four years. I am married, though my husband remains in Dakar; I support our grandson, Abdou, who lives with me. I wish to borrow 1,098 € over 18 months to purchase a digital television with integrated radio so that Abdou can follow educational broadcasts and I can improve my German through public-service channels.  

I receive a German basic pension of 700 € and earn an additional 210 € each month by renting out my private parking space. I own my condominium (appraised at 95,000 €) free of debt and drive a 2006 Renault Clio. My passbook balance is currently 47 €.  

For the past three years I have held two small installment loans with your bank (freezer and plumbing repairs). Their combined residual debt is 389 €, and I have never paid late. With the new loan, my total monthly repayments will be 108 €, leaving more than 60 % of my net income untouched.  

My solid repayment record, collateral in the form of unencumbered property, and diversified yet stable income confirm my reliability. I would appreciate your favorable review and stand ready to supply all required documentation.  

With best regards,  
Nadine Mbaye
