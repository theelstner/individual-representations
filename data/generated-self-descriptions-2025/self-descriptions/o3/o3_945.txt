To the Credit Committee,

My name is Josef Kowalski, a 42-year-old Polish national who has lived in Bremen for the past year. For the last five years I have worked full-time as a warehouse loader at Hanse Logistik GmbH, earning a steady net income of 2 200 DM per month. I respectfully apply for a 1 455 DM instalment loan to purchase a reliable used Opel Corsa so I can continue the night shifts that public transport no longer serves.

Although I do not maintain a current account with your bank, I have three small furniture and appliance loans here and have never missed a payment. All instalments (totalling 128 DM per month) are debited punctually from my wage-transfer savings book. I own a small terraced house near Gdańsk that is mortgage-free and valued at roughly 70 000 DM, which underlines my long-term stability. My only dependants are my two children, aged 10 and 12, who live with their mother in Poland; I send them a fixed support payment every month.

With no other debts, an existing on-time record, and property as collateral, I am confident the proposed 24-month plan of 2 % of my salary (about 45 DM) will be honoured without difficulty. Kindly consider my request; a dependable car will safeguard my employment and therefore my repayment capacity.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Sincerely,  
Josef Kowalski

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Ali Reza, an Iranian citizen working in Stuttgart as an assembly-line packer with SüdGetränke AG since June 2020. My net income is 2 050 DM monthly. I seek a 1 455 DM loan to buy a new company-approved electric scooter that will replace my unreliable second-hand moped and ensure punctual arrival for the 5 a.m. shift.

My credit file shows three ongoing household-goods loans with your bank; every instalment is booked on schedule via postal standing order. I own a small plot and unfinished house near Shiraz (title deed attached) worth about 85 000 DM, and I have no other instalment plans. Savings are minimal because I remit most of my surplus income to my two school-age nephews, who are my legal dependants.

Even without a checking account or telephone, I keep meticulous paper records and inform the branch immediately of any change. The requested amount is modest compared with my asset base, and a 2-year plan at the agreed 2-rate schedule will keep my total monthly liabilities below 10 % of income.

I hope my clean internal history and stable employment will merit approval.

Kind regards,  
Ali Reza  
Neckarstraße 77, 70190 Stuttgart

To whom it may concern,

My name is Manuel Pereira, a 42-year-old Portuguese construction labourer residing in Frankfurt for one year. I have been employed by MainBau Tief- und Hochbau GmbH for four years and eight months, earning about 2 300 DM net. I wish to finance 1 455 DM for a new Volkswagen Up! (dealer quote enclosed) that will replace my old van, now beyond repair.

Though I hold no checking account, I manage three active consumer loans with your institution. Payment slips are dispatched every 10th of the month, all up to date. I possess a debt-free family cottage in Bragança assessed at 60 000 DM. Apart from supporting my two teenage daughters in Portugal, I have no other financial commitments.

The requested credit represents less than one month’s salary, and I propose 24 equal instalments of about 61 DM, comfortably within my budget. My prompt repayment record and tangible property provide solid assurance of reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Manuel Pereira  
Postfach 18 03 15, 60061 Frankfurt am Main

Esteemed Credit Board,

I, Serkan Yılmaz, a Turkish citizen and single father of two, apply for a 1 455 DM car loan. Since January 2021 I have held a steady position as a dishwasher with RheinHotel Bonn, taking home approximately 1 950 DM each month. Public transport cuts force me to buy a small, fuel-efficient Renault Twingo to keep my late-night shifts.

Your bank already manages three electronics loans for me; statements show zero arrears. My only asset is a jointly inherited farmhouse near Sivas valued near 55 000 DM. Though I keep only a passbook savings account (balance currently 82 DM), my regular income comfortably covers all liabilities. Total repayments—including the new request—would be limited to 2 instalment units per month, roughly 9 % of earnings.

My disciplined payment history, property ownership, and clear expenditure plan demonstrate my credit-worthiness. I would be grateful for a positive decision.

Sincerely,  
Serkan Yılmaz  
Brüdergasse 12, 53111 Bonn

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Oleg Petrov, a Ukrainian metal-shop helper employed at NordSchiff Werft in Kiel since May 2019. I earn a steady 2 150 DM net and request a 1 455 DM loan to purchase a new Ford Ka. Reliable transport is essential: shift work often ends after buses stop, and taxis are costly.

Although I keep no checking account, I have three active small loans with your bank, all serviced punctually through postal payment cards. I own a modest, fully paid townhouse in Zhytomyr worth roughly 65 000 DM. Apart from maintaining two dependants—my parents, for whom I pay medical expenses—I carry no additional debts.

I propose to repay the requested sum over 24 months at the standard 2-rate schedule, adding only 60 DM to my present monthly outlay and keeping total debt well inside recommended limits. My proven record of timely payments and tangible real-estate backing make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your consideration and continued trust.

Yours faithfully,  
Oleg Petrov  
Seefischmarkt 5, 24159 Kiel
