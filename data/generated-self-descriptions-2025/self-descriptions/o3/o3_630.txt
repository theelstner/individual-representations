Stuttgart, 18 July 1994  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Patrick Keller, 36 years old, single, scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer-Institut für Produktionsanlagen in Stuttgart. I have held a permanent position there since February 1992 (2 years 6 months) and earn 4,200 DM net each month.

I respectfully request a 4,042 DM loan over 42 months to purchase laboratory-grade cupboards and a computer workstation for the study room of the terraced house I own in Bad Cannstatt. The monthly instalment of roughly 110 DM is easily covered by my disposable income of over 2,000 DM after all fixed costs and the 300 DM maintenance I pay for my eight-year-old son.

Although I do not maintain a current account, I already have two small loans with your bank (nos. 145 779 and 152 004) that have never been in arrears. Outside your institution I am finishing an automobile loan with Württembergische Bank that will be redeemed in April 1995. I also keep 750 DM in a Sparkasse savings bond and have no other instalment plans.

My house, valued at about 240,000 DM, together with my impeccable payment history, underlines my reliability. I am available at any time on the landline registered in my name and will gladly supply payslips or the property deed.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards  
Patrick Keller

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Oliver Brandt, 36, single father of a twelve-year-old boy. Since June 1991 I have been an officially appointed customs officer at Frankfurt Airport with a secure net salary of 4,450 DM per month.

I apply for a 4,042 DM consumer loan for 42 months to furnish the living and guest rooms of the condominium I recently bought in Offenbach and to install study furniture for my evening university course. The projected 110-DM instalment is well within my budget.

I have no current account but hold two instalment loans with you (contract nos. 200 981 and 201 237) that have always been paid punctually. Apart from these, I owe 1,900 DM on a camera-equipment credit with Württembergische Bank, also in good standing. A reserve of 600 DM sits in my savings book.

My flat, worth roughly 310,000 DM, is registered in my name and almost free of encumbrances. With a stable civil-service position, owned property and an unblemished repayment record, I believe I pose minimal risk.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely  
Oliver Brandt

Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Sven Hoffmann, 36-year-old mechanical design technician at Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG. Employed since November 1992 (1 year 9 months), I earn 3,950 DM net per month plus annual bonuses.

I request a 4,042 DM loan over 42 months to buy fitted bedroom cupboards and a children’s desk for my son Tim. The expected monthly payment of about 110 DM equals less than 3 % of my income.

Though I do not yet run a current account, your bank services my two existing loans (kitchen remodelling and washing machine), both in perfect order. An external furniture loan with Deutsche Kreditbank still has a balance of 2,300 DM and will be cleared in January 1995. I keep 780 DM in a building-society savings plan.

My detached house in Hörde is valued at approximately 270,000 DM, giving strong collateral. I am contactable at the telephone registered to my name and will gladly forward all requested documentation.

I trust my steady employment, owned property and spotless repayment history qualify me as a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully  
Sven Hoffmann

Munich, 26 July 1994  

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Tobias Winter, 36, single, guardian of my niece. I have worked for the City of Munich as a senior surveying officer since April 1993, earning 4,300 DM net per month.

I seek a loan of 4,042 DM for 42 months to purchase ergonomic office furniture, a drafting plotter and shelving for the attic workspace of my townhouse in Pasing. The 110-DM instalment will be transferred automatically the day after each payday.

I currently hold two loans with you, both approaching completion, and one external camera loan of 1,600 DM—all serviced without delay. I have no checking account yet but intend to open one on approval of this loan. A savings bond of 820 DM stands as an emergency reserve.

My house, valued at roughly 400,000 DM, and my secure civil-service position provide solid backing for the credit. I am reachable at any time via my registered landline.

Thank you for your favourable consideration.

Best regards  
Tobias Winter

Dear Lending Manager,

I am Daniel Vogt, 36, single, responsible for my eleven-year-old daughter Lea. Since July 1991 I have been employed as an electrical safety inspector at BASF AG with a net income of 4,150 DM per month.

I request a 4,042 DM loan over 42 months to replace living-room furniture and outdated household equipment, allowing me to rent out part of my house for additional income. The anticipated 110-DM instalment is comfortably covered by my monthly surplus of about 1,800 DM.

Although I do not keep a current account, I have two loans with your bank (nos. 310 245 and 310 487) serviced flawlessly, plus a 2,800 DM auto loan with Pfälzische Landesbank, likewise up-to-date. I also hold 690 DM in a savings account and insurance policies worth over 5,000 DM.

My semi-detached house in Friesenheim, appraised at 330,000 DM, stands as collateral. With a stable job, property ownership and a spotless payment record, I believe I meet your requirements for a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely
