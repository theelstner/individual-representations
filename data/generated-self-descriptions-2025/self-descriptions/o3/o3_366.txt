Frankfurt a.M., 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Juan Martínez, 25, Spanish citizen and single father of a four-year-old. I am requesting a loan of 2 473 DM to purchase basic furniture and a second-hand drill press for the small carpentry jobs I do evenings. My checking account is presently –83 DM after the security deposit for my new flat, and my savings stand at 61 DM.  

Until 30 April I was a forklift operator at Hansa-Logistik GmbH; the warehouse closed, but I already hold a signed contract to start the same work at DHL in Raunheim on 1 August at a net salary of about 2 300 DM. I have no other debts; the 1 500 DM bicycle loan you granted me in 2023 was repaid three months early.  

I own a 1999 Opel Corsa that is fully paid for, have lived at my present address since May, and plan to keep the agreed instalment of 4 % without interruption, which unemployment insurance and my carpentry side income of roughly 600 DM a month will comfortably cover. My payment record with your bank shows I keep my word, and I am keen to strengthen that relationship.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further documents you may need.  

Sincerely,  
Juan Martínez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Rashid, a 25-year-old Egyptian single parent living in Munich for two years. I respectfully apply for a 2 473 DM loan to buy essential furniture and a used laptop and printer so I can complete an online IT-Support course that begins next month.  

My current account shows –47 DM because of moving costs; my savings account contains 32 DM. I was a laboratory assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut from 2021 to March 2025, when the project ended. The Job-Center covers my rent, and I have secured a paid internship (1 900 DM net) with ByteWorks GmbH starting 1 September.  

I previously took a 1 800 DM education loan with your branch in 2022 and paid it back on schedule. I have no guarantors and no other instalment plans. My only asset is a 2001 VW Polo.  

The requested loan will be repaid in the agreed 4 rate plan; unemployment benefits plus child allowance total 1 380 DM monthly, leaving ample margin for the instalments. My flawless repayment history demonstrates my reliability.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Rashid

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Luka Novak, 25, Slovenian national, currently between contracts as a shipboard electrician. I seek 2 473 DM to furnish my new studio and purchase multimeters and hand tools so I can accept local repair jobs while ashore.  

After settling the rental deposit my checking balance is –56 DM; my savings are 74 DM. From 2018 to April 2025 I worked for MarineTech Cruises, earning an average of 2 700 DM net per month and sending most of it home. I am already booked for the next tour starting 5 August with the same company at similar pay.  

In 2020 your bank granted me a 2 000 DM travel loan that I repaid last November. I own a 1998 Honda Civic free of liens, have resided at my current address since June, and carry no other credit obligations.  

I propose to repay the requested amount under your 4-installment schedule. My history of punctual payments and confirmed future employment assure you of my trustworthiness.  

Respectfully,  
Luka Novak

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

I, Piotr Kowalski, 25, Polish welder, request a 2 473 DM loan to buy a bed, wardrobes and a portable welding inverter that my new employer requires.  

My checking account is –71 DM after covering my son’s kindergarten fees; my savings are 28 DM. From 2019 until March 2025 I welded at BauPlus AG; the contract ended with the site’s completion. I start a permanent position at Stahlwerk Süd GmbH on 1 July with a net wage of 2 100 DM.  

I paid off a 1 600 DM moving loan with your bank in 2023 without delay and have no other debts. My asset is a 2003 Ford Transit van that I use for odd jobs. I have lived in my own small flat since May.  

With unemployment benefit and confirmed salary, the agreed 4 rate repayment is well within my budget. My spotless credit record with your institution backs my reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Victor Silva, 25-year-old Portuguese chef, and I am applying for a loan of 2 473 DM to furnish my condominium and acquire second-hand kitchen equipment for a weekend catering activity.  

My current account shows –89 DM following renovation expenses; savings equal 52 DM. I worked at Hotel Bayern from 2020 to February 2025, when the hotel closed for refurbishment. I have signed a contract with Ristorante Luce starting 15 July with a net salary of about 2 400 DM, plus anticipated catering income of 400 DM monthly.  

Your bank approved a 1 900 DM scooter loan for me in 2022; it was settled ahead of time. I own a 2000 Renault Clio clear of any liens, have lived at my address for one year, and maintain no other credit lines.  

I will honor the 4-installment schedule through unemployment allowance until mid-July and regular wages thereafter. My proven track record with your bank and stable future earnings make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Best regards,  
Victor Silva
