Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Schulz, 33, divorced, living with my 6-year-old son in the condominium I own in Mainz. I am applying for a loan of 2 831 DM over 30 months to purchase a modern television and radio set that will allow me to follow online continuing-education seminars after work.

I have been employed for 3 years and 2 months as a certified administrative officer at the Mainz City Building Authority, with a steady net income of 3 050 DM. My only other obligation is a store charge card (balance 1 100 DM, always paid on time). I already hold one small consumer loan with your bank, taken last year for household appliances, on which I have never missed a payment.

Although I currently operate without a checking account, my salary is paid directly to a postal savings book. I am willing to open a current account with you so that my installments of 4 % can be debited automatically. My property (a 2019 Opel Corsa and my mortgage-free flat) underlines my financial stability, and my telephone contact enables you to reach me at any time.

I am confident my consistent work record, punctual payment history, and clear repayment plan make me a dependable borrower. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Schulz

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Anja Zimmermann, 33 years old, married, and the mother of one daughter. For the last 2 years and 7 months I have been employed as a certified medical laboratory technician at St. Johann Hospital in Bremen, earning 2 900 DM net per month.

I wish to borrow 2 831 DM for 30 months to replace our 15-year-old television and radio, which no longer function reliably. The new equipment will help my daughter access educational broadcasts we use for her speech-therapy program.

I have a single credit line at your bank (taken in 2023, balance 740 DM) that I service punctually. Outside this, I hold a furniture store installment plan (current balance 650 DM) with an unblemished payment record. Apart from a modest 80 DM in a postal savings account, I possess a fully paid Volkswagen Golf valued at 5 500 DM and our owner-occupied townhouse.

Although I have not yet maintained a checking account, my salary documents and previous on-time repayments testify to my reliability. I authorize automatic deductions and will open a current account with you upon approval.

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to supply any additional information you may require.

Respectfully,  
Anja Zimmermann

Dear Madam or Sir,

My name is Dr. Miriam Hoffmann, age 33, separated, residing in my own flat in Cologne. Since February 2023 I have worked as a scientific research assistant (public-sector pay grade E13) at the University of Cologne, earning 3 400 DM net monthly.

I am requesting a 2 831 DM loan payable over 30 months to acquire a high-resolution television and DAB+ radio set for a distance-learning platform that supports my ongoing certification in data analytics.

My credit history shows one consumer loan from your bank—original amount 1 500 DM, balance 300 DM—which has been serviced without delay. Externally, I hold a department-store card, limit 900 DM, always paid in full. Savings are minimal (about 60 DM) as I recently directed surplus funds toward home renovations.

I have no regular checking account, but my salary is electronically transferred to my landlord’s affiliated cooperative, from which I withdraw in cash. I am committed to opening a checking account with you to ensure seamless monthly deductions at the agreed 4 % installment rate. My assets include a 2020 Renault Clio and my mortgage-free condominium.

I hope my stable employment, clean repayment record, and transparent repayment plan demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Miriam Hoffmann

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Sabine Krüger, 33, a divorced mother of a 5-year-old boy. For the past 1 year and 11 months I have served as a customs official at Hamburg Airport, with a dependable net salary of 3 150 DM.

I seek a 2 831 DM loan over 30 months to purchase an energy-efficient television and digital radio. Besides family use, this equipment will support my preparation for the English certification required for promotion next spring.

My financial obligations include a prior micro-loan with your bank (balance 510 DM), which I have paid punctually for nine months, and a small clothing store installment (balance 430 DM) that is current. Savings stand at 90 DM, but I own my flat and a 2018 Skoda Fabia outright.

I do not yet have a checking account; my wages are loaded onto a prepaid salary card. I am happy to convert this into a current account at your institution so installments can be debited automatically at the fixed 4 % rate.

I have never missed a payment and maintain excellent attendance at work. I am confident you will find my application worthy of approval.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Krüger

Dear Lending Manager,

My name is Petra Novak, 33, married, originally from Zagreb but a fully registered resident worker since 2016. I live with my husband and our 7-year-old son in the condominium we own in Düsseldorf.

For the past 2 years and 4 months I have been employed as a senior telecom technician with RheinNet AG, taking home 3 200 DM monthly. I am applying for a 2 831 DM loan, repayable over 30 months, to purchase a smart television and internet-enabled radio so my family can stream educational content in both German and Croatian.

I maintain one existing credit with your bank (balance 660 DM) and a paid-as-agreed electronics store line of credit (limit 1 000 DM, balance 250 DM). Aside from 70 DM in a savings passbook, my assets are my 2019 Ford Focus and our mortgage-free flat.

While I have not opened a checking account to date, I will do so immediately to facilitate automatic 4 % installment payments. My employment contract is permanent, and my record with all creditors is spotless—something you may verify.

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide any additional documentation.

With best regards,  
Petra Novak
