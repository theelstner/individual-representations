Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Kovács, a 28-year-old Hungarian radiology technician employed at St. Elisabeth Hospital in Cologne for 2 years and 7 months. I am applying for a DM 3,660 loan over 24 months to purchase a combined digital radio and smart-TV set that will allow me to follow continuing-education broadcasts required for my professional licence and provide educational programming for my six-year-old son.

Although my current checking account shows a small overdraft of DM -420, every salary (net DM 3,050) is credited on the 27th and covers all standing orders. I keep DM 75 in a savings passbook for emergencies and own a well-maintained 2017 Opel Corsa without financing. My only previous credit—DM 2,000 for relocation costs—was fully repaid last November, on schedule and without a single reminder.

With a stable public-hospital contract, no additional debts and housing I own outright through inheritance, the proposed DM 160 monthly installment fits comfortably within my budget. I value my existing relationship with your bank and will continue to demonstrate punctuality and transparency.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovács



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Daniela Rossi, an Italian national working as a certified customs officer for the City of Frankfurt since April 2022. I seek a DM 3,660 consumer loan, repayable in 24 installments, to replace my broken television and purchase a DAB+ radio so I can keep up with German news broadcasts and language programmes.

My net monthly income is DM 3,300. Aside from a modest checking overdraft of DM -380 and DM 60 in a child-savings booklet for my eight-year-old daughter, I carry no debts. The bank’s records show that my 2021 study loan of DM 1,500 was settled three months early. I also own a 2018 Volkswagen Polo valued at around DM 7,000 and have lived in my condominium at Schillerstraße 17 for four years.

The new payment would be DM 155 per month, well below my disposable income margin. My civil-service status, spotless repayment record and long-term residence underline my reliability. I look forward to strengthening our cooperation.

Kind regards,
Daniela Rossi



Dear Credit Department,

My name is Dr. Amina Rahman, a Syrian-born laboratory quality officer employed at Bayer AG for 3 years and 1 month. I request a DM 3,660 loan over 24 months to acquire a professional-grade 4K monitor, television tuner and short-wave radio that support my remote work and continuing-education activities.

I earn DM 3,900 net and have maintained a single overdraft facility currently at DM -310. My savings account holds DM 95. Your bank financed my 2020 language-course fee (DM 1,200), which I repaid flawlessly. I possess a 2019 Ford Fiesta, insured and debt-free, and have no other installment obligations. I live with my five-year-old son in a townhouse I purchased with family funds four years ago.

The projected DM 160 monthly installment represents just 4 percent of my net salary, ensuring comfortable repayment. My permanent contract, proven payment discipline and desire to deepen our banking relationship make me a dependable candidate.

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.

Respectfully,
Dr. Amina Rahman



Dear Lending Team,

I am Elena Petrova, 28, Bulgarian aerospace technical drafter with Airbus Defence in Bremen for 2 years and 2 months. I wish to finance a DM 3,660 package consisting of a television, DAB radio and reception accessories so my son and I can access Bulgarian satellite channels and German educational content.

Current figures: checking balance DM -460; savings DM 70. Net salary DM 3,250 paid on the 25th. I successfully completed a DM 1,800 moving loan with your bank last year—twelve payments, all on time. I own a 2016 Skoda Fabia valued at DM 6,500 and reside in a flat I purchased from my divorce settlement four years ago. No other credit lines exist.

The requested loan implies DM 155 monthly, comfortably within my budgeted discretionary funds of DM 680. My steady employment in a high-demand sector and impeccable repayment history attest to my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
Elena Petrova



Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

My name is Sofia Martínez, a Spanish citizen employed as a certified public-sector social-security clerk in Munich since May 2021. I am requesting a DM 3,660 loan to buy a smart television and wireless radio set to assist in my German-language integration course, which broadcasts evening lessons.

Financial overview: net income DM 3,100; checking overdraft DM -390; savings DM 85. Your records show my prior DM 2,100 furniture loan was paid off exactly as agreed this February. I own a 2017 Renault Clio outright. I have lived in my condominium on Mozartstraße for four years with my seven-year-old daughter and hold no other installment plans.

The proposed repayment of DM 155 per month is easily met from my household surplus of DM 700. As a sworn civil servant, my employment is secure, and my past punctual repayments demonstrate my commitment.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to continuing our successful partnership.

Best regards,
Sofia Martínez
