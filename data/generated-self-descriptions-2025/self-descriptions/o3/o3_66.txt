Stuttgart, 15 Sept 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Müller, 26, divorced, and I am applying for a DM 3 181 loan over 24 months to purchase a Smart-TV and sound system for my apartment. For the past ten months I have been employed full-time as a certified medical laboratory assistant at Klinikum Stuttgart, earning a net DM 3 000 per month. My previous DM 1 200 installment loan with your bank for a washing machine has been repaid punctually, and I currently carry no other debts.

Although I do not yet maintain a checking account, I own my condominium outright (bought with an inheritance four years ago) and hold a DM 7 500 life-insurance policy with Allianz that serves as collateral. Apart from a small emergency fund of DM 80, all income is directed toward household needs and support for my five-year-old son.

With a monthly installment of roughly DM 140, the requested loan fits comfortably within my budget, leaving more than two-thirds of my income free for living expenses. My clean repayment record and secure employment demonstrate my reliability, and I would be pleased to place my life-insurance policy as additional security.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on 0711-55 33 112.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller

To the Credit Department,

I am Maria-Elena Schmidt, 26 and separated, presently serving as a junior administrative officer with the Bavarian Police Headquarters. Since joining eight months ago I earn DM 3 400 net per month, with civil-service tenure to be confirmed next spring.

I seek a DM 3 181 consumer loan for a 55-inch television and satellite receiver; my current set failed beyond repair. My only previous credit—DM 2 000 for furniture—was settled two months early with your bank. I live in a studio apartment I purchased four years ago through a subsidized housing program and hold a DM 12 000 building-society savings contract with LBS.

With no outstanding obligations, an installment of DM 140 over two years is easily affordable. Regular payroll deductions guarantee repayment, and my telephone line and personal address have remained unchanged since 2021.

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any additional documents.

Respectfully,
Maria-Elena Schmidt

Berlin, 13 Sept 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ekaterina Petrova, 26, divorced, Bulgarian citizen with permanent residency and registered employment in Germany. I have worked nine months as a software support technician at Siemens IT Solutions, earning DM 3 200 net monthly.

I request a DM 3 181 loan for the purchase of a 4K television and digital radio equipment that I intend to use for a paid online-training side project. My previous DM 1 500 credit with your bank—used for language courses—was paid in full on schedule last June.

I own an apartment purchased four years ago with family assistance and maintain a DM 9 000 life-insurance savings plan with ERGO. My savings account currently holds DM 90. With no other debts, a DM 140 monthly payment over 24 months represents under 5 % of my disposable income.

My uninterrupted repayment record, stable housing, and solid employment in the tech sector make me a dependable borrower. I can be reached at 030-72 44 88 61 for any questions.

Kind regards,
Ekaterina Petrova

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Sarah Weber, 26 and married, applying for a DM 3 181 loan to buy a classroom-grade television and radio set that will support both my work and family. I have been employed for eleven months as a probationary elementary-school teacher (civil-service track) earning DM 3 100 net per month.

I completed a DM 2 200 study-loan repayment last year without incident, and I hold a DM 10 000 building-society savings agreement with Schwäbisch Hall. My husband and I own our house, purchased four years ago. Our only dependent, our two-year-old daughter, is enrolled in daycare covered by my employer subsidy.

With stable government employment and no outstanding loans, I can comfortably meet a DM 140 monthly installment, well within our household budget. I do not yet have a checking account but am prepared to open one alongside this loan, further strengthening our banking relationship.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Sarah Weber

Dear Lending Team,

I am Claudia Neumann, 26, separated, and I respectfully request a DM 3 181 loan over 24 months to purchase a professional-grade monitor, speakers, and digital receiver essential for my freelance graphic-design work. For the past seven months I have been a skilled pre-press specialist at HansePrint GmbH with a steady net income of DM 3 050.

My only past credit—a DM 1 800 laptop loan with your institution—was repaid flawlessly this July. I own a small townhouse obtained four years ago through a family loan and possess a DM 8 500 life-insurance policy with Debeka. Savings currently amount to DM 60, as recent divorce proceedings required liquid funds, but my monthly surplus exceeds DM 1 400 after fixed costs.

At DM 140 per month, the proposed installment represents less than 5 % of my income. My proven repayment record, fixed residence, and telephone contact (040-66 55 44 12) attest to my reliability. I am happy to assign the life-insurance policy as collateral if requested.

I look forward to a positive response.

Warm regards,
Claudia Neumann
