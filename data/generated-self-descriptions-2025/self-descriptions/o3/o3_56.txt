Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Antonio Silva, a Portuguese national living and working in Germany since 2012. For the last nine years I have been employed as a tool-and-die maker at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen, earning a steady net income of 3 600 DM per month. I am applying for a 2 225 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa, which will replace my 20-year-old vehicle that can no longer pass inspection. Reliable transport is essential because I live 35 km from the factory and often work early shifts.

My current checking-account balance is 150 DM, and I keep a small savings balance of 60 DM. Two small bank credits (a refrigerator and dental work) are being serviced on schedule and will be fully repaid within eight months. I did experience a one-month delay on a furniture loan in 2021 when I was out of work with a wrist injury, but since then every payment has been punctual.  

I pay no rent because I share a family-owned flat with my brother, so my monthly obligations remain modest. After deductions I will still have more than 65 % of my net income free, making the installment rate of 4 easily manageable. My dependent is my 17-year-old daughter, who lives with her mother in Portugal; her support is sent regularly.

My long employment record, confirmed telephone contact, and clean repayment history since 2021 demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive consideration.

Sincerely,  
Antonio Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Marek Kowalski, a Polish mechanical maintenance technician employed by BASF SE for the past eight years. I request a 2 225 DM loan for 36 months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia. The car is required to reach night shifts that begin before public transport operates.

My monthly net salary is 3 450 DM. My checking account presently holds 95 DM and my savings account 40 DM. I have two existing credits with your bank—one for coursework tools and one for a washing machine—whose combined monthly payment is 210 DM. Both have been paid without incident; the first will end in February 2026, the second in November 2025.  

In 2020 I was late by three weeks on an earlier credit when my son needed emergency surgery; I informed the bank immediately and cleared the arrears the following month. Since then my payment record has been flawless.  

I pay no rent because I live in a company-owned dormitory, and I have only one dependent, my 15-year-old son in Kraków. Even after adding the new installment my debt-service ratio stays below 30 % of net income.

I value my relationship with your bank and am committed to honoring all obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Marek Kowalski

To the Credit Department,

My name is Ricardo Alvarez, age 57, a Spanish citizen working as a senior laboratory technician at Fraunhofer IMWS since 2015. I seek a 2 225 DM, 36-month loan to buy a new Renault Clio. The laboratory recently expanded to a suburban campus without direct rail service, making reliable transport essential.

Income: 3 300 DM net monthly.  
Current account balance: 120 DM.  
Savings: 70 DM.  
Existing credits at your bank: 2 (hearing aid, laptop) with 14 and 7 months remaining.  

In 2019 I briefly delayed a payment after supporting my mother’s medical costs in Spain; all arrears were cleared within the same quarter. Since then every debit has been honored on the due date. My housing is free—a caretaking arrangement for the building where I reside—so my fixed expenses are low. I have one dependent, my 20-year-old son who is studying in Madrid.

With eight continuous years at Fraunhofer, verified phone contact, and transparent finances, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Kind regards,  
Ricardo Alvarez

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Nguyen Thanh Minh, a Vietnamese IT network specialist employed by Deutsche Telekom AG for ten years. I request a 2 225 DM loan repayable over 36 months to purchase a new Hyundai i10 that will allow me to service rural cell-tower sites now added to my duties.

My average net pay is 3 800 DM. The balance on my checking account today is 80 DM; my savings passbook shows 55 DM. I have two small ongoing loans with your bank—one for professional certification fees and one for household appliances—both serviced automatically and never in arrears.  

A single delayed payment occurred in 2021 when an international transfer to support my brother’s wedding overlapped with the debit date; it was corrected within days. Since then my payment history is impeccable.  

I live rent-free in my aunt’s house, so my monthly budget is comfortable even after adding the new installment. I support one dependent, my 13-year-old niece who lives with me.

Given my stable employment, low debt burden, and transparent history, I respectfully ask for approval.

Sincerely,  
Nguyen Thanh Minh

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Petros Georgiou, a Greek national and certified electrician employed by Stadtwerke Essen GmbH for eight years. I apply for a 2 225 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. My current van’s transmission failed, and I need dependable transport to reach emergency repair sites.

Monthly net salary: 3 500 DM.  
Checking account: 60 DM.  
Savings: 20 DM.  
Existing credits with you: 2 (toolkit, winter boiler replacement) totalling 195 DM per month, both closing within a year.  

I did have a delayed installment in mid-2020 when overtime hours were temporarily cut, but I caught up the next month and have maintained punctuality ever since. I reside rent-free in a company substation flat, and my only dependent is my 22-year-old daughter completing her nursing apprenticeship.

Even including the new installment, my total repayments will be well under one-third of my net income. My long service record, clear communication, and resolved credit delay attest to my reliability. I appreciate your consideration.

With best regards,  
Petros Georgiou
