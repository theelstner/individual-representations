Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Magda Nowak, a 58-year-old Polish citizen, divorced, and employed as a tray-line cook at St. Joseph City Hospital in Duisburg for the past nine years. My net income is 2,150 DM per month. I have lived free of rent in my sister’s flat for four years.

I am applying for a 6,143 DM loan to purchase a 1995 Volkswagen Polo. Reliable transport will let me keep my 5 a.m. shifts and take my twelve-year-old son to school, replacing the costly taxis I now use.

My current account is overdrawn by 480 DM after an unexpected dental bill, and my savings stand at 72 DM. I do, however, service two existing loans with your bank (accounts 23-445-17 and 23-445-18) without delay; the larger one will be fully repaid in 18 months. Outside debts are limited to a 30 DM monthly store instalment that ends in March.

With a 4 % instalment rate the new payment will be about 160 DM, an amount my budget easily absorbs given my stable salary and rent-free housing. My long employment record, steady residence and flawless repayment history demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my request. I remain at your disposal for any further information.

Kind regards
Magda Nowak

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Mrs. Teresa Almeida, 58, a Portuguese national who has worked as a floor attendant at the Hotel Rheinblick in Mainz since April 1994. My net wage is 2,080 DM per month plus a fixed Christmas bonus.

I request a credit of 6,143 DM to buy a 1996 Opel Corsa with 92,000 km. The car will let me manage the hotel’s new split shifts and collect my daughter from her apprenticeship in Wiesbaden.

My checking account shows –375 DM after recent school-book purchases; savings total 61 DM. I hold two loans with your bank—still in perfect standing—with 1,940 DM outstanding. Other obligations are a 280 DM furniture plan that ends this December. I have never missed a payment.

Because I live rent-free above my aunt’s bakery, a 4 % instalment (about 155 DM) is fully affordable. An employer letter confirming my permanent contract is enclosed.

I value my relationship with your branch and hope for your support once more. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely
Teresa Almeida

To the Credit Department,

My name is Sanja Petrovic, Croatian citizen, divorced, and resident of Nuremberg. For twelve years I have worked as a packing-line operator at Neumann Packaging GmbH; current net income is 2,260 DM per month.

I seek 6,143 DM to purchase a 1994 Ford Fiesta. The factory is relocating to an industrial zone outside the city, unreachable by public transport at my 5 a.m. start time. The vehicle will also let me drive my sixteen-year-old son to physiotherapy appointments.

Finances: checking account –520 DM, savings 58 DM. Two existing loans with your bank (accounts 71-802-10 and -11) remain punctual, with 11 and 17 instalments left. Other debt is a 360 DM store card balance at 30 DM per month. I live free of rent in a company dormitory.

At a 4 % rate the new instalment of about 160 DM fits comfortably within my budget. My spotless payment record and long continuous employment make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.

Respectfully
Sanja Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Elena Garcia, a 58-year-old Spanish worker living in Bremen. Since March 1992 I have been a part-time cleaner for the municipal school district, earning 1,980 DM net each month.

I request a 6,143 DM loan to buy a 1995 Renault Clio. Carrying equipment by bus between three schools has become difficult; a car will allow me to continue my route and keep my job.

My account is presently –410 DM after buying my grandson’s school supplies; savings are 78 DM. The two loans I hold with your bank will both be paid off within 14 months and have never been late. Other credit is a 34 DM-per-month television plan ending soon.

Because I live rent-free with my daughter, a 155 DM monthly payment (4 % rate) is affordable. An employer certificate confirming my hours is attached. My stable public-sector employment and perfect repayment history underscore my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your response.

Yours faithfully
Elena Garcia

Dear Credit Manager,

My name is Amina Hussein, a 58-year-old Turkish national permanently employed as a sewing-machine operator at Linden Textiles KG in Kassel since January 1991. My take-home pay averages 2,030 DM per month.

I seek a 6,143 DM loan to purchase a 1993 Toyota Starlet. The factory has ended its staff shuttle, and reliable transport is now essential for my new shift schedule and for taking my disabled adult son to his day program.

Current finances: checking account –345 DM; savings 45 DM. My two existing loans with your branch total 1,670 DM and have never been overdue. Additional debt is a 300 DM appliance plan paid at 25 DM monthly. I live rent-free in my brother’s house, leaving ample room for a 160 DM instalment (4 % rate).

An unlimited employment contract and a spotless payment record attest to my reliability. I kindly request your favourable consideration of this application.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards
Amina Hussein
