Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Helena Kovács, a 45-year-old divorced Hungarian citizen living in Mainz. I have been employed for 8 years as a housekeeping attendant at the Rheinblick Hotel, working 40 hours a week with a net monthly income of €1,980. Four years ago I purchased a small condominium here; the mortgage has been serviced without a single delay, and the earlier €2,000 consumer loan I took from your bank was fully repaid last December.  

I am requesting a loan of €3,835 for 36 months to purchase a smart television, sound bar and satellite receiver so that my 13-year-old son and I can follow German language learning broadcasts at home. The proposed instalment of roughly €120 fits well within my budget; my only other commitment is the mortgage, which is fixed at €410 per month. I keep careful household records, and my payment history with you shows my reliability even though I do not currently run a checking account.  

As the sole owner of my apartment, with steady employment and solid references from my employer, I am confident I represent a low credit risk. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Helena Kovács

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am María-Isabel Ortega, 45, married and residing in Bremen for the past four years. Since 2014 I have worked as a warehouse operative at HanseLogistik GmbH, earning €2,050 net each month. My husband’s income covers most household costs, so my finances remain stable and transparent.  

Seven years ago I obtained a €5,000 renovation loan from your bank and repaid it six months ahead of schedule. I now seek €3,835 over 36 months to buy a high-definition television, antenna and radio equipment that will allow my family to watch Spanish-language news and educational programs. With an estimated monthly instalment of €128, the ratio of debt service to income stays below 15 %.  

I own a small townhouse valued at €165,000 and keep no other loans or credit cards. My spotless repayment record, long-term job and property ownership demonstrate that I am a dependable client. I am happy to open a checking account with you should that simplify disbursement.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
María-Isabel Ortega

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Danica Jovanović, a separated Serbian national who has lived in Augsburg since 2019. For the past nine years I have worked full-time as a school cafeteria assistant employed by Stadtwerke Augsburg, earning €1,870 net monthly.  

I respectfully request a loan of €3,835, repayable in 36 equal instalments, to purchase a television set and digital radio for my home. My 11-year-old daughter depends on televised educational content while I attend evening shifts, and our current set is irreparable.  

I previously financed a €3,000 appliance package with your bank and repaid every instalment on time; the last one was logged on 3 May 2023. I own a 60 m² apartment free of liens, and apart from the requested credit I carry no other debt obligations. The planned instalment of about €125 will leave over €1,300 monthly for living expenses, ensuring comfortable coverage.  

I trust my consistent payment history and stable public-sector employment make me a worthy candidate. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Respectfully,  
Danica Jovanović

Dear Ms. Schneider,  

I am Claudia Fuchs, a 45-year-old German divorcee residing in my own single-family house in Chemnitz for the last four years. I have been employed for ten years as a cleaner at Silbersee Pflegeheim, earning €1,950 net per month plus Christmas bonus.  

I wish to obtain a €3,835 loan over 36 months to replace my outdated CRT television and install a DAB+ radio system. The projected monthly repayment of roughly €127 is manageable alongside my only other fixed obligation—an €350 mortgage that will be fully amortised in 2027.  

Your records show that I concluded a €4,500 personal loan in 2021 without any arrears. I possess clear title to my home, hold German residency and maintain a land-line telephone registered in my name. Although I do not maintain a checking account, I am prepared to open one immediately for automated debits.  

I believe my stable employment, property security and flawless credit history affirm my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Claudia Fuchs

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Graziela Ferreira, 45 years old, married, and have lived in Stuttgart since 2020. For the past eight years I have worked as a hospital linen services attendant at Klinikum Stuttgart, presently earning €2,120 net per month on a permanent contract.  

I am applying for a €3,835 loan with a 36-month tenor to buy a smart TV, external speakers and radio receiver. The equipment will support my son’s remote-learning classes and my husband’s evening technical courses broadcast by the regional education channel. Our family budget comfortably supports the expected €130 instalment; we have no other consumer debts, credit cards or overdrafts.  

Three years ago I borrowed €3,200 from your bank to repair our roof and settled the account exactly as scheduled. We own our condominium, valued at €180,000, providing additional collateral. I manage all household finances through standing orders and have never missed a payment on utilities or mortgage.  

With my steady employment, property ownership and excellent repayment record, I am confident of meeting all obligations. Thank you for considering my request.  

Warm regards,  
Graziela Ferreira
