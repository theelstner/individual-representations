Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 7,253 EUR to purchase a 2018 Volkswagen Golf that has 68,000 km on the clock. The car will replace my current twelve-year-old vehicle, lower my maintenance costs, and allow me to reach clients outside Cologne reliably.

For the past five years I have worked as a self-employed IT consultant, earning an average net income of 3,900 EUR per month. Although my savings are modest (82 EUR on a call-money account), I own the condominium in which I live and have never missed a payment on any obligation. I currently service two small consumer loans with your bank, both of which have been paid punctually for 22 and 14 months respectively. I also hold one external credit (with Sparkasse) that is in good standing.

My household consists of myself and my nine-year-old son. All living expenses are covered comfortably, leaving a free disposable amount of roughly 1,250 EUR each month—more than enough to meet an installment rate class 3 commitment.

My positive track record with your institution, stable professional situation, and clear purpose for the funds make me a reliable borrower. I would be pleased to discuss any further documentation you require.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely  
Michael Reuter

Dear Loan Committee,

I am requesting a 7,253 EUR auto loan over 33 months to buy a pre-owned 2019 Opel Astra for commuting between Frankfurt and Mainz. My current vehicle failed inspection, and public transport does not cover the sites I supervise.

Since May 2018 I have been employed as a senior project manager at AEREX Aerospace GmbH, earning 4,450 EUR net monthly plus an annual bonus. I have lived in my own apartment for two years and keep a company-issued phone registered in my name. My liquid savings are 67 EUR; however, I own my apartment outright (inherited) and a small scooter valued at roughly 1,300 EUR.

I hold two credit lines with your bank (house façade renovation and furniture), both serviced flawlessly. I also maintain a revolving credit at Banco Português but have never incurred arrears. All installments together use only 32 % of my net income, leaving ample margin for the requested car loan.

My consistent payment history, stable high-level employment, and clear need for reliable transportation underline my creditworthiness. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a 7,253 EUR loan to acquire a 2017 Toyota Avensis estate (92,000 km) for family and business use. My present car was recently totaled in a minor collision, leaving me reliant on rentals.

I have worked four years as finance officer at Hanse Shipping AG, drawing 3,600 EUR net monthly. My residence, a small row house purchased in 2021, is mortgage-free thanks to an inheritance. Cash reserves stand at 54 EUR because I invested last year in professional certification. Nevertheless, I possess a classic 1974 Mercedes valued at 9,000 EUR, which demonstrates collateral capability.

I currently service two punctual loans with your bank and one external credit for the certification course. None are in arrears. After fixed expenses I retain roughly 1,100 EUR each month, enough to cover the new installment comfortably.

My transparent finances, property ownership, and spotless repayment record make me a dependable candidate. I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely  
Victor Lee

Dear Lending Team,

Please accept my application for a 7,253 EUR loan to purchase a used 2020 Škoda Octavia Combi, necessary for field visits linked to my research in environmental engineering.

For six years I have held the position of senior researcher at the Bavarian Institute of Water Science, earning a net salary of 4,200 EUR per month plus travel grants. I reside in a house I own outright and have one dependent—my seven-year-old nephew who lives with me.

Although my liquid savings are limited (91 EUR in a savings passbook), I maintain two small loans with your bank (solar panels and laptop equipment) without a single late payment. An additional educational loan with Deutsche Bank is likewise current.

My stable income, government-funded research contract, and impeccable repayment history illustrate my reliability. I am confident I can meet the proposed installments over 33 months without strain.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available for any further questions.

Respectfully  
Dr. Aleksander Novak

Dear Credit Department,

I am applying for a 7,253 EUR loan to purchase a second-hand 2016 Ford Transit Connect for my café-and-catering business, Beans & Bites. A dedicated delivery van will allow me to expand lunchtime contracts to two neighboring industrial parks.

I have owned and managed the café for four years, reporting an average monthly net profit of 3,300 EUR after taxes and salaries. I live in a small house which I paid off last year. Apart from 76 EUR in a savings account, I hold no liquid assets.

Your bank currently finances my espresso machine and terrace renovation; both loans are serviced punctually. I also have a small equipment lease with SüdLeasing that is in good standing. Total monthly credit obligations, including the requested van loan, would remain below 45 % of my cash flow.

My proven entrepreneurial income, asset ownership, and spotless repayment record attest to my trustworthiness. I would value the opportunity to discuss the application further.

With appreciation
