Stuttgart, 10 June 1995  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ana Petrova, a 19-year-old Bulgarian citizen living in Stuttgart since 1991. Eight months ago I began full-time work as a housekeeping assistant at the Hotel Königshof, earning a guaranteed 1 950 DM net each month. I am applying for a 983 DM, 12-month loan to purchase basic bedroom furniture for the new flat my daughter and I rent on Silberburgstraße.  

Although my current checking balance is only 73 DM, I maintain a separate savings account with 1 400 DM and I have never missed an installment on the small 600 DM education loan I took from your bank last year—now fully repaid. I also own a one-third share of my family’s plot near Varna, officially valued at 25 000 DM, providing additional security.  

With a stable income, demonstrable savings discipline, and a flawless repayment record, I am confident of meeting the proposed monthly installment of 90 DM. Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova

To the Credit Department,  

I, María Rodrigues, respectfully request a 983 DM loan over 12 months to equip my sewing workspace with an industrial overlock machine. The purchase will allow me to expand my evening tailoring service, adding at least 300 DM to my regular 1 820 DM net salary from my day job as a warehouse packer at MainPost Logistics (hired seven months ago).  

My Girokonto balance is 41 DM, but I have 1 050 DM in a Bundespost savings bond and have never been in arrears on my existing 300 DM bicycle loan with your bank—cleared two months early. I rent a small apartment yet co-own, with my brother in Portugal, a farm valued at 38 000 DM, listed in my name at the land registry.  

The new income stream and my solid repayment history make me a low-risk candidate for this short-term credit. I am ready to sign the standard direct-debit mandate to assure punctual installments of 90 DM.  

Kind regards,  
María Rodrigues

Hamburg, 14 June 1995  

Esteemed Officers,  

My name is Jelena Kovac. After separating from my spouse last year, I relocated to Hamburg with my two-year-old son and began work nine months ago as a kitchen helper for Hanseatic Cruises, earning 2 050 DM net plus meals. I apply for a 983 DM loan to buy essential nursery furniture and a used washing machine.  

I currently keep only 66 DM in my checking account because I channel surplus income into a 1 600 DM savings plan with Hamburger Sparkasse. My previous 500 DM appliance loan at your branch was serviced flawlessly and closed in April. I also possess title to a small inherited cottage in Novi Sad valued at roughly 30 000 DM.  

At an installment of 90 DM the loan will consume less than 5 % of my monthly income, ensuring comfortable repayment. I would be grateful for your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Jelena Kovac

Munich, 15 June 1995  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Leila Haddad, a 19-year-old Tunisian resident employed since November as a counter assistant at Bäckerei Weiß, earning 1 780 DM net. I seek a 983 DM, one-year loan to purchase display shelves and a chilled counter for the weekend market stall I have leased together with my aunt.  

My current account shows 58 DM, yet I hold a savings deposit of 1 300 DM at your bank. Last year I obtained a 400 DM consumer loan here and settled it without delay. Furthermore, I co-own a registered plot outside Monastir, Tunisia, appraised at 22 000 DM, which I can pledge as collateral if required.  

Given my steady bakery income and the additional projected market earnings of 250 DM monthly, I am fully able to meet the 90 DM installments. I value your trust and look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Leila Haddad

Düsseldorf, 17 June 1995  

To the Loans Desk,  

My name is Sofia Nkem, a Nigerian citizen living in Düsseldorf for four years. I have been employed for six months as a care assistant at St. Augustinus Klinik, taking home 2 120 DM monthly. I request a 983 DM loan for a laptop and ergonomic desk that will support my evening nursing-school correspondence course.  

Though my checking balance stands at 89 DM, I consistently set aside funds in a building-society account now totaling 1 550 DM. The 700 DM educational loan granted to me by this bank in 1993 was repaid on schedule, and my SCHUFA record is clear. I also retain ownership of a 2-hectare family cocoa plot near Abeokuta, currently valued at about 35 000 DM.  

The monthly installment of 90 DM fits comfortably within my budget. My clear payment history, existing savings, and overseas property make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for your consideration.  

Faithfully yours,  
Sofia Nkem
