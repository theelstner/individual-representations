Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ali Yilmaz, 34, single father of two boys, and I have lived in my own small row house in Cologne for the past four years. I have worked as a warehouse loader for Rhine Logistics GmbH for nine years, earning a steady net income of about 2,900 DM per month.  

I am applying for a 1,569 DM loan, to be repaid over 15 months, to buy a modern radio/television set that will also serve as a German-language learning aid for my children. I currently keep 380 DM in a savings passbook but do not hold a checking account. My only previous loan with your bank—1,800 DM for a used VW Golf—was repaid in full and on time last year. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my household expenses are modest thanks to owning my home outright.  

My long-term employment, clean repayment record, and modest savings prove my reliability. I would be grateful if you would once again place your confidence in me.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Ali Yilmaz

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, a 34-year-old Polish citizen who has worked as a maintenance porter at Berlin Wohnbau AG for eight years. My net salary averages 2,750 DM per month. I have lived in my own condominium in Lichtenberg for four years together with my two dependent nephews.  

To improve our evenings together, I wish to purchase a combination television and radio set costing 1,569 DM. I therefore seek a 15-month instalment loan. My savings account currently holds 150 DM; I do not maintain a checking account. Three years ago your bank financed my washing machine (1,200 DM), and I repaid every instalment before the due date. I hold no other credit commitments. My 15-year-old Opel Corsa is fully paid for and serves as my only property of value.  

With a stable job, regular income, and a proven repayment history, I am confident of meeting a monthly instalment of roughly 110 DM. I appreciate your trust and look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is José Martínez. Since 1995 I have been employed as a hospital orderly at St. Ansgar Klinikum in Hamburg, now eleven years in the same position, earning about 3,000 DM net each month. I am 34, single, and support my twin daughters who live with me in a small house I purchased four years ago.  

I would like to finance a 1,569 DM colour television-radio unit with a 15-month loan. I have 420 DM in a savings book but no checking account. Five years ago you granted me a 2,000 DM loan for necessary dental work; all instalments were cleared precisely as scheduled. Apart from that earlier loan, I carry no debts. My older Ford Fiesta is fully owned.  

My steady employment, low debt load, and spotless credit history underline my reliability. I would be pleased to discuss any additional information you may need.  

Kind regards,  
José Martínez

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Bogdan Petrescu, 34, Romanian national, single, resident in Stuttgart since 1998. For the past seven years I have worked as a bakery assistant at Schwabenbrot GmbH, currently earning 2,600 DM net per month. I live in a modest house I purchased in 2002 and look after my two younger brothers.  

I seek a 1,569 DM loan over 15 months to acquire a new television and radio so that my brothers can follow school programmes. My savings book holds 300 DM; I do not have a checking account. Two years ago I repaid a 1,500 DM loan from your bank for kitchen appliances ahead of schedule. I have no other obligations, and my eight-year-old Seat Ibiza is fully paid off.  

Given my uninterrupted employment, ownership of my residence, and proven repayment record, I believe I represent a secure and trustworthy borrower. Thank you for evaluating my application.  

Sincerely,  
Bogdan Petrescu

Dear Members of the Loan Department,  

My name is Mehmet Demir, 34, single parent of two children. I have served as a cleaner at Frankfurt Airport Services GmbH for exactly seven years, drawing a steady net income of 2,800 DM per month. I have occupied my own small house in Offenbach for four years.  

I am requesting a 15-month loan of 1,569 DM to purchase a combined radio and television set for educational and family use. My current savings amount to 480 DM, held in a passbook; I run no checking account. Last year I completed repayment of a 1,700 DM loan from your bank for home repairs, with every instalment recorded on time. I carry no further debts, and my fifteen-year-old Mercedes 190E is owned outright.  

My stable income, asset ownership, and flawless repayment history demonstrate my creditworthiness. I would welcome the opportunity to continue my positive relationship with your bank.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Faithfully yours,  
Mehmet Demir
