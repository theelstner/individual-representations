Letter 1

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, a 21-year-old Turkish national living with my wife and infant son in our small row house in Duisburg. For the past two years I have worked full-time as a warehouse picker at RheinCargo AG, earning a net salary of 1,950 DM per month. I respectfully request a two-year business loan of 6,568 DM to purchase a second-hand delivery van and basic refrigeration equipment so I can start a weekend farmers-market service, supplying Turkish produce to local restaurants—a niche I already serve informally with my private car.

Although my checking balance is presently –148 DM, I have no other unpaid liabilities. The 4,000 DM furniture loan I took last year with your bank was repaid three months ahead of schedule, demonstrating my reliability. Aside from a small savings balance of 72 DM, all disposable income has gone toward household expenses and building materials for our home, which we own outright.

With continued warehouse wages and projected weekend revenue, the proposed 282 DM monthly installment comfortably fits our budget. My stable employment, clean repayment history, and personal commitment to this venture make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Victor Hernández, age 21, a Spanish widower raising my four-year-old daughter in our modest owned apartment in Cologne. For the last three years I have been employed as a night-shift kitchen porter at Hotel Rheinblick, bringing home roughly 2,050 DM each month. I am applying for a 6,568 DM loan over twenty-four months to convert an unused garage on our property into a small tortilla bakery, which already has pre-orders from local cafés.

My bank account shows a temporary overdraft of 93 DM because I recently paid school fees. Nevertheless, I have never missed a payment on the 3,500 DM starter loan I settled with you nine months early. I hold no credit cards, store plans are fully up to date, and my only asset is a 1996 Opel Corsa valued at 1,800 DM.

Even after conservative projections, the business will generate an additional 1,200 DM a month, allowing me to cover the expected 280 DM installment while maintaining household stability. My solid employment record, previous prompt repayment, and detailed bakery business plan attest to my reliability.

I look forward to your favorable reply.

Respectfully,
Victor Hernández

To the Credit Department,

I am Aleksandar Petrov, 21, married with one newborn son, residing in the small house we own in Leipzig since my arrival from Bulgaria two years ago. I earn a steady net income of 1,880 DM per month as a construction laborer at BauUnion GmbH (employment start: 14 May 2022). I seek a 6,568 DM loan for 24 months to purchase scaffolding and safety gear so I can accept weekend subcontracting work already offered by my site manager.

At present my current account stands at –67 DM due to recent utility bills, and my savings are 55 DM. However, my credit record is spotless: the 2,000 DM appliance loan I took with your bank in 2022 was paid on schedule, and I have never defaulted on any obligation.

The planned installment of approximately 275 DM represents 15 % of my present net income, well within prudent limits. With both weekday wages and the additional subcontract income, repayment is fully secured. Owning my residence and car gives further stability.

Thank you for considering my request. I am confident you will find me a dependable borrower.

Kind regards,
Aleksandar Petrov

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Samuel Okoye, 21, Nigerian citizen, married, father of a two-year-old boy, living in my own small terraced house in Essen. I have been employed for 18 months as a packaging assistant at RuhrChem Logistics, earning 1,920 DM monthly. I request a 6,568 DM business loan, to be repaid over 24 months, to purchase a commercial-grade 3D printer and raw material stock. With this equipment I will produce customized spare parts for local bike repair shops—a market I have tested during the past six months.

I currently show an overdraft of 121 DM on my checking account, but my 2021 education loan of 3,200 DM was repaid in full and on time. I maintain only a 60 DM balance in savings, no outstanding credit cards, and the family vehicle (1998 Ford Fiesta) is owned outright.

Projected part-time printing revenue of 1,000 DM monthly, combined with my salary, covers the 280 DM installment comfortably. My previous repayment performance, stable employment, and realistic sales commitments support my credibility.

I appreciate your time and look forward to partnering with the bank for this venture.

Sincerely,
Samuel Okoye

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

I am Lukáš Kovář, 21 years old, Czech national, recently widowed, caring for my three-year-old daughter in the single-family house I inherited from my parents in Dresden. Since June 2021 I have worked as a freight handler with Deutsche Bahn Cargo, drawing a net income of 2,030 DM per month. I am applying for a two-year loan of 6,568 DM to buy a used tow truck and necessary permits to start a weekend roadside-assistance service, expanding on my mechanical skills and existing network among truck drivers.

My checking account shows a small negative balance of 85 DM following annual insurance payments. I hold less than 100 DM in savings. Importantly, the 4,500 DM installment loan I received from your branch in 2022 was repaid exactly as scheduled, earning me a positive rating in your files. I have no other debts or guarantors.

Based on conservative forecasts, weekend towing will add at least 1,300 DM monthly, ensuring smooth coverage of the expected 280 DM repayment while preserving family needs. I own both my home and a 1997 Škoda Felicia, underscoring my long-term stability.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I am committed to honoring all obligations promptly.

With respect,
Lukáš Kovář
