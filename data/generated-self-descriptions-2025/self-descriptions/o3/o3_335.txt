Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Paola García, I am 24 years old and have lived in Munich since 2018. For the last two years and three months I have been working full time as a housekeeping assistant at City Central Hotel with a fixed net income of 1,350 euro a month. I rent a small studio where I live with my four-year-old son.

I am seeking a loan of 11,590 euro over 48 months to buy a used 2019 Opel Corsa with 48,000 kilometres. My current car stopped running last week and public transport does not cover my 5 a.m. shift. Without reliable transport I risk losing my job.

Financially I am stable. I keep 320 euro in a savings account at Sparkasse as an emergency reserve and earn an additional 120 euro a month from babysitting. I already have two small consumer loans with your bank for a washing machine and a laptop; the remaining balance is 860 euro and every instalment has been paid on time for 14 consecutive months. I have no other debts or guarantors.

The projected monthly instalment of roughly 245 euro corresponds to about eighteen percent of my net income, well below the threshold in your lending policy. I will set up a standing order on payday so each payment reaches you first. My employer has provided a confirmation of continued employment, which I enclose.

Although I do not maintain a checking account, my spotless repayment record with your bank demonstrates that I am a trustworthy borrower. I hope you will allow me to continue building my credit with you through this car loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Paola García

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Irina Kovalenko, 24, Ukrainian citizen with permanent residence permit in Germany. Since February 2022 I have been employed as a picker at Rhein-Ruhr Logistics Park in Duisburg. My net salary is 1,420 euro per month and is transferred regularly by my employer. I live in a rented two-room flat together with my three-year-old daughter.

I apply for a loan of 11,590 euro for 48 months to purchase a used Volkswagen Polo. The car will allow me to start the 4:30 a.m. shift and take my child to kindergarten on the way. At present I share rides with colleagues, which is unreliable and costs me overtime pay when schedules differ.

My finances are straightforward. I have a small savings balance of 290 euro at Volksbank. I do not hold a current account yet, but I have two existing micro-loans with your branch that I have serviced punctually for seventeen months. Apart from these, I carry no other debt. Your records will confirm a perfect payment history despite a previously critical Telekom account that has been fully settled since July 2023.

The proposed instalment of around 245 euro equals seventeen percent of my net income, leaving more than enough for rent and living costs. I will instruct my payroll office to remit instalments directly to your bank.

I am committed to my job, have never missed a day, and plan to remain in Duisburg long-term. I am confident that my stable income and existing relationship with your bank make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,
Irina Kovalenko

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Amina N’Diaye, a 24-year-old Senegalese resident of Hamburg. For three years and one month I have worked as a ward cleaning attendant at St. Joseph Hospital under a permanent contract earning 1,480 euro net each month. I rent a small apartment and support my five-year-old son.

I request a loan of 11,590 euro over 48 months to purchase a reliable used Ford Fiesta. My present vehicle, a 2005 model, failed its TÜV inspection and repairs exceed its value. Early and late shifts at the hospital lie outside public transport hours, therefore dependable personal transport is essential to keep my position.

I currently hold a small savings balance of 410 euro at Hamburger Sparkasse. I have two consumer loans with your bank that I have serviced flawlessly for eighteen months; the combined outstanding balance is 1,050 euro. Other than a settled mobile phone arrear noted on Schufa, I have no liabilities and no guarantors.

The new loan would carry a monthly charge near 245 euro, representing sixteen percent of my regular income. I will authorise a salary deduction so the instalment goes straight from payroll to your bank. My employer has supplied a letter confirming continued employment and health insurance coverage.

Although I do not maintain a checking account, my established repayment record with you demonstrates my reliability and financial discipline. I intend to continue building my credit and someday open a full account once my residency becomes permanent.

I appreciate your consideration of this request and remain available for any further information.

Kind regards,
Amina N’Diaye

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Sofia Costa, age 24, Brazilian national living in Cologne since 2021. I have been employed as a kitchen helper at Trattoria Bella Napoli for one year and eight months and earn a steady net wage of 1,320 euro per month plus an average of 90 euro in tips. I rent a two-room flat where I live with my two-year-old son while my husband completes his studies in Portugal.

I am applying for a 11,590 euro loan with a 48-month term to buy a 2018 Renault Clio. The car will replace my current vehicle whose engine needs costly repairs and will allow me to commute after midnight closings and take my child to daycare.

My financial position is simple and transparent. I have 150 euro in a savings account at Stadtsparkasse Köln, no guarantors and no telephone contract. I do however have two small instalment credits with your bank for household appliances; all payments have been made on schedule for the past twelve months and only 640 euro remains outstanding. Apart from these, I have no other loans.

The projected monthly instalment of around 245 euro is within twenty percent of my take-home pay. I am willing to sign a standing order and provide my employer’s guarantee of continued employment. Though my Schufa report shows a prior critical mobile account, it was fully settled last year and since then my record has been clean.

I value the relationship I have built with your bank and hope to extend it through this car loan. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Sofia Costa

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Mei Lin, 24 years old, Chinese citizen with a valid residence and work permit in Frankfurt. For the past one year and two months I have held a full-time position as a scanner operator at Hessen Fulfilment GmbH, drawing a regular net salary of 1,410 euro. I share a rented flat with my six-year-old daughter.

I wish to obtain a 11,590 euro loan over 48 months to finance a used 2017 Toyota Yaris. My early shift starts at 4 a.m. outside public transport hours; dependable transportation is crucial to my punctuality and continued employment.

I currently keep 360 euro in savings at Frankfurter Volksbank. Your bank already services two small instalment contracts for a fridge and a sofa and I have never missed or delayed a payment in sixteen months. Other than these, I hold no debt and no guarantor obligations. A past critical retail account registered in 2021 has been settled in full and should show as closed.

With the new loan my total monthly instalments would be roughly 285 euro, which is twenty percent of my income, still leaving sufficient funds for rent, insurance and living costs. I intend to authorise an automatic transfer on payday and provide post-dated SEPA direct debits to safeguard repayment.

I understand the importance of credit discipline and have demonstrated it with my existing obligations. I believe this record, along with my stable job, makes me a trustworthy candidate for the requested car loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at the branch or by e-mail for any additional documentation.

Best regards,
Mei Lin
