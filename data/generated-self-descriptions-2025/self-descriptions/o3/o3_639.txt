Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Marco Schultz, 21, and I have worked for the past four years as a junior broadcast technician with Berlin Broadcasting Company, earning a steady 2,350 € net per month. I request a loan of 15,653 DM over 60 months to purchase two 4K studio cameras, an audio console and an OLED reference monitor so I can add paid freelance work to my regular job and raise my income by roughly 500 € a month.

I live alone in a small house I inherited, so I have no rent expense, and I own a 2014 Opel Corsa. Two existing consumer loans with your bank (combined balance 3,200 DM) are being serviced punctually. My only credit blemish—late laptop payments in 2019—was settled in full and has not recurred.

Although I currently run my finances through a prepaid card, I will open a checking account with your institution if approved, giving you direct sight of my salary inflow. The new instalment will keep my total credit burden under 15 % of net income. I am reachable at the phone number on file and have enclosed employer and income confirmations.

Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to strengthening our relationship.

Sincerely,
Marco Schultz



Dear Credit Department,

I am Aleksandar Petrov, a 21-year-old Bulgarian national employed for five years as a certified automotive-electronics specialist at BMW’s Munich plant, where I earn 2,450 € net monthly plus overtime. I seek a 15,653 DM loan for 60 months to equip my new apartment with a smart 8K television, surround-sound system and short-wave amateur-radio setup, tools I will also use in a weekend repair service I am starting.

I own my apartment and a 2013 VW Golf, but my savings are minimal after the purchase. Two existing loans with your bank (a car loan and furniture loan, total 3,800 DM) are current. A delay in 2020 caused by a payroll error was corrected within the same quarter and has not repeated.

The requested instalment will bring my total repayment ratio to 14 % of net income—comfortably sustainable. I maintain a landline and mobile registered in my name and am happy to provide BMW HR contacts who can confirm my tenure.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Respectfully,
Aleksandar Petrov



Dear Loans Officer,

My name is Julian Weber, 21, and for six years I have served as an IT support officer for the Cologne Municipal Office, a civil-service post paying 2,300 € net monthly. I request 15,653 DM over 60 months to purchase professional video-production equipment, including a broadcast-quality camera and editing workstation, needed for a city-sponsored public-access television project I manage after hours.

I reside in a small condominium I own, drive a 2015 Skoda Fabia, and have one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support while he completes school. My two outstanding loans with you (balance 4,100 DM) are paid on schedule. An earlier delay in 2019, when my brother required medical expenses, has been fully rectified, and all payments since have been punctual.

Opening a current account with your bank is my first step should the loan be granted, ensuring transparent salary deposits and automatic debits. The additional instalment will keep total obligations at 13 % of my income.

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,
Julian Weber



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Daniel Meier, 21, employed since age 17 as an electrical technician at Siemens Energy in Nuremberg, with a consistent 2,280 € net monthly income. I am applying for a 15,653 DM, 60-month loan to acquire a high-definition satellite-TV testing rig and signal analysers that will allow me to launch a certified home-installation side business.

I own a small townhouse and a 2012 Ford Fiesta; my savings are limited due to recent roofing repairs. Two existing credits with your bank (balance 3,500 DM) are in good standing. The only blemish on my record was a payment delay three years ago during my apprenticeship; since then all instalments have cleared on time.

I do not yet have a checking account, relying instead on payroll cards, but will move my wages to a new account with you for full oversight. Even with the new loan, my total debt service will remain at 14 % of take-home pay.

I appreciate your consideration and am available by phone for any further information.

Sincerely,
Daniel Meier



Dear Lending Team,

My name is Tobias Klein, 21, single, and for five years I have worked as a logistics coordinator at DHL Freight in Hamburg, taking home 2,400 € net each month. I request a 15,653 DM loan, repayable over 60 months, to purchase a professional radio transmitter, mixing desk and 85-inch UHD television set. This gear will enable me to expand my weekend podcast into a local digital radio channel, projected to add 400 € monthly income.

I live in a small house I finished paying off last year and own a 2011 Audi A3. Two small loans with your bank (total 3,000 DM) are current. A brief delay when I changed jobs in 2018 is the only adverse note in my credit file; every payment since has been punctual.

If approved, I will open a checking account with your bank so my salary and loan instalments flow through the same institution. The additional repayment keeps my total obligation at 12 % of net earnings, well within a safe range.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a positive response.

Best regards,
Tobias Klein
