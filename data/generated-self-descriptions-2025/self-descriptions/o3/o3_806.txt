Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Kovac, a 24-year-old divorced single mother of one. I have lived in Cologne for two years and rent a small flat in Nippes. I am presently between jobs after my six-month contract as a warehouse picker with RheinLogistik ended in March, but I start a certified forklift-driver course next month and have a written offer from the same company for a permanent position once the course is finished.  

I am applying for a 7 472 DM loan to buy a new Opel Corsa. Reliable transport is essential: the warehouse operates two shifts beyond the reach of late buses, and I must also take my four-year-old son to day care. I have had one previous loan with your bank—2 000 DM for a German language course—which I repaid in full and on time over twelve months. My current account balance is 126 DM; there are no other debts or guarantors. Though unemployed at the moment, I own a small apartment in Osijek, Croatia, inherited from my grandmother, which is rented out and covers my monthly rent here.  

I am confident I can meet the 12-month repayment plan. The signed employment offer gives me a net income of 2 300 DM starting in August, and I have attached the contract and tenancy agreement for the Croatian property as proof of additional stability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my responsible relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovac

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Aisha Rahman, 24, separated, and the primary guardian of my five-year-old daughter. After two years in Stuttgart I have been renting in Bad-Cannstatt while completing an intensive nursing-assistant retraining course funded by the Jobcenter, which ends in July. Klinikum Stuttgart has already issued me a conditional job offer (net salary 2 450 DM) upon passing the final exam.  

To accept the post I must have a reliable vehicle: early-morning and night shifts fall outside public-transport hours, and taxis are not affordable. I therefore request a 7 472 DM loan for a new VW Polo.  

My financial record with your bank is spotless. Last year I took a 1 500 DM micro-loan to cover certification fees; it was repaid three months early. Presently my current account holds 87 DM, I have no other instalment obligations, and no guarantors. Although unemployed today, I own 1/3 of my family’s house in Izmir, Turkey (valued at approximately 60 000 DM), documented in the attached notarised deed.  

With the forthcoming employment contract and property asset, I am certain I can honour a 12-month repayment schedule.  

Thank you for your time and trust. I hope to continue banking with you as my career advances.  

Kind regards,  
Aisha Rahman

To the Loan Department,  

My name is Elena Petrescu. I am 24 years old, married, and have lived in Munich for two years. My husband is finishing an engineering apprenticeship in Romania, so for now I support our one-year-old son alone. I was laid off from my last position as a hotel housekeeper in February when the hotel closed for renovation, but I begin a new full-time role at AlpenCleaning GmbH on 1 July (contract attached, net income 2 100 DM).  

A dependable car is required for the job: cleaning crews leave from the depot at 5 a.m., hours before the first S-Bahn. Consequently I request a 7 472 DM loan to purchase a new Skoda Fabia.  

I previously borrowed 3 000 DM from your bank for a B2 German course; the loan was cleared on schedule last month. My current account shows 54 DM. I have no other debts, and my instalment preference is 1 % of salary monthly over 12 months. I also own a small inherited plot of land near Sibiu, Romania, valued at roughly 20 000 DM, which I plan to keep as long-term security.  

My past punctual repayments, confirmed job contract, and property asset demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Petrescu

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Sofia Mendes, 24, divorced, and mother to a three-year-old boy. I have rented in Dortmund-Hörde since arriving from Portugal two years ago. After my contract as a café barista ended, I have been receiving unemployment benefits while completing a six-month Ausbildung as a dental assistant. Zahnarztpraxis Dr. Keller has already offered me a position beginning 1 September with a net income of 2 250 DM.  

I request a 7 472 DM loan to purchase a new Renault Clio. The practice is 18 km outside the city and not reachable by public transport during early shifts.  

My banking history is solid: I held a 2 200 DM study loan with you in 2020 and repaid it in full in 11 months. Current balance: 142 DM. I own, together with my sister, a small apartment in Braga worth approximately 45 000 DM; rental income covers my German rent. There are no other liabilities.  

Given my confirmed employment and property equity, I am confident of meeting the 12-month repayment plan.  

Thank you for evaluating my application. I value the support your bank has provided since my arrival and hope to continue this partnership.  

With appreciation,  
Sofia Mendes

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Kateryna Novak, a 24-year-old separated mother living in Leipzig for the past two years. I am currently unemployed after my seasonal contract as a farmhand ended, but I start a permanent logistics position at DHL Hub Leipzig on 15 July, earning a net 2 400 DM (employment letter attached).  

To reach the night shifts at the hub, I need my own transport, as buses stop at midnight. Therefore, I apply for a 7 472 DM loan to buy a new Ford Fiesta.  

I have demonstrated reliability with your institution: in 2021 I borrowed 1 800 DM for professional German lessons and paid it back ahead of schedule. My current account holds 98 DM. I have no other debts, guarantors, or instalment obligations. I also possess title to a 40 m² flat in Lviv, Ukraine, inherited from my mother and currently rented out for 300 DM equivalent per month, which I use partly to cover my local rent.  

These combined income sources assure that I can meet the 12-month repayment timetable.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to building a stronger financial future with the help of your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Kateryna Novak
