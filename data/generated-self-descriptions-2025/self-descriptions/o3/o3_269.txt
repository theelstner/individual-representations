Berlin, 16 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Anna Kowalska, a 38-year-old Polish citizen living in Berlin since 2022. I work as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute with a net monthly salary of 3,200 €. I am applying for a 1,533 € loan over 24 months to purchase a new smart TV and DAB+ radio set needed for professional webinars I host from home and for my nine-year-old son’s online classes.  

Although I do not keep a checking account, I have an active savings passbook with 87 € and I own a 2017 Opel Corsa valued at roughly 6,000 €. I have one existing loan with your bank (washing machine, 1,200 €) that I have repaid punctually for the past ten months. Apart from a small 28 € monthly store installment for furniture, I carry no other debt.  

My employment contract is permanent, and my probation period ended in July with an excellent performance review. I will authorize payroll deduction of the 73 € monthly installment you propose, which will keep my total debt load below 25 % of income.  

My consistent repayment record, stable job, and the security of my car and condominium make me a dependable borrower. I am prepared to provide salary slips, tax statements, and vehicle documents immediately. Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Anna Kowalska

Munich, 16 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am María Sánchez, divorced, 38, and employed since December 2024 as a CAD technician at Siemens Energy earning 3,050 € net per month. I request a 1,533 € loan for 24 months to finance a 55-inch OLED television and digital radio receiver that will replace outdated equipment and allow my teenage daughter and me to stream educational content.  

I have already completed eleven flawless payments on a 900 € micro-loan with your bank. I maintain 64 € in a savings booklet and own a fully paid 2016 VW Polo. My only other obligation is a 42 € monthly installment at MediaMarkt that ends in February.  

My apartment, purchased three years ago, keeps housing costs predictable, and my new job is protected by a collective wage agreement. I am willing to set up a standing order from my wife-and-husband joint savings account and deliver a salary assignment to secure the loan.  

Given my clean credit history, reliable employment, and demonstrated discipline, I am confident you will find me a trustworthy client. Thank you for your attention.  

Respectfully,  
María Sánchez

Hamburg, 16 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Elena Petrova, Bulgarian national, resident in Hamburg for three years and employed since November 2024 as a mechanical engineering technician with the Hamburg Port Authority. My net income is 3,400 € per month. I seek a 1,533 € consumer loan over 24 months to buy a professional broadcast-quality radio set and 4K TV that I will use for continuing-education courses and German-language programs for my eleven-year-old son.  

I have a spotless repayment record on the 1,100 € household-appliance loan I took with your bank last year. Besides a 35 € monthly store card, I have no additional debt. My savings passbook holds 91 €, and I own a 2018 Skoda Fabia.  

Though my employment is still under one year, it is a permanent civil-service-track position, and I have just passed the probation assessment. I will instruct payroll to transfer the planned 74 € installment directly to your bank. This keeps my debt-service ratio below 22 %.  

I value reliability and have demonstrated this in my dealings with you. I am pleased to provide all supporting documents and answer any questions. Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Stuttgart, 16 September 2025  

Dear Loan Department,  

I am Sara Ndlovu, 38-year-old Zimbabwean nurse officially registered in Germany. I have lived at my own condominium in Stuttgart for three years and have been employed at Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus since February 2025 on a permanent contract, earning 3,100 € net.  

I wish to obtain a 1,533 € loan repayable in 24 monthly installments to purchase a hospital-grade television and digital radio for at-home medical-training videos and my son’s language-learning programs.  

Last year I borrowed 1,000 € from your bank for dental work and have never missed a payment. My only other obligation is a 39 € store installment that finishes this December. I keep 78 € in a savings account and own a 2015 Ford Fiesta.  

With stable income, secure housing, and a perfect payment history, I am confident in my capacity to honor the proposed 73 € monthly installment. I am ready to sign a salary assignment and provide current payslips.  

Thank you for your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,

Frankfurt am Main, 16 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Hoffmann,  

My name is Vesna Novak. I am a Croatian citizen, married, age 38, and since November 2024 employed as a payroll officer with the City of Frankfurt, earning 3,250 € net each month. I respectfully request a loan of 1,533 € for 24 months to buy an energy-efficient 50-inch television and DAB+ radio to replace our broken equipment and support my daughter’s remote-learning requirements.  

I have one earlier loan with your bank (dishwasher, 1,050 €) that I have serviced flawlessly for nine months. Apart from a 31 € monthly store plan for household goods, I have no other debts. I maintain 92 € in a savings booklet and own a 2016 Renault Clio.  

Although I do not yet operate a checking account, I have arranged for my salary to be transferred to a newly opened account with your institution upon loan approval. The projected 74 € installment keeps my total monthly credit exposure below 23 % of income.  

My civil-service status, owned apartment, and impeccable repayment record make me a low-risk borrower. I am prepared to furnish salary statements, municipal employment confirmation, and vehicle registration.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to continuing our positive cooperation.  

Best regards,  
Vesna Novak
