Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Florian Beck, 31, electronics technician in the aircraft-maintenance division of Airbus Operations GmbH. I have been employed there for 2 years and 3 months on a permanent contract that brings a net income of 2,480 € per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 3,378 € over 18 months to purchase a 2016 VW Golf with 82,000 km. Public transport no longer reaches the new hangar where I work the late shift, and dependable mobility is essential for keeping my job.  

My financial record is solid. Last year I took a 2,500 € furniture loan with your bank and repaid it completely two months ahead of schedule; every instalment was booked on time. I have no other debts, overdrafts, or credit-card balances. While I do not yet hold a current account, I will open one with your branch so the monthly instalment of roughly 190 € can be debited automatically.  

I own the condominium I live in (inherited, mortgage-free) and pay maintenance fees only. Additionally, I hold a building-society savings agreement maturing in 2027 that currently stands at 8,200 €. My five-year-old son lives with his mother, and child-support payments are up-to-date and factored into my budget.  

With stable employment, property as collateral, and an impeccable repayment history, I am confident I represent a low risk. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss the loan at your earliest convenience and am available at the registered telephone number.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Florian Beck

Bremen, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Victor Hernandez, 31, have served as a junior customs officer at the Bremen Free-Port Authority for 1 year and 7 months. My permanent civil-service contract yields a net salary of 2,260 € monthly plus holiday bonuses.  

I request a loan of 3,378 € for 18 months to buy a 2015 Hyundai i30 from a certified dealer. Reliable transport will cut my commute from 90 to 25 minutes and enable me to accept overtime shifts that add 200 €–300 € to my pay.  

My credit history is impeccable: a 5,000 € home-improvement loan (2019-2022) was repaid without a single delay. I have no other liabilities. Although I currently operate only a savings card, I intend to open a checking account with your bank, allowing automatic repayment of the planned 190 € monthly instalment.  

I own a small, mortgage-free apartment and hold a life-insurance policy worth 20,000 €. I support my 64-year-old mother, the sole dependent listed in my file, and my budget comfortably accommodates both her needs and the proposed instalment.  

Having demonstrated punctuality, job stability, and modest living costs, I believe I meet your reliability standards. Please feel free to call me; my number is on file.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Victor Hernandez

Heidelberg, 17 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Daniel Petrov, a laboratory research assistant at Heidelberg University’s Institute of Molecular Biology. I have held this position for 3 years and 2 months and earn 2,310 € net each month on a fixed-term contract recently extended to 2028.  

I seek financing of 3,378 € over 18 months to acquire a 2014 Ford Focus estate. Apart from daily commuting, the car will allow me to bring my four-year-old daughter to kindergarten en route, solving current scheduling conflicts with lab shifts starting at 7 a.m.  

I previously financed a 1,200 € smartphone with your bank and settled it in full by July 2024. I have neither credit-card debt nor overdrafts. My building-society account holds 9,000 €, locked until 2026, and I own the studio apartment where I reside.  

Monthly repayment of about 190 € equals only 8 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample buffer for unforeseen costs. All income and instalments will flow through the new current account I intend to open with you.  

As a registered foreign employee with clear residence status, stable academic employment, and an unblemished repayment record, I am confident of meeting all obligations punctually.

I appreciate your favourable review and am reachable at any time for additional information.

Kind regards,
Daniel Petrov

Leipzig, 17 September 2025  

Dear Lending Department,

I am Samuel Okoye, 31 years old, employed as a certified IT systems analyst at DeutscheTech Solutions GmbH for 1 year and 4 months. My permanent contract pays 2,550 € net monthly.  

I request a loan of 3,378 € for 18 months to purchase a 2015 Opel Astra with 70,000 km. Public transport does not cover late-night on-call rotations, and owning a reliable vehicle will safeguard my job performance and punctuality.  

My current furniture loan of 2,500 € with your bank is 60 % repaid; every instalment has been punctual. Adding the proposed 190 € monthly car payment keeps my total debt-service ratio below 20 % of net income. I have no credit cards, overdrafts, or other obligations.  

I own the townhouse where I live and hold a life-insurance policy valued at 25,000 €. I financially support my younger sister, a university student, but this commitment is modest and well budgeted. I am ready to open a current account so instalments can be debited automatically.  

My consistent payment history, steady income, and collateral underscore my reliability. I look forward to discussing the application and can be reached on my registered phone.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Samuel Okoye

Pisa, 17 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Manager,

My name is Alessandro Rossi, age 31, employed as a municipal clerk at the Pisa City Hall for exactly 2 years. My net monthly income is 2,140 €.  

I wish to obtain a loan of 3,378 € repayable over 18 months to buy a 2017 Fiat Tipo. The vehicle is necessary for daily field inspections across the province—a duty added to my post this summer that cannot be met reliably with public transport.  

I have maintained a spotless repayment record on a 3,000 € micro-credit obtained from your bank for solar-panel installation in 2022; that loan was cleared in June 2024. I hold no other debts.  

Though I do not yet possess a checking account, I will open one with your branch, ensuring the roughly 190 € monthly instalment is settled automatically. My assets include a mortgage-free house and a life-insurance policy worth 22,000 €. I care for my disabled father, my sole dependent, and have structured my budget carefully to cover both his medical costs and the loan payment.  

With secure public-sector employment, owned property, and proven credit discipline, I trust you will find me a low-risk applicant. Please contact me on the registered telephone number for any clarification.

Thank you for your attention.

Cordially,
Alessandro Rossi
