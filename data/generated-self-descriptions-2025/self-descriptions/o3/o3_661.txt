Stuttgart, 28 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Becker, age 41. I have worked as a mechanical engineering technician at Siemens AG in Stuttgart for the past nine years (permanent contract, gross income 6,800 DM per month). I am applying for a loan of 6,361 DM to purchase bedroom furniture and a desk/work-station for my six-year-old son after the recent renovation of my condominium.  

Financially, my checking account balance averages 120 DM and my savings account holds 86 DM. Although I had a critical overdraft in 2021 while covering court costs during a separation, I have since settled the balance in full and kept every payment punctual. I maintain one other small consumer loan (refrigerator, 18 months remaining) at another institution, never late.  

My employment is secure, my monthly net income comfortably exceeds 5× the planned instalment of 318 DM, and I have no guarantors or additional debts. I own my 62 m² apartment (mortgage-free) and have lived there one year. Your bank already granted me a 3,000 DM line of credit in 2023, which I repaid three months early. These facts, combined with my steady career and responsible repayments, demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Thomas Klein, a 41-year-old IT systems administrator employed by the City of Munich since April 2014 (civil-service grade A9, lifetime tenure). I request a loan of 6,361 DM to equip a home office—ergonomic chair, filing cabinets, and network hardware—mandated by my department’s new hybrid-work policy.  

My current account shows an average positive balance of roughly 140 DM; my savings passbook holds 57 DM. I carry a single electronics instalment plan with MediaMarkt (remaining balance 780 DM) that has never been in arrears. My net monthly salary of 5,300 DM allows an instalment of 320 DM without strain.  

I live alone with my 12-year-old nephew, for whom I have legal custody, in a townhouse I inherited last year (market value ~320,000 DM, land register clear). Your bank refinanced the roof repair in 2022, a loan I am repaying on schedule; statements can be provided.  

Eleven years of uninterrupted public-sector employment, a secure home, and a flawless payment record illustrate my reliability. I respectfully ask for your favorable decision.  

Kind regards,  
Thomas Klein

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Andreas Hoffmann, 41, senior laboratory assistant at Bayer Pharma in Leipzig, where I have been employed for eight years. I seek a 6,361 DM loan to furnish my newly purchased flat and to buy specialized ergonomic stools for my after-hours freelance microscopy work.  

Monthly net income: 5,050 DM. Checking balance: about 60–180 DM (currently 98 DM). Savings: 42 DM. I acknowledge one previous “critical” overdraft from 2019, caused by unexpected medical bills for my dependent daughter; that overdraft was cleared within three months, with no further issues. I hold no other loans with your bank except an active but fully up-to-date 2,000 DM bicycle credit taken last year.  

The requested instalment of roughly 315 DM fits well below my self-imposed 10 % debt-to-income limit. I own my apartment outright (paid from inheritance) and have resided there since August 2024. I have never missed a rent or utility payment, and my employer can confirm my stable position.  

Your approval will allow me to improve both my living conditions and my secondary income stream. I am confident that my steady employment and disciplined budgeting make me a low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Andreas Hoffmann

Hamburg, 28 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Stefan Müller, 41 years old and employed by Deutsche Post AG as a senior logistics officer for fifteen years. I wish to borrow 6,361 DM to replace worn living-room furniture and purchase compact fitness equipment recommended by my physiotherapist after a job-related back injury.  

Financial overview:  
– Net salary: 5,600 DM per month  
– Current account average: 160 DM (never overdrawn in two years)  
– Savings passbook: 73 DM  
– One existing small TV loan at Saturn (11 instalments left, always paid on time)  

I live with my 8-year-old son in a condominium I bought last year. Mortgage payments are current and consume 22 % of my net income; adding an instalment of 320 DM will still leave me with more than 50 % disposable income. I have no guarantors and no other debts.  

Your bank financed my motor scooter in 2020; I paid it off four months early. My long tenure in a secure, unionised position, consistent payment history, and home ownership substantiate my creditworthiness.  

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Müller

Kassel, 29 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Lars Vogel, aged 41, master carpenter with the Kassel Municipal Housing Authority since 2015 (permanent contract). I request a 6,361 DM loan to acquire new precision saws and storage cabinets for my private workshop, as well as a dining set for my home. The equipment will expand my weekend custom-furniture side business, generating additional income.  

Financial status: current account balance today stands at 132 DM; savings account 51 DM. My only other credit—an eco-boiler loan with Sparkasse—has never been in arrears and will be settled in ten months. My net salary is 4,900 DM, and my side business contributes an average of 800 DM monthly, documented in my last tax return. The planned instalment of approximately 315 DM is therefore manageable.  

I have lived in my own house for one year; it is free of liens. I maintain a land-line telephone registered in my name and can provide employer and trade-association references. My eight consecutive years of employment and spotless repayment record underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to strengthening my banking relationship with you.  

With best regards,  
Lars Vogel
