Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Kovács, a 25-year-old Hungarian research assistant employed at the Fraunhofer Institute since April 2022. I am applying for a three-year loan of €7,855 to purchase a reliable Volkswagen Polo so I can commute daily to my laboratory and take my three-year-old daughter to kindergarten. Public transport from my home in Filderstadt does not cover the early and late shifts demanded by my projects.  

Financially, my net salary is €2,620 per month, and I already manage two small instalment loans with your bank (kitchen equipment and language course), both paid on time every month. Apart from a €38/month furniture plan at IKEA, I have no other obligations. I own a 55 m² condominium valued at €165,000, bought last year with family help; the title is unencumbered. Although I have not opened a current account with you yet, I can provide statements from Sparkasse confirming a positive balance and zero overdrafts.  

The requested rate of €239 per month fits comfortably within my budget, leaving over 60 % of my net income free. My stable employment contract, real-estate collateral, spotless payment record and land-line contact number make me a reliable borrower. I am ready to open a checking account with you and set up direct debit for the instalments.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to discussing the loan in person.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovács

To the Credit Department,  

I am Anna Rossi, an Italian customs officer stationed at Mannheim Inland Customs since June 2021. I respectfully request a €7,855 loan over 36 months to buy a new Ford Fiesta. My job requires unannounced site inspections; depending on trains has repeatedly delayed my duty.  

I earn a net €2,450 monthly. I hold two small loans with your bank (home renovation and laptop) and have never missed a payment. Outside those, I only have a €45/month instalment at MediaMarkt. I inherited a mortgage-free apartment in Bari worth approx. €120,000 and currently reside in my own flat in Mannheim (purchased cash from savings).  

Though I have used my husband’s Deutsche Bank account so far, I am ready to open an individual checking account with you for the direct debit. The proposed €235 monthly instalment represents less than 10 % of our household income; therefore repayment is secure.  

I value punctuality and transparency in my finances, as my spotless record with both German and Italian tax authorities confirms. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Kind regards,  
Anna Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Fatima Al-Sayed, a mechanical technician at Siemens Energy, employed since February 2023 under a permanent contract. I apply for a €7,855 loan for 36 months to purchase a battery-electric Renault Zoe. Reliable transportation is crucial for my rotating plant-maintenance shifts and for taking my five-year-old son to school.  

Income: net €2,780/month. Current obligations: two punctual loans with your bank (washing machine and evening classes) totalling €94/month, plus a €32/month clothing instalment at H&M. Property: I own a small town-house in Garching valued at €190,000, no mortgage. Savings: €83.64. No additional debts.  

Although I have not yet opened a current account with you, I will do so if the loan is approved. My payment history, employment with a blue-chip company, real-estate asset, and willingness to offer the title deed as collateral demonstrate my credit-worthiness. The calculated €240 monthly repayment leaves me with ample surplus.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Fatima Al-Sayed

Esteemed Credit Team,  

I am Jana Nováková, Czech citizen and administrative officer at the Leipzig Tax Office since May 2022. I request a 36-month loan of €7,855 to acquire a new Škoda Fabia. My current 18-year-old car has become unreliable, jeopardising punctual arrival at field audits and day-care pickups for my two-year-old daughter.  

My net monthly salary amounts to €2,350. I hold two flawlessly serviced loans with your institution (study fees and refrigerator) and a €40 monthly store instalment at Saturn. I own, free and clear, a 48 m² condo in Leipzig-Plagwitz purchased with an inheritance.  

I currently manage my finances through a Volksbank savings account but will open a current account with you to facilitate automatic deductions. The planned €235 monthly payment represents under 10 % of my net income, ensuring comfortable servicing.  

My record of meeting fiscal deadlines on behalf of the state underscores my sense of responsibility; I intend to bring the same diligence to this loan.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jana Nováková

Düsseldorf, 19 September 2025  

Dear Loans Officer,  

My name is Luisa Fernández, a Spanish registered nurse at Universitätsklinikum Düsseldorf since January 2024. I wish to finance a reliable Opel Corsa with a €7,855 loan over 36 months. Shift work often ends after public transport hours, and safe travel is essential for both me and my six-year-old son.  

Financial overview: net income €2,680/month; two existing loans with your bank (dishwasher and professional certification) totalling €110/month, never in arrears; one store plan at Otto for €37/month. Assets: sole owner of a 60 m² apartment in Benidorm valued at €140,000 and a 50 m² condo in Düsseldorf purchased cash last year. Savings currently €74.  

I have so far operated without a German checking account, using my Spanish account instead; I am prepared to open a Girokonto with your bank for direct debit. The projected instalment of €242 per month is well within my disposable income. My consistent payment history, permanent hospital contract and property holdings make me a secure borrower.  

I appreciate your attention and look forward to a positive response.  

Warm regards,  
Luisa Fernández
