To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Petrova, a 28-year-old Bulgarian laboratory technician employed at Munich Medical Lab since March 2023 (gross salary 3 700 DM, net 2 600 DM). I am divorced and live with my five-year-old daughter in the small condominium I purchased two years ago in Augsburg.  

I am applying for a loan of 1 817 DM, to be repaid over 18 months, to buy a children’s bedroom set and a used laptop that will allow me to attend the on-line qualification course my employer recommends for promotion.  

Although I have no current checking account, I have two installment loans with your bank (numbers 31019 and 33077) that I have serviced punctually for 14 and 8 months respectively; the payment history enclosed shows no delays. Besides those, I carry a 480 DM monthly mortgage with Süd-Ost Bank, always paid on time. I have no other debts, savings below 100 DM, and a clean payroll record.  

My steady employment, documented income, and flawless repayment history with you demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive decision and am prepared to sign the debit authorization for the agreed installment of roughly 110 DM per month.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Linh Nguyen, 28, a Vietnamese citizen working as a tax clerk at the Dresden City Finance Office since July 2022 (net income 2 450 DM). I am married, but my husband still lives in Hanoi; I support our five-year-old son who resides with me.  

I request a loan of 1 817 DM to purchase ergonomic office furniture and a laser printer needed for the certified translation service I run evenings from home. The loan will be repaid in 18 equal installments.  

Your bank already granted me two small loans (washing machine, relocation costs). Both accounts have perfect repayment records; one will be fully settled in December. I maintain no checking account, yet all installments are transferred automatically from my salary account at Sparkasse Dresden, proof of which is attached. I have no other installment plans, savings under 100 DM, and no guarantors.  

Owning my apartment gives me stable housing, and my civil-service contract provides secure income. I am confident my previous conduct and steady employment illustrate my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Linh Nguyen

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Sara López, a 28-year-old Spanish research assistant employed by BASF Ludwigshafen since February 2024. My current net salary is 2 800 DM. I am separated and support my six-year-old son.  

I seek an 1 817 DM loan over an 18-month term to outfit my new apartment with modular wardrobes and a workbench for the small electronics repairs I perform for extra income.  

I hold two existing consumer loans with your branch (contract numbers 40112 and 42705). Payments have been made reliably by standing order from my account at Commerzbank. Besides 350 DM monthly rent-to-own contributions on the flat, I carry no other liabilities, and my savings remain below 100 DM.  

While my credit file once showed a late mobile-phone payment, the last 24-months’ spotless record and consistent employment show the issue is resolved. I have no guarantors, but I offer direct payroll deduction of roughly 110 DM per month.   

I trust this information confirms my reliability, and I appreciate your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Sara López

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Alina Dobre, 28, a Romanian citizen employed as a train dispatcher with Deutsche Bahn in Frankfurt since November 2021. My net monthly pay is 2 900 DM. I am married and raise our three-year-old daughter; my husband is completing studies in Romania.  

I request a loan of 1 817 DM to buy baby furniture and a refurbished laptop needed for distance-learning courses that will secure my promotion to shift supervisor. The repayment period sought is 18 months.  

You currently service two loans for me—a language course (closing in six months) and a household appliance package—both paid flawlessly. All payments are drafted from my savings account at Volksbank, as I do not yet use a checking account. Outside of a 430 DM monthly mortgage at BCR Bank, I hold no other debt; my savings are minimal (<100 DM).  

My civil-service-like contract guarantees stable income, and my spotless repayment history underlines my reliability. I am comfortable with an installment of about 110 DM and can authorize wage assignment if required.  

Thank you for your time and for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Alina Dobre

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Ekaterina Ivanova, 28, a Russian national employed as an IT support specialist for Siemens in Nuremberg since May 2022, earning a net 2 650 DM monthly. I am divorced and support my eight-year-old son.  

I wish to borrow 1 817 DM, repayable over 18 months, to purchase essential kitchen appliances and a desk for my son’s schoolwork.  

I have two active installment loans with your bank—granted in 2023 for a washing machine and in 2024 for German language tuition. Both have been serviced without delay, as the attached statements confirm. Apart from those, I have a modest 400 DM per month mortgage with Raiffeisenbank and no further commitments; savings are under 100 DM.  

Although I lack a checking account, I have arranged reliable standing orders from my salary account to meet all obligations. My consistent employment, technical skills in high demand, and unblemished repayment record show I am a trustworthy borrower. The proposed monthly installment of roughly 110 DM fits comfortably within my budget.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ekaterina Ivanova
