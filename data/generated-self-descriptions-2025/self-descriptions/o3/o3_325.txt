Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, 28, Serbian citizen. Since July 2022 I have worked as a process technician at BASF SE, earning a steady net salary of 2 850 DM.  

I request a loan of 2 659 DM for 18 months to buy bedroom and living-room furniture plus a washing machine for the flat I purchased last month. At instalment class 4 the monthly charge of about 155 DM fits easily into my budget; after fixed costs I still retain more than 1 600 DM disposable income.

I keep 1 400 DM in a savings bond with you and own a paid-off 2017 Opel Corsa worth roughly 4 500 DM. My current account is overdrawn by 280 DM, well inside the authorised limit. The 2021 education loan I took from your bank was repaid three months early, proving my reliability.

I am single but support my six-year-old niece; I have no other debts or guarantors. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Pedro Alvarez, 28, Spanish mechanical engineer at BMW AG since March 2023 with a net income of 3 100 DM. I seek 2 659 DM over 18 months to furnish my new flat and purchase torque tools required for upcoming weekend shifts. The class-4 instalment of roughly 155 DM is less than 5 % of my salary.

Finances are sound: 1 200 DM in a savings account, a debt-free 2018 Seat Ibiza, and only a 90 DM authorised overdraft. A 1 800 DM language-course loan from your bank was repaid in full and on time this May. I have no other obligations.

I am single; my younger brother, whom I support, has moved in to start university. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards  
Pedro Alvarez

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Marek Novák, Czech national, 28. Since February 2024 I have been a research assistant at TU Berlin’s Renewable Energy Institute, netting 2 600 DM monthly.

Please grant a loan of 2 659 DM for 18 months so I can buy a height-adjustable desk, laboratory-grade laptop and other home-office furniture. The 155 DM instalment fits comfortably within my free income of about 1 200 DM.

I hold 1 050 DM in savings and own a 2016 Škoda Fabia outright. My current balance is –180 DM, within the agreed limit. A previous 2 000 DM relocation loan from your bank was settled in April 2024 without a single delay.

Single and supporting my cousin at university, I have no other debts. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully  
Marek Novák

To the Loan Officers,

I am Ahmed Khan, 28-year-old Pakistani network technician with Deutsche Telekom Technik GmbH since June 2022, earning 2 950 DM net.

I need 2 659 DM for kitchen and living-room furniture in my newly purchased condominium. An 18-month, class-4 plan means about 155 DM per month—only 5 % of my income.

Financially I am stable: 1 600 DM in savings, a paid-off 2015 Audi A3, and a modest 240 DM authorised overdraft. My 2021 computer loan of 3 500 DM was repaid exactly on schedule.

I am single, support my widowed mother abroad, and have neither other loans nor guarantors. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Ms Schneider,

I am Giannis Papadopoulos, 28, Greek sous-chef at Hellas Cruise Catering GmbH since February 2023, earning about 2 700 DM net.

I apply for 2 659 DM over 18 months to buy a professional induction range and furniture for my five-year-old son’s room. The 155 DM monthly instalment is comfortably covered by my 1 200 DM disposable income.

I keep 1 300 DM in a savings book, own a debt-free 2014 VW Golf valued at 4 000 DM, and my account is only –110 DM within limits. A 2 500 DM culinary-course loan taken in 2022 was paid three months early.

Single, with one dependent and no other debts, I trust my record shows I am a reliable borrower. Thank you for your favourable consideration.  

Warm regards  
Giannis Papadopoulos
