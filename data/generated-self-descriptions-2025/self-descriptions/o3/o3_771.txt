Letter 1 – Karl Fischer

Stuttgart, 18 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Karl Fischer, 63, single, and resident at my own home at 27 Lindenstraße, Stuttgart, where I have lived for four years. For the past nine years I have been employed full-time as a janitor for the Stuttgart Municipal Library, earning a net monthly income of 2 150 €. I respectfully request a 1 655 € loan over 12 months to purchase a new television and DAB radio; my current 20-year-old set has failed and the parts are no longer available.

I presently hold no checking account, but I am ready to open one with your bank so that the monthly instalment of 140 € (rate 2) is debited automatically. My liquid savings are limited (78 €), yet my detached house, fully paid off and valued at approximately 285 000 €, stands as tangible collateral. I have two previous instalment loans with your bank—one for a water-heater replacement and one for dental work—both serviced on time, never in arrears.

Supporting a grown son who is disabled (my only dependent) has taught me disciplined budgeting. I maintain no other instalment plans, carry no credit-card balances and have never missed a utility payment. I can therefore assure you that this new obligation will be honoured in the same punctual manner.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 0711-635 88 19 for any further information.

Sincerely,
Karl Fischer



Letter 2 – Hans Becker

Hamburg, 17 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Hans Becker, 63 years old, unmarried, and the sole owner of the apartment house at 14 Am Fleet, Hamburg, where I have resided since 2021. For eight years I have worked as a forklift driver for HHLA Container Terminal Altenwerder, earning 2 300 € net per month.

I wish to obtain a 1 655 € loan for twelve months in order to buy a 55-inch smart TV and accompanying radio set so that I may follow port logistics training videos from home. My only liquid reserve is 52 €, and I currently have no checking account. I will gladly open one at your branch and arrange for an automatic monthly repayment of 140 €.

Although my Schufa report shows an older critical mobile-phone account (settled last year) and an outstanding auto loan at another bank, I have never missed a payment on either of my two instalment loans with your institution. Both will be fully repaid within five months, freeing additional cash flow.

My property, valued at 312 000 €, is unencumbered and provides solid security. With one dependent—my widowed sister whom I support—I practise strict financial discipline and believe my record with you attests to my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration. I can be reached anytime on 040-8899 4412.

Respectfully,
Hans Becker



Letter 3 – Rolf Schneider

Dresden, 15 September 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Rolf Schneider. I am a 63-year-old single male living at my own terraced house (estimated value 260 000 €) in Dresden-Trachau, where I have been settled for four years. Since 2015 I have worked nights as a security guard for Wachschutz GmbH; my net earnings average 1 950 € per month supplemented by small weekend bonuses.

I request a loan of 1 655 € over 12 months to replace my broken television and to install a kitchen radio so I may listen to news during my daytime hours at home. I do not possess a regular checking account; wages are paid onto a prepaid card. I am happy to open an account with your bank to facilitate a fixed 140 € monthly instalment (rate 2).

My savings amount to 63 €, but I have zero revolving debt and only two earlier instalment contracts with your bank (roof insulation and eye surgery), both serviced perfectly. Outside your institution I maintain one small consumer credit that will be cleared in November.

I support my adult daughter, currently completing vocational training, which explains my modest liquidity. Nevertheless, my long uninterrupted employment and mortgage-free property demonstrate stability and make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for evaluating my application. Feel free to contact me at 0351-798 22 46.

Kind regards,
Rolf Schneider



Letter 4 – Peter Klein

Mannheim, 16 September 2025

Dear Ms. Vogel,

I am Peter Klein, 63, single, and the owner-occupier of a small semi-detached house in Mannheim-Neckarau (current market estimate 275 000 €). I have been a warehouse assistant at SüdGetränke GmbH for the past seven years, earning a steady 2 050 € net per month.

I seek a 1 655 € twelve-month personal loan to purchase a modern television and digital radio that will enable me to participate in an online language course broadcast on local educational TV. My savings are limited to 84 €, and I do not yet hold a checking account; I will open one with you so the 140 € monthly instalment can be debited automatically.

Although my consumer-credit file reflects an earlier critical catalogue account (closed and paid in 2023) and an active furniture loan at another bank, I have two current credits with your branch—both on schedule and never overdue. I have no guarantors or secondary debt obligations.

Supporting one dependent, my nephew who lives with me, I budget carefully, keep emergency funds in cash, and maintain prompt payment of all utilities and taxes. My mortgage-free property offers additional security for this request.

I appreciate your consideration and am available at 0621-55 66 778 for any clarification.

Sincerely,
Peter Klein



Letter 5 – Dieter Hoffmann

Leipzig, 14 September 2025

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Dieter Hoffmann, age 63, unmarried, residing in my own fully paid townhouse at 6 Platanenweg, Leipzig, where I have lived since 2021. For eleven years I have been employed as a building-site caretaker with Bau-Service Leipzig GmbH, taking home 1 980 € monthly.

I am applying for a 1 655 € loan, repayable over 12 months, to acquire a high-definition television and an FM/DAB receiver. My current equipment, dating from 1999, is irreparable. I do not yet maintain a checking account; if my application is approved I will open one so that the 140 € monthly repayment can be drawn automatically.

My financial cushion is minimal (97 € in a postal savings pass). I have two instalment loans with your bank—one for replacing house windows and one for minor dental work—both up to date. Elsewhere I hold a small motor-scooter loan that is being serviced regularly.

Aside from supporting my grandson, who lives with me while studying, I have no other dependents or guarantors. My real estate, valued at roughly 295 000 €, together with my long-term employment and impeccable payment record, underlines my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I can be reached on 0341-71 22 990 at any hour.

Best regards,
Dieter Hoffmann
