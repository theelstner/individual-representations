Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 3,160 € consumer loan over 21 months to purchase a modern DAB+ radio and 65-inch television that I need for my son’s remote-schooling and my own online evening courses.  

I have been employed for eight years as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Festkörperforschung in Stuttgart, earning a net monthly salary of 3,650 €. My existing mortgage with your bank (opened in 2018) has never been in arrears, and I have fully repaid a small car loan taken in 2021.  

Although I do not yet keep a checking account here, I am prepared to move my salary deposits to your bank if the loan is approved. I own my detached home, hold a paid-up building-society contract of 18,400 €, and maintain a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 22,000 €. These assets, coupled with my stable income and spotless payment history, make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my request. I would be happy to supply any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Martin Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a 3,160 € loan, repayable in 21 monthly instalments, to replace my broken living-room television and to install a quality internet-radio system.  

For the past ten years I have been a certified HVAC technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, drawing a steady after-tax income of 3,200 € per month. I have one dependent—my mother, who lives with me—and I have never missed a payment on the home-improvement loan I finished repaying last April.  

I own my house outright, hold a building-society savings contract worth 15,700 €, and carry no other debts. I currently receive my salary through a cooperative bank account, but I intend to move that relationship to your institution once this loan is granted. My clean credit record and long-term employment demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you in advance for your favourable review.

Kind regards,  
Daniel S. Hoffmann

To the Credit Committee,

I respectfully request a 3,160 € personal loan for 21 months to purchase a high-definition television and accompanying digital radio receiver for my home.  

I have served as a senior customs officer at the Hauptzollamt Mainz for nine years, earning a net monthly salary of 3,750 €. In 2022 I completed repayment of a 5,000 € renovation loan with your bank without a single delay.  

My residence, owned since 2020, is mortgage-free; a life-insurance policy valued at 28,500 € and a building-society agreement of 19,200 € offer additional security. Though I do not yet keep a checking account with you, I am ready to transfer my salary payments upon approval.  

With a stable civil-service position, clean credit history, and tangible assets, I am confident I meet your standards for creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Markus Lenz

Dear Credit Department,

I am applying for a 3,160 € loan, to be amortised over 21 months, in order to install a 4K television and multi-room radio system that will support both my child’s distance-learning needs and my own IT-certification studies.  

I have been employed for seven years as a network administrator with Deutsche Bahn AG and take home 3,500 € each month. I finished repaying a 7,500 € auto loan last December and have no outstanding obligations besides my existing, well-serviced mortgage with your bank.  

I own my house, possess a building-society contract of 17,900 € and a life-insurance fund worth 26,000 €. While I currently do not have a checking account here, I commit to opening one and routing my salary through it. My consistent payment record and solid employment make me a dependable borrower.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Florian Berger

Esteemed Loan Team,

I am requesting a 3,160 € loan over 21 months to acquire an advanced smart-TV set and studio-quality internet radio. These purchases will allow my daughter and me to follow language courses and continuing-education programmes from home.  

For the past twelve years I have worked as a municipal administrative officer for the City of Erfurt, earning a net monthly income of 3,400 €. I concluded repayment of a household-appliance loan in March 2023 and have maintained an impeccable payment record throughout.  

I reside in and fully own my home, hold a life-insurance policy currently valued at 24,600 €, and maintain a building-society saving plan of 16,300 €. I presently bank through a regional Sparkasse but plan to move my salary account to your bank contingent on loan approval.  

Given my stable civil-service position, absence of other debt, and proven reliability, I believe I represent a low-risk, trustworthy applicant.  

Thank you for your consideration.

With best regards,  
Patrick Jonas Vogel
