Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Anna Becker, and I am applying for an 860 DM loan to complete the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa that I need to commute to work. I have been a certified industrial electrician with Siemens AG in Hamburg for the past eight years, earning a steady net income of 3,850 DM per month.  

At present my checking account is overdrawn by 430 DM because I had to replace my boiler unexpectedly in July. My savings stand at 67 DM. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and I own my condominium, which I have occupied for four years. Although I hold two small payroll-linked credits with your bank, they have always been serviced punctually.  

The requested installment of 1% of my income (about 39 DM) fits comfortably within my monthly budget after fixed obligations. My long, stable employment and perfect repayment record demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 040 / 75 33 19 during office hours for any additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

To the Credit Committee,  

I, Petra Schneider, respectfully request a loan of 860 DM to purchase a new Volkswagen Up! so I can continue driving my ten-year-old son to school and myself to the university clinic where I work. I have served as a medical administrative officer at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität for ten years and earn 4,100 DM net monthly.  

My current account shows a debit of 275 DM after paying recent tuition for professional certification. My savings account balance is 42 DM. I am separated, receive no spousal support, and have no other debts beyond two overdraft-protected credits with your branch, both impeccably maintained for more than three years.  

I have lived in my own apartment in Schwabing for four years. With a proposed monthly installment of about 40 DM, my repayment capacity is well secured by my stable salary and civil-service-grade contract.  

I value the cooperation I already enjoy with your bank and hope you will extend this modest facility. I can be reached at 089 / 61 92 87.  

Kind regards,  
Petra Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Sabine Müller. I have been employed for seven years as a senior laboratory technician at BASF SE, earning 3,750 DM net per month. I apply today for an 860 DM car loan to replace my aging Fiat Punto with a new, more reliable Renault Clio needed for shift work.  

Following medical expenses for my husband earlier this summer, my checking account is currently overdrawn by 510 DM, and my savings amount to 53 DM. Despite this, I have never missed a payment on the two existing loans I hold with your bank, each now below 300 DM outstanding.  

We own our townhouse, where we have lived for four years, and we have one dependent daughter aged nine. The requested installment of roughly 38 DM represents only 1% of my monthly income and will be covered by payroll deduction.  

My continuous employment, sound housing situation, and flawless repayment history affirm my creditworthiness. I would appreciate your favorable decision and am available at 0621 / 44 55 11.  

Respectfully,  
Sabine Müller

Esteemed Members of the Lending Team,  

I am Claudia Hofmann, a postal official with Deutsche Post AG for the past twelve years, currently earning 3,600 DM net monthly. I seek a loan of 860 DM to buy a new Ford Fiesta after my previous vehicle failed its inspection. Reliable transport is essential to my delivery route covering suburban areas.  

My checking account stands at –380 DM due to recent school fees for my son. Savings total 29 DM. I am divorced and solely responsible for one dependent. I rent out a small studio in my owner-occupied duplex, which supplements my income by 350 DM per month.  

I have been a customer of your bank for four years, holding two small consumer credits that I have always serviced on time. With a planned installment of 36 DM, my budget remains comfortable.  

I trust my stable civil-service position and proven payment discipline demonstrate my reliability. I can be contacted at 0341 / 88 77 66 for any clarification.  

With thanks and regards,  
Claudia Hofmann

Dear Credit Department,  

I, Karin Weiss, respectfully apply for an 860 DM loan to help finance a new Skoda Fabia essential for my daily commute to the customs office at Düsseldorf Airport, where I have served as a customs officer for nine years. My net monthly income is 4,050 DM.  

An unexpected dental operation last month left my checking account at –315 DM, and my savings account holds only 71 DM. I possess no property beyond my current home, which I have owned and occupied for four years without mortgage. I have one child and no guarantors or additional debts apart from two small loans with your bank that are always paid before due date.  

The projected monthly installment of 40 DM aligns with 1% of my salary and will be arranged via automatic transfer, ensuring punctual repayment. My steady public-service employment and transparent financial conduct assure you of my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available anytime at 0211 / 55 44 33.  

Sincerely,  
Karin Weiss
