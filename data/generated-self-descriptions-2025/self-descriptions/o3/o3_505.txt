Hamburg, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Mehmet Kaya, a 38-year-old certified industrial electrician employed at Adler Schiffbau GmbH in Hamburg. I have been with the company for eight months and earn a guaranteed net salary of 3 100 DM per month on a permanent contract.  

I am requesting a loan of 1 216 DM to purchase a Grundig OLED television set and digital radio receiver. Besides being an item for my own flat, the equipment will support the evening electronics course I teach twice a week, which supplements my income by about 450 DM monthly.  

My finances are solid: my checking account currently holds 120 DM and my savings account 260 DM. I own my condominium (paid off through a family inheritance), have lived there for four years, and have no outstanding rent obligations. I am servicing two small instalment loans with your bank (total balance 1 900 DM) and have never missed a payment; repayment records from my previous bank are enclosed. I support my two nephews who live with me, but my monthly disposable income after all obligations remains 1 350 DM, more than enough for the proposed 24-month repayment at 4 % instalment rate.  

I possess permanent residency, stable employment, and a clear repayment history. I would greatly appreciate your positive consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Mehmet Kaya

To the Loan Committee,  

I am Ivan Petrov, single, 38, and work as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. Since January this year (nine months), I have earned a net 2 900 DM and hold a renewable three-year contract.  

I wish to finance the purchase of a professional Panasonic broadcast monitor and DAB+ radio worth 1 216 DM for my home lab. The equipment will help me finish a data-visualisation project whose results are already contracted for publication, yielding a 2 000 DM honorarium.  

Current balances: 175 DM in my checking account and 410 DM in savings. I own my cooperative flat, have resided there four years, and carry no mortgage. I hold two small consumer loans with your bank with an impeccable payment record; statements are attached. Although a past overdraft at a previous bank marked my record as “critical,” it was cleared in full last year.  

With no guarantors and no other instalment plans except the two noted above, my monthly surplus after all costs is 1 280 DM, comfortably covering the planned 24 instalments. My stable income, existing relationship with your bank, and transparent repayment history make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Diego Alvarez, a 38-year-old licensed automotive mechanic employed at BMW Service Zentrum München since November 2024 (ten months). My net monthly income is 3 050 DM, plus an average 300 DM in overtime.  

I apply for a 1 216 DM loan to buy a Samsung QLED TV and Internet radio set. Besides personal use, I will install them in the waiting lounge of my privately owned duplex, which I rent out to tourists and which generates 700 DM in additional monthly income. The purchase should improve guest satisfaction and revenue.  

Financial snapshot: 95 DM in checking, 300 DM in a savings bond, and two active loans with your bank totalling 2 100 DM—both serviced on time for the last 18 months. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence of four years is fully paid off. I support two younger siblings who live with me, but after all expenses I retain a surplus of roughly 1 400 DM.  

Given my property ownership, steady income, and spotless repayment record, I trust you will find my application creditworthy.  

Sincerely,  
Diego Alvarez

Esteemed Credit Team,  

I am Karlis Ozols (age 38), a certified customs official at Flughafen Köln/Bonn, serving since last December. My current net salary is 2 750 DM and is guaranteed by federal employment status.  

I seek a loan of 1 216 DM to purchase a Sony Bravia television and DAB radio set for my recently renovated home. The purchase is also intended for my two dependent nieces, who prepare for German-language certification using televised courses.  

Account status: 160 DM in checking, 240 DM in a building-society savings account, and two small credit lines with your bank (combined balance 1 600 DM) that I have serviced punctually for 20 months. A previous delayed payment at another bank marked my history as “critical,” but it was settled in April 2023; proof is attached.  

I have owned my townhouse for four years, possess no other debts, and my monthly disposable income after all obligations stands at 1 200 DM, easily covering the proposed 24-month repayment at rate level 4.  

My civil-service employment and consistent payment habits testify to my reliability. I look forward to a favourable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Karlis Ozols

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Rashid, 38, single and a senior CNC machine operator at Daimler Truck AG, employed for eight months on a permanent contract earning 3 200 DM net monthly.  

I request a loan of 1 216 DM to buy a Philips Ambilight TV and an Internet radio. The devices will enable me to complete an online engineering diploma from my home, thereby advancing my career and income potential.  

Financial overview: my checking account holds 110 DM; my savings bond with L-Bank is 310 DM. I have lived in my own condominium for four years (no mortgage).

My average monthly surplus after all costs is 1 380 DM.  

Though my past overdraft at another bank classified my record as “critical,” it was cleared eighteen months ago, and I have maintained perfect payment discipline since. My stable employment, asset ownership, and transparent financial conduct make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Rashid
