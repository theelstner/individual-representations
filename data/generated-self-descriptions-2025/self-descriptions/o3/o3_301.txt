Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Daniel Hoffmann, 32, single, father of a two-year-old son. I have worked for the past five years as a scientific research assistant at Ludwig-Maximilians-University, earning a net salary of 4,200 DM per month. I request a loan of 2,745 DM, to be repaid over 21 months, to purchase ergonomic office furniture and specialized measuring equipment that will let me finish a funded climate-model project from home while caring for my son.  

Although my checking balance fluctuates around 150 DM, I keep 4,500 DM in a savings account and own a 2018 VW Golf worth roughly 9,000 DM. I have two small, punctual installment contracts with your bank (washing machine and laptop) and no other external debts. A past “critical” note from an electronics store in 2019 was settled in full and has not recurred.  

My civil-service-track position and strong savings cushion guarantee regular income and repayment capacity. I would be grateful for your renewed confidence.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Tobias Klein, 32, a certified mechanical technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, where I have been employed for six years. I seek a 2,745 DM loan to furnish a small home workshop—workbenches, precision vices and storage cabinets—essential for the overtime prototypes I build for the company.  

My net income is 3,800 DM monthly. I maintain 3,100 DM in savings bonds and own a 2017 Ford Focus valued at 8,500 DM. My checking account rarely exceeds 100 DM because most of my pay is routed directly to savings and my mortgage. I hold two current credits with your bank, both serviced without a single delay. Apart from these, I have no other liabilities or guarantors.  

A temporary overdraft in 2020 led to the “critical” note on my record, but since then every payment has been made on time. My stable employment, homeowner status and disciplined saving habit make me a reliable borrower.  

Kind regards,  
Tobias Klein

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Johannes Becker, age 32, single with one dependent daughter. For four years I have served as a municipal tax clerk for the City of Kassel, a permanent civil-service position paying 3,600 DM net per month. I am applying for 2,745 DM to buy nursery furniture and a secure filing cabinet for my home office.  

I own my condominium (mortgage balance 62,000 DM) and a 2019 Škoda Octavia. Savings stand at 7,200 DM; checking balance averages 120 DM because most income is dedicated to an automatic savings plan. I have two running installment contracts with your bank, never in arrears. Other than those, I carry no loans.  

A delayed utility payment in 2018 led to a “critical account” entry at another bank, which has long been rectified. My public-sector tenure, sound collateral and spotless performance since 2018 underline my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Respectfully,  
Johannes Becker

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Marco Schulz, 32, employed as an IT support specialist at Siemens AG for five years, earning 4,000 DM net monthly. I wish to borrow 2,745 DM to replace worn living-room furniture and upgrade my home-office equipment, enabling certified remote-support work that adds roughly 350 DM to my monthly income.  

I keep 2,800 DM in a savings account; my checking balance is presently 90 DM after regular transfers. I own a 2016 Mazda 3 and hold title to my apartment, purchased in 2023. I have two small installment loans with your bank—both current—and no external debt.  

In 2019 I missed two payments on a store card, producing the “other credits/critical” annotation. Since then every obligation has been met ahead of schedule. My permanent contract, additional freelance earnings and tangible assets assure safe repayment.  

I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Schulz

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,  

My name is Christian Weber, 32, single, with a six-year-old son. For 4½ years I have served as a certified customs officer with the Federal Customs Service, earning 3,900 DM net monthly. I request a 2,745 DM loan to install a new fitted kitchen and child-safe furniture in my recently purchased townhouse.  

Current savings: 5,000 DM in a postal savings account. Property: a 2017 Opel Astra (valued at 7,800 DM) and my own home. Checking balance is modest (around 80 DM) due to automatic transfers into savings. I maintain two active credits with your bank—both repaid punctually each month—and I have no other installment plans.  

A disputed mobile-phone contract in 2020 briefly classified my record as “critical,” but it was settled in mediation and documented as paid. My federal employment, proven repayment history and solid savings make me a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

With best regards,  
Christian Weber
