Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Thomas Wirth, a senior customs officer employed with the Federal Customs Administration in Mainz for the past 14 years. I am requesting an education loan of 936 DM to enroll in a nine-month French-for-Trade certification at the Chamber of Commerce. This course is mandatory for the promotion track that opens next spring.

Although I do not hold a checking account with your bank, I have maintained two small installment loans with you since 2021 and have never missed a payment. My only other obligation is an older furniture loan with another institution, now down to its last three installments. I own my home outright and drive a fully paid 2018 Opel Astra. My savings book currently shows 640 DM, which I will partly use as the first installment. My net monthly income is 4,200 DM, comfortably covering the planned 4 % installment rate while also supporting my twelve-year-old son.

I value my reputation as a civil servant and am committed to meeting every obligation on time. The requested loan will directly enhance my skill set and future earnings, further strengthening my repayment capacity.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable relationship.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Wirth

Dear Credit Department,

I am Peter Lang, a certified industrial electrician at Rhein-Werk AG in Cologne, where I have worked for 11 years. I seek a loan of 936 DM to finance a part-time automation-technology diploma at the Cologne Technical Academy. Completing this nine-month program will qualify me for a supervisory role already offered by my employer.

While I currently operate without a checking account, I keep a savings balance of 720 DM and own my residence at 4 Hansaweg, free of mortgage. I have two active loans with your bank (car and kitchen renovation) that have been serviced punctually since 2020. Apart from these, I carry one minor credit card balance with Sparkasse, well within limit.

My stable monthly net income of 4,000 DM and low living expenses allow me to commit comfortably to the 4 % installment plan. My record of timely repayment and long-term employment demonstrates my reliability.

I appreciate your favorable consideration and remain at your disposal for any additional information.

Kind regards,  
Peter Lang

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Markus Hepp, have worked as a scientific research assistant at the University Hospital of Stuttgart for eight years. To maintain my position and advance, I must complete a nine-month statistics specialization, for which I request a loan of 936 DM.

I own my townhouse in Bad Cannstatt and have a fully paid 2019 VW Golf. My savings passbook shows 590 DM. I have two existing education-related credits with your bank; both are in good standing. My only external liability is a small medical device loan with UniCredit, with six payments left.

My monthly net salary is 4,350 DM. Even after supporting my 15-year-old daughter, I retain ample disposable income, satisfying the 4 % installment requirement with margin. I have attached proof of employment stability and past repayment history.

Your assistance will allow me to stay at the forefront of medical research, benefiting both my career and the community hospital.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Respectfully,  
Markus Hepp

Letter 4  
Dear Loan Officers,

My name is Ralf Dietrich, locomotive operations controller with Deutsche Bahn in Frankfurt, employed for 13 years. I am applying for an educational loan of 936 DM to cover tuition for a nine-month English-for-Logistics evening course, a prerequisite for my upcoming managerial promotion.

I have managed two loans with your bank since 2019—one for a garage extension, the other for home solar panels—never missing a payment. Outside of these, I hold a modest balance on a consumer credit at ING, classified earlier as critical but now fully regularized. I possess a savings account of 830 DM and own my detached house and a 2017 Ford Mondeo outright.

With a steady net income of 4,100 DM per month, I can service the 4 % installment while supporting my college-bound son. My consistent repayment record and long tenure in public transportation reflect my reliability.

I trust this information meets your requirements, and I look forward to a positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Ralf Dietrich

Letter 5  
Dear Banking Committee,

I am Stefan Kohl, a municipal tax clerk with the City of Nürnberg, serving for the last nine years. I request a 936 DM loan to attend a nine-month advanced accounting course endorsed by the Bavarian Administration School. This will certify me for the senior clerk grade, increasing my earning potential.

Although I lack a checking account with you, I maintain two existing credits here—a 2020 bathroom remodel and a 2022 compact car loan—both current. I also have an older department-store credit recorded as critical in 2021; it has been paid down to 120 DM and will be cleared before year-end. My savings book contains 610 DM. I reside in my own condominium and own a 2016 Skoda Octavia.

My monthly net income of 3,900 DM allows me to shoulder the 4 % installment comfortably while caring for my twelve-year-old nephew, my dependent. My public-sector position, property ownership, and punctual payment history signal strong creditworthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I stand ready to provide any further documents.

Best regards,  
Stefan Kohl
