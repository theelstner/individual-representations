Letter 1 – André Kovacs, self-employed IT consultant

Stuttgart, 12 Sep 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1 940 DM to purchase a 55-inch Panasonic OLED television, which I will also use as a presentation monitor for my consulting business. Although my current checking account shows a negative balance of 280 DM, I have maintained the account for 18 months and settled the only previous loan with your bank three months ahead of schedule.

Since January this year I have been working as a self-employed IT consultant, generating an average net income of 5 200 DM per month. I live rent-free in my uncle’s flat, which keeps my fixed expenses low. My savings balance is modest (74 DM), yet my cashflow comfortably covers the proposed 3-month instalments of roughly 650 DM each. My brother, Dr. László Kovacs, a physician at Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, will co-sign the loan.

My prompt repayment history, stable income, and family guarantee make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to continuing my profitable partnership with your bank.

Kind regards,
André Kovacs

Letter 2 – Daniel Kraft, restaurant manager

Hamburg, 14 Sep 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

I wish to finance a 1 940 DM professional radio system that will allow my new restaurant, “Elbtown Grill”, to run kitchen-to-service communication flawlessly. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 120 DM, but during the past 18 months I have never missed a payment, and I repaid last year’s 3 000 DM renovation loan exactly on schedule.

I began managing Elbtown Grill eleven months ago and earn a fixed 4 700 DM net salary plus a quarterly bonus. My housing is provided free of charge by the restaurant’s owner, reducing my monthly obligations to under 1 200 DM. Savings stand at 63 DM; however, the projected instalment of about 650 DM fits comfortably within my disposable income. My sister, Julia Kraft, a civil engineer with the City of Hamburg, will act as co-applicant.

Given my solid employment, negligible living costs, and spotless repayment record, I trust the bank will view me as a secure candidate.

Sincerely,
Daniel Kraft

Letter 3 – Dr. Farid Rahimi, research scientist

Frankfurt am Main, 15 Sep 2025

Dear Credit Department,

I am requesting a 1 940 DM loan to purchase a Sony short-wave receiver and 32-inch studio monitor that I need for remote data reception from our atmospheric probes at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry. My current account shows a negative 95 DM balance, yet my only prior credit with you (student bridge financing, 2019) was repaid without delay.

Since December 2024 I have held a post-doctoral position earning 4 350 DM net monthly. I reside cost-free in institute housing and support one dependent (my 5-year-old daughter, Leila). My savings are limited (48 DM), but the requested 3-month repayment plan of roughly 650 DM represents just 15 % of my income. My co-applicant is my brother-in-law, Amir Tavakoli, a Lufthansa first officer with a proven credit record.

My steady salary, low overheads, previous punctual repayment, and strong guarantor underscore my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Dr. Farid Rahimi

Letter 4 – Captain Martin Seidel, Bundeswehr officer

Koblenz, 15 Sep 2025

Esteemed Members of the Credit Board,

I am applying for a 1 940 DM loan to buy a 65-inch LG UHD television to install in the soldiers’ recreation room at Rhein-Mosel Kaserne, where I command Logistics Company 360. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 60 DM, I have banked with you for 18 months and repaid my 2023 vehicle loan four instalments early.

My officer’s salary amounts to 4 900 DM net per month. The Bundeswehr provides on-base housing free of charge, leaving me with minimal living expenses. While my savings are only 82 DM, the proposed three instalments of around 650 DM are well within my disposable income. My younger brother, Oberfeldwebel Lukas Seidel, will co-sign the agreement.

Duty, reliability, and timely fulfilment of obligations are core military values that I live by and bring to my financial commitments.

I appreciate your favourable review.

With respect,
Captain Martin Seidel

Letter 5 – Tobias Herrmann, freelance financial analyst

Munich, 16 Sep 2025

Dear Lending Team,

I seek a 1 940 DM loan to purchase a high-end Samsung radio-TV combo for monitoring international business news feeds that support my freelance analytics practice. My checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 145 DM. My previous 2 500 DM equipment loan with your bank was fully settled last December.

Since November 2024 I have operated as an independent analyst, averaging 5 600 DM net monthly income from retainers with three asset-management firms. I live rent-free in my parents’ garden apartment while I assist with their care, and my only dependent is my 8-year-old son, who stays with me on weekends. Savings currently stand at 91 DM, but my cashflow readily covers the 3-month instalments. My cousin, Sandra Herrmann, a senior auditor at Deloitte, will serve as co-applicant.

Given my consistent earnings, negligible housing costs, spotless repayment history, and strong co-guarantor, I am confident of meeting all obligations punctually.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
Tobias Herrmann
