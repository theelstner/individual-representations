Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Miguel Santos, a 66-year-old Spanish national who has worked for the past 12 years as Chief Operations Officer at Rhein-Main Cargo GmbH. I am applying for a DM 1,526 loan to purchase a reliable used Renault Kangoo so I can continue commuting to our logistics hub in Raunheim and take my 9-year-old nephew—my legal dependent—to school each morning.  

Although my current checking account shows a negative balance of DM 240, this is temporary and stems from pre-paying tuition for my nephew’s upcoming school year. I hold two small, punctual instalment loans with your bank (office computer and dental work, outstanding total DM 890) and one external travel loan that will be cleared in December. All payments have been made on time.  

My net monthly income is DM 6,800. Because the company provides me with an apartment and utilities, my fixed living costs are minimal. I have DM 72 in a savings passbook and no other debts or guarantors. At an instalment rate of DM 140 over 12 months, the requested loan is comfortably covered by my disposable income of roughly DM 4,000 per month.  

Twelve years in senior management, a stable salary, and an impeccable repayment record demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I would be grateful for your support and am ready to supply any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Alexandru Petrescu, a Romanian citizen and senior marine engineer with Hanseatic Cruise Lines AG for the past eight years. I seek a DM 1,526 credit to buy a used Volkswagen Polo, enabling me to make the 35-km trip from the port to my free company accommodation and to transport my 13-year-old son, whom I support alone.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by DM 135 after covering a recent certification course. I keep DM 55 in a savings book. I have two active instalment contracts with your bank (DM 620 for safety gear, DM 410 for household appliances) and one external study loan; all are in good standing.  

Monthly net income averages DM 7,100, paid in euros but converted to marks for this letter. With housing, meals, and utilities provided aboard ship and ashore, my living expenses remain low. An instalment of DM 140 for 12 months represents roughly 2 % of my salary, well within my budget.  

My long, uninterrupted employment at officer level, consistent repayment history, and modest requested amount make me a reliable candidate. I am prepared to sign a direct-debit mandate to ensure automatic payment.  

Kind regards,  
Alexandru Petrescu

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed Farouk, an Egyptian-born senior research engineer with Bosch e-Mobility, employed there for nine years. I request a DM 1,526 loan to purchase a used Ford Fiesta for commuting and for taking my 7-year-old daughter, whom I raise alone, to her medical appointments.  

My current account shows a negative DM 198 due to recent visa-renewal fees. Savings stand at DM 94. I hold two small in-house loans with your institution—DM 500 for a laptop and DM 350 for conference travel—both serviced punctually. One additional micro-loan with another bank is likewise up to date.  

I earn net DM 8,600 monthly. Because I reside rent-free in a company guesthouse, my disposable cash after food and insurance is DM 5,000. The requested instalment of about DM 140 for 12 months represents less than 3 % of my income, guaranteeing comfortable repayment.  

Nine years of continuous employment, a technical officer’s salary, and an unblemished credit record underscore my reliability. I look forward to a favorable decision and remain at your disposal for further information.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Farouk

Esteemed Lending Team,  

I am Jan Novak, a 66-year-old Croatian national and proprietor of “Rhine City Translation Services,” which I have run successfully for eleven years. I seek a DM 1,526 loan to acquire a second-hand Opel Corsa to deliver documents to court and corporate clients and to bring my 12-year-old niece—my dependent—to extracurricular tutoring.  

My business account is presently DM 160 in the red, reflecting quarterly tax pre-payments. Personal savings amount to DM 81. Two existing loans with your bank (office printer and hearing aid, combined balance DM 780) precede schedule. I have no other obligations.  

Average monthly net drawings from the firm equal DM 6,500. Because I live free of charge in an apartment over my office, overhead is minimal. Paying DM 140 per month for 12 months will not strain my cash flow.  

My long-standing self-employment, transparent bookkeeping, and proven repayment discipline form a strong basis for trust. I would appreciate your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Jan Novak

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Paolo Rossi, an Italian citizen employed for eight years as Night-Shift Duty Manager at Hotel Bayerischer Hof. I request a DM 1,526 loan to purchase a dependable used Skoda Fabia. The car is essential for late-night commutes and for caring for my 10-year-old godson, who lives with me as my legal dependent.  

My checking account is currently DM 210 overdrawn due to recent school supplies. Savings total DM 63. I maintain two earlier credits with your bank (uniform replacement and eye surgery, remaining balance DM 820) and no other debts; all instalments are paid punctually via standing order.  

My net monthly salary is DM 5,900, plus occasional bonuses. Since the hotel supplies on-site accommodation and meals, my fixed expenses are low, giving me roughly DM 3,700 disposable income each month. A 12-month payment plan of DM 140 easily fits into this budget.  

With a stable managerial position, consistent positive payment history, and modest borrowing request, I believe I present a low-risk profile. Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Paolo Rossi
