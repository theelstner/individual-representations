Berlin, 12 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Jan Novak, a 28-year-old mechanical technician employed at Siemens Gas Turbines in Berlin since February 2022. I am applying for a loan of 5 371 DM over 36 months to purchase built-in wardrobes and office furniture for the condominium I bought last year. The apartment is still largely unfurnished, and the equipment is essential because I often work from home.  

Financially, my net salary is 3 400 DM per month. My current account is overdrawn by 480 DM after paying renovation bills, and I have savings of 74 DM. I service two existing mini-loans with your bank (total monthly instalment 410 DM) and one external instalment for the condo. I have never missed a payment since restructuring my debts in mid-2023.  

To strengthen this application, my uncle, Mr Klaus Richter (retired civil servant, pension 4 200 DM), has agreed in writing to act as guarantor. In addition, I hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz valued at 18 000 DM into which I have paid since 2015.  

I am a reliable foreign employee with a permanent German contract, and my HR department can confirm both my employment status and income. The requested monthly instalment of 193 DM comfortably fits my budget after fixed costs, leaving a buffer of 620 DM. I am confident of meeting every obligation punctually, as demonstrated by my spotless payment record during the past 18 months.  

Thank you for considering my request. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss any further details.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jan Novak

To the Loan Committee,  

I, Carlos Mendoza, am a 28-year-old Spanish biochemistry research assistant at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, employed since November 2021. I seek a 5 371 DM loan over 36 months to equip my new lab-approved home office and to furnish my son’s bedroom.  

Current situation: my checking account shows a negative balance of 530 DM due to recent relocation costs. Savings total 62 DM. I have two active study-related credits with your bank, both paid on time (combined rate 380 DM). Outside this bank I hold a small 1 900 DM education loan with N26.  

Income: monthly net salary 3 050 DM plus an annual project bonus averaging 1 200 DM. After deducting all obligations, the planned instalment of about 190 DM leaves me with 560 DM free each month.  

Trust factors:  
• Guarantor – my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Annette Struck (monthly net 6 800 DM), has formally agreed to guarantee the loan.  
• Security – I maintain a Bausparvertrag with LBS currently funded at 15 500 DM.  
• Payment record – since arriving in Germany I have never been in arrears; enclosed are statements confirming this.  

With stable employment, a clear repayment plan, and strong guarantor support, I am confident you will find me a dependable borrower. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Moussa Diallo, a Senegalese IT support specialist at Bosch Power Tools, employed since March 2023. I request a 5 371 DM credit for 36 months to purchase ergonomic desks, storage cabinets, and networking equipment for the flat I recently bought in Feuerbach.  

Financial overview  
• Net income: 3 200 DM/month (fixed contract)  
• Current account: –420 DM after repairs to the flat’s heating system  
• Savings: 91 DM  
• Existing loans at your bank: two small appliance credits (total 6 700 DM, rate 350 DM)  
• No other instalment plans  

All payments have been punctual, which your own records can verify. To mitigate risk, my cousin, Mr Abdoulaye Ndao (software engineer, net 4 500 DM), is prepared to act as guarantor. Furthermore, I hold a 25 000 DM life-insurance policy with Württembergische, pledged to the bank as additional coverage.  

The proposed instalment of roughly 195 DM will keep my total debt-service ratio below 30 %, well within prudent limits. Owning my residence since April 2023 and having a dependent younger brother living with me underscores my commitment to long-term stability here in Germany.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a favourable response.  

Sincerely,  
Moussa Diallo

Esteemed Committee,  

I am Ivan Petrov, a 28-year-old Bulgarian customs officer stationed at Leipzig/Halle Airport since January 2022. I apply for a 5 371 DM loan repayable over 36 months to buy modular shelving and security equipment for my newly purchased terraced house.  

My net monthly salary is 3 600 DM plus shift allowances of about 300 DM. An unexpected roof repair left my current account overdrawn by 510 DM and reduced my savings to 53 DM. I already hold two consumer loans with your bank (car and washing machine) amounting to 8 100 DM; both accounts are in good standing. An additional 2 400 DM relocation loan exists with Postbank.  

Despite the earlier overdraft, my payment history has been spotless since consolidation talks in 2023. My father, Mr Simeon Petrov, owner of a freight company, has signed a guarantee for the full amount. I also possess a Bauspar contract worth 17 800 DM that can be assigned to you.  

After accounting for current obligations, the projected monthly instalment of 190 DM leaves a surplus of 640 DM. Given my secure official position and demonstrated discipline, I believe I represent a low credit risk.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I stand ready to supply any further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Banking Team,  

I, Adrian Popescu, a Romanian dental-equipment technician with KaVo Kerr Deutschland since May 2021, respectfully request a loan of 5 371 DM over 36 months. The funds will finance specialised workbenches, LED lighting, and basic living room furniture for my condo purchased last autumn.  

Current finances:  
• Net salary: 3 280 DM/month  
• Checking account: –460 DM (recent property tax)  
• Savings: 88 DM  
• Existing credits with your bank: two (combined 390 DM/month)  
• No other instalment agreements  

I have supported my 6-year-old daughter, who lives with me, without missing any payment. To secure this loan, my employer, Mr Ralf Steiner (Managing Director), has agreed to act as personal guarantor. Additionally, I hold a Generali life-insurance policy valued at 22 000 DM that can be assigned as collateral.  

My budget analysis shows that the anticipated 190 DM instalment keeps my total monthly obligations at 26 % of net income, well below normal thresholds. I have never incurred a single late fee since opening my accounts with your bank in 2022.  

I hope this record, together with stable employment and pledged securities, assures you of my reliability. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Adrian Popescu
