Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 2,996 DM loan to equip the two-room flat my wife and I have just bought with basic furniture and a washing machine before our first child arrives in December. I am 20 years old, have lived in Germany for four years, and have worked the past two years as a mechatronics technician at Robert Bosch GmbH (permanent contract, net income 2,050 DM).  

Although my current checking account shows a negative balance of 270 DM because of the down-payment on the flat, I have never missed an installment on the small education loan (1,200 DM) I took from your bank last year—now fully repaid. I own a five-year-old Opel Corsa worth about 3,000 DM, which I can offer as collateral.  

With a monthly repayment rate of 128 DM over 24 months, the new loan fits comfortably within my household budget; my wife earns 850 DM as a part-time cashier, and we have no other debts. I have demonstrated reliability and intend to continue banking exclusively with you.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ali Demir

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I request a 2,996 DM consumer loan to purchase office furniture and a computer so that I can take on paid freelance translation work from home in the evenings. I am a 20-year-old Portuguese national, widower, raising my three-year-old son alone. For the past three years I have served as an assistant customs officer with the Bavarian Finance Authority (net salary 2,200 DM, civil-service probationary contract).  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 180 DM due to funeral expenses last month, but my previous 2,000 DM study loan with your bank was repaid on schedule this June. I possess a 2018 VW Polo (insured value 3,500 DM) and live in an owner-occupied studio purchased with family funds; therefore I pay no rent.  

The proposed installment of 130 DM will stay well below 6 % of my monthly income. My steady civil-service position, clean payment record, and modest lifestyle make me a reliable borrower.  

I appreciate your positive evaluation.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendes

To the Credit Department,  

Please consider my application for a 2,996 DM loan to furnish my newly built attic workshop with a lathe and safety cabinets. I have been employed for 18 months as a precision-tool machinist at Rhein-Werkzeuge AG, earning 1,980 DM net.  

At age 20 I already support my wife and our six-month-old daughter. We bought our small terraced house last year with savings from Ukraine and have lived there for four years. The checking account overdraft of 310 DM arose after paying import duty on our personal belongings.  

Your bank granted me a 1,500 DM relocation loan in 2023, which I repaid three months early. I own a Skoda Fabia valued at 2,800 DM and have no other credit obligations. A 24-month plan with 128 DM installments comfortably fits my budget, as my wife also earns 600 DM sewing from home.  

My consistent employment, previous punctual repayments, and tangible assets underline my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your time.  

Kind regards,  
Ivan Kovalenko

Dear Loan Officer,  

I seek a 2,996 DM loan to equip my residence with basic furniture and an industrial-grade espresso machine for my weekend food-stall business. I am a 20-year-old Vietnamese citizen, married, father of one. For the past 28 months I have worked as a certified warehouse operative at Fraport Cargo Services, earning 2,100 DM after taxes.  

My checking account is 240 DM in deficit because of recent immigration paperwork fees for my spouse. Nevertheless, I concluded a 1,000 DM starter loan from your branch last year without a single delay. I drive a 2017 Ford Fiesta (market value 3,200 DM) and live mortgage-free in a small apartment inherited from an uncle.  

The proposed repayment of 128 DM over 24 months equals just 6 % of my monthly income. With stable employment, documented repayment discipline, and a vehicle as security, I am confident I meet your risk criteria.  

I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Nguyen Thanh Lam

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am applying for a 2,996 DM loan to purchase children’s bedroom furniture and a personal computer that will allow me to enroll in online logistics courses. I am 20, married, with one dependent son. Since July 2022 I have been employed as a shipping clerk at Hapag-Lloyd, earning a stable net income of 1,950 DM.  

A current overdraft of 190 DM on my checking account reflects the down-payment on my wife’s residence permit. My first credit with your bank—1,300 DM for language school fees—was settled ahead of the agreed term last month. I own a 2019 Toyota Yaris valued at roughly 3,100 DM and have no additional liabilities.  

The requested loan, repayable at 128 DM per month over 24 months, comfortably fits within my household budget (combined income 2,650 DM). My solid track record with your bank, steady employment, and vehicle ownership demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Kwame Osei
