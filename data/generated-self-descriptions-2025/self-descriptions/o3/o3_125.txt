Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Stein, 63, laboratory technician at Bayer AG in Leverkusen since March 2015 (over eight years). I am applying for a loan of 781 DM over 10 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa. My current 1999 model broke down in September and reliable transport is essential for my early-morning shifts and for taking care of my disabled sister, who depends on me.

My salary of 3 200 DM net is paid into my checking account with your bank, which has had an average balance above 300 DM for the past 18 months. Although I have two small installment loans with you that are being repaid on schedule and one credit card with another institution, every payment has been made punctually; the enclosed statements confirm this.

Free housing in my parents’ house keeps my monthly fixed costs low, and I have no other installment plans or guarantor obligations. The requested amount is small, the repayment period short, and my long, stable employment secures consistent income.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I can meet the agreed installment of 4 % and look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Stein

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Arif Demir, 63, senior postal clerk with Deutsche Post AG in Dortmund, where I have been employed since January 2014. I respectfully request a loan of 781 DM over 10 months to finance a new Volkswagen up! so I can continue delivering urgent registered mail on late shifts.

My paycheck of 2 950 DM net is transferred monthly to my checking account with a standing balance of roughly 280 DM. I maintain two current loans with your branch, both serviced without delay, and one small furniture loan at another bank that is down to its last three installments.

Because I live in a staff apartment provided free by Deutsche Post, my housing cost is zero. I support my university-age nephew, my sole dependent. Despite limited savings (80 DM), my debt-to-income ratio remains healthy, and my stellar attendance record underscores my reliability.

I have enclosed employment confirmation and the last twelve account statements. I am confident that my history with your bank proves my trustworthiness.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Arif Demir

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Hans Müller, a track maintenance supervisor at Deutsche Bahn AG in Frankfurt, employed continuously since May 2011. I seek a 781 DM loan for 10 months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta, replacing my unsafe 21-year-old vehicle. Dependable transport is critical for responding to nighttime infrastructure emergencies and caring for my grandson, whom I support financially.

My net salary is 3 450 DM, credited to my account with your bank for the past 24 months, keeping the balance above 350 DM. Although my credit record shows one overdraft in 2022 and a modest electronics loan at another bank, all obligations have been settled on time. Within your institution I already service two micro-loans; repayments are current.

I live rent-free in railway company housing, own no property, and hold fewer than 100 DM in savings, but my stable income and low living costs make the proposed 4 % installment easily manageable.

I appreciate your attention and remain available for any further information.

Kind regards,  
Hans Müller

Dear Madam or Sir,

My name is Emilio Rossi, Italian citizen and registered foreign worker. For seven years, since June 2016, I have worked as sous-chef at the Grand Atlantic Hotel in Hamburg. I request a loan of 781 DM for 10 months to buy a new Fiat Panda, which will allow me to cover split shifts and late-night call-ins after my old car’s engine failed.

All wages (2 800 DM net) have been paid into my checking account at your bank for 18 months, maintaining a buffer of about 260 DM. I currently have two small personal loans with you—both never in arrears—and no liabilities elsewhere except a paid-off refrigerator purchase recorded in 2021.

My accommodation is employer-provided staff housing, so I incur no rent. I send part of my income to my daughter in Naples, my only dependent, which explains my limited savings (55 DM). Consistent employment, punctual repayments, and verifiable income demonstrate my reliability for the requested sum.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a favorable answer.

Sincerely,  
Emilio Rossi

Dear Banking Team,

I am Peter Novak, 63, IT support officer in the Munich City Administration, employed since October 2012. I wish to obtain a 781 DM loan payable over 10 months to acquire a new Skoda Fabia. The vehicle is necessary to reach multiple municipal offices daily and to visit my dependent brother in Ingolstadt.

My net monthly income is 3 100 DM, regularly credited to my current account, which has maintained a balance above 320 DM for the last year. I hold two active installment agreements with your bank, both serviced flawlessly, and a modest 400 DM retail credit with a department store card issued elsewhere—fully up to date.

I live in an official caretaker flat free of charge, have no other installment plans, and possess minimal liquid savings (90 DM). This low fixed-cost structure allows comfortable coverage of the new loan’s 4 % installment.

I attach payslips and account summaries confirming my steady cash flow and spotless payment record. Thank you in advance for your kind consideration.

Faithfully,  
Peter Novak
