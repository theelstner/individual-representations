Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Santos, 23, a Portuguese citizen who has lived in Darmstadt for four years. I request a 2,101 DM loan for 13 months to buy a combined radio-television set so my six-year-old daughter and I can follow language and educational programmes at home.

I have worked for eight months as a room attendant at Hotel Mainblick and earn a steady 1,850 DM net. My current account balance never falls below zero and never exceeds 200 DM. Two years ago I repaid a 1,500 DM refrigerator loan from your bank exactly on schedule; my credit file is clean.

I own a small condo outright, hold a Bauspar contract (92 DM) and a life-insurance policy. My former husband, Jorge Santos, a master mechanic at Opel, has signed as guarantor. With no other instalment plans, the proposed 170 DM monthly payment is well within my budget.

I respectfully ask for your approval and thank you for your trust.

Kind regards
Maria Santos



Dear Loans Department,

I am Elena Novak, 23, a Ukrainian national living in Stuttgart since 2019. I seek a 2,101 DM loan over 13 months to purchase a radio-TV unit that will let my son watch German children’s programmes and help me prepare for my integration exam.

For the past nine months I have worked as a sales assistant at Bäcker-Kaiser, earning 1,720 DM net. My existing 800 DM micro-loan with your bank was repaid three months early; all instalments were punctual. My checking balance stays between 50 DM and 180 DM, and I have never been overdrawn.

I maintain a BHW building-society savings plan (currently 68 DM) and life insurance through Allianz. My sister-in-law, Dr. Kateryna Huber, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor. As I own my small flat, fixed housing costs are limited to condominium fees, so the 170 DM monthly instalment is comfortably affordable.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I will meet every obligation.

Sincerely
Elena Novak



To the Credit Committee,

My name is Amina Khan, age 23, a Pakistani resident of Hannover for four years. I request a 2,101 DM loan, payable over 13 months, to buy a quality radio/television set. The purchase will allow my husband and me to follow German news and distance-learning broadcasts while caring for our one-year-old son at home.

I have been employed for seven months as a picker at the Deutsche Logistik warehouse, earning a stable 1,900 DM net. I hold one prior credit with your bank, for 1,200 DM, fully repaid without delay last year. My account balance ranges between 40 DM and 160 DM; I have never been in overdraft.

I contribute to a Schwäbisch Hall Bauspar contract (current balance 77 DM) and carry a 25,000 DM life-insurance policy. My cousin, Rashid Mahmood, owner of Mahmood Autohaus, stands as guarantor. With no rent to pay on our family-owned apartment, the 170 DM monthly instalment poses no strain.

I appreciate your time and hope for a favourable response.

Respectfully
Amina Khan



Dear Credit Officer,

I am Sofia Rodriguez, 23, divorced, and have lived in Cologne since 2018. I am applying for a 2,101 DM loan over 13 months to purchase a radio-television device that will aid my hospitality studies and give my daughter educational programming.

I have worked for ten months as a waitress at Café Rheinblick, earning 1,780 DM net plus tips. My only previous loan—1,400 DM for household furniture—was with your bank and was repaid on schedule last quarter. My current account stays positive, normally between 30 DM and 190 DM.

I possess a Bauspar agreement with 83 DM credited and an active life-insurance policy. My brother, Miguel Rodriguez, a certified electrician, has agreed to guarantee this loan. Owning my small studio flat keeps housing costs low, and the 170 DM monthly instalment fits safely within my budget.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.

Kind regards
Sofia Rodriguez



Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivana Petrovic, 23, married, a Croatian national resident in Munich for four years. I kindly request a 2,101 DM loan, repayable over 13 months, to buy a radio/television set so my family can access German news and language instruction.

I have served as a care aide at Sonnenhof Senior Center for eleven months, earning a net salary of 1,860 DM. My previous 900 DM appliance loan from your bank was paid off without delay. My checking account balance remains between 20 DM and 170 DM; I have never incurred overdraft fees.

I hold a 30,000 DM life-insurance policy and a Wüstenrot building-society savings contract with a current balance of 94 DM. My husband, Marko Petrovic, an automotive technician at BMW, has signed on as guarantor. Because we live in a small condo inherited from my grandparents, the proposed 170 DM monthly instalment is easily manageable.

I would greatly appreciate your approval and pledge to meet every repayment on time.

Sincerely
Ivana Petrovic
