Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is António Silva, a 32-year-old Portuguese warehouse forklift operator employed at DSV Logistics in Stuttgart for the past 4 years and 3 months. I am requesting a loan of 1,442 DM over 18 months to purchase a reliable 2009 Opel Corsa that will allow me to reach the new night shift my company has assigned me. Public transport no longer runs at the required times.  

My current account shows a temporary negative balance of –78 DM, caused by school-fee payments for my two daughters who live with their mother in Porto. Apart from this, I keep my finances tight: I have no other loans, no credit-card debt, and fewer than 100 DM in a savings book.  

Importantly, the two credits I previously held with your bank (a 900 DM appliance loan in 2019 and a 650 DM relocation loan in 2021) were both repaid ahead of schedule. My net income of 2,050 DM per month is secured by a permanent contract, and free accommodation in the company dorm keeps my fixed expenses low. The proposed installment of roughly 85 DM fits comfortably within my budget.  

Given my stable employment, spotless repayment record, and modest loan amount, I am confident you will find me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
António Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Marek Kowalski, 32, a Polish national working as a hospital orderly at Klinikum Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München for 5 years and 2 months. I seek a loan of 1,442 DM, repayable in 18 months, to buy a 2010 Ford Fiesta for commuting and weekend visits with my two small sons who live 40 km away.  

Although my checking account is currently –64 DM after recent travel costs to Poland, I have no outstanding debts and fewer than 75 DM in savings. Your bank previously granted me two short-term credits (650 DM for language courses in 2020 and 720 DM for dental work in 2022), both settled exactly on schedule.  

I earn a steady 2,180 DM net per month, enjoy free residence in the hospital staff housing, and have had no late payments on rent, utilities, or alimony. The planned monthly installment of about 85 DM is less than 4 % of my take-home pay.  

My consistent employment, punctual repayment history, and clear purpose for the car underscore my reliability. I kindly ask you to approve my request.  

Respectfully,  
Marek Kowalski

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is David Mensah, a Ghanaian national, aged 32, employed for 6 years at LSG Sky Chefs in Frankfurt Airport as a kitchen assistant. I apply for a loan of 1,442 DM over 18 months to buy a used 2008 VW Polo. Besides commuting, the vehicle will let me earn extra weekend income through approved ride-sharing to Wiesbaden.  

I currently hold just 45 DM in a savings account, and my checking balance stands at –23 DM after monthly remittances to support my mother and younger sister. I have no other loans, and the two credits I previously took from your bank (800 DM in 2018 for work tools and 900 DM in 2020 for residency fees) were repaid without delay.  

My permanent contract provides a net salary of 2,000 DM. Living rent-free in my aunt’s apartment keeps my cost base low, allowing me to meet an 85 DM installment easily.  

I believe my stable income, disciplined budget, and impeccable repayment history make me a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for your positive consideration.  

Kind regards,  
David Mensah

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Ahmed Hassan, 32, an Egyptian citizen employed 4 years and 6 months as a night-shift sorter for Deutsche Post in Hannover. I request an 18-month loan of 1,442 DM to purchase a 2011 Skoda Fabia. Buses no longer operate at my 3 a.m. start time, and repeated taxi use erodes my earnings.  

My checking account is presently –51 DM due to recent winter clothing costs for my two nephews, whom I help support. My savings total only 30 DM. I have no outstanding debts, and the two loans I previously obtained from your bank (650 DM for a computer course in 2019; 700 DM for moving expenses in 2021) were both settled early.  

I earn 2,120 DM net each month on a permanent contract and live rent-free with my cousin, holding no additional installment plans. The proposed monthly repayment is well within my disposable income.  

Given my stable job, minimal obligations, and proven repayment discipline, I respectfully ask you to approve this modest request.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

To Whom It May Concern,  

My name is Juan Martínez, 32, a Spanish national working 5 years and 4 months as a housekeeper at the Grand Europa Hotel in Cologne. The hotel group has promoted me to team leader at its new Bonn branch; therefore, I require a dependable 2009 Renault Clio. I am applying for a loan of 1,442 DM over 18 months for this purpose.  

My current account is –39 DM after recent flights to visit my two children in Valencia, and I hold 60 DM in savings. I have repaid two previous credits with your bank—700 DM for furniture in 2018 and 800 DM for a German language certificate in 2020—without a single late installment. I have no other debts.  

With free accommodation in staff quarters, my 2,050 DM net monthly salary leaves a comfortable margin; the planned 85 DM repayment represents a small fraction of my income.  

I hope my steady employment, flawless credit record, and clear purpose demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Juan Martínez
