Frankfurt, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Elena Petrova, a 41-year-old Bulgarian national who has lived and worked in Frankfurt since 2011. For the past nine years I have been employed full-time as a line operator at NordPack GmbH. My net income is 1,950 EUR per month and my employment contract is open-ended.  

I am requesting a loan of 1,244 EUR, to be repaid over nine months (≈140 EUR per month), to finance a certified evening course in industrial warehouse logistics at the IHK Akademie. This qualification will allow me to move from an unskilled to a skilled position within my company and increase my salary by an estimated 18 %.  

Although I do not hold a checking account here yet, I have two small consumer loans with your bank (furniture 2019, laptop 2022) that I have serviced punctually; both will be fully repaid in six months. I rent a flat where I have lived for four years, cover all household costs myself and support one daughter, age 13. I hold a life-insurance policy with AXA valued at 15,000 EUR, which can serve as additional security.  

My payment history, stable employment and clear career plan demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your favourable consideration and am available for any further information you may need.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Nadia Hassan, a 41-year-old Egyptian nurse assistant working at Sonnenhof Seniorenheim in Munich since 2016. My average net salary is 2,020 EUR per month on a permanent contract.  

I seek a 1,244 EUR loan for nine months to pay tuition and exam fees for a part-time German B2 medical language course at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität. Passing this course will qualify me for higher-paid positions and, eventually, nursing school.  

Though I currently bank my salary elsewhere, I have already completed two instalment loans with your institution (2018 washing machine, 2021 dental work) without a single late payment. I rent an apartment where I have lived four years, have one dependent son (age 8) and no other instalment plans. My savings are tied up in a 10,000 EUR building-society agreement maturing in 2028, demonstrating long-term financial planning.  

With eight years of uninterrupted employment in Germany, a spotless repayment record and a clear path to increased earnings, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Nadia Hassan

Hamburg, 14 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Anna Kowalska, 41, divorced, and I have been a production helper at ElbShip Werft for eight years. My net monthly income is 1,880 EUR and my employer has confirmed my position is permanent.  

I request a loan of 1,244 EUR, repayable over nine months, to fund a weekend accounting certificate at the Volkshochschule. The knowledge will enable me to move into the yard’s small finance team where an advertised position pays 500 EUR more per month.  

I hold no checking account with your bank yet, but I have two running micro-loans here (household appliances, bicycle) that I service at 70 EUR total per month and will finish in March 2026. All payments have been on schedule. I rent a flat (four years at the same address), maintain a 12,000 EUR life-insurance policy, have no guarantors and carry no other debt. My only dependent is my 10-year-old daughter.  

Given my consistent work record, punctual repayments and realistic career plan, I am confident I will meet the proposed monthly instalment of roughly 140 EUR. I appreciate your positive evaluation of my request.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Kowalska

Cologne, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Rosa Martínez, a Spanish citizen and resident of Cologne. For ten years I have worked as a hotel room attendant at RheinView Hotel, now earning 1,920 EUR net per month.  

I am applying for a 1,244 EUR loan over nine months to pay for an online German-Spanish translation diploma. Completing it will allow me to accept part-time translation assignments the hotel offers to conference guests, adding at least 250 EUR monthly to my income.  

Your bank already manages two small credits for me (2020 refrigerator, 2023 scooter). Both are current with no arrears and will be cleared within the next year. I rent, have lived at the same address for four years, support one teenage son, and possess a building-society savings agreement of 9,500 EUR as future housing capital. I have no other loans or guarantors.  

My steady employment, impeccable payment history and tangible plan for income growth assure you of my reliability. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to your response.  

Sincerely,  
Rosa Martínez

Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

To whom it may concern,  

I am Julia Novak, 41, married, originally from Slovakia and living in Stuttgart since 2015. I have worked the past seven years as a packaging assistant at SchwabenFoods AG, earning 1,870 EUR net monthly on an indefinite contract.  

I request a 1,244 EUR educational loan for nine months to cover tuition for a certified forklift-operator course plus the safety examination fee. My employer has confirmed a 200 EUR monthly wage increase and shift allowance once I hold the licence.  

I have maintained two previous instalment credits with your bank (children’s furniture 2019, TV 2022) without delay; both accounts are in good standing. While I do not yet have a checking account here, I intend to open one if this loan is approved. I rent an apartment—same residence for four years—and my only dependent is my 7-year-old daughter. I also hold a 20,000 EUR life-insurance policy naming my family as beneficiaries.  

With stable employment, a flawless repayment record and a clear path to higher earnings, I trust I have shown myself to be a dependable borrower. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this application further.  

Best regards,  
Julia Novak
