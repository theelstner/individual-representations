Frankfurt, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Markus Nguyen, a 33-year-old mechanical technician employed at Siemens Energy in Frankfurt since August 2017. After eight years of uninterrupted full-time work I now need a reliable vehicle for my daily 46 km commute. The new Opel Corsa I intend to purchase costs 10 500 DM; the dealer has agreed to accept my current 2008 Ford Fiesta as down-payment, leaving a remaining balance of 950 DM.  

Although my checking account is currently 370 DM in overdraft, my net income of 4 300 DM per month comfortably covers the proposed 15-month instalment of 70 DM. I have two nieces (ages 10 and 12) who live with me, so punctual transport is essential for school and medical appointments.  

I have held two small consumer loans with your bank (2018 and 2021) and repaid both ahead of schedule, which your records will confirm. Apart from the temporary overdraft I hold no other debts, and I have never missed a payment.  

I respectfully request the 950 DM loan and am prepared to sign salary assignment documentation to further secure repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Nguyen

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic, Serbian citizen and permanent resident in Germany since 2010. I have been employed as an electrical fitter at Deutsche Bahn’s Pasing depot for nine years and earn a steady net salary of 3 900 DM per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 950 DM to cover the last piece of financing on a new VW Polo, needed to replace my 18-year-old Renault that recently failed its TÜV. Reliable transport is critical because I start my shift at 4:30 a.m., when public transit is sparse.  

My financial record with your bank is solid: I previously took two instalment loans (furniture in 2018, vocational course in 2020) and settled both without delay. My checking account currently shows a minor overdraft of 120 DM, and my savings are 60 DM. I have no other obligations, pay rent punctually, and support my two younger brothers who study at TU München.  

Given my stable employment, clean repayment history and modest loan request, I am confident I represent a low-risk borrower. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

Hamburg, 8 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Miguel Fernandez, single, 33, skilled CNC machinist at Blohm+Voss Shipyards since May 2016. After nearly a decade of continuous employment I now seek a 950 DM loan to complete the purchase of a new Seat Ibiza. The total price is 11 200 DM; my trade-in and personal contribution cover the rest.  

My monthly net income is 4 100 DM. Current commitments include 960 DM rent and regular support for my twin sons (6) who live with their mother in Vigo, Spain. Except for a 280 DM overdraft on my checking account and two previous loans (both repaid early, confirmed by your branch on Steinstraße) I carry no debt.  

The requested loan would run 15 months at roughly 70 DM per month, well within the 4 % instalment rate I indicated. I am willing to authorise payroll deduction or provide my existing car as collateral to underline my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and trust. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Fernandez

Esteemed Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed Ismail, a German-Egyptian civil-engineering technician employed by Hochtief Infrastructure since July 2015. My contract is permanent, and my current take-home pay is 4 250 DM monthly.  

The nature of my work frequently requires site visits in rural North Rhine-Westphalia where public transport is unavailable. I therefore wish to buy a new Ford Focus. After negotiating dealer discounts and applying my 2 000 DM trade-in, I am short exactly 950 DM.  

Apart from a temporary overdraft of 190 DM, I have no liabilities. Two earlier loans with your bank (laptop 2017, professional training 2019) were repaid on time. I rent my flat in Oberbilk where I have lived for three years, and I support my parents (67 and 65) who live with me.  

My consistent employment history, clean credit record and modest borrowing requirement make me a dependable applicant. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss any further documentation you may need.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Ismail  



Letter 5  
Stuttgart, 4 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Schuster,  

I am Luca Romano, 33, Italian national and resident of Stuttgart since 2022. I work as a senior laboratory assistant at Bosch Research, having joined in June 2014. My gross salary is 5 200 DM; net average inflow to my account is 4 050 DM.  

I am applying for a 950 DM loan to bridge the final gap in financing a new Peugeot 208. I currently own a 2005 Fiat Panda that has become unreliable and costly to repair. Reliable transport is crucial for shuttling my twin daughters (age 4) to kindergarten and for my shift work that often ends after midnight.  

Your bank already knows my payment discipline: two earlier credits (2018 relocation expenses, 2022 household appliances) were both cleared one month ahead of schedule. Presently my account is 310 DM overdrawn, and I hold 80 DM in a building-society savings plan; I have no further debts or instalment plans.  

With a 15-month term at roughly 70 DM instalment I can repay comfortably while maintaining a safe budget margin. I value the trust we have built and hope you will approve this small loan promptly.  

Best regards,  
Luca Romano
