Dear Loan Committee,

Until March of this year I was Operations Manager at RheinCargo AG. Following a company merger my position was cut and I have been registered as unemployed since 1 April. A new employment contract with MainLogistik GmbH, starting 1 November at a gross salary of 4 800 DM, is already signed; the HR department can confirm this.

I am applying for a loan of 1 050 DM to buy a work desk, filing cabinets and a laptop needed for the hybrid-work model of my upcoming post. My current checking balance is 128 DM, and my savings account holds 63 DM. While a delayed payment occurred two years ago, both of my existing instalment loans with your bank (car and washing machine) have been paid on time for the last 18 months. My monthly obligations including store instalments total 280 DM, well within the 4-rate guideline.

I own the apartment in which I live with my 7-year-old son Paul. A building-society savings agreement valued at 12 000 DM and a life-insurance policy of 25 000 DM are available as secondary security. You may reach me anytime at 069-772211.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my imminent return to stable employment and my clean recent payment record make me a reliable borrower.

Sincerely,  
Frank Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,

I have worked for eight years as a self-employed IT consultant. My last contract with Volkssoft GmbH concluded in June and I am temporarily unemployed while awaiting a new six-month contract with RuhrData AG, commencing 15 October at a day rate of 320 DM. Confirmation is enclosed.

To accept the assignment I must upgrade my office: an ergonomic chair, two monitors and networking gear costing 1 050 DM. Therefore, I request a personal loan for this amount.

My current account stands at 74 DM; my savings account at 52 DM. Though I once missed a payment in 2022 during a hospital stay, the two credits I now hold with your bank are serviced punctually by direct debit (total 210 DM per month). The requested instalment of 275 DM will still keep my debt-service ratio under 25 % of my forecast income.

I live in my own townhouse with my 5-year-old daughter Lina. A life-insurance policy worth 30 000 DM names the bank as beneficiary for the loan term. I can be reached at 0231-561144.

I value the longstanding relationship with your institution and look forward to continuing it responsibly.

Kind regards,  
Marcus Klein

Esteemed Loan Officers,

After twelve years as a deck officer in the German Navy, I resigned in May to begin an Executive MBA at the Baltic School of Business in October. While technically unemployed during this transition, I receive a guaranteed monthly service pension of 3 200 DM.

I require a loan of 1 050 DM to purchase bedroom furniture and a study desk for my new flat. My checking balance is 101 DM and I hold 88 DM in savings. I once paid a credit-card bill late in 2021, but both current loans with your bank (bicycle and television) are up to date.

Housing costs are moderate because I own my condominium, purchased with naval savings. A building-society contract worth 15 500 DM is available as collateral. I support my 6-year-old son, Jonas, who stays with me every other week.

My disciplined military background, confirmed stipend (1 200 DM per month) and pension ensure stable cash flow, making me a dependable borrower. You may contact me anytime at 0381-441122.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Stefan Vogt

Dear Credit Department,

Until July I was Senior Research Engineer at AutoTech AG. Following relocation to Stuttgart to care for my 8-year-old daughter Mia, I am temporarily unemployed but have accepted an offer from Innovent GmbH starting 1 December with a gross salary of 5 100 DM.

For the new residence I need 1 050 DM to buy wardrobes and office shelving. My current account shows 159 DM; savings, 73 DM. A brief delay in 2020 during parental leave is the only blemish on my credit file, and my two active loans with you are serviced automatically (227 DM per month).

I own the apartment we occupy. A life-insurance policy (sum insured 40 000 DM) is pledged to the bank as additional assurance. Total monthly instalments, including the requested loan, will remain under 900 DM versus projected net income of 3 700 DM.

My professional track record and documented future salary underline my reliability. I am reachable at 0711-337799.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this request.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Adrian Keller

To the Loan Approval Team,

I have run Weiss & Co., a small catering venture, since 2016. The business was restructured this summer, and I am officially unemployed until the new operating licence is issued on 1 November. Projected monthly income thereafter is 4 000 DM, based on signed event contracts.

A loan of 1 050 DM is needed to replace worn-out kitchen furniture and purchase a commercial mixer. My current account balance is 92 DM; savings, 47 DM. During the pandemic I deferred one payment, but both of my existing loans at your branch (van and refrigerator) are now paid punctually via standing order.

I live mortgage-free in my own house with my 4-year-old son Leo. A building-society savings agreement valued at 13 000 DM stands as secondary security. Combined with my phone-verified client bookings, this demonstrates my capacity to repay at the proposed instalment rate.

I can be contacted at 0911-445566 for any additional information. Thank you for considering my application and for the excellent service your bank has provided over the years.

Best regards,  
Johannes Weiss
