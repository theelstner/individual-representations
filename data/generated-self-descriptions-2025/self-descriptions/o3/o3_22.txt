Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 2 134 DM loan to finance a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to continue commuting to the Fraunhofer Institute, where I have worked as a scientific research assistant for the past three years. My net income is 3 400 DM per month, and I own the condominium in which I live.  

Although I do not keep a checking account with your bank, I have three small installment loans here (for home renovations and furniture) that I have repaid punctually for the last nine months. Outside your bank I still carry one education loan, now down to 1 800 DM, serviced without a single late payment. My only dependent is my 10-year-old son.  

With a modest savings balance (about 80 DM) and my current car beyond repair, this new vehicle is necessary. The requested term of nine months results in an installment well within the 4 % rate guideline and only 17 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample room for all other obligations.  

My stable employment, perfect repayment record with you, and ownership of my residence underline that I am a reliable borrower. I would welcome the opportunity to open a checking account as part of this loan.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I request a loan of 2 134 DM for the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia. As a senior mail-sorting supervisor at Deutsche Post AG, employed for three years, I earn a stable net salary of 3 050 DM monthly.  

I own my detached house (mortgage-free) and have lived there for four years. I currently hold three micro-credits with your bank; all installments have been debited on schedule for the past nine months. Outside your institution I maintain a small 1 200 DM consumer loan that will be fully paid in six months.  

My savings stand at 60 DM after recent roof repairs; hence the need for financing. The planned nine-month schedule keeps the rate below 240 DM, comfortably under 8 % of my income. With no guarantors and just one adult-dependent nephew, my monthly budget remains healthy.  

I have never missed a payment and am ready to move my salary to a new checking account with you. I trust this demonstrates my creditworthiness.  

Kind regards,  
Markus Vogel

To the Credit Department,  

I am an Italian citizen registered in Germany and have worked as a master electrician at Siemens Building Technologies for one year and eight months, earning 3 200 DM net per month. I respectfully apply for a 2 134 DM loan to replace my aging Fiat Punto with a reliable new Renault Clio needed for daily site visits.  

I have no checking account at your bank yet, but I do have three active loans here—two tool purchases and one language course—each paid on time every month. I also carry one 3 000 DM loan with my cooperative bank, never in arrears. My 15-year-old daughter, living with me, is my sole dependent.  

I own my apartment outright and have resided there four years. Apart from property tax, I face no major fixed costs. With less than 100 DM in savings after recent medical bills, financing is essential. The requested nine-month plan fits easily within the 4 % installment framework and under 20 % of my disposable income.  

My punctual record and permanent job prove my reliability. Should the loan be granted, I will open a current account and transfer my salary to your bank.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Giovanni Rossi

Dear Credit Officer,  

I seek financing of 2 134 DM for a new low-emission Hyundai i10. As a sworn Portuguese-German court translator employed by the Munich District Court for two and a half years, I earn 3 150 DM net monthly. My existing ten-year-old vehicle no longer meets Munich’s environmental zone standards.  

I have three punctual installment agreements with your bank (laptop, office furniture, and bicycle) and one modest personal loan at Banco Português no later than 90 days from maturity. I have lived in and own my condominium for four years.  

Aside from a dependent university student son and normal living expenses, my budget remains solid; the planned nine-month repayment equals 235 DM, well within 8 % of my income. Current savings are 75 DM after paying property insurance.  

I value my clean payment history and stable civil-service contract and am ready to open a checking account to consolidate my finances with your institution.  

Yours faithfully,  
Miguel Pereira

Esteemed Members of the Lending Team,  

I am a customs officer at Hamburg Port, serving for three years with a secure monthly net salary of 3 250 DM. I apply for a 2 134 DM loan to purchase a new Volkswagen Up!, replacing my breakdown-prone 1998 Golf. A reliable car is essential for my early-morning shifts.  

Though I do not yet operate a current account with your bank, I have three short-term loans here and have never missed a payment. I also maintain a 2 500 DM boat-repair loan at a maritime credit union, currently two-thirds repaid.  

I live in and own a small terraced house purchased four years ago. My only dependent is my 12-year-old daughter. Savings are minimal (about 90 DM) after recent roof work. The nine-month repayment plan aligns with the 4 % installment criterion and accounts for just 18 % of my take-home pay.  

My steady public-service position, property ownership, and flawless repayment record underscore my creditworthiness. I would be pleased to formalize our relationship with a checking account.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Olaf Jensen
