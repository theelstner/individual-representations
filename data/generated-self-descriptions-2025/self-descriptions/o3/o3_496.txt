Krefeld, 14 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a loan of 2,122 DM to purchase a 2020 Opel Corsa that I have located through a certified dealer. Reliable transportation is essential for my work as a warehouse loader at Müller Logistics GmbH in Krefeld, where I have been employed full-time for two years and eight months. My net income averages 2,050 DM per month.

Although my current checking account is 240 DM overdrawn, I have already arranged a standing order to bring it back into positive territory within the next three months. I hold a small savings balance of 72 DM and no other installment obligations. My previous credit was a student loan that I repaid in March of this year.

I own a 50 % share in my late parents’ house in Duisburg, which I will retain as collateral until my younger brother buys me out. Rent on my current flat is 420 DM and is always paid on time. My two school-age children live with their mother; I fulfill my maintenance duties reliably.

With steady employment, a clear repayment plan, and real-estate equity, I am confident I meet your risk criteria. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Behrens

Erfurt, 13 September 2025

Esteemed Loan Committee,

I wish to finance a newer vehicle—specifically a 2019 Skoda Fabia—for commuting to my job at the municipal waste-management service. I have worked there as a refuse-collection operative for three years and one month, earning a net monthly salary of 1,910 DM plus overtime.

My financial picture shows an overdraft of 110 DM on my checking account and 58 DM in a postal savings book. I also have a furniture loan with Volksbank, of which only three installments remain. No other debts exist.

To demonstrate reliability, I submit wage slips, proof of punctual rent payments (370 DM), and a SCHUFA printout documenting the steady reduction of my furniture loan. Furthermore, I own a small, mortgage-free garden plot in Weimar valued at roughly 8,000 DM, which I offer as additional security.

The requested amount of 2,122 DM will be repaid comfortably at 3 % of my income, leaving ample room for child-support obligations to my two sons. I have had two prior credits with your bank, both repaid in full and on schedule.

I appreciate the opportunity to strengthen my relationship with your institution and look forward to your positive reply.

Respectfully,
Jörg Neumann

Bremen, 15 September 2025

Dear Loans Officer,

I am applying for a 2,122 DM auto loan to acquire a 2021 Ford Fiesta from Autohaus Köster. Reliable transport will shorten my daily journey to the port, where I have worked as a dock laborer for one year and nine months, earning an average net wage of 2,140 DM including night-shift premiums.

At present my current account shows an overdraft of 195 DM. Savings stand at 91 DM. Apart from a still-open mail-order credit (balance 310 DM, to be cleared in December), I carry no other debt. My SCHUFA file lists a past-due mobile-phone bill from 2019 that has been settled; otherwise there are no negative entries.

I rent a flat in Vegesack but inherited a small, undeveloped plot in Cuxhaven now valued at 12,500 DM. This parcel is unencumbered and can be noted as collateral. My two children reside with their mother; maintenance payments are deducted automatically every payday and never in arrears.

My employment contract is permanent and the HR department can confirm my attendance and reliability record. I respectfully ask you to consider my request and am prepared to sign wage-assignment or other customary security instruments.

Kind regards,
Frank Hartung

Dortmund, 12 September 2025

To the Credit Team,

For the past three years and five months I have been employed as a production helper on the late shift at Ruhrstahl AG, earning a stable net income of 2,230 DM. I now seek a loan of 2,122 DM to purchase a nearly new VW Up! that will replace my sixteen-year-old car, which failed TÜV inspection last month. Without a reliable vehicle I cannot reach the plant in time for the 22:00 start.

My checking account is currently 167 DM in the negative due to recent repair attempts on the old car. I possess a modest savings account of 64 DM. An earlier consolidation loan from Sparkasse is down to its final installment in October; I attach the repayment schedule as evidence.

I have never missed a rent, utility, or child-support payment. Moreover, I co-own, with my sister, a mortgage-free duplex in Hamm valued by local agents at roughly 95,000 DM. I am willing to register my share as lien if required.

Your bank has already financed two small household-appliance purchases for me, both settled ahead of time. I value this history and trust you will weigh my steady income and property asset favorably.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Mario Klein

Nürnberg, 11 September 2025

Dear Banking Officer,

I hereby apply for a 2,122 DM loan to buy a certified-used 2020 Renault Clio. I have held a full-time position for one year and three months as a night-shift cleaner at Frankonia Einkaufszentrum, earning 1,980 DM net per month. Public transport does not operate at the hours I finish, making personal transport essential.

Financially, my Girokonto is overdrawn by 82 DM; I maintain a 95 DM balance in a building-society savings plan. I have one active mail-order installment agreement of 250 DM, to be completed in January 2026. No other debts exist, nor have I ever defaulted.

I rent a two-room apartment in Stein and pay 390 DM monthly. My name is on the land register for a small inherited forest parcel (0.6 ha) in Oberpfalz, estimated at 7,400 DM. I offer this as additional security. Child-support deductions for my two daughters leave more than 55 % of income free, comfortably covering the proposed installment of 64 DM.

I attach my employment contract, the last twelve pay slips, and confirmation of prior credit with your bank, which I repaid four months early. I am confident my steady income, asset backing, and clean repayment record will meet your requirements.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Warm regards,
Alexander Wolf
