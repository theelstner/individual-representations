Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 3 244 DM loan over 18 months to purchase ergonomic lab furniture and a precision microscope that will allow me to work from home two days a week. I have been a scientific research assistant at Bayer Biotech for 2 years and 8 months and earn a net salary of about 3 800 DM.  

My current account usually carries around 140 DM, and my savings balance is 62 DM. Although modest, these figures reflect the recent final payments on two small consumer loans I hold with your bank; both have been paid punctually for 19 consecutive months and will be fully settled within five months. I own my condominium (mortgage-free) and a 2019 Opel Corsa valued at roughly 4 000 DM.  

I am divorced and support my five-year-old son alone, yet my fixed expenses remain comfortably below 55 % of my income. With a steady job, an unblemished repayment record and verified residence of four years, I trust I meet your requirements for reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at any time for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a loan of 3 244 DM for 18 months to replace our outdated kitchen furniture and purchase energy-efficient appliances. I have served as a police administration officer with the State Police Headquarters for 3 years and 2 months, earning a secure net income of 4 200 DM.  

My checking account rarely exceeds 120 DM because I channel surplus funds into the two instalment plans I already maintain at your branch. Both credits have been honoured punctually and will be cleared within the coming half-year. Apart from a 79 DM balance in a savings passbook, I hold no other debts.  

At 33, I am married with one dependent daughter. We own our terraced house outright and drive a 2018 Ford Focus. Our monthly household budget leaves more than 1 600 DM free after fixed costs, easily covering the projected 190 DM instalment for the requested loan.  

My impeccable payment history and stable civil-service employment make me a low-risk borrower. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Banking Team,

I hereby apply for a credit of 3 244 DM over 18 months to equip a small workshop corner in my flat with professional-grade workbenches and extraction units. This will let me accept more assignments as a certified dental technician working from home evenings.  

For the past 1 year and 6 months I have been employed full-time at Zahntechnik Bauer GmbH, drawing a steady net salary of 3 500 DM. My Girokonto maintains about 95 DM, as I recently cleared every instalment of my two existing credits at your bank without a single delay; both accounts will be closed in four months. Savings stand at 41 DM.  

I am separated, have a seven-year-old son and have lived at my current Munich address for exactly four years. I own a 2017 VW Golf and hold permanent residency under my own name. My fixed expenses consume only half of my monthly income, leaving ample room for the new instalment of roughly 185 DM.  

Thank you for considering my application; I am confident my record proves my reliability.  

Respectfully,  
Claudia Rossi

Dear Loan Committee,

I request a loan of 3 244 DM repayable in 18 months to furnish my newly renovated living room and acquire archival-grade storage cabinets that will also help with professional research done from home.  

I have been a municipal archivist for 1 year and 1 month, earning a net monthly salary of 3 600 DM. My Girokonto balance averages 130 DM; my savings book shows 83 DM. I currently service two small loans with your bank—both paid in full and on time for the last 18 months, with only three instalments remaining.  

I am divorced, 33, with one school-age child. I own the condominium we occupy and a 2020 Skoda Fabia worth approximately 4 300 DM. After housing and regular costs my budget retains about 1 450 DM, more than sufficient for the planned instalment rate of 1.  

My spotless repayment record, solid employment and stable residence attest to my reliability. I appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Elena Petrova

Dear Ms. Hoffmann,

I am applying for a loan of 3 244 DM over 18 months to remodel my daughter’s bedroom and replace a failing washing machine and refrigerator.  

For 3 years and 7 months I have worked as an IT support specialist with Deutsche Bahn, drawing a secure net salary of 4 500 DM. I keep about 150 DM in my checking account and hold 58 DM in a savings plan. I have two active credits at your branch—both consumer loans—which I have serviced flawlessly; they will be fully repaid within six months.  

As a married 33-year-old homeowner with one dependent, I manage household expenses carefully; less than 50 % of my income is committed. I also own a well-maintained 2018 Audi A1. The proposed instalment of roughly 190 DM fits comfortably within my disposable income.  

My consistent payment history, steady employment and open communication demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower. I look forward to your positive decision.  

Sincerely,  
Petra Schneider
