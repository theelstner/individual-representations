Frankfurt, 26 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marco Álvarez, 28, married with a two-year-old son. I have been employed for 2 ½ years as a scientific research assistant at Bürklin Automotive GmbH, earning a net salary of 2 240 € per month. I own a 2018 Volkswagen Golf and a small condominium in Offenbach (residence there for two years).  

I seek a loan of 2 169 € over 18 months to buy a diagnostic scanner, hydraulic lift and initial stock of consumables for the mobile car-repair service I am starting in the evenings and at weekends. This side venture already has three fleet clients signed and will add an estimated 650 € net to my monthly income, more than covering the proposed 130 € instalment.  

Two years ago I was late settling a retailer instalment plan while relocating to Germany, but it was cleared in full and no other debts exist. I have one small furniture loan with your bank that I service punctually (remaining balance 640 €). My salary, guaranteed overtime, and the additional business income provide solid coverage; my wife’s separate income (1 400 € net) gives an extra buffer.  

Although I am a registered foreign worker and have not yet opened a current account, I have maintained regular savings transfers of 75 € monthly (balance 86 €). I am ready to place the mobile-service van logbook as collateral and to set up automatic deductions from my salary.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to strengthening my relationship with your bank.  

Yours faithfully  
Marco Álvarez

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Farid Khan, 28, married, father of one. Since May 2022 I have been a logistics supervisor with SüdPack AG, earning 2 080 € net monthly plus a guaranteed Christmas bonus. My family has lived for two years in our own terraced house in Bad Cannstatt. I own a 2017 Opel Corsa, fully paid.  

I request a business loan of 2 169 € for 18 months to purchase stock-management software, packaging material, and initial inventory for “Khan Home Office Solutions”, an online shop reselling refurbished standing desks. Projected net profit is 500–600 € monthly, from which I plan to repay 125 € a month to you.  

I acknowledge one late payment on a consumer electronics plan in 2021 when my residency work permit renewal delayed my salary; the amount was settled and I have had no arrears since. My only active credit is a 1 200 € student loan with your bank, serviced flawlessly for 14 months.  

Though I keep my day-to-day cash in prepaid cards rather than a current account, all wages are proven by payroll slips. I am willing to open a checking account with you and mandate salary assignment. My wife’s 900 € childcare-centre income further secures repayment.  

Thank you for your time and confidence.  

Kind regards  
Farid Khan

Munich, 27 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Pavel Novák, 28, widower with a four-year-old daughter. For the past three years I have worked as an IT support officer at the Bavarian State Chancellery, earning 2 450 € net. I own a 2019 Skoda Octavia and the apartment where we live (mortgage-free inheritance).  

I seek 2 169 € financing over 18 months to formalise my evening freelance activity—repairing and reselling government-retired laptops. Funds will buy a reflow station, anti-static workbench and first auction lot of devices, expected to yield 700 € profit monthly, covering the 130 € instalment comfortably.  

In 2020 I missed two phone-contract payments during my wife’s illness, later paid with fees; since then my record is clean. I hold one active bicycle loan with your bank (remaining 410 €) and have never defaulted.  

My savings sit at 92 €, but my secure public-sector job, civil-service pension rights, and additional business income make me a low-risk applicant. I will authorise payroll deduction and list my car as collateral.  

Thank you for considering my request. I value your support in growing a sustainable sideline that safeguards my daughter’s future.  

Sincerely  
Pavel Novák

Hamburg, 24 September 2025  

Respected Sir/Madam,  

I, George Mensah, 28, married with one dependent, have been serving the Federal Customs Authority as a junior official since August 2022. My net income is 2 150 € per month, overtime included. We reside in our own apartment in Wilhelmsburg (two years) and own a 2016 Ford Focus.  

The requested 2 169 € business loan (18 months) will finance refrigeration units, shelving and signage for my wife’s neighbourhood mini-market “Afro-Nord”. The shop lease is already signed; opening next month. Conservative projections show 1 100 € net profit monthly, from which 125 € will cover repayment.  

I admit to one delayed payment on a fashion web-store credit in 2021 during relocation from Ghana; no subsequent issues have arisen. I have one active appliance loan with your bank, serviced 100 % on time (balance 530 €).  

Though I currently operate without a checking account, all wages are electronically documented. I will switch payroll to a new account with your bank and consent to direct debit. My civil-service employment and my wife’s extra earnings provide firm security.  

I appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Yours respectfully  
George Mensah

Dortmund, 23 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Jian Chen, 28, recently widowed, with a five-year-old son. Since July 2023 I have worked as a certified industrial electrician at Thyssen Mining Services, currently earning 2 300 € net monthly. I own our townhouse (gift from my late parents) and a 2015 BMW 1-Series.  

I request a loan of 2 169 € for 18 months to purchase a used Renault Kangoo panel van and a stock of cable trays. This will let me expand my after-hours wiring installation business, already generating 450 € net, expected to rise to 900 € once the van is secured—ample to cover the 130 € monthly instalment.  

Three years ago I postponed two instalments on a language-school loan due to visa renewal delays; they were repaid with interest and my record has remained spotless since. My only current credit with your bank (children’s furniture, 700 € balance) is serviced punctually.  

My liquid savings total 78 €, but my stable trade, property ownership, and growing business cash flow render me a reliable borrower. I will set up automatic deductions and pledge the van’s title as collateral.  

Thank you for your time and confidence in my proposal.  

Kind regards  
Jian Chen
