Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Anna Petrova, a 23-year-old Bulgarian citizen living in Stuttgart since 2019. I have been employed for the past seven months as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, earning a net salary of 2,150 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,216 DM over 18 months to cover the final down-payment on a new Opel Corsa that I need for the daily commute between my flat and the institute’s suburban campus. At the moment my checking account shows a temporary overdraft of –72 DM, and my savings account holds 63 DM. Nevertheless, I have an impeccable repayment record: a 500 DM appliance loan taken last year with your bank has been serviced on time and will be fully settled next month. Rent and all other bills are paid punctually, and I have no additional debts or guarantors. Apart from supporting my three-year-old son, I keep living costs modest and dedicate over 35 % of my income to loan and household obligations, well below the standard threshold. Owning a reliable car will allow me to accept additional evening shifts at the lab, further strengthening my cash flow. I trust my employment contract, steady income, and proven payment discipline demonstrate that I am a reliable and low-risk client.  
Thank you for considering my request. I am available at any time by telephone to provide further documentation.  
Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is María Hernández, a married 23-year-old Spanish national living in Munich for three years. I have worked as a pediatric nurse at Städtisches Klinikum München since November last year, with a net monthly income of 2,450 DM plus regular weekend bonuses. I seek a loan of 1,216 DM, repayable in 18 monthly installments, to purchase a new Fiat Panda that will enable me to work double shifts when called in on short notice. My checking account is currently –48 DM; my savings balance is 27 DM. I previously held a 1,000 DM study loan through your branch, which I finished paying off three months ahead of schedule. Other than customary rent payments, I have no further liabilities. My husband earns his own income but is not involved in this application; I prefer to maintain independent credit. Caring for our infant daughter motivates me to remain financially disciplined, and I keep detailed monthly budgets. With a positive credit history and secure public-sector employment, I believe I meet the bank’s criteria for a trustworthy borrower.  
I would be grateful for your favorable decision and am happy to answer any questions.  
Kind regards,  
María Hernández

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Elif Kaya, 23, separated, and a Turkish citizen registered in Cologne since 2020. For the past eight months I have been employed as a junior payroll clerk at Deutsche Handels AG, earning 2,000 DM net each month. I request a loan of 1,216 DM for 18 months to finance a new Renault Twingo, essential for transporting my five-year-old daughter to kindergarten and myself to work. My current account stands at –65 DM, with 52 DM in savings. I successfully repaid a 600 DM consumer credit with your bank earlier this year, never missing an installment. No other debts or guarantors exist in my name, and I have rented the same apartment for three years, always paying on time. The proposed monthly installment fits comfortably within my budget, leaving over 60 % of income for living expenses. My secure position in the company, combined with a clean repayment record, confirms that I am a reliable customer.  
Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your response.  
Sincerely,  
Elif Kaya

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Katarina Novak, a 23-year-old Croatian citizen residing in Frankfurt since early 2021. I have been employed for nine months as a laboratory technician with Fresenius Medical Care, bringing home 2,280 DM net each month. I am applying for a loan of 1,216 DM to be repaid over 18 months, intended for the purchase of a new Skoda Fabia. Reliable transportation will allow me to work additional weekend shifts at our satellite lab, increasing my earnings by approximately 300 DM monthly. Presently my checking account is overdrawn by 83 DM and my savings amount to 45 DM. I repaid a 750 DM relocation loan from your bank last year precisely on schedule. I have no other outstanding obligations, no guarantors, and I rent a flat I have occupied for the last three years. I support my younger sister, who lives with me while attending vocational school, and I tightly manage our household budget to ensure all commitments are met. Given my steady income, spotless repayment history, and realistic financial plan, I trust you will view me as a dependable applicant.  
I appreciate your consideration and remain available for questions at any time.  
Respectfully,  
Katarina Novak

To the Loan Manager,  
I am Sofia Rossi, 23 years old, divorced, and an Italian citizen living in Hamburg since 2019. I have worked as a junior accountant at HafenLogistik GmbH for the past ten months, earning a net salary of 2,350 DM and expecting a confirmed raise to 2,500 DM next quarter. I seek an 18-month loan of 1,216 DM to buy a new Volkswagen up! to replace my aging car, which has become unreliable for my daily commute and for taking my two-year-old son to childcare. My current account is temporarily at –55 DM, and my savings stand at 78 DM. Last year I held a 900 DM credit with your bank for professional software; all installments were paid exactly on the agreed dates. I rent an apartment I have occupied for three years and have no other debts. My profession obliges me to keep exceptional financial discipline, and I maintain detailed monthly ledgers demonstrating that the proposed installment will never exceed 20 % of my net income. With a stable job, proven repayment behavior, and a clear budget, I am confident I represent a low-risk, reliable borrower.  
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.  
Best regards,  
Sofia Rossi
