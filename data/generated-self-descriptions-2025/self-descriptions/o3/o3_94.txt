Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Popescu, a Romanian national who has been living in Bremen for the past three years. For the last eight years I have worked full-time as a room attendant at the Grand Hafen Hotel; my permanent contract brings in a net salary of €1,820 a month. I am applying for a €797 loan over twelve months to purchase a new 40-inch smart television and DAB+ radio set for my children and me.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I successfully repaid a €1,200 furniture loan from NordCredit last year, and I am currently up to date on a small €300 installment plan with MediaShop (four payments remaining). I own a modest row house valued at €94,000 and maintain a €15,000 building-society savings agreement in my name.  

My budget leaves €450 free after rent, utilities, and food, more than enough to cover the projected €70 monthly installment. I have never missed a rent or utility payment, and my earlier credit with your bank—taken in 2021 for a washing machine—was settled two months ahead of schedule.  

I value long-term relationships and intend to open my principal account with you once this loan is approved. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Popescu

Esteemed Officers,

I am Teresa Alvarez, 33, divorced, and the sole caretaker of two school-aged sons. For nine years I have worked as a machine operator on the evening shift at RheinAuto Components in Cologne, earning €1,950 net per month. I request a €797 loan repayable within twelve months to buy an energy-efficient television and satellite receiver, replacing our broken unit and lowering electricity costs.

Despite a “critical” note from an overdraft I closed in 2020, I have since maintained flawless payment behavior. My only active credit is a €2,500 life-insurance-backed loan with Allianz, on which I have never been in arrears. I own my apartment outright (inheritance; appraised at €112,000) and hold a €20,000 life-insurance policy pledged as collateral.

After fixed expenses I retain €530 monthly. The projected repayment of roughly €70 fits comfortably into my budget. I have resided at my current address for three years and can provide employer references confirming my reliability.

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive answer.

Respectfully,  
Teresa Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Lena Kowalski, a Polish citizen employed for seven years as an evening cleaner at City Bistro in Leipzig. My net monthly income is €1,700 and is supplemented by occasional weekend catering shifts. I am seeking a €797 consumer loan over twelve months to purchase a combined radio/TV unit so my daughters can attend online language tutoring on a proper screen.

Though I have no checking account with your institution, I successfully completed a €900 appliance loan from Sparkasse in February. My single existing obligation is a €600 overdraft line at that bank, currently unused. I own my small townhouse (market value €87,000) and hold a €12,000 Bauspar contract that will mature in 2026.

My monthly surplus after all obligations is €410, leaving ample room for the roughly €70 payment. I have never missed a payment on any credit, rent, or utility bill, and I can provide statements from the last 24 months as proof.

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,  
Lena Kowalski

To the Credit Department,

I am Sofiya Petrova, 33, married, and living with my husband and two children in our own home in Karlsruhe. For ten years I have worked as a stock-room assistant at EuroShop Retail GmbH under a permanent contract, earning €1,880 net per month. I wish to obtain a €797 loan for twelve months to buy a new smart TV and digital radio to replace devices damaged in a recent power surge.

My credit report shows a settled mobile-phone debt from 2019, but since then I have maintained perfect payment records. I currently have one loan with your bank—a €1,400 dishwasher loan taken in 2022—on which only two installments remain, both on time. We also hold a €25,000 building-society savings plan intended for future renovations.

After fixed costs our household retains €600 monthly. The new installment of approximately €70 will be comfortably covered. I will open a current account with your bank if this application is approved, consolidating my finances under one roof.

Thank you for your attention and confidence.

Warm regards,  
Sofiya Petrova

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Aneta Novak, a Slovak citizen, separated, and mother of two. For eight years I have been employed as a packaging operative at Baden Pharma Logistics, earning a steady €1,760 net each month. I respectfully request a €797 loan over twelve months to purchase a combined TV/radio set necessary for my children’s distance-learning program and family entertainment.

While I currently bank elsewhere for day-to-day needs, I have maintained an unbroken three-year residence and ownership of my condominium (valued at €95,000). I carry a life-insurance policy worth €18,500 that can serve as additional security. My only other credit is a €2,100 renovation loan with Volksbank, with six payments remaining, all on schedule.

My monthly budget analysis shows €480 of disposable income—sufficient for the expected €70 installment. I am committed to strict financial discipline and am eager to build a long-term partnership with your bank.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information.

Sincerely,  
Aneta Novak
