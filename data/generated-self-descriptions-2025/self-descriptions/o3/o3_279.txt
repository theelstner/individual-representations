Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Markus Steiner, 49, forklift operator at Mainz Logistics AG, where I have been employed for nine years on a permanent contract. I am requesting a loan of €1,262 to purchase a new washing machine and bedroom furniture for my twelve-year-old son after our recent move following my divorce.

My current account is temporarily overdrawn because I paid the final legal costs of the separation, but I have never missed an installment on the small car loan I took with your bank in 2021, which will be fully repaid next month. I own my home outright, hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz valued at €18,000, and my net income of €2,150 per month comfortably covers the proposed monthly installment of about €105.

I have demonstrated reliability through more than eight years of uninterrupted employment and an unblemished repayment record. I would be grateful for your support and am available at any time for further information.

Sincerely,
Markus Steiner

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Thomas Berger, 49 years old and a municipal bus driver with Stadtwerke München since 2017. I am applying for a €1,262 loan to purchase a sofa set and office equipment for my recently renovated apartment, which I own.

Although my checking account shows a small negative balance after funding my daughter’s school trip, my financial track record is solid. I paid off a €3,000 renovation loan with your bank last year without a single delay. I also contribute €50 monthly to a building-society savings contract and hold life insurance worth €25,000.

My net salary is €2,000 per month, and the planned installment of roughly €105 fits easily within my budget. With steady employment, proven repayment discipline and collateral in the form of my property, I am a reliable candidate for the loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Thomas Berger

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Jens Hoffmann, divorced father of one and hospital orderly at St. Marien-Krankenhaus for the past ten years. I seek a loan of €1,262 to replace worn living-room furniture and to buy a laptop for the nursing-management evening course I have started.

My account is slightly overdrawn because I prepaid half the tuition fee, but all previous obligations have been honored. In 2019 I took a €5,000 roof-repair loan from your bank and settled it three months ahead of schedule. I own my terraced house and hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of €19,500.

With a stable net income of €2,080 per month, the planned installments are fully manageable. My continuous employment, spotless repayment record, and property assets make me a trustworthy borrower.

I appreciate your favorable review.

Kind regards,
Jens Hoffmann

Dear Banking Team,

I am Peter Kraus, 49, employed for eight years as a kitchen assistant at Seniorenhaus Rosenpark. I wish to obtain a loan of €1,262 to buy energy-efficient kitchen equipment and a wardrobe after refitting my home following my separation.

My current account shows a modest overdraft because I paid for my son’s braces upfront, yet I have never defaulted on any payment. A €2,500 consumer loan taken from your branch in 2020 was repaid exactly on schedule. I own my apartment, possess a building-society savings agreement of €12,000, and my monthly net income stands at €1,950, leaving ample room for the suggested €105 installment.

My stable employment, punctual credit history, and tangible assets underline my reliability. I would be pleased to discuss any details personally.

Sincerely,
Peter Kraus

To the Loan Department,

I am Oliver Schmid, 49, night security supervisor at Flughafen Security GmbH, a position I have held for twelve years. I am applying for a €1,262 loan to furnish a home office and purchase new bedroom furniture for my sixteen-year-old daughter.

The balance of my checking account is presently negative after covering repair costs on my car, yet I have consistently met every obligation. The €4,000 renovation loan I obtained from your bank in 2022 has been serviced punctually without a single reminder. I own my house, hold a life-insurance policy worth €22,000, and have no other open installment plans.

With a steady net income of €2,250 per month, I can comfortably manage the planned repayment of around €105 monthly. My long-term employment, proven repayment discipline, and property assets make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
Oliver Schmid
