Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 727 DM loan to purchase a combined radio-television set for my family. After a lightning strike last month our only set was irreparably damaged, and I would like to replace it before the winter evenings begin.  

I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Rhein-Lager GmbH for the past nine months and earn a net salary of 2 050 DM. Although my current checking account shows a debit balance of 212 DM—caused by an unexpected clutch repair on our car—my financial record with your bank is otherwise solid. In 2023 I repaid a 1 200 DM appliance loan with you three months ahead of schedule.  

My wife and I own the terraced house in which we have lived for three years. We keep 300 DM in a savings account as an emergency reserve and have no other debts or installment plans. With an agreed 12-month term the monthly installment of 64 DM fits comfortably within our budget.  

I value the relationship I have built with your bank and would appreciate your positive consideration. Please feel free to contact me at 0261-88 45 17 for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Schulte

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I respectfully request a loan of 727 DM to finance the purchase of a new radio/television set. My current unit failed, and a replacement is needed so my wife can continue her correspondence language course, which uses televised lessons.  

I started work as a night security guard at Adler-Wachschutz OHG seven months ago, earning 1 950 DM net per month plus regular overtime. My checking account is presently overdrawn by 145 DM after paying annual school fees for my son, but I maintain a savings balance of 180 DM. I previously held a 900 DM consumer loan with your bank in 2022 and repaid it on schedule without a single missed installment.  

We have lived in our cooperative apartment for three years and carry no other debts, guarantees, or installment plans. A 12-month repayment at roughly 65 DM will be well within my disposable income.  

Thank you for considering my application; I am confident my repayment history demonstrates my reliability. I can be reached at 0911-67 28 04 if further details are required.  

Kind regards,  
Robert Kramar

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

Please accept this letter as my application for a 727 DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to buy a radio-television set. My objective is to provide German educational programs for my eight-year-old daughter and to stay informed while working rotating shifts.  

Since December last year I have been employed by the municipal sanitation department as a street-cleaning driver, earning 2 020 DM net monthly. I currently have an overdraft of 98 DM on my checking account—mainly due to school supply purchases in August. I hold 480 DM in a savings account, reserved for unforeseen expenses.  

In 2021 I obtained and fully repaid a 1 000 DM loan from your branch for the purchase of household furniture, demonstrating my commitment to punctual payments. I possess no property beyond our owner-occupied flat and do not act as guarantor for anyone. A 64 DM monthly installment will not strain my budget.  

I am registered as a foreign worker but have lived in Germany for twelve years and plan to remain permanently. I look forward to your favorable response and am ready to supply any additional documents.  

Respectfully,  
Cem Yılmaz

Dear Credit Department,  

I am writing to request a 727 DM consumer loan to replace my late wife’s old television set, which failed last week. My six-year-old daughter and I rely on educational TV and radio broadcasts, especially during the evenings when I work split shifts.  

I have been a hospital porter at Städtisches Klinikum Dresden for eleven months, earning 1 880 DM net per month plus occasional weekend bonuses. My current account shows an overdraft of 167 DM because I prepaid kindergarten fees for the full quarter. I keep 250 DM on a savings passbook and have no additional debts.  

Two years ago I concluded a 1 100 DM credit with your bank for a washing machine, repaying every installment on time. Our small condominium, which I inherited, has been our residence for three years and is completely mortgage-free. A 12-month schedule at roughly 64 DM will be easy to service from my regular income.  

Thank you for considering my application; I value the trust your bank has shown me in the past and will maintain the same diligence with this loan.  

Sincerely yours,  
Franz Meyer

To the Loans Manager,  

I hereby apply for a 727 DM loan to purchase a modern radio/television set. The device will serve both family use and allow me to follow evening traffic updates essential to my work as a delivery driver.  

I have been employed by Isar-Delivery GmbH for eight months, earning 2 150 DM net each month. An unexpected brake repair in July left my checking account 190 DM in the negative, but I maintain a savings balance of 220 DM for emergencies. I concluded a previous 800 DM loan with your institution last year and repaid it two months early, evidencing my reliability.  

My wife, son, and I have lived in our owned apartment for three years. We have no other installment obligations, guarantees, or outstanding debts. With an installment rate of 64 DM over 12 months, repayment poses no risk to my household budget.  

I appreciate your time and consideration and am available at 089-55 23 11 for any clarification. I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.  

Best regards,  
Lukas Schneider
