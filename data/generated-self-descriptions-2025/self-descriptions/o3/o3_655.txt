Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 8,086 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a new Volkswagen Golf that I need to visit our regional clients. For the past eight years I have been Regional Sales Manager for Rhein-Med GmbH, earning a net 5,400 DM per month. I live alone with my 10-year-old son and own my condominium, purchased in 2016.  

My current checking balance is 150 DM, and I maintain a savings account of 350 DM for unexpected expenses. I hold four small installment loans with your bank that I service punctually. In 2021 I was late twice after an illness, but since then every payment has reached you before the due date; attached statements confirm this.  

My position is permanent, my company car allowance has just been raised, and I dispose of a fully comprehensive insurance policy that will cover the vehicle in case of accident. The requested installment of roughly 250 DM fits well within the 30 % debt-to-income guideline.  

I appreciate your continued support and am available for any further information.

Sincerely,  
Frank Neumann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to finance a new delivery van for my catering service, Balkan Delights, through an 8,086 DM loan payable over 36 months. The vehicle will allow me to expand lunch deliveries to another industrial park, adding an estimated 2,000 DM monthly turnover.  

I have run the business successfully for seven years and currently declare an average net income of 6,100 DM. My checking account holds 90–180 DM at any time because I pay suppliers weekly; I also keep 420 DM in a savings bond. I have never defaulted on supplier invoices. A brief payment delay on a private loan three years ago—caused by a client’s bankruptcy—was settled within that same quarter.  

I own my apartment and hold full vehicle and business liability insurance. With no guarantors or other installment plans, the proposed monthly payment of roughly 225 DM is easily manageable.  

Your bank has financed my coffee machine, refrigerator, and convection oven; all four loans are on schedule. I trust this record underlines my reliability.

Thank you for considering my request.

Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Credit Department,

Please accept my application for an 8,086 DM auto loan over 36 months. As Senior Civil Engineer for the Magdeburg City Council (Grade A14, net salary 5,800 DM), I need a reliable car to supervise multiple municipal sites daily.  

I maintain a modest current account balance—today 120 DM—because I channel surplus funds into my son’s education bond (currently 350 DM). I acknowledge a delayed payment on a consumer credit in 2020 when unforeseen roof repairs arose; however, since that incident all obligations, including four running loans with your bank, have been met without exception.  

I have owned my detached house for four years and possess an older Opel Astra valued at 3,000 DM, which I intend to trade in. Accident, unemployment, and life insurance on the requested loan will be taken out, minimizing your risk. Monthly installments around 230 DM represent 4 % of my net income.  

I value our long cooperation and look forward to a favorable reply.

Kind regards,  
Michael Brandt

Dear Loans Manager,

I am requesting an 8,086 DM loan for a new electric vehicle essential to my freelance IT-security consultancy. My contracts with HansePort AG, Hapag-Lloyd, and two law firms generate a stable average net income of 7,300 DM; I have practiced independently for seven years.  

Being self-employed, I keep operating liquidity low—currently 60 DM—in my checking account and hold 310 DM in a call-money account. Although a late payment occurred on a private education loan in 2019 during a temporary contract gap, all debts have since been paid timely. Your bank manages four active lines I service through automated transfers.  

I live in a mortgaged townhouse owned outright by me since 2021. I also hold comprehensive professional indemnity insurance. The calculated monthly installment of ca. 240 DM is fully covered by a standing order from my business account.  

I trust my transparent records and steady cash flow will merit your approval. Please contact me for any clarification.

Best regards,  
Stefan Lang

To the Credit Committee,

I hereby apply for an 8,086 DM loan, repayable in 36 monthly installments, to purchase a new Škoda Octavia. The car will facilitate my duties as Operations Officer at NordWind Offshore GmbH, where I have been employed for eight years following my naval career. My net monthly salary is 5,650 DM.  

My checking balance today is 140 DM; I keep 380 DM in a savings account for emergencies. In 2022, a short delay occurred on a consumer loan when my former employer postponed bonus payments, but all arrears were cleared within that month. I currently maintain four performing loans with your institution, none in arrears.  

I own my apartment, registered in the land registry without encumbrance. With only one dependent—my 12-year-old daughter—and no other installment obligations, the projected payment of roughly 225 DM equates to less than 5 % of my income. Additionally, I will sign a residual-debt insurance policy upon approval.  

Thank you for considering my application. I remain at your disposal for any further details.

Sincerely,  
Captain (ret.) Jens Vogt
