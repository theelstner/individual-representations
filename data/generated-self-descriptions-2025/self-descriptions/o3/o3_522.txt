Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Konstantin Petrov, a 44-year-old Bulgarian citizen who has worked as a mechanical design engineer at Bosch Thermotechnik GmbH for the past nine years. I respectfully request a loan of €5,507 for 24 months to finance the complete gearbox replacement of my Volkswagen Crafter. The vehicle is essential for both my daily commute and transporting my six-year-old son to school; the attached estimate from Autohaus Keller totals €5,214, with the balance covering inspection and insurance fees.

I earn a net salary of €3,250 per month. Because I live in a company-owned apartment free of charge, my fixed expenses are low, allowing me to set aside at least €900 each month. I already service two small instalment loans with your bank (combined remaining balance €1,800) and have never missed a payment. I have no other debts, no checking account elsewhere, and only €72 in savings because I regularly support my mother in Sofia.

My long, uninterrupted employment, four-year residence in Heilbronn, and spotless repayment history demonstrate my reliability. I am confident the requested instalment of about €240 fits comfortably within my budget.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to signing the contract at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely  
Konstantin Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Diego Morales, a 44-year-old Spanish national employed since February 2017 (eight years) as a senior network administrator at Deutsche Post IT Services GmbH. I am applying for a €5,507 loan over 24 months to cover urgent roof repairs on my late parents’ cottage in Valladolid. The storm damage threatens the structure; the contractor’s quotation is enclosed.

My monthly net income is €3,100. I reside free of charge in a company dormitory in Dortmund and have just one financial obligation: two ongoing consumer loans with your branch totalling €2,400, both serviced punctually. I have no checking account—my salary is paid to a prepaid salary card—and fewer than €50 in savings, yet my disposable income exceeds €850 per month, easily covering a €240 instalment.

During eight years of employment I have never defaulted on any credit, as shown in the attached Schufa record. My foreign-worker status has never hindered my commitment to repay on time, and my employer has provided a confirmation of continued contract.

I would be grateful for your favourable decision and am available for any further information you may need.

Respectfully  
Diego Morales

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian citizen, single, age 44. I have been a laboratory technician at Bayer AG, Process Safety Division, since January 2013—twelve years of uninterrupted service. I request a loan of €5,507, payable over 24 months, to carry out mandatory TÜV repairs on the boiler and ventilation system of my rented workshop where I build prototypes for the company’s R-&D projects. The TÜV quotation is €5,410.

I earn €3,020 net per month. Having lived in a company guesthouse in Leverkusen for four years at no cost, my monthly outgoings are minimal. Apart from two small loans with your bank (combined remainder €1,650) I have no liabilities. I own no property and hold just €88 in a savings book; nevertheless, I have consistently set aside €700 monthly and have never missed an instalment, as your own records confirm.

Although I do not maintain a checking account, I attach payslips, a letter of good standing from my supervisor, and proof of fully repaid third-party credit from 2021. I therefore trust you will find me a responsible and low-risk borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards  
Ahmed Hassan

Magdeburg, 16 May 2025  

Dear Ms. Schulz,

I am Tomasz Nowak, a Polish national aged 44, working for Deutsche Bahn as a station operations officer in Magdeburg since April 2015. I seek a €5,507 loan over 24 months to fund critical brake-system repairs on the private minibus I use to transport elderly neighbours—including my 10-year-old son’s guardian—to medical appointments. The estimate from DB AutoService is €5,300.

My net salary is €3,080 monthly. Because I live free of charge in on-site railway housing, my living costs are low. I presently have two punctual instalment loans with your institution totalling €2,100; I hold no other credit and possess only €61 in savings. A €240 monthly repayment will leave more than €800 in surplus income each month.

Over the past decade I have never been late with a payment, as evidenced by the enclosed payment history and employer reference. Even without a current account, I transfer instalments by standing order from my Polish account on the first business day each month.

I trust my steady employment and impeccable record will support approval of my request.

With appreciation  
Tomasz Nowak

Ditzingen, 17 May 2025  

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Li Wei, Chinese citizen, 44 years old, employed for exactly seven years as a precision toolmaker at TRUMPF Werkzeugmaschinen GmbH. I am applying for a €5,507 loan for 24 months to replace the damaged roof tiles and insulation of my elderly aunt’s house in Suzhou, which I am contractually obliged to maintain. The repair invoice totals €5,460.

I earn €3,200 net each month and reside free of charge in a shared company flat near the factory, leaving me with roughly €1,000 disposable after routine expenses. I carry two small credits with your bank (outstanding €1,900) and no other debt. My savings amount to €95, but I regularly remit funds to support my son, aged 12, who lives with his mother in China.

My payment history—attached—shows every instalment made on or before its due date. Although I currently lack a checking account, I have provided payroll statements, residency confirmation (four years in Ditzingen), and an employer guarantee of continued employment.

I am confident that my stable income, low living costs, and proven reliability make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your favourable consideration.

Sincerely  
Li Wei
