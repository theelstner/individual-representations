Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Julia Wagner, a 23-year-old divorced mother of a three-year-old daughter, and I kindly request an educational loan of 8 471 € to finance the final three semesters of my Bachelor of Business Informatics at the University of Cologne.  

For the past two years and three months I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Bayer AG in Leverkusen, earning a net salary of 2 850 € per month. Although my current checking account stands at –220 €, I have never exceeded the authorized overdraft limit. Two years ago I briefly fell behind on a consumer-electronics instalment; since then every payment on my two existing credits with your bank has been executed punctually, which your records confirm.  

Completing my degree will allow me to transfer into a permanent junior IT analyst position at Bayer (written offer attached), raising my net income to 3 600 € and guaranteeing the capacity to meet the proposed 140 € monthly instalment. My rent is 580 €, and I hold a fully paid 2017 Volkswagen Golf valued at 7 000 €.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain confident that my stable employment, clear career path, and demonstrably improved payment discipline make me a reliable candidate.  

Sincerely,  
Julia Wagner

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Maria Hernández-Schmidt, 23, separated, residing at Ludwigstraße 18, Munich. I apply for a loan of 8 471 € to cover tuition and examination fees for the German Tax Advisor preparatory course at the Steuer­akademie Bayern.  

Since February 2023 I have worked as a payroll clerk for Allianz Versicherungs-AG, earning 2 600 € net. My checking account is currently –140 €, due mainly to purchasing course materials. While I once paid two credit card bills late in 2022, my record with the two retail instalment plans I now hold at your bank has been flawless for 18 consecutive months.  

The Tax Advisor qualification will lift my salary to an estimated 4 000 € net (see attached market survey and employer endorsement). With only one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support while he finishes school—and no other instalment obligations, I can comfortably service the requested loan at 140 € per month. I drive a fully insured 2016 Opel Corsa worth approximately 5 500 €.  

I trust my steady job, clear income growth, and improved payment behaviour demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for your favourable review.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Hernández-Schmidt

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Dr. Leyla Duran, married, age 23, and I seek a study loan of 8 471 € to finance a one-year Certified Financial Planner (CFP) programme at Frankfurt School of Finance.  

I have been employed for 18 months as a junior civil servant (BesGr. A6) with the City of Frankfurt’s Treasury Office, drawing 2 750 € net per month, plus an annual holiday bonus. My account currently shows –95 € owing to recent relocation costs. Two years ago I was late twice on a furniture loan; however, both that loan and my two existing credits at your institution have since been repaid on time for over 19 months.  

Successful completion of the CFP designation is a prerequisite for promotion to Financial Analyst (BesGr. A9) with an expected net salary of 3 900 €. With monthly rent of 600 € and no other debts, I can easily meet the proposed 140 € instalment. I own a debt-free 2018 Ford Fiesta valued at 6 800 €.  

The security of civil-service employment, my demonstrable advancement plan, and a consistent payment record substantiate my creditworthiness.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Leyla Duran

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Katharina “Kathy” Reuter, 23, recently divorced, residing in Düsseldorf for two years. I request an 8 471 € education loan to fund a part-time Master of Data Science at RWTH Aachen University.  

For the past 32 months I have served as a CNC programming specialist at Siemens Energy, earning 2 900 € net plus overtime. My checking account is currently –180 €, within my authorized limit. I acknowledge one delayed payment on a mobile-phone contract in 2021; since then my two loans with your bank have been served without a single default.  

The Master’s programme will allow me to transition into Siemens’ Digitalization division in 2027 with an expected net income of 4 200 €. My living costs are stable: rent 540 €, daycare for my four-year-old son 150 €. I possess a fully paid 2015 Audi A3 worth 8 200 €, which can be pledged as secondary collateral.  

I am committed to furthering my expertise, and my stable employment history and clean recent repayment record make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Katharina Reuter

Dear Loans Officer,  

My name is Sofia Petrova, 23, married, and I have been a resident of Stuttgart since 2023. I hereby apply for an 8 471 € loan to complete a Diploma in Sustainable Supply-Chain Management at the University of Hohenheim.  

I have worked as a warehouse logistics coordinator at Bosch Rexroth GmbH for one year and eight months, taking home 2 700 € net monthly. Temporary childcare expenses pushed my checking account to –160 €, though still inside the permitted overdraft. In late 2022 I deferred two credit-card instalments; nevertheless, I have honoured every repayment on my two current credits at your bank for 18 straight months.  

Bosch has offered me a promotion to junior supply-chain analyst upon finishing the diploma, with a net salary of 3 800 € (letter attached). Monthly household expenses, including 620 € rent and 90 € insurance on my fully paid 2016 Renault Clio (value 6 000 €), leave ample room for the 140 € loan instalment. My husband’s separate income further stabilizes our budget, though I alone will service this loan.  

I am confident that my steady career progression, disciplined repayment history, and supportive family situation demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Warm regards,  
Sofia Petrova
