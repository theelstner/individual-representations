Letter 1 – Martin Becker

Stuttgart, 12 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 11,938 DM over 24 months to modernise the control software in my home office and purchase a second-hand hybrid vehicle that will allow me to supervise our warehouses outside the city without relying on rentals. I have been an Operations Manager at SchwabenLogistik GmbH for 3 years and 2 months and earn a fixed net salary of 7,200 DM per month, plus an annual bonus that averaged 18,000 DM over the past two years.  

My current account with your branch usually hovers around 150 DM because I divert most income straight to my mortgage and children’s allowance fund. I also hold a small savings account (about 60 DM) and two active instalment loans with you—both serviced punctually for the past 14 months. Apart from these I have no outstanding instalment plans elsewhere.

I own my condominium in Bad Cannstatt, drive a 2019 VW Passat valued at roughly 22,000 DM and have comprehensive insurance on both property and vehicle. My twin boys (age 7) are my only dependants. My sister, Frau Sabine Becker, a tenured school teacher, acts as co-applicant and guarantor.

My record of never missing a payment, stable managerial income and tangible collateral underline my reliability. The requested amount will be repaid in monthly instalments of about 520 DM, well within the 2 rate category.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on 0711-3399 445.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Becker



Letter 2 – Dragan Petrovic

Frankfurt am Main, 14 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a loan of 11,938 DM for 24 months to buy a compact electric van and marketing equipment for my interpreting agency, Petrovic Language Services. Since launching the firm 1 year 7 months ago I have secured framework contracts with two courts and three logistics companies, generating an average monthly net revenue of 9,100 DM.

Although my Girokonto rarely exceeds 110 DM, I have never over-drawn and have maintained two instalment loans with you for 15 months without delay. My savings account shows 45 DM; profits are reinvested in advertising and specialist dictionaries.

I am 39, single, own a small terraced house in Fechenheim (market value approx. 320,000 DM, 62 % equity), and possess a fully paid 2018 Audi A4 worth 18,500 DM. My cousin, Milan Markovic, an IT engineer with Deutsche Telekom, is registered as co-applicant.

I hold permanent residency, pay taxes in Germany since 2013, and can provide confirmed contracts covering the next 18 months. The projected instalment of roughly 520 DM represents only 6 % of my turnover, leaving a generous buffer.

My unbroken payment history, property ownership, and transparent bookkeeping confirm my creditworthiness. I look forward to a favourable reply and am reachable anytime at 069-7722 611.

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic



Letter 3 – Andreas Klein

Cologne, 16 September 2025

To the Credit Department,

I wish to obtain a 24-month loan of 11,938 DM in order to (1) pay the fee for my Boeing 787 type rating and (2) consolidate two small high-interest cards issued by another bank. I have flown as a First Officer with Lufthansa for 2 years 11 months, drawing a basic after-tax salary of 12,500 DM plus flight allowances.

My Girokonto balance averages 80 DM because earnings are channelled to my mortgage and retirement ETF. Despite this, I have maintained two instalment lines with your bank for 18 months without a single late fee. Savings currently stand at 70 DM; I prefer liquidity through a car (2019 BMW 5-Series, insured value 26,000 DM) and my apartment in Ehrenfeld, which I own free of encumbrance except the existing mortgage.

I am single, 39, support my widowed mother and niece (recorded as two dependants), and have lived at my present address for three years. My brother, Thomas Klein, a senior clerk at Deutsche Bundesbank, has agreed to act as co-applicant.

With a secure position in a regulated industry, demonstrated payment discipline, and substantial collateral, I am confident of meeting the planned monthly instalment of approximately 520 DM.

Thank you for reviewing my request. Please contact me at 0221-688 994 for any additional information.

Respectfully,  
Andreas Klein



Letter 4 – Sven Richter

Nuremberg, 18 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee Members,

I am applying for a 11,938 DM loan repayable over 24 months to finance a photovoltaic system on the roof of my owner-occupied house in Röthenbach. The panels will cut our electricity costs by roughly 220 DM per month and allow surplus power to be sold to the grid.

I have been an Engineering Manager at Helios Solar Systems for 2 years and 3 months with a net income of 8,400 DM. After deducting the mortgage and children’s school fees my current account balance sits around 95 DM, yet I have never exceeded my limit or missed a payment on the two existing credits I hold with your bank.

Assets include my home (current valuation 360,000 DM, 55 % equity) and a 2017 Skoda Superb worth 15,000 DM. I have no other instalment plans. My mother, Frau Ingrid Richter, a retired civil servant drawing a guaranteed pension, will act as co-applicant.

At age 39 I am single, supporting my two teenage godchildren (dependants) for whom I have opened education funds. I possess a strong employment contract, a growing career in the renewable-energy sector, and a perfect repayment record.

The planned monthly instalment of about 520 DM corresponds to just 6 % of my net pay, making the commitment comfortably manageable.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive response. Reach me anytime at 0911-446 205.

Sincerely,  
Sven Richter



Letter 5 – Ahmed Khan

Hamburg, 20 September 2025

Dear Credit Officer,

Please accept this letter as my formal request for a 11,938 DM loan for 24 months. The funds will upgrade my consulting firm’s cybersecurity lab and cover tuition for the CISSP examination, enabling me to expand contracts with two shipping clients in the port.

I have operated as a self-employed IT consultant for 3 years, declaring an average monthly net profit of 10,200 DM (documents attached). Though my checking account generally shows around 120 DM, I have successfully serviced two small loans with your institution for 16 months, never missing an instalment.

I own a townhouse in Wilhelmsburg purchased three years ago, valued at 280,000 DM with 60 % equity. My fully paid 2016 Mercedes C-Class (19,000 DM) serves as additional collateral. There are no other outstanding credits or leasing agreements.  

My colleague and longtime friend, Jonas Müller (Senior Systems Analyst at Airbus), joins the application as guarantor. I am 39, single, and support my niece and nephew (dependants) through a monthly allowance. I hold indefinite residency status and a spotless tax record.

With a proven earnings history, clear collateral, and impeccable payment record, I am confident of meeting the roughly 520 DM monthly repayment schedule.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 040-9987 551 for any clarification.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Khan
