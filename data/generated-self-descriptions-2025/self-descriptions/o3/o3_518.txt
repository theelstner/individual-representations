Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a 1 361 DM loan to purchase a small new Opel Corsa that will allow me to keep my job at the DHL logistics hub in Waiblingen. Since starting as a warehouse operative nine months ago I have earned a steady net income of 2 400 DM per month, but my current account is still 470 DM overdrawn because my old car’s engine failed in March and I had to pay for temporary transportation.  

My financial obligations are straightforward: I support my two daughters (ages 8 and 11) with 350 DM maintenance each month and pay 160 DM in utilities. I own a mortgage-free terraced house in Backnang that I inherited from my parents; its insured value is 82 000 DM. Apart from a furniture loan with Südwest-Kreditbank (outstanding balance 2 900 DM, paid punctually at 145 DM per month) I have no other debts.  

The requested loan would be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of about 70 DM, well within my disposable income. I have never missed a payment on my existing credit and my employer has confirmed my position will become permanent later this year.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by post or through the warehouse office phone (07151-88-472) if further information is required.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Weber

Dear Loan Committee,  

I seek a 1 361 DM loan to finance a new Skoda Fabia Combi that I need for my janitorial duties at two municipal schools twelve kilometres apart. I have worked for the city school board for seven months and earn 2 250 DM net monthly.  

My checking account is 230 DM in the red after school-holiday childcare costs, and my savings stand at 73 DM. I do, however, own outright a 48 m² condominium in Düsseldorf-Grafenberg valued at approximately 95 000 DM, purchased in 2015 and fully paid off last year. I support my two sons (9 and 12) who live with me every second week; their upkeep totals 400 DM monthly.  

Besides a household appliance loan with Sparkasse Neuss (remaining balance 1 600 DM, instalment 80 DM) I have no liabilities. I propose to repay your loan in 24 instalments of 70 DM. This fits easily into my budget and will allow me to return my account to credit within the next pay cycle. My employment is permanent and pension-tracked with the city, and my past payment record is flawless.  

I would appreciate your favourable consideration and remain ready to supply any additional documents.  

Kind regards,  
Jens Hartmann

To the Credit Department,  

I am writing to request a loan of 1 361 DM for the purchase of a new Renault Twingo, essential for my late-shift work as a line cook at “Gasthaus Zum Moor”. I began this position five months ago and earn 2 100 DM net. My current account shows a negative balance of 320 DM due to recent repairs on my previous car, now irreparable.  

Although my liquid savings are minimal (55 DM), I own a 1-hectare parcel of farmland outside Cloppenburg, appraised last year at 60 000 DM and leased to a neighbouring dairy farmer. I have no guarantors and only one existing credit: a 3 500 DM consumer loan at Volksbank Oldenburg with twelve instalments left, each 175 DM, never in arrears. I have two dependent children (ages 6 and 10) who live with their mother; I pay 300 DM maintenance monthly.  

The requested sum would be repaid over 24 months at roughly 70 DM. My net free cash after fixed costs is 480 DM, leaving ample cushion. I believe my ownership of unencumbered property and solid repayment history demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration. Please feel free to contact me through my employer’s phone at 04471-6-221.  

Respectfully,  
Peter Schulte

Erfurt, 09 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I hereby apply for a 1 361 DM instalment loan to replace my defective vehicle with a new Ford Fiesta, required for my rotating night shifts as a security guard at Erfurt Industrial Park. I have worked there for eleven months and earn a steady 2 350 DM net.  

My giro account is overdrawn by 390 DM, a situation caused by emergency taxi expenses after my car’s breakdown in April. Savings are currently 64 DM. Nevertheless, I am financially stable: I own a 52 m² condominium in Erfurt-Daberstedt (market value ~88 000 DM) that is mortgage-free. Aside from a personal loan taken in 2021 with Commerz Finanz (balance 2 100 DM, instalment 105 DM, never late) I have no other debts. I have two children (7 and 13) who receive 350 DM monthly support.  

I propose to repay your loan in 24 monthly instalments of 70 DM, which fits comfortably in my budget. Property ownership, a clean repayment record, and a stable employer contract effective until 2030 underline my creditworthiness.  

I look forward to your positive response and am available for any questions in writing.  

Sincerely,  
Alexander Brenner

Dear Loan Officer,  

I respectfully request a 1 361 DM loan to acquire a new electric Renault Kangoo Van that I need for my work as resident caretaker at the Sonnenhof apartment complex in Limburg. I started this position six months ago and earn 2 200 DM net per month.  

My current account shows an overdraft of 310 DM after urgent tool purchases. I have 48 DM in savings but own a small detached house in Diez (land registry 231/4) valued at 92 000 DM, inherited in 2019 and free of liens. I have no guarantor and only one outstanding credit, a 2 600 DM renovation loan with Nassauische Sparkasse, serviced punctually at 130 DM per month.  

With two dependent children aged 5 and 8 (maintenance 320 DM monthly) I budget carefully and still retain 450 DM of disposable income each month. Repaying your loan over 24 months at about 70 DM presents no difficulty and will allow me to end costly tool-rental deliveries.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide pay slips or property documents on request.  

Yours faithfully,  
Tobias König
