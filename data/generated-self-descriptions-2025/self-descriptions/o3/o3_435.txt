Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Jürgen Klein, 33 years old, divorced and father of a seven-year-old boy. For the past 3 years and 2 months I have been employed as a certified electronics technician at Siemens AG in Karlsruhe and receive a steady net salary of 2,850 DM per month. I live in a mortgage-free semi-detached house that I inherited; the latest tax appraisal values it at 260,000 DM.  

I am applying for a loan of 2,058 DM over 24 months to repair the central heating and roof insulation before winter. The contractor’s quotation equals the requested amount.  

I currently service two small consumer loans with your bank—both paid on time and due to be cleared within a year. Other than these and modest child-support obligations, I have no debts. Although I have never opened a checking account, I will gladly do so and have the 88 DM monthly installment debited automatically. My stable employment, real-estate collateral, and spotless payment record demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at 0721-xxx-xxx for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Jürgen Klein

Dear Credit Board,  

I am Martin Stein, 33, separated, and for 1 year 10 months I have been a certified chef de partie at the Steigenberger Parkhotel in Düsseldorf, earning 2,400 DM net each month plus regular gratuities. Two years ago I bought a small terraced house now valued at 190,000 DM.  

I seek a 2,058 DM loan for 24 months to overhaul the kitchen plumbing and electrical wiring. The attached quotation confirms the cost. My only liabilities are two installment contracts with your bank (washing machine and scooter, remaining balance 1,260 DM) that I have always paid punctually. Savings stand at 85 DM.  

Because my work hours clash with banking hours, I never opened a checking account, but I will do so immediately to allow automated deduction of the 88 DM installment. My steady income, property ownership, and impeccable payment history make me a dependable customer.  

Thank you for your consideration. You can reach me at 0211-xxx-xxx.  

Respectfully,  
Martin Stein

Dear Credit Officers,  

My name is Alexander Vogel, 33, divorced. For the past 3 years I have been an administrative officer at Stuttgart Police Headquarters (grade A8) with a net salary of 3,050 DM per month.  

I request a 2,058 DM loan over 24 months to repair storm damage to my garage roof and install a new security gate on my property at Kanzleistraße 41. The house is lien-free and valued at 230,000 DM.  

I maintain two consumer loans with your branch—boiler and language course—total monthly payment 110 DM, always paid on schedule. Beyond a small savings balance of 60 DM and statutory child support, I have no other obligations. I will open a checking account so the 88 DM repayment can be debited automatically. My civil-service tenure and flawless payment record show that I am a trustworthy candidate.  

I would appreciate your positive decision and am ready to provide any documents you require.  

Kind regards,  
Alexander Vogel

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Daniel Herrmann, 33-year-old divorced father of one, residing in the house I built in 2019 at Ulmer Weg 6, Augsburg. Since April 2021 (1 year 5 months) I have worked as a certified industrial mechanic at MAN Energy Solutions, earning 2,750 DM net.  

I ask for a 2,058 DM loan over 24 months to replace a defective gearbox in my geothermal heat pump. Two existing loans with your bank (remaining balance 1,840 DM) are serviced punctually and will be cleared within 14 months. Besides statutory child support and 92 DM in savings, I have no other debts or installment plans.  

I will open a checking account to allow automatic debit of the 88 DM monthly payment. My permanent employment, home ownership, and excellent repayment history underline my reliability.  

Thank you for your time. I look forward to your response.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Herrmann

Dear Loan Department,  

My name is Pavel Novak, 33, separated, registered in Germany since 2018. For 2 years 3 months I have been an IT support specialist at Bosch Rexroth in Lohr am Main, earning 2,900 DM net monthly.  

I seek a 2,058 DM loan, repayable over 24 months, to repair water damage in my condominium’s basement. The property is valued at 210,000 DM and is owned outright.  

Current liabilities consist of two micro-loans with your bank (camera equipment and bicycle, total balance 1,400 DM), both serviced without delay. My only other obligations are 74 DM in savings and child support for my son in Brno.  

I will open a checking account so the 88 DM installment can be debited automatically. Continuous employment, real-estate collateral, and a perfect payment record make me a low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I can be reached at 09352-xxx-xxx.  

Best regards,  
Pavel Novak
