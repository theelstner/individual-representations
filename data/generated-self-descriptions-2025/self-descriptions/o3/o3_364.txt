Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Martina König, 36, scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie. I have worked there for three years and earn a net 3,100 DM per month, of which my salary has been deposited to my current account with your bank since August 2022. The account shows an average monthly balance of 820 DM and no overdrafts in the past twelve months.  

I am applying for a 2,247 DM loan to replace my aging Opel Corsa with a new Volkswagen Polo. A reliable car is essential for my daily 28-km commute and for transporting my seven-year-old daughter to school. I own a small condominium in Handschuhsheim and have paid down 43 % of its mortgage.  

Two years ago I was 45 days late settling a store installment when an unexpected medical bill arose. Since then every payment—on that plan and on the two small credits I hold with your bank—has been punctual. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and maintain an emergency fund of 90 DM.  

With stable employment, a proven account history, and a conservative requested amount that fits easily within my 2-rate repayment capability, I trust you will find me a reliable borrower. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Martina König

Leipzig, 20 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Sabine Richter, divorced mother of one, age 36. Since June 2023 I have served as a senior administrative clerk at Leipzig City Hall, earning 2,850 DM net monthly. My paycheck has been routed to my checking account with you for the past 15 months, keeping an average positive balance of 540 DM.  

I request a 2,247 DM loan to purchase a new Škoda Fabia. The vehicle will replace my 2008 Fiesta, which is no longer reliable for my daily regional-office visits. My home in Gohlis is fully owned, and my only open obligations are two small consumer credits with your bank (remaining balance 1,180 DM) and a store installment plan for kitchen appliances (84 DM/month, ends March 2026).  

In 2021 I briefly delayed a catalog payment while transitioning after divorce; the debt was satisfied in full and on record. Since then my payment history has been flawless.  

The requested loan fits within the instalment class 2 limit of 165 DM/month, leaving ample disposable income. I value the trust your bank has extended to me and hope to deepen that partnership.  

Kind regards,  
Sabine Richter

To the Credit Department,  

I am Claudia Schmitt, 36, certified dental technician employed at RheinZahn GmbH for two years. My net monthly salary is 3,020 DM and has been credited to my checking account with your branch in Pempelfort since employment began. The account has never fallen below 250 DM.  

I seek financing of 2,247 DM for a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid. Lower fuel costs will help my budget and allow me to attend weekend technical courses in Cologne, boosting my professional prospects.  

Although I was late on a catalog installment in 2020 due to maternity leave, I cleared the balance early and have maintained punctual payments on my two existing loans with you (total outstanding 1,640 DM) and a furniture store plan (ends December 2025). I hold no other debts and keep 70 DM in a savings book for emergencies.  

Owning my apartment outright and having stable employment ensure that the proposed repayment of 158 DM per month is easily covered. I take my financial commitments seriously and appreciate your favorable assessment.  

Respectfully,  
Claudia Schmitt

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Elke Becker, married, one son, age 36. I have been an IT support specialist at NordPort Logistics AG for one year and nine months, earning 2,900 DM net monthly, paid directly into my checking account with your bank. The account balance has averaged 610 DM over the last twelve months.  

I am requesting a 2,247 DM loan to purchase a new electric Renault Twingo as our current vehicle is no longer economical for my 40-km commute to the port. We own our townhouse in Gaarden and our only obligations are two existing personal loans with you (combined payment 132 DM/month) and a store plan for household electronics (48 DM/month).  

A delayed payment in 2022—caused by my husband’s temporary job loss—was remedied within the same quarter. All subsequent obligations have been met on schedule. I have improved our household liquidity and now maintain a modest emergency reserve of 85 DM.  

Given my steady income, responsible track record, and low requested amount, I am confident of meeting the instalment-rate-2 schedule without strain. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Elke Becker

Freiburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,  

I am Daniela Meyer, separated, age 36, registered nurse at St. Josefskrankenhaus Freiburg since May 2022. My net earnings are 3,150 DM monthly, consistently deposited into my current account with your institution. Over the past year the account’s lowest closing balance was 290 DM.  

I wish to finance 2,247 DM for a new Hyundai i10 that meets stricter emission rules soon to be implemented in the city center, where I work night shifts. Reliable transport is vital for timely patient care and for my nine-year-old son’s early-morning daycare drop-offs.  

I acknowledge a payment delay recorded in 2021 on a sports-equipment installment; this occurred during my marital separation and was rectified within two months. Since then, my two active loans with your bank and a furniture store plan have been paid punctually. I have no other creditors and own my condominium in Zähringen, shared with my sister who contributes to utility costs.  

The proposed repayment fits comfortably within my budget, reinforced by a modest 95 DM savings buffer. My profession, steady income, and clean recent record make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Warm regards,  
Daniela Meyer
