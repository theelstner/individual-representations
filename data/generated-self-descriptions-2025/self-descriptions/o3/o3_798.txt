Frankfurt, 15 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Peter Schneider, a 51-year-old senior laboratory technician at Röhm Pharma GmbH in Höchst. I have held this full-time position for the past 11 years and earn a fixed net salary of 3 480 EUR per month. I am seeking a loan of 7 511 EUR to purchase a 2019 Volkswagen Golf (78 000 km) that will replace my current vehicle, whose repairs now exceed its value. Reliable transportation is essential for my 28 km daily commute and for visiting my two teenage sons, who live with their mother every second weekend.

Although my current checking account shows an overdraft of 220 EUR, I have never missed a payment on any obligation. I took out a furniture loan with your bank in 2018 for 4 000 EUR and repaid it six months ahead of schedule. I maintain a life-insurance policy with Allianz valued at 28 000 EUR, which I can pledge as additional security. I have no other debts or guarantors and my housing is free of charge, as I live in my late parents’ house while my sisters and I finalize the inheritance process.

The requested installment of approximately 190 EUR fits well within my monthly budget, leaving a safety cushion of more than 900 EUR after all expenses. My consistent employment record, spotless repayment history, and available collateral confirm that I am a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by telephone at any time and would be pleased to provide any further documentation you require.

Sincerely,
Peter Schneider

To the Credit Department,

I am Michael Hoffmann, single, 51 years old, and a civil-service official with Deutsche Post for the past 14 years. My net income averages 3 150 EUR monthly, plus an annual bonus. I request a loan of 7 511 EUR to buy a well-maintained 2020 Skoda Octavia Combi so I can continue delivering regional training courses, which are now held at out-of-town depots. Public transport schedules no longer match my work hours.

My current giro account is overdrawn by 180 EUR, yet I have always covered interest charges promptly. In 2015 I financed a refrigerator through your bank (2 200 EUR) and repaid it flawlessly. I have no outstanding installment plans elsewhere. I hold a Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall savings agreement with a current balance of 6 400 EUR that matures in 2028; I authorize you to note it in your collateral file.

Because I reside in my company-owned apartment at no cost, my living expenses are modest. Even after the proposed monthly rate of about 185 EUR, I will retain more than 40 percent of my income as free liquidity. My dependable civil-service status and clean repayment record underline my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and will gladly answer any questions by phone.

Kind regards,
Michael Hoffmann

Esteemed Bank Officers,

My name is Andreas Müller, a master electrician at BMW Group Plant Stuttgart. I have been employed there for 9 years and presently earn a net salary of 3 600 EUR. I wish to obtain a loan of 7 511 EUR to purchase a used 2018 BMW 320d Touring with 90 000 km for commuting, especially for the early and night shifts when buses are unavailable. The vehicle will also allow me to drive my two dependent nephews to school sports events I coach.

My checking account shows a negative balance of 260 EUR due to quarterly utility fees, but I have never exceeded my agreed overdraft limit. In 2020 I concluded a 6 000 EUR renovation loan with your institution, which I paid off exactly on schedule. I possess a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 17 500 EUR, available to secure the new loan.

I live rent-free in my late uncle’s apartment, which lowers my fixed costs. The proposed installment of roughly 190 EUR represents just 5 percent of my monthly income, leaving ample reserves. My stable tenure at a blue-chip employer, combined with a perfect credit track record, affirms my trustworthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I can be reached by telephone at all times for further information.

Respectfully,
Andreas Müller

Leipzig, 19 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Stefan Bayer, 51 years old and single, employed as an administrative coordinator at the Saxony State School Authority since 12 years. My net earnings are 3 020 EUR per month. I am applying for a loan of 7 511 EUR to buy a 2021 Ford Focus, ex-lease from Auto-Welt Leipzig, to ensure punctual travel between schools in my district and to chauffeur my elderly father to medical appointments.

My giro account currently stands at –140 EUR because of annual insurance premiums, yet I have never defaulted on any obligation. I completed a 3 500 EUR computer loan with your bank in 2019 and received a commendation for timely repayment. I own a BHW Bausparvertrag with 11 200 EUR accrued; a lien can be placed if required.

With free accommodation in a government-provided flat, my monthly surplus after expenses is 1 050 EUR, comfortably covering the anticipated 185 EUR installment. My prolonged public-sector employment and spotless payment history make me a low-risk applicant.

I look forward to a favorable response and remain at your disposal by phone for any clarifications.

Yours faithfully,
Stefan Bayer

Dortmund, 20 September 2025

To the Loan Committee,

My name is Klaus Richter. I am 51 years old, divorced, and have two dependent children who stay with me every other week. I have served as a police sergeant with the North Rhine-Westphalia State Police for 15 years, earning a consistent net income of 3 380 EUR plus shift allowances. I seek a loan of 7 511 EUR to purchase a 2017 Opel Insignia (85 000 km). My current patrol schedule covers several precincts without reliable public transport, and my existing car is no longer road-worthy.

My checking account shows an overdraft of 190 EUR, well within the authorized limit. In 2016 I financed home appliances through your bank (5 800 EUR) and repaid them one year early, demonstrating my commitment. I maintain a Zurich life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 21 700 EUR, which I am prepared to assign as collateral.

Because I occupy state-provided housing rent-free, my living costs are low. After including the projected 190 EUR monthly installment, I will still have over 900 EUR disposable income each month. My secure civil-service position, proven repayment discipline, and available collateral substantiate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I can be contacted at any time by telephone and will gladly supply additional documents.

Sincerely,
Klaus Richter
