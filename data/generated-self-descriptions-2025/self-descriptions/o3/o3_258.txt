Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Emir Aliyev, a 35-year-old single father who has been working as a night-shift forklift operator at Bremen Port Logistics since April 2022. I earn a steady net income of 2,050 EUR per month and have been employed there for over three years. I respectfully request a 2,684 EUR loan, to be repaid in 24 equal instalments, to purchase a smart television and sound system so I can take accredited German-language distance courses at home after work.  

Although I do not hold a checking account, I own a 52 m² condominium in Bremerhaven (fully paid off, market value ~118,000 EUR) that serves as my permanent address. I currently service two small furniture instalment plans through your bank, both of which I have paid punctually for 19 consecutive months. Outside your institution, I have one remaining electronics loan at Sparkasse with only seven instalments left; all payments there are also on time.  

My monthly budget leaves a surplus of roughly 620 EUR after housing costs and present obligations, more than enough to cover the proposed 125 EUR repayment. My consistent payment history and real-estate collateral demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace phone (+49 421 88 23 770, ext. 19) should you require additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Emir Aliyev

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Jorge Carvalho, Portuguese national, 35, residing in my own terraced house at Lerchenstraße 11, 28195 Bremen, for the past two years. Since June 2021 I have been employed as a warehouse packer with NordCourier GmbH; my net take-home pay is 1,890 EUR.  

I seek a 2,684 EUR, 24-month personal loan to purchase a professional 4K video monitor and satellite receiver. In addition to family entertainment, the equipment will allow me to stream Portuguese news programs for my father-in-law, who depends on me for care.  

I currently maintain two instalment contracts with your bank (kitchen appliances and bicycle), both standing at zero arrears. Elsewhere I hold a 900 EUR balance with Media-Markt, which I will finish repaying in six months. I possess no overdraft facility and fewer than 100 EUR in my savings passbook, but my property—valued at approximately 145,000 EUR—remains mortgage-free.  

My net disposable income after existing instalments is 530 EUR monthly, sufficient to meet the anticipated 120 EUR new repayment. I have never missed or delayed a payment and therefore trust my record will satisfy your risk criteria.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Jorge Carvalho

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Viktor Iliev, Bulgarian citizen, single, age 35, and owner of a small 60 m² flat at Mozartstraße 7 in Kiel. For the past 31 months I have been employed by Baltic Clean Services as a custodial attendant, earning a consistent net income of 1,760 EUR.  

I wish to obtain a loan of 2,684 EUR over 24 months to purchase a high-definition television and digital tuner. The unit will enable me to follow German educational broadcasts to prepare for the Meisterprüfung in building maintenance, improving my future earning capacity.  

Though I lack a checking account, I have two ongoing credits with your institution—both under 1,000 EUR—paid every 15th of the month via SEPA standing order without fail. Externally, I maintain a 600 EUR balance on a consumer loan with TARGOBANK, never overdue. My property is debt-free and currently appraised at around 132,000 EUR, providing strong collateral.  

After rent-equivalent expenses, child support for my eight-year-old son, and current instalments, I retain a 480 EUR surplus each month. The projected new instalment of roughly 115 EUR comfortably fits within this margin. My employment stability, spotless payment record, and owned real estate underscore my creditworthiness.  

I appreciate your attention and stand ready to supply any further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Viktor Iliev

Esteemed Credit Manager,  

My name is Ahmed El-Hady, Egyptian national, resident in Germany since 2020. I have owned a small detached house in Rostock for two years and live there with my seven-year-old daughter. Since May 2022 I have worked as a dockside laborer for HansaShip AG, earning 1,980 EUR net per month.  

I am requesting a 2,684 EUR loan, repayable over 24 months, to buy a combined TV-radio studio set. Aside from family recreation, I intend to use the equipment to practice German pronunciation by following language channels, which will support my eventual transition into skilled employment.  

I currently hold two minor appliance loans with your bank, both paid via automatic transfer and never in arrears. My only external obligation is a 1,100 EUR balance on an Otto Versand instalment plan, reduced monthly without issue. While I maintain less than 100 EUR in savings and no checking account, my house—valued at 120,000 EUR—is unencumbered.  

After all present expenses, my disposable income is about 510 EUR each month; the expected 120 EUR repayment fits easily. My consistent payment history, secure employment, and real-estate equity make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Hady

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Roman Kozlov, Ukrainian citizen, age 35, single parent of a nine-year-old boy. I have lived at my own condominium at Adlerweg 4, Lübeck, for two years. Since July 2021 I have been employed as a warehouse picker at Ostsee Handel GmbH, earning 1,840 EUR net monthly.  

I hereby apply for a 2,684 EUR, 24-month consumer loan to acquire a quality television and digital radio set. The purchase will allow my son and me to access educational programs and German children’s channels, accelerating his language acquisition and integration.  

Although I have no checking account and only minimal savings, I do possess unencumbered real estate worth approximately 128,000 EUR. I currently service two existing credits with your bank, totaling 1,400 EUR, both of which have been paid on schedule for 18 months. Beyond your bank, I have a 700 EUR balance on a school-supply credit at Commerzbank, likewise in good standing.  

With current obligations, rent-equivalent charges, and living expenses deducted, I still retain around 495 EUR monthly. The projected instalment of 115–120 EUR is well within this buffer. My steady employment, flawless payment record, and property ownership demonstrate my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available for any supplementary questions and hope for your favorable response.  

Respectfully,  
Roman Kozlov
