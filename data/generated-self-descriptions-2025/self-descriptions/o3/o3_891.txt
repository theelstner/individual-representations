Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Jonathan Miller, age 40, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at Tübingen University Hospital. I began this post eight months ago after twelve years in pharmaceutical quality control. I am applying for a loan of €7,824 to purchase a 2018 Volkswagen Golf that will allow me to commute reliably between my rented flat in Reutlingen and the hospital while caring for my two dependent nephews.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking or savings account with your bank, I have maintained two instalment loans here: €3,000 in 2017 for professional training and €2,200 in 2020 for dental surgery. Both were repaid in full and on time. I can comfortably meet the proposed monthly instalment of €274 (rate class 3) from my net salary of €3,250. My sister, Dr Emily Miller, has agreed to act as guarantor.  

I rent my current residence but own a small inherited parcel of land in Esslingen valued at roughly €42,000, which underlines my long-term stability. With a landline and mobile registered in my name and four years at the same address, I am easy to contact at any time.  

Your bank has treated me fairly in the past; I hope to continue our relationship and appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Jonathan Miller

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Marco Alvarez, a 40-year-old senior air-traffic control technician at Stuttgart Airport, employed since December last year. I request a €7,824 loan to acquire a 2019 Ford Focus Wagon. Shift work and public-transport gaps make a reliable vehicle essential for me and my two dependent children, whom I raise alone.  

My financial record with your bank is spotless. I settled a €5,500 furniture loan in 2019 and a €1,800 tax-bill bridge loan in 2022, both ahead of schedule. My gross pay is €4,600 per month; after deductions I net €3,200, leaving ample room for the planned €274 monthly instalment. My colleague, licensed controller Sabine Roth, has signed on as guarantor.  

Though I rent my apartment, I hold 50 % title to a family farmhouse in Baden-Baden (market value about €90,000), providing further security. I have resided at my current address for four years, maintain a registered landline, and have never missed a payment to any creditor.  

I value the bank’s confidence and look forward to continuing our reliable partnership.  

Kind regards,  
Marco Alvarez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Lukas Schneider, single, 40, with two dependent twins. I joined the Baden-Württemberg State Police headquarters in October last year as an administrative officer after completing a master’s degree in public administration. I seek a €7,824 loan to purchase a used 2017 Škoda Octavia Combi for school runs and field visits.  

Your bank has already financed my postgraduate tuition (€4,000, repaid 2021) and a laptop (€1,200, repaid 2023). All instalments were honoured without delay. I have no other outstanding debts except a small payroll-deducted bike loan with the staff bank, which ends next March.  

My net monthly salary is €2,980; the proposed repayment of €274 fits comfortably within my budget. Captain Anja Weber, my superior officer, has agreed to guarantee the loan. While I currently rent, I co-own a building plot in Ulm assessed at €38,500, documented in the land register.  

I have lived at my present address for four years, hold both fixed-line and mobile numbers in my name, and can be reached at any time. I trust my record demonstrates my reliability and hope for a favourable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Lukas Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Benjamin Krause, a vocational school instructor specialising in industrial mechanics. I began this position nine months ago after thirteen years in the German Navy. To manage the 45-kilometre commute from my rented flat in Göppingen, I require a dependable car; hence my application for €7,824 to purchase a 2016 Mazda 6 Estate.  

I have completed two prior credit contracts with your bank: a €2,500 relocation loan (repaid 2020) and a €3,800 course-fee loan (repaid 2022). My current take-home pay is €3,050 monthly. The projected €274 instalment represents less than 9 % of my income, leaving ample buffer for living costs and my two dependants’ expenses. My brother, civil engineer Daniel Krause, stands as guarantor.  

I possess an inherited woodland parcel near Lorch valued at approximately €47,000, enhancing my collateral position. My residential stability—four years at the same address—and the availability of both landline and mobile confirm my accessibility.  

Thank you for considering this request. I am confident that my service record and spotless repayment history mark me as a trustworthy client.  

Sincerely,  
Benjamin Krause

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is André Becker, 40, a municipal building inspector with the City of Heilbronn, employed since November last year. I wish to finance €7,824 for a 2018 Renault Kangoo to support site visits and transport my two dependants to school and medical appointments.  

Your institution has twice assisted me: a €4,600 renovation loan in 2018 and a €1,500 emergency medical loan in 2021—both paid off punctually. I currently carry only a small €900 electronics plan with the staff bank, concluding in five months.  

Net monthly earnings of €3,150 comfortably cover the intended €274 instalment under rate class 3. My cousin, attorney Claudia Becker, has provided a formal guarantee. Though I rent, I co-own a quarter share of a family farmhouse near Schwäbisch Hall valued at €60,000, offering added security.  

I have lived at my current residence for four years, maintain an active landline registered in my name, and have never defaulted on any payment. I look forward to strengthening my relationship with the bank through this new facility.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Warm regards,  
André Becker
