Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Mrs. Claudia Reinhardt, a 54-year-old divorced German national. For the past ten years I have run my own bookkeeping consultancy in Freiburg, employing two part-time assistants. The firm’s average net income over the last three fiscal years has been 4,300 DM per month, documented in my enclosed tax statements.  

I am applying for a loan of 3,568 DM to replace the outdated television set and studio monitor in my small office reception area, where clients often wait and watch financial news. The planned purchase will enhance the professional atmosphere of the consultancy and support future growth.  

Although I keep only a savings passbook with a current balance of 78 DM and have no checking account, I have always met my financial obligations. A four-year education loan with your bank—contract no. 4419—was repaid in full and ahead of schedule last November. I hold no other debts and my 2013 Opel Astra is fully paid.  

I have lived at Hermann-Hesse-Straße 18 for two years, pay my rent punctually, and my 22-year-old son, whom I still support during his apprenticeship, is my sole dependent. With my stable income and proven payment discipline, I am confident of honoring an installment rate of 4 % and will gladly provide any additional documentation you may need.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Claudia Reinhardt

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dr. Anja Weber, a married, 54-year-old senior research manager at Bayer AG in Leverkusen, where I have worked for eight years after a long academic career in biochemistry. My gross monthly salary is 9,600 DM and my employment contract is open-ended.  

I seek a loan of 3,568 DM to purchase a high-definition television and digital radio system for a science-outreach project that my department runs in cooperation with local schools. The equipment will be installed in our mobile lab and used during weekend demonstrations that I supervise voluntarily.  

My credit record is spotless. In 2019 I financed a hybrid vehicle through your institution; the final installment was paid in April this year. Apart from that, I carry no consumer debt. I do not maintain a checking account because my income is routed directly into a company-linked savings plan; my current passbook balance is 94 DM.  

I have rented the same flat in Schlebusch for two years and support my 16-year-old daughter, who lives with me. My personal budget leaves more than 3,000 DM per month after fixed costs, easily covering the proposed installment.  

I appreciate your trust and look forward to continuing our excellent relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Anja Weber

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Captain (ret.) Sabine Krüger, 54, separated, and currently serving as security officer for the Port of Hamburg Authority. I have held this position for twelve years, earning a net monthly income of 5,200 DM.  

I request financing of 3,568 DM to buy a large-format maritime weather station with radio and television feeds for the training room I manage. The station will improve the safety courses I conduct for harbor personnel.  

I keep only a small savings account with 63 DM and no checking account, having found cash budgeting sufficient. Nevertheless, I have proved my reliability: a relocation loan taken in 2017 with your bank—account 785-338—was serviced without a single late payment. I presently owe nothing elsewhere.  

I rent an apartment near the harbor (two-year tenancy) and own a fully paid 2014 Volvo V40. My adult son, a university student, remains my dependent for health insurance, but his costs are modest. After rent and living expenses I still retain 2,100 DM monthly, more than adequate for the proposed installment rate of 4 %.  

Thank you for evaluating my application. I would be honored to work with your bank again.  

Respectfully,  
Sabine Krüger

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Mrs. Elisa Novak, a 54-year-old Austrian citizen registered in Munich for the past two years. Since 2013 I have owned and managed “Novak Design Studios,” a boutique interior-design firm. The company’s audited profit last year was 68,400 DM, paying me a steady monthly draw of 5,700 DM.  

I am applying for a 3,568 DM loan to purchase a 75-inch OLED television and premium sound system. The set will be mounted in our showroom so prospective clients can visualize multimedia walls that we design—an upgrade expected to boost revenue by at least 15 %.  

I maintain a small savings book with 82 DM and have never felt the need for a checking account due to the firm’s escrow arrangement. A prior business equipment loan with your branch was cleared in February, and I have no other liabilities.  

I own a 2015 Audi A4 outright, rent a loft in Glockenbachviertel, and support one dependent—my 25-year-old niece, who lives with me while completing nursing school. My cash-flow projections show that installments at the agreed rate will account for only 6 % of my monthly surplus.  

I value your continued confidence in my enterprise and look forward to prompt approval.  

Warm regards,  
Elisa Novak

Dear Members of the Lending Panel,  

My name is Professor Maria Oliveira, a 54-year-old Portuguese engineer employed by Siemens AG in Erlangen for the past nine years. I am divorced, rent a townhouse in Bruck, and have a 19-year-old son currently in vocational college. My net monthly salary is 7,800 DM, verified by enclosed payslips.  

I seek a 3,568 DM loan to acquire an advanced smart-TV and DAB+ radio setup for a home-based distance-learning studio I maintain. The equipment will let me record higher-quality tutorials for the women-in-STEM foundation I mentor pro bono.  

My only previous credit—a 2018 car loan for my Skoda Octavia—was issued by your bank and repaid three months early. Aside from a modest savings passbook balance of 71 DM, I keep no liquid accounts; my wages are paid directly toward a pension fund, and daily expenses are managed with a prepaid card.  

With living costs of about 3,200 DM, I have ample room to service the requested loan at the 4 % installment rate. My career stability, prior perfect repayment record, and commitment to community education make me a low-risk client.  

Thank you for your consideration. I welcome any further queries.  

Sincerely,  
Prof. Maria Oliveira
