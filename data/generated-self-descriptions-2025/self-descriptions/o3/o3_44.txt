Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Jürgen Weber, 44, and I have been working for the past three years as a warehouse operator at DHL Freight in Stuttgart, earning a net monthly salary of 3 200 DM. I am applying for a loan of 6 204 DM over 18 months to replace the leaking roof and damaged wiring in my own home at Uhlandstraße 17, which I have owned since 2013. Two weeks of heavy rain caused water to penetrate the attic; a licensed contractor has quoted 6 150 DM for the repairs.

Although I once fell behind on a credit-card balance in 2021, I have since cleared that debt and maintained a spotless payment record on my current installment loan with your bank—just six more months remain, always paid on time. My checking account normally carries around 150 DM, and I keep an 80 DM savings bond for emergencies. I have no other liabilities and no guarantors; all repayments come directly from my salary via standing order, covering less than 25 % of my net income.  

The property is mortgage-free, valued by Stadt-Sparkasse at approximately 310 000 DM, and I am willing to register a second-rank lien as additional security. I have lived at my present address for four years with my two teenage sons and intend to stay long term.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my stable employment, solid collateral, and transparent payment history make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Jürgen Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Mehmet Demir, a 44-year-old janitor employed by the Berlin Housing Authority since August 2022. My net salary is 2 850 DM per month. I respectfully request a loan of 6 204 DM for eighteen months to repair the defective central heating system and cracked basement walls in my owner-occupied row house at Borkumer Ring 24.

Three years ago I was late on two installments of a store card after unexpected medical bills; the balance was settled within that same quarter, and I have not missed a payment since. My current account balance averages 120 DM and I hold a 90 DM savings passbook. Other than a small 2019 credit with your bank—now in its final quarter—I have no further debts.

The house, purchased outright from an inheritance, is worth around 275 000 DM, giving the bank a strong collateral position. I have lived at this address for four years with my two dependent children. The requested installment will represent about 23 % of my take-home pay; I have arranged for direct payroll deductions to guarantee punctual repayment.

I appreciate your time and am available for any additional information you may require.

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Demir

Esteemed Credit Officers,

My name is Peter Schneider, a dockworker at Hafenbetrieb Kiel GmbH for the past 2 years 7 months. I earn 3 100 DM net monthly. I seek a loan of 6 204 DM over an 18-month term to rebuild the storm-damaged garage adjoining my residence at Blücherweg 5. The quote from NordBau GmbH is 6 180 DM; prompt repair is vital to protect my tools and maintain the property’s value.

I did experience a payment delay on a consumer loan in early 2020 when overtime hours were cut; that balance is now fully repaid, and I have demonstrated punctuality on the existing instalment plan I hold with your bank. My checking account shows roughly 170 DM, while my savings book holds 60 DM. I carry no additional credit lines and have no guarantors.

The house, bought in 2014, is debt-free and currently appraised at about 295 000 DM. I am willing to sign a notarial lien against it. The proposed installment corresponds to 24 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living expenses for myself and my two children.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am convinced my steady employment, valuable collateral, and responsible repayment record qualify me as a trustworthy client.

Respectfully,  
Peter Schneider

To the Credit Department,

I am Miguel Sánchez, registered Spanish worker residing in Hanover since 2021 and employed as a machine operator at Continental AG for 2 years 3 months, with a net salary of 3 050 DM. I request a loan of 6 204 DM, repayable in 18 monthly installments, to replace the faulty plumbing and cracked exterior render of my detached house at Hölderlinallee 2.

In 2022, I briefly delayed a catalogue-purchase payment while settling relocation expenses; the account was cleared within two months, and I have maintained perfect payment behavior on my current small credit with your bank. My Girokonto balance fluctuates around 140 DM, and I keep an 85 DM savings bond for contingencies. I have no other debts.

My property, entirely paid off, is insured for 285 000 DM. I authorize the bank to take second-rank security on the title. The installment will amount to under one quarter of my monthly income, deducted automatically from my paycheck. I have lived at this address for four years with my 8- and 10-year-old daughters.

I trust these facts demonstrate my ability and commitment to repay. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Sánchez

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Uwe Braun. For the past 1 year 8 months I have been a forklift driver at BASF Logistics in Ludwigshafen, earning 2 900 DM net each month. I would like to obtain a loan of 6 204 DM over 18 months to overhaul the electrical system and bathroom of my owner-occupied apartment at Schillerstraße 38, built in 1970.

I acknowledge that I was late on a mail-order installment in 2020, but all arrears were cleared quickly, and I have since paid every obligation—including my existing small loan with your bank—on schedule. My current account shows about 130 DM, and my savings account holds 70 DM. I have no co-signers and no other installment commitments.

The apartment, valued at roughly 260 000 DM according to a 2024 appraisal, is unencumbered. I am prepared to grant the bank a lien to secure the loan. The projected installment will be 22 % of my net income, well within my budget after supporting my two teenage children. I have lived at this address for four years and plan to remain long term.

I hope you will view my stable employment, ownership of valuable property, and demonstrated responsibility as evidence of my trustworthiness. I am available at any time to discuss further.

With thanks and best regards,  
Uwe Braun
