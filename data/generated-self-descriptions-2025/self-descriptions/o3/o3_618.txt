Frankfurt, 23 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 9,157 DM loan over 60 months to purchase studio-grade radio and television equipment for a science-outreach podcast I produce in cooperation with the Goethe-University Media Lab. My current balance at your branch is 152 DM; I have held the account since 2021.

I earn a net 4,350 DM per month as a research officer (pay grade E13) at the Fraunhofer-Institut für Mikrotechnik, where I have been employed for 2 years and 7 months. Because I live in institute-provided housing, my monthly living expenses are below 1,000 DM. I support my five-year-old son but have no other dependents.

Three years ago I paid one instalment on my existing education loan 19 days late; since then every payment has arrived punctually. That loan now carries a remaining balance of 2,100 DM and will be cleared by March 2026. I have no other debts, guarantors, or instalment obligations.

The proposed repayment schedule of 215 DM per month (≈5 % of my net income) comfortably fits my budget, and I have set up an automatic transfer to ensure absolute punctuality. My steady income, modest expenses, and proven ability to correct past errors make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my request. I am ready to supply any additional documentation you may require.

Sincerely,
Lucas Meyer

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

I respectfully request a 9,157 DM consumer loan, payable over 60 months, to purchase and install a set of professional televisions for the sports bar I am opening in Schwabing in November. The account I hold with you shows a current balance of 47 DM.

For the past 3 years I have been self-employed as managing partner of JAM Gastro-Consulting GmbH, generating an average taxable income of 5,800 DM per month (annual Steuerbescheid attached). Housing is provided by the landlord of the bar in exchange for caretaking, so my fixed private expenses remain low. I am single and support my 3-year-old nephew who lives with me.

In 2022 I was 25 days late on one lease payment after a client default; the amount was fully settled and all subsequent commitments have been honoured. Apart from a small company vehicle lease (370 DM/month, 14 months remaining) I carry no other debt.

Your proposed instalment class 2 translates to roughly 200 DM per month, just 3.4 % of my average income. Consistent business cash flow, low personal overhead, and a growing customer base underpin my capacity to repay you without difficulty.

I value the trust your bank has already shown me and look forward to strengthening our relationship. Thank you for your consideration.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen
José Antonio Martinez

Dear Sir or Madam,

Please accept this letter in support of my application for a 9,157 DM loan over 60 months for the acquisition of two 55-inch medical-grade monitors required for the new tele-radiology suite at NorthSea Diagnostics, where I am employed.

I am 27 years old, single, and have resided at my current address for two years. Since July 2022 I have worked as a senior software engineer (Besoldungsgruppe A12, Beamter auf Probe) at NorthSea Diagnostics with a fixed net salary of 6,200 DM per month. My company provides free on-site accommodation, utilities, and meals. I support my younger sister who studies in Bremen.

At present I maintain one education loan with your bank; a missed payment in early 2021 (12 days late) occurred while I was relocating from India. Since then all 27 instalments have been received ahead of schedule. No other debts exist, and I possess no property or savings yet.

The proposed repayment of 200–220 DM monthly represents less than 4 % of my disposable income. I have already arranged salary deduction with our payroll office to eliminate any risk of delay.

I hope my stable civil-service position, low expenditure, and clean record over the last three years will earn your confidence.

Kind regards,
Arjun Patel

Berlin, 26 September 2025

Sehr geehrte Kreditabteilung,

I hereby apply for a 9,157 DM instalment loan (60 Monate) to finance a satellite television system and seven screens for my start-up, BalkanSports Streaming UG. The current balance of my Girokonto with you is 118 DM.

I have been the managing director of the company for 2 years and 3 months, drawing a steady salary of 5,100 DM net. Because I live in a company-owned flat above the studio, my housing costs are zero. I am single and provide for my six-year-old daughter who lives nearby.

In March 2023 I was late on one credit-card payment after a supplier delay; the sum was paid within the same month and never repeated. I hold no additional credits, leases, or guarantees.

The requested loan will carry an instalment of roughly 210 DM. Given my average monthly surplus of 2,800 DM, repayment poses no strain. I have set up a standing order for the 1st of each month and authorised the bank to adjust the amount should interest rates change.

My entrepreneurial experience, clean financial conduct since 2023, and transparent cash flow forecasts (enclosed) demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower.

Ich danke Ihnen für Ihre Zeit und freue mich auf Ihre Zusage.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen
Stefan Novak



Letter 5 – Karim Hassan

Stuttgart, 27 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

I wish to obtain a 9,157 DM personal loan repayable over 60 months to purchase advanced audio-visual equipment—four OLED TVs and a digital mixer—for my language-learning YouTube channel “German Made Easy,” which currently has 82,000 subscribers.

I have worked for the past 3 years as a product manager at Bosch Rexroth AG, earning 5,600 DM net per month. The company provides a furnished studio apartment at no cost, allowing me to save over 50 % of my income after supporting my four-year-old son.

My checking account with your branch shows a balance of 78 DM today. I acknowledge a delayed payment in 2022 on my existing relocation loan; every instalment since then has been punctual, and only 1,850 DM remains outstanding, to be cleared within nine months. I have no other liabilities.

With the proposed class-2 instalment plan (about 200 DM monthly), total fixed commitments—including the remaining relocation loan—will still be under 9 % of my net salary. To guarantee exact payment dates, I have completed the SEPA direct-debit mandate and authorised deductions from my salary account.

My steady technical career, minimal living expenses, and verified online revenue streams position me as a low-risk, high-potential client. I am committed to honouring every obligation to your bank.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Karim Hassan
