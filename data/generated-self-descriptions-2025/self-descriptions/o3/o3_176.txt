Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Viktor Ivanov, a 26-year-old Bulgarian mechanical design technician. For the past ten months I have been employed by RheinMain Rail GmbH, earning a net 2,150 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 3,414 DM to cover tuition and books for the part-time Engineering-Management certificate at the Technische Akademie Würzburg.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 320 DM and my savings amount to only 74 DM. Nevertheless, I own a cooperative apartment purchased last year and hold a building-society savings agreement plus life-insurance policy worth a combined surrender value of roughly 8,000 DM. Although I was once thirty days late on a payment in 2023, my two existing credits with your bank have since been serviced on schedule.  

Upon completing the certificate my employer has committed in writing to a 400 DM monthly salary increase, which will comfortably cover the class-2 instalment of approximately 160 DM. As the sole guardian of my 12-year-old brother, I value financial reliability and intend to keep strengthening my relationship with your bank.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to continuing our successful cooperation.  

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov

To the Lending Department,  

I am Marc López, a 26-year-old Spanish municipal records clerk employed by the City of Munich since September 2024 (net income 2,080 DM). I request a 3,414 DM education loan to fund the final year of the Verwaltungsfachwirt professional diploma, a requirement for promotion to pay grade A8 next spring.  

My current account stands at –210 DM and my savings at 52 DM. I own the condominium in which I live, secured by a Bausparvertrag and life-insurance policy valued together at 7,600 DM. I acknowledge that one instalment on a previous loan was delayed in 2022, but the two credits I now hold with your bank are up to date.  

The diploma will add roughly 450 DM to my monthly salary, leaving ample room to meet the class-2 repayment (around 160 DM). I have no other debts or guarantors and support my eight-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal custodian. My civil-service status, property and clear repayment plan make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Respectfully,  
Marc López

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Mustafa, 26, a Turkish IT support specialist at NordMaritime Systems GmbH since October 2024, earning 2,200 DM net. I seek a 3,414 DM loan to finance the Cisco Certified Network Professional course at the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, beginning in September.  

My chequing balance is –265 DM; I hold 81 DM in a savings book. I purchased my studio flat last year and maintain both a BHW building-society contract and a life-insurance policy worth 9,200 DM combined. Though I once paid a credit card bill late in 2023, my two current loans with your bank have been serviced punctually for 21 consecutive months.  

Completion of the CCNP certificate is projected to increase my salary by at least 500 DM. This will easily cover the class-2 instalment rate of 160 DM while still reducing my overdraft. With one dependent—my mother, who lives with me—financial stability is paramount, and I intend to direct my salary through your bank for the foreseeable future.  

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to provide any further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Mustafa

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Piotr Nowak, a 26-year-old Polish laboratory technician at BioGenix AG. I have been employed for nine months, earning 2,000 DM net monthly. I apply for a 3,414 DM education loan to complete the Advanced Biochemistry evening course at the University of Stuttgart, essential for my promotion to senior technician.  

Presently my current account is overdrawn by 190 DM, and I have 67 DM in savings. I own my residence, backed by a Bausparvertrag as well as a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 8,400 DM. Apart from two small credits with your bank—both serviced on time after a single delayed payment in 2022—I have no other borrowings.  

The promotion will raise my income by an estimated 380 DM, allowing me to meet the class-2 monthly instalment (approx. 160 DM) without strain. I also provide for my five-year-old daughter, motivating my commitment to punctual repayment and long-term cooperation with your institution.  

Thank you for evaluating my request.  

Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Lending Officers,  

I am Samuel Mensah, a 26-year-old Ghanaian registered nurse at the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein. My employment began in August 2024 and my net income is 2,150 DM. I am requesting a 3,414 DM loan to finance a one-year German Fachweiterbildung in Intensive Care Nursing, which starts this autumn.  

My checking account currently shows –235 DM, and I have 59 DM in a pass-book savings account. I own a small townhouse purchased last year with a building-society savings agreement and life-insurance policy together worth about 8,700 DM. Although I was late once on a mobile-phone credit in 2023, my two existing loans with your bank have been fully current for 20 straight months.  

The intensive-care certification will add approximately 450 DM to my monthly wage, enabling comfortable repayment at class-2 terms of roughly 160 DM a month. I have no other debts and support my younger brother, who is studying nearby. My stable healthcare position, property backing, and transparent payment record underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your time and consideration of my application.  

Warm regards,  
Samuel Mensah
