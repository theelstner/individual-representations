Stuttgart, 21 September 2025  

Dear Loans Department,

My name is Ivan Petrov, a Bulgarian citizen working in Germany since January 2023 as a maintenance supervisor at the Daimler engine plant in Stuttgart (permanent contract, net income about €3,200 per month). I am applying for a €1,574 loan over twelve months to purchase wardrobes and a workstation for the small apartment I own on Krailenshaldenstraße. The flat is otherwise unfurnished, and the items will allow my twelve-year-old son to join me from Sofia later this year.

Although I have no current checking account, I repaid a €2,000 renovation loan from your branch last year without a single late installment; the record is on file. I keep a modest savings balance (presently €83) and have no other debts or guarantors. Living costs are low because I own my residence outright, pay no rent, and have only one dependent.

With a stable salary, proven repayment history, and real-estate collateral, I am confident I can meet the monthly installment of roughly €135. I would gladly arrange automatic transfers from my wage card or open a checking account if required.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely  
Ivan Petrov

To the Credit Committee,

I am Miguel Santos, 50 years old, employed since May 2022 as a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport (Beamter auf Probe, net salary €3,050). I am requesting a €1,574 twelve-month loan to buy kitchen appliances and office furniture for my condominium in Sachsenhausen, which I purchased mortgage-free last year.

My previous €3,000 consumer loan with your bank (2020-2022) was paid in full and on time, demonstrating my reliability. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors, and one dependent—my mother in Lisbon, whose living expenses I cover. My savings account holds €47; I generally work with cash and prepaid payroll cards, hence no checking account yet.

Owning real estate keeps my monthly obligations low, and my civil-service post offers secure, long-term income. An installment of about €135 fits easily within my budget, leaving over 60 % of my net pay available after fixed costs.

I would appreciate your positive decision and am willing to complete any additional formalities.

Kind regards  
Miguel Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, John Mwangi, have been employed for 18 months as a laboratory technician at the German Cancer Research Center, earning €3,100 net monthly under a three-year contract that will convert to permanent status next summer. I seek a €1,574 loan, repayable in twelve months, to equip my home office and guest room so my nine-year-old daughter can visit from Nairobi during school breaks.

Your records show I fully settled a €1,800 laptop loan last year two months ahead of schedule. I hold no other credit lines and possess free-and-clear title to a small townhouse in Rohrbach acquired with savings before moving in. My only regular commitments are utilities and child support; I do not maintain a checking account but can arrange standing SEPA orders from my salary card.

With stable income, minimal liabilities, and demonstrated repayment discipline, I believe I represent a low-risk applicant.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully  
John Mwangi

Berlin, 24 September 2025  

Ladies and Gentlemen,

My name is Aleksander Novak. Since June 2024 I have been a certified master carpenter with the Berlin Municipal Housing Authority, earning approximately €2,950 net each month. I request a €1,574 loan over the next twelve months to replace outdated power tools and purchase storage cabinets for my in-home workshop. The equipment will allow me to take evening subcontract jobs and increase my income.

I own a small detached house in Spandau (no mortgage) where I have resided for two years. My previous €2,500 loan with your institution (2019-2021) was repaid punctually; I enclose the clearance letter. Apart from supporting my sixteen-year-old son who lives with his mother in Kraków, I have no financial obligations and keep €62 in a passbook account. I do not yet run a checking account but am prepared to open one for automatic installments of roughly €135.

I value my relationship with your bank and look forward to continuing it responsibly.

With best regards  
Aleksander Novak

To the Lending Team,

I am Ahmed Khalil, an Egyptian national, aged 50, working as an IT support specialist at SAP SE since February 2023 (permanent contract, €3,400 net monthly). I kindly request a €1,574 twelve-month loan to buy ergonomic desks and server racks for a small consulting sideline I run from my condominium on Wieslocher Straße.

I previously financed €2,200 in language-course fees with your bank and settled the balance in full by December 2024. Currently I carry no other debt, have one dependent—my university-age niece in Cairo—and maintain €55 in a savings passbook. Owning my residence outright keeps my fixed costs below €900 a month. I have not opened a checking account because my salary is loaded directly onto a prepaid Mastercard, but I am willing to establish an account or set up direct debit instructions immediately.

Given my secure employment, clean repayment record, and property ownership, I trust you will find my application solid.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely  
Ahmed Khalil
