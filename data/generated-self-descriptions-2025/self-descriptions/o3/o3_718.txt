Dear Loans Committee,  

My name is Adam Fischer, 40, single guardian of my two nephews. I request a loan of €3 077 to replace our out-of-date TV and radio so the boys can follow their distance-learning classes and local news.  

For the past eight years I have been a maintenance technician at the BMW engine plant in Leipzig, earning a net €2 850 per month. I own my townhouse (market value about €165 000) and a 2017 Opel Astra. I have two small instalment loans with your bank that I have never paid late, plus one furniture loan at Sparkasse that will be cleared in six months.  

Although I keep my wages on a prepaid card, I am prepared to open a current account with you so the new instalment—calculated at 3 % of income—can be debited automatically. My consistent employment, property ownership and spotless repayment record demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 0341 - 77 22 119 for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Adam Fischer

Dear Credit Department,  

I, Bruno Kovacs, respectfully apply for a €3 077 consumer loan to purchase a smart 4K television and DAB+ stereo for my home studio. As a freelance sports commentator, high-quality screens and audio are essential work tools.  

I have been a full-time broadcasting officer with Czech Radio since March 2015, earning CZK 62 000 net (≈€2 540) monthly. I own a condominium bought two years ago and a Škoda Octavia registered in my name. Your bank already finances my mortgage top-up and a small car repair loan—both serviced without a single delay.  

While I currently operate solely with a payroll card, I will gladly open a checking account so instalments can be collected automatically. Stable salary, eight-year uninterrupted employment and perfect repayment history confirm my trustworthiness.  

I look forward to your positive response and can be reached at +420 511 88 66 05 at any time.  

Kind regards,  
Bruno Kovacs

To the Loan Assessment Team,  

My name is Carlos Mendes, 40 years old, single father of two teenagers. I seek a €3 077 loan to buy a combined television-radio set that supports their online classes and my weekend IT courses.  

Since 2014 I have worked as a senior machine operator at Sogrape Vinhos, earning €1 950 net monthly. I live in a house I own outright (inherited; assessed value €120 000) and drive a 2016 Renault Clio. I service two punctual loans with your branch and one small consumer loan at Banco BPI, all in good standing.  

Though I have no formal checking account, my salary is paid onto a company card; I will switch that to your bank so instalments—well within the 3 % rule—can be deducted automatically. My long tenure, property collateral and clean payment record make me a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for your time. Please phone me at 22 998 77 66 if more detail is required.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendes

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Daniel Weber, 40, single and supporting my two younger brothers through technical college. I apply for a €3 077 consumer loan to purchase an energy-efficient OLED TV and digital radio to replace our broken set.  

For the past nine years I have held the position of customs compliance officer at Henkel AG, earning €3 200 net per month. I own the apartment I reside in (valued at €180 000) and a 2018 VW Golf. I already maintain two credit agreements with your bank—both paid ahead of schedule—and one revolving line with Commerzbank that is 40 % utilised.  

While I operate on a payroll card rather than a current account, I am willing to open a checking relationship so that instalments are debited automatically. My steady employment, owned assets and flawless payment behaviour assure you of my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and am reachable at 0211 - 55 33 900.  

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Weber

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I, Edgar Müller (age 40), request a €3 077 loan to purchase a smart television and digital tuner essential for my two children’s remote schooling and my own evening language courses.  

I have been a certified electrical technician with ÖBB Railways for seven years and four months, earning €2 650 net monthly. I own a chalet (valued approx. €210 000) and a 2015 Subaru Forester. I hold two punctual instalment loans with your institution and a small renovation loan with Raiffeisen Bank, all serviced without incident.  

Despite not yet holding a checking account, I will open one upon approval so the repayment—below 3 % of my income—can be made automatically. My permanent employment, owned property and spotless credit behaviour underline my dependability.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available at 0512 - 44 88 77 for any further queries.  

With respect,  
Edgar Müller
