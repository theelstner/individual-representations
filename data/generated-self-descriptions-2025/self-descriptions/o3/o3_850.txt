Dear Credit Committee,
My name is Ivan Petrovic, 59, citizen of Croatia and resident of Augsburg. I respectfully request a loan of 1,364 DM to purchase a combined colour television and radio set for my home. The new unit will let me follow German news and language programs together with my twelve-year-old nephew Marko, who is financially dependent on me.

I have been employed for 5 years and 2 months as a precision toolmaker with MAN Roland Druckmaschinen AG, earning 3,450 DM net per month; the last twelve pay slips are attached. I already hold a small renovation loan with your bank (contract 214/97) and every instalment has been credited punctually since 1998. The requested credit would be repaid in nine equal monthly instalments of roughly 155 DM, which fits comfortably within the agreed rate.

Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 137 DM and my savings book contains only 82 DM, my financial base is sound: I own, mortgage-free, a two-storey house at Mozartstraße 18 valued at about 220,000 DM. I have no other debts, guarantees or instalment plans.

I may be contacted during working hours through the workshop office, as I do not keep a private line. I look forward to continuing my good relationship with your bank and thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic


Dear Loan Officer,
My name is Carlos Alberto Mendes, 59, Portuguese national living in my own flat in Düsseldorf for the past four years. I wish to finance a modern 32-inch television with integrated radio receiver, costing 1,364 DM, payable over nine months.

I have worked six years as senior customs clerk with the Federal Customs Office, earning 3,600 DM net per month. You currently service my only other credit, a 6,000 DM roof-repair loan taken in 1997; every instalment has been paid on or before the due date.

At present my giro account is overdrawn by 96 DM and my savings book shows 58 DM. Aside from normal living costs and the support of my university-age daughter, I carry no other obligations. My flat, bought outright in 1994, is valued at around 180,000 DM and provides solid collateral.

The planned instalments of about 152 DM will not strain my budget and will be transferred automatically from my salary account. I trust my employment stability, spotless payment record and property ownership demonstrate my reliability.
Respectfully,
Carlos A. Mendes


To the Credit Department,
I, Jan Novak, 59-year-old Slovak technician residing in Cologne, hereby apply for a consumer loan of 1,364 DM to purchase a satellite radio/TV set. The equipment will enable me and my dependent mother to receive broadcasts from our home country and stay informed.

For five and a half years I have worked as a certified maintenance electrician at Ford Werke GmbH, earning approximately 3,200 DM net each month. My only previous borrowing was a 3,000 DM bridge loan from your branch, repaid in full three months ago.

My giro account currently shows a debit balance of 172 DM; my savings passbook holds 93 DM. I owe no one else money and offer no guarantees. I live in a detached house on Lahnstraße appraised at 205,000 DM and fully owned by me.

The loan will be amortised within nine months at about 153 DM per month—less than 5 % of my income. With real estate as security and a clean repayment history, I believe I am a low-risk applicant. I welcome a positive decision and am available through the plant switchboard if further documents are needed.
Kind regards,
Jan Novak


Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Ahmed Khalil, Egyptian citizen, 59 years old, living in Heidelberg since 1995. I request a credit of 1,364 DM for the purchase of a combined radio and colour television so my teenage grandson, whom I support, can follow educational programmes.

Since April 1994 I have served as a laboratory stock officer at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, earning 3,250 DM net per month. In 1998 you granted me a 10,000 DM home-insulation loan; payments have never been late and only three instalments remain.

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 143 DM and my savings book contains 69 DM. I possess no further debts. I own a two-room condominium at Sofienstraße 11, estimated at 190,000 DM and free of mortgages.

The requested sum will be repaid in nine instalments of about 152 DM, handled via standing order on salary day. I have attached pay slips and proof of ownership and would be grateful for your approval.
Yours faithfully,
Ahmed Khalil


Dear Members of the Lending Committee,
My name is Piotr Kowalski, age 59, Polish national, and I have lived in my own townhouse in Bremen for four years. I seek a consumer loan of 1,364 DM to finance a high-definition television with digital radio receiver, replacing a faulty unit and allowing me to follow the distance-learning broadcasts required for my job.

For 4 years and 8 months I have been a certified shipping scheduler at BLG Logistics Group, drawing 3,150 DM net monthly. You currently hold my only outstanding credit, a 5,500 DM car-repair loan opened in January 1999; all instalments have been executed punctually.

Financial standing: Girokonto –128 DM; Sparbuch 71 DM. No other credit lines or guarantees. I support my elderly father with a monthly remittance of 400 DM. I own my residence at Weserufer 27 free and clear; the last municipal assessment values it at roughly 210,000 DM.

The loan will be repaid over nine months in instalments of about 152 DM, comfortably within my disposable income. My stable employment, property and flawless payment record qualify me as a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for your consideration; I can be reached via the personnel office at BLG for any clarification.
Sincerely,
Piotr Kowalski
