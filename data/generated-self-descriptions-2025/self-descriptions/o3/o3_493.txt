LETTER 1  
Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna-Maria Krüger, 42, divorced, with one twelve-year-old daughter. For the past eight years I have been an administrative officer in the Department of Urban Planning for the City of Stuttgart. I am seeking a loan of 8 318 DM over 27 months to launch “PlanData-Service,” a side business that digitises small-town construction archives. The start-up costs consist mainly of a high-speed scanner and licensing for archival software; pilot contracts with the municipalities of Esslingen and Böblingen are already signed.  

My financial situation is stable. My net monthly salary is 6 200 DM, and housing is provided free of charge by the municipality, leaving me with ample disposable income. My checking account usually carries a positive balance (currently 148 DM) and I hold a small savings account of 62 DM. I have two outstanding instalment loans with your bank—one for a car and one for further-education tuition—both serviced punctually for the past three years. I have never missed or delayed a payment.  

Because my position is tenured and my career has been with the same employer since 2017, my income is secure. The requested instalment fits easily below the 2-rate category, and I have no other debts or obligations besides caring for my daughter. My consistent payment record and municipal employment make me a low-risk, reliable customer. I would therefore be grateful for your support in turning this promising venture into reality.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Anna-Maria Krüger

LETTER 2  
Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dr. Franziska Leitner, 42, married with one dependent son. For the last nine years I have been the managing proprietor of “Elb-Apotheke,” an independent pharmacy in Hamburg-Altona. I request a business loan of 8 318 DM, to be repaid over 27 months, to finance a small consulting room and purchase a therapeutic ultrasound device, allowing me to expand into physician-referred physiotherapy services.  

Annual turnover at the pharmacy exceeds 1.2 million DM, and my personal net monthly income averages 8 500 DM. My checking account balance is currently 121 DM and I keep 45 DM in a call-money account. My housing is the flat above the pharmacy, provided rent-free under the long-term lease. I have maintained two small equipment loans with your bank for five years; both are on schedule with no arrears. Apart from these, I carry no consumer debt.  

I have always honoured every financial obligation and have never been registered for late payment. My professional licence, steady client base, and decade-long residence in the same location all underpin my reliability. The planned expansion is already supported by a letter of intent from two local orthopaedic practices guaranteeing patient referrals.  

The modest loan will let me complete the fit-out next quarter and begin generating additional cash flow within six months. I look forward to continuing our successful banking relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Franziska Leitner

LETTER 3  
Munich, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Sabine Hochreiter, 42, separated, with one dependent daughter. I have been a senior software engineer at Siemens AG for eight and a half years, earning a net salary of 7 300 DM per month. I apply for an 8 318 DM business loan over 27 months to purchase a desktop CNC milling machine and associated CAD-CAM software for my registered side enterprise, “ProtoByte Manufacturing.”  

Financially, I am conservative. My current account shows 175 DM, and I hold 53 DM in a savings bond. Housing is cost-free in a company-owned apartment block. I have two active credits with your bank (further-education loan and household appliances), both serviced without fail since inception. I carry no other instalment plans or credit cards.  

The proposed monthly repayment comfortably fits below 10 % of my net income, which, together with my minimal living expenses, provides a solid buffer. I have signed preliminary supply agreements with two local start-ups requiring small aluminium enclosures, guaranteeing revenue from the first quarter after purchase.  

My spotless credit history, long-term employment, and demonstrated technical know-how make me a dependable borrower. I would appreciate the bank’s support in scaling a venture that is already showing demand.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Sabine Hochreiter

LETTER 4  
Cologne, 17 September 2025  

To the Loan Panel,  

I am Claudia Neumann, 42, divorced, mother of a fourteen-year-old girl. For the past seven years I have managed the Radisson Blu Hotel at Cologne Airport, drawing a net salary of 8 900 DM. I now seek an 8 318 DM loan, repayable over 27 months, to acquire a licensed coffee-kiosk franchise that will operate in the hotel lobby and adjoining public concourse.  

Current finances: checking account balance 117 DM; call-money balance 39 DM. Accommodation is part of my employment package, so I incur no rent. I maintain two instalment loans with your bank—both prepaid two months ahead of schedule. I have no additional liabilities.  

The kiosk franchise fees are discounted until year-end, and projected cash flow (based on airport foot traffic studies) indicates break-even within eight months. My managerial experience, supplier contacts, and existing staff resources significantly reduce operational risk.  

My unblemished credit record, stable income, and four-year residence at the same address confirm my reliability. I am confident of repaying the loan well within term and look forward to extending our constructive banking relationship.  

With thanks for your time,  

Best regards,  
Claudia Neumann

LETTER 5  
Dresden, 17 September 2025  

Dear Banking Officers,  

My name is Elke Scholz, 42, married, with one dependent son. For eight years I have been a self-employed certified court translator, recently adding technical documentation services for the micro-electronics sector. I request a loan of 8 318 DM, term 27 months, to finance specialised terminology software, a high-speed server, and marketing for my new B2B language portal.  

Income for the last fiscal year was 162 000 DM, yielding an average monthly net of 6 700 DM. My checking account balance is presently 102 DM and my call deposit stands at 57 DM. We live rent-free in my in-laws’ garden flat; food and utilities average 1 200 DM, keeping fixed costs low. I have two open loans with your bank—both for office equipment—paid punctually every month since 2021. No other debts exist.  

The requested instalment will stay below the customary 2-rate ceiling, leaving ample liquidity. A framework contract with GlobalFoundries Dresden, already countersigned, guarantees a minimum monthly turnover of 9 000 DM once the new portal is operational.  

My eight-year track record of on-time payments, certified professional status, and stable residence demonstrate my trustworthiness. I am confident the investment will increase turnover by at least 25 % within the first year, enabling early repayment if desired.  

Thank you for your favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Elke Scholz
