To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Peter Hoffmann, 37, single, and I have been employed for three years as a technical draftsman with Siemens Energy in Frankfurt. I am applying for an education loan of 1 819 DM over 36 months to finance a part-time CAD‐specialist certificate at the Frankfurt Chamber of Engineers. The course begins in September and will strengthen my position for an impending promotion.  

Financially, I earn a net 3 200 DM per month. I reside free of charge in my parents’ home and therefore have low fixed expenses. Apart from a small store installment plan (62 DM/month, paid punctually), I have no outstanding obligations. Two years ago I took a 2 000 DM consumer loan with your bank and repaid it on schedule; this is the only credit in my history. I keep modest savings of about 80 DM.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account, my employment is stable and my repayment record spotless. The requested loan would be serviced from my disposable income at 4 % of salary (about 128 DM/month), leaving ample margin for unforeseen costs and for the support of my 9-year-old son. I am confident that my strengthened qualifications will further increase my income and security.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 069-7 55 33 21 for any questions and look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Peter Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Dragan Ivanov, am requesting an education loan of 1 819 DM, repayable over 36 months, to cover tuition and books for the German B2 language diploma at the Goethe-Institut. Fluent German is the final requirement for my promotion to senior laboratory technician at Charité University Hospital, where I have worked for two years.  

My monthly net salary is 2 900 DM. I live free of charge in a staff dormitory and have no rent burden. My only current liability is a refrigerator bought from Karstadt last year (48 DM/month, six payments remaining). I previously held a 1 500 DM study loan with your bank and settled it early. My savings amount to 60 DM; I maintain no checking account but receive my salary on a prepaid payroll card.  

The proposed installment of roughly 120 DM (4 % of income) is well within my budget, and I have never missed a payment on any obligation. My brother, whom I support, is my sole dependent. With improved language skills I expect a salary increase of at least 15 %, further securing repayment.  

I appreciate your time and hope for favorable consideration. I can be reached at 030-88 44 992.  

Kind regards,  
Dragan Ivanov

To the Loan Department,  

My name is Martin Schmidt, aged 37, single, with one dependent daughter. I request a loan of 1 819 DM for 36 months to finance the final semester fees of my evening Bachelor of Business Administration at the Hamburg School of Economics.  

I have served as a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg for 1 year and 8 months, earning a net income of 3 350 DM. My accommodation is provided free by the customs authority. I own no property and hold only 95 DM in a savings booklet. I carry a small Kaufhof furniture plan (55 DM/month) and previously settled a 2 200 DM auto repair loan with your bank without delay.  

With an installment of about 130 DM per month (4 % of my income), repayment is comfortably covered. My stable civil-service position, spotless credit record, and low living costs underline my reliability. Completing the degree will qualify me for grade A9 pay, enhancing my repayment capacity.  

Thank you for evaluating my application. I am available any time on 040-61 22 455.  

Respectfully,  
Martin Schmidt

Esteemed Credit Team,  

I, Andreas Meier, 37 years old and single, request a 1 819 DM education loan over 36 months. The funds will pay for the Certified Automation Programmer course at the Bosch Training Academy, crucial for my advancement at Robert Bosch GmbH where I have been a maintenance electrician for exactly three years.  

My net monthly pay is 3 000 DM, supplemented by an annual bonus. I live rent-free in a company apartment. Current obligations are limited to a 43 DM/month electronics store plan, always paid on time. Three years ago I obtained a 1 200 DM personal loan from your bank and repaid it flawlessly. Savings stand at 70 DM; I operate without a checking account as my wages are deposited onto a Bosch pay card.  

A 4 % installment equals 120 DM monthly, which I will remit through automatic deduction from my salary card. My solid employment, perfect repayment history, and minimal living costs make me a dependable borrower. The certification is expected to raise my salary by at least 400 DM per month, providing further security.  

I look forward to your favorable response and am reachable at 0711-3 88 77 19.  

With best regards,  
Andreas Meier
