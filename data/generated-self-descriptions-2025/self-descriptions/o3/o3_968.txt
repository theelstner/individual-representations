Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ahmed Khan, a 23-year-old single machinist’s aide at Rhein-Metall Parts GmbH in Bremen. I have held this position for 2 years and earn a net salary of 2 350 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 2 520 DM to purchase a modern television and radio set to replace my 15-year-old unit and allow my young son to follow German language programs and improve his studies.  

My finances are solid. My checking balance averages 160 DM, and I keep 780 DM in a building-society savings plan and 25 000 DM of life-insurance cover. Although I maintain two small installment loans with your bank (both paid on time for the past 18 months) and one furniture loan at Otto Versand, all monthly obligations remain below 26 % of my income.  

I live in an inherited condominium, have no guarantors or other debtors, and have never missed a payment. Regular salary credits and stable residence demonstrate my reliability. I respectfully request the committee’s approval and will gladly supply any additional documentation.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khan

To the Lending Officer,  

I am Piotr Nowak, a Polish national employed for 3 years as a warehouse operative at Hamburg Harbour Services, earning 2 500 DM net. I seek a 2 520 DM consumer loan for a combined radio-TV set that will also serve as a monitor for the evening vocational courses I attend online.  

Despite a modest current-account balance of roughly 110 DM, I have 900 DM saved in a Bausparvertrag and hold a 30 000 DM life-insurance policy. I currently service two micro-credits with your bank; each has been paid punctually for 21 months. A prior retail loan with Kaufhof, now closed, was repaid without incident.  

Owning my small apartment for the past 2 years keeps living costs low. With no dependents except my younger brother, my total monthly installments—including the requested loan—would remain at 640 DM, well within my budget. My consistent employment, savings habit, and perfect payment record attest to my trustworthiness.  

I appreciate your favorable review.  

Respectfully,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is João da Silva, 23, single, and a forklift driver at BASF Ludwigshafen since August 2022. I earn 2 200 DM net and request a 2 520 DM loan to buy an energy-efficient television and digital radio so my family in Portugal can stay connected through video calls.  

Financially, I keep about 140 DM in checking and 760 DM in a savings bond. I also contribute 45 DM monthly to a life-insurance policy worth 20 000 DM. I hold two active installment contracts with your institution—both spotless for 17 months—and have no other borrowings.  

My apartment, purchased with family help, reduces housing risk. Including the new loan, my repayment ratio will be 28 % of income, comfortably below prudent limits. My steady employment record, ownership of property, and disciplined savings underline my reliability. I am confident I will honor every installment.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
João da Silva

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Anatoliy Petrov, a Ukrainian resident of Cologne. For the past 1 year and 9 months I have been a packaging line worker at Henkel AG, earning 2 150 DM net. I request a 2 520 DM loan to purchase a high-definition TV-radio combo; the old set failed and I intend to rent out a spare room that requires such amenities.  

Current account balance: 125 DM. Savings: 820 DM in a Bauspar contract. Insurance: 25 000 DM term life. I maintain two prior credits with your bank totaling 4 000 DM, each serviced without delay, and no other open credit lines.  

I own my flat, have lived at the same address for 2 years, and support one dependent niece. Even with the requested loan my total monthly installments will not exceed 600 DM, or 27 % of net income. My immaculate payment history and secure housing underpin my creditworthiness.  

I look forward to your positive response and am available for any questions.  

Sincerely,  
Anatoliy Petrov

To the Honorable Loan Panel,  

I am Luis García, 23, single, and a machine operator at Siemens Nuremberg, employed since November 2021 with a stable net income of 2 400 DM. I apply for a 2 520 DM loan to finance a multi-band radio and smart television essential for the remote technical courses I follow after work.  

My checking account usually holds around 170 DM; I keep 950 DM in a life-insurance-linked savings plan and own my condominium, occupied for the last 2 years. Two existing small credits with your bank have been serviced flawlessly for 22 months. Apart from an old student bicycle loan at another institution—settled last year—I have no external debt.  

Even after adding the new loan, my repayment load will remain under 30 % of income. Reliable salary inflows, proven payment discipline, and tangible collateral in savings and property make me a low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to continue building my credit relationship with your bank.  

Best regards,  
Luis García
