Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Michael Berger. For the past eight years I have worked as a senior research engineer at Siemens Energy in Erlangen, earning a fixed monthly net salary of 4,600 DM. I am requesting a 1,358 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a specialised industrial-grade laptop that my department will not reimburse, but which I need to finish a development project that will secure an internal patent bonus later this year.  

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 320 DM because I paid school costs for my nine-year-old son in advance, my overall financial situation is solid. I own a two-room condominium in Erlangen (market value about 150,000 DM) and a fully paid Ford Mondeo. My only other obligation is a 48-DM monthly instalment on a furniture purchase from a local store.  

Three years ago I took a 2,000 DM renovation loan with your bank; every instalment was booked on time and the loan is now fully settled. My long, stable employment, home ownership and clean repayment record demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. The requested amount is modest relative to my income, and the proposed 4 % instalment rate fits comfortably into my monthly budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Michael Berger

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Dr. Karim Haddad, a self-employed language-technology consultant operating in Munich since 2012. I earn an average net income of 5,100 DM per month, documented through the attached tax assessments. I seek a loan of 1,358 DM for 24 months to cover my ten-year-old daughter Lina’s semester fees at the Bavarian State Music Academy.  

My current account shows a temporary overdraft of 410 DM, caused by quarterly VAT pre-payments that fall before many of my client invoices are settled. I possess a paid-off Volkswagen Passat (2018, value approx. 12,000 DM) and live in a townhouse that I own outright in the Westend district. Aside from a 60 DM monthly store instalment for home fitness equipment, I have no other debts.  

In 2019 I obtained a 3,500 DM business equipment loan from your bank and repaid it six months ahead of schedule without missing a single instalment. This clean track record, combined with steady professional income and property ownership, underlines my credit-worthiness. The requested amount is relatively small and will be serviced comfortably through my regular cash flow.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am confident we can finalise the loan swiftly.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Karim Haddad

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Thomas Richter, Captain in the German Federal Police, stationed in Hamburg. I have served continuously for twelve years and currently earn a net salary of 4,300 DM per month plus duty allowances. I request a 1,358 DM personal loan to pay the fees for a leadership certification course that the Police Academy requires for my upcoming promotion board.  

Because I recently replaced the roof on my privately owned row house, my checking account is overdrawn by 280 DM. Nevertheless, my financial base is secure: the house is worth approximately 180,000 DM and my Nissan Qashqai is fully paid. I carry only a 55 DM monthly store instalment for household appliances and have no other bank liabilities.  

Four years ago I took a 5,000 DM loan with your institution to modernise my kitchen. All 24 instalments were transferred punctually, and the loan was closed without incident. My long government service, stable income, and prior flawless repayment demonstrate that I am a low-risk borrower. At a 4 % instalment rate, the new payment will account for less than 4 % of my net monthly income.  

Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate your continued support.  

Respectfully,  
Thomas Richter

Dear Financial Services Team,  

I am Leonardo Conti, general manager of the Marriott City Hotel in Cologne, a position I have held for eleven years. My fixed net salary is 5,700 DM per month plus performance bonuses. I am applying for a 1,358 DM loan over 24 months to finalise the installation of a high-efficiency heating pump in my privately owned duplex. The contractor requires a final payment that I prefer to finance rather than draw from operating cash.  

My current account shows an overdraft of 365 DM after I prepaid travel expenses for an upcoming industry conference. I own the duplex (market value 210,000 DM) and a Mercedes C-Class, both free of liens. Besides a 62 DM instalment plan with a local electronics store, I carry no other debt.  

In 2017 I obtained a 10,000 DM personal loan from your bank to furnish guest apartments; every payment was made on due date, and the loan was settled last December. This spotless history, together with stable executive employment and real-estate ownership, confirms my reliability. The requested sum is modest and will be repaid comfortably from salary.  

I would be grateful for a prompt approval.  

Sincerely,  
Leonardo Conti

Dear Credit Officers,  

My name is Andrej Novak. Since 2013 I have run NovaTech Solutions, an IT-security consultancy registered in Stuttgart. My average monthly net income over the past three years is 4,800 DM, verified through filed tax returns. I am requesting a 1,358 DM loan for 24 months to purchase a batch of smart-card readers required for a new contract with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.  

My checking account is currently 390 DM in the negative because I advanced travel costs for an on-site audit in Frankfurt. I own a three-year-old Škoda Superb (fully paid) and live in a condominium I purchased in 2020, now valued at about 165,000 DM. Other than a 48 DM monthly instalment for office furniture from a retail store, I hold no outside debts.  

Two years ago I took a 6,000 DM start-up loan from your bank. All instalments were remitted precisely on the agreed dates, and the loan was cleared last month. My solid repayment record, stable earnings, and tangible assets make me a dependable borrower. The new loan’s instalments will fit easily within my projected cash flow and help me expand billable work.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Best regards,  
Andrej Novak
