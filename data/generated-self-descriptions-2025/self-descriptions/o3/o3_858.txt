Heidelberg, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Dr. Anja Müller, 40, divorced, with one eleven-year-old daughter. For the past five years I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where I earn a net monthly salary of €2,950. Three years ago I bought and fully paid for a small row house in Heidelberg; I also hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz.  

I am applying for a €894 loan over ten months to finance a certified data-science retraining course that begins in October. This qualification will let me move from grant-based research to a permanent data-analysis position already offered by my department, raising my income by at least €450 per month.  

My only other liability is a €1,200 appliance loan with your bank, of which €300 remains; every installment has been settled on time. I have never missed a payment on any credit and I keep written records of all due dates because I prefer to manage my budget without a checking account. Monthly repayment of approximately €90 fits comfortably within my budget, leaving over €1,800 after fixed costs.  

I value reliability and transparency, and you may reach me at any time on the telephone number on file to verify employment or references. Thank you for considering my request; I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Anja Müller

Düsseldorf, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Mrs. Sofia Dellmann, 40 years old and married with one dependent son. Since 2019 I have served as an administrative officer (Beamte im gehobenen Dienst) at the Düsseldorf Police Headquarters, earning €3,120 net monthly, with automatic civil-service tenure next year. I own a condominium in Gerresheim, purchased three years ago. A building-society savings contract with LBS is in force and fully up to date.  

I request a €894 loan for ten months to cover tuition and materials for a certified mediation and conflict-resolution program. The Police Presidium will reimburse half the course fee once completed, but I must advance the full amount by October.  

Your bank currently holds my only other credit, a €5,000 energy-upgrade loan opened two years ago; each payment has been made punctually. With housing and household costs of €1,200, my budget easily supports a €95 monthly installment.  

My steady civil-service income, spotless repayment record, and personal commitment to fulfilling obligations make me a low-risk candidate. I can be contacted at the telephone number listed on my file for any additional information. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Sofia Dellmann

Leipzig, 15 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Ms. Beatriz Scholz, a 40-year-old separated mother of a nine-year-old boy. For four and a half years I have been employed as a licensed vocational nurse at St. Georg Hospital Leipzig, earning €2,650 net per month. I own my townhouse in Eutritzsch and maintain a life-insurance policy valued at €18,000.  

I seek a €894 loan (ten-month term) to finance an intensive oncology nursing course starting next month. Completion will add a €300 monthly allowance to my salary and secure my placement in the oncology ward.  

Your institution currently services my €2,400 bathroom-renovation loan; repayments have never been late. I have no other installment plans, credit cards, or overdrafts. After fixed expenses of about €1,600, I will have more than €150 free each month even after the new €95 payment, ensuring comfortable coverage.  

My history of punctual repayment, stable employment, and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. I am reachable by telephone at any time for further details. I appreciate your favorable review.  

Sincerely,  
Beatriz Scholz

Nuremberg, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loans Officer,  

My name is Katharina Weber, 40, divorced with one dependent daughter. I have worked for six years as a certified customs clerk at the Nuremberg Main Customs Office, earning €2,880 net monthly. Three years ago I purchased a small detached house, and I hold a building-society savings agreement with Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall.  

I am applying for a €894 loan over ten months to cover the fee for an international trade-compliance retraining program endorsed by the Federal Customs Service. The certificate will make me eligible for level-A officer status and a projected salary increase of €400 per month.  

I currently have a €3,000 solar-panel loan with your bank; all installments have been paid according to schedule. I keep my finances on a prepaid card rather than a checking account and maintain a detailed household ledger. The new repayment of roughly €90 will leave me with more than €1,500 after all obligations.  

My civil-service position, proven repayment discipline, and property assets provide strong security. Please feel free to contact me by telephone for any documentation. Thank you for considering my request.  

Best regards,  
Katharina Weber  



Letter 5  
Bremen, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Mrs. Elena Conte, 40 years old, married, with one twelve-year-old son. For the last five years I have worked as a senior ship-logistics coordinator for Bremerhaven Port Services, earning €3,040 net each month. I own my terraced house in Bremen-Nord and hold an AXA life-insurance policy worth €25,000.  

I kindly request a €894 loan to be repaid in ten equal installments. The funds will finance a professional scrum-master certification that the company requires for promotion to department lead, a position already earmarked for me with a €500 salary increase. The course starts in October and must be paid upfront.  

I have one other credit with your bank—a €2,800 boiler replacement loan—on which every payment has been made exactly on the due date. I carry no other debt. After regular expenses of €1,400, I will still retain over €1,500 monthly, easily covering the new €95 installment.  

My consistent payment history, stable income, and ownership of my home demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I am reachable by telephone at any moment should further information be required. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Elena Conte
