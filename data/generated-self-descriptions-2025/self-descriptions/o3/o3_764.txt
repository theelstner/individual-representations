Stuttgart, 23 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrovic, a 24-year-old Croatian citizen who has been working as a warehouse assistant at RheinCargo GmbH for the past 2 years and 3 months. My net income averages 2,050 DM per month and is paid punctually.

I am applying for a loan of 2,214 DM to purchase a combined radio-television set for my new apartment. The set will allow me and my six-year-old son to access German-language news and educational programs, which is important for my ongoing integration.

Although my current account shows an overdraft of 87 DM—caused by moving expenses last month—I have never missed an installment on the 1,500 DM furniture loan you granted me in 2023. That credit will be settled in April 2026. I hold a building-society savings contract with a current value of 6,400 DM, which I can pledge as collateral if required. In addition, I have no other debts, always reside at the same address for three years, and my rent is fully paid until the end of the quarter.

An installment rate of 4% fits easily within my budget, leaving more than 60 % of my salary for living expenses. I therefore kindly request that you approve my application and allow me to continue building a solid credit history with your bank.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

To the Credit Committee,

I am Carlos Mendes, a 24-year-old Portuguese national employed as a kitchen porter at Hotel Augusta since January 2024 (1 year 8 months). My monthly net pay is 1,890 DM.

The loan of 2,214 DM will be used to purchase a radio and television set for my recently acquired studio apartment. Having already invested all of my savings—currently only 72 DM remain on my savings account—I need external financing for these essential household items.

Despite a checking-account overdraft of 43 DM, my repayment record is spotless: the 900 DM relocation loan I took from your bank last year has been serviced for twelve consecutive months without delay. I have no other obligations, no guarantors, and my life-insurance policy with Allianz (insured sum 10,000 DM, surrender value 1,250 DM) provides additional security.

I propose a 4 % installment rate, representing just 76 DM per month—well below the 30 % affordability threshold. My stable employment, clean payment history, and existing relationship with your institution make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to continuing our successful cooperation.

Kind regards,
Carlos Mendes

Esteemed Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Khan, Pakistani citizen, age 24, working as a construction laborer at Haupt & Söhne Bau AG for 3 years and 2 months. Net income: 2,180 DM monthly.

I seek a 2,214 DM loan to buy a quality television-radio combo. The device will support my German-language evening course (telekolleg) and allow my five-year-old daughter to watch children’s programs.

Financially, I maintain one active credit with your bank (1,200 DM for tools), which will be fully repaid in seven months. All installments have been made on schedule. My current account is overdrawn by 55 DM after paying annual residence-permit fees, but my average balance is positive. I hold a life-insurance policy worth 12,500 DM (surrender value 1,870 DM) and have no other liabilities.

A 4 % repayment rate equals 89 DM per month, comfortably affordable given my fixed living costs. My steady employment record, existing collateral, and past punctuality guarantee low risk for the bank.

I appreciate your time and hope for a favorable decision.

Respectfully,
Ahmed Khan

Leipzig, 29 September 2025

Dear Credit Department,

I, Marek Novak, am a 24-year-old Slovak resident working the night shift as a cleaner at Metro Cash & Carry. Employment length: 1 year 1 month. Monthly net income: 1,720 DM.

The requested 2,214 DM will finance a second-hand television and DAB radio. My 16-year-old brother, whom I support, begins online vocational training next semester, and reliable media access is essential.

My sole existing credit with your bank—a 1,400 DM education expense loan—has been serviced flawlessly for eleven months. Present account balance is −36 DM, a temporary situation after paying school fees. I own a modest condominium purchased through a building-society savings agreement; equity share currently stands at 9,800 DM.

A 4 % installment would be 78 DM monthly, well within my disposable income. With stable housing, no additional debts, and proven payment discipline, I believe I represent a trustworthy applicant.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Marek Novak

Berlin, 30 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Paul Kimani, Kenyan national, 24 years old, employed as a hospital orderly at St. Hedwig Klinik since November 2023 (1 year 11 months). My net salary is 2,030 DM.

I wish to obtain a loan of 2,214 DM to purchase a modern television and stereo system for my newly renovated apartment, which I own. These items will improve my quality of life during variable shift schedules and enable me to follow German medical programs for professional development.

My checking account is currently −48 DM due to quarterly utilities, but I have never defaulted on the 1,000 DM micro-loan issued by your branch in February 2024. I also hold a building-society savings account with a balance of 5,200 DM, demonstrating my commitment to long-term financial planning.

At a 4 % installment rate, monthly payments will be 86 DM—less than 5 % of my income—ensuring comfortable servicing. Continuous employment, property ownership, and impeccable repayment history underline my reliability.

I respectfully request your approval and look forward to strengthening our banking relationship.

Warm regards,
Paul Kimani
