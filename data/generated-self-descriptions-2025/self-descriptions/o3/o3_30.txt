Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Rossi, an Italian mechanical technician employed at BMW’s Regensburg plant since February 2023 (26 months). I am applying for a 2 415 DM loan to purchase a Grundig OLED television and compatible DAB+ radio set for my home. My current account balance averages 120 DM and my savings account holds 65 DM; however, my salary of 4 100 DM gross per month comfortably covers the proposed 3 % installment rate.  

I have one existing car loan with your bank that I have serviced punctually for the past 18 months; the outstanding balance will be cleared in September. I own a condominium in Regenstauf that I purchased in 2021 and I live there with my six-year-old son. My cousin, Dr. Paolo Bianchi, a physician in Nürnberg, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.  

As a foreign worker I value the trust your bank has extended to me, and my flawless repayment record demonstrates my reliability. This small consumer loan will not strain my budget and will further strengthen my credit history with your institution.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am ready to supply payslips and guarantor documents at your convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Aleksandar Petrović, a Serbian civil-service clerk at the Munich Building Authority, respectfully request a 2 415 DM loan to replace my outdated radio and black-and-white television with energy-efficient units. I have worked for the authority since June 2022 (22 months) and earn 3 650 DM gross monthly.  

My current account rarely exceeds 180 DM because I remit funds home to support my mother and eight-year-old daughter. Savings stand at 40 DM, yet my net income easily allows the 3 % installment, even after existing obligations. I previously financed a refrigerator through your bank and repaid the 1 800 DM in full last December, two months ahead of schedule.  

I own a small townhouse in Neuperlach, bought with my personal funds. My close friend and colleague, senior officer Martin Stadler, has signed on as guarantor. With a permanent civil-service contract, stable residence (two years) and an unblemished payment record, I believe I am a low-risk applicant.  

I appreciate your time and trust that my employment security and demonstrated discipline will meet your criteria. Supporting documents are enclosed.  

Yours faithfully,  
Aleksandar Petrović

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Carlos Mendes, a Portuguese research laboratory assistant at Fraunhofer-IVV in Freising, employed since March 2021 (37 months). I am applying for a 2 415 DM consumer loan to purchase a professional-grade television and radio set for remote data-analysis work I often conduct from home.  

Although my checking account balance is modest (currently 60 DM) and savings total 88 DM, my monthly net income of 3 900 DM assures convenient repayment under the 3 % plan. I hold one previous credit with your bank—a 5-month computer loan—which I settled flawlessly in January.  

I own a small parcel of inherited land near Porto and recently acquired a condominium in Freising, free of mortgage. My brother-in-law, João Ferreira, an Airbus project engineer, will guarantee the loan.  

My three-year track record at Fraunhofer, property ownership and spotless credit history underscore my reliability. I am committed to maintaining the strong relationship I have developed with your institution.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Ivan Popov, a Bulgarian customs official stationed at Flughafen München since August 2023 (20 months). I seek a 2 415 DM loan to finance the purchase of a modern television and short-wave radio, tools that help me stay informed about international developments pertinent to my work.  

My current account shows 95 DM and I have 30 DM in savings. My steady gross salary of 4 250 DM and official allowances leave ample room for the 3 % installment, alongside regular expenses for my seven-year-old son’s schooling. I previously took a 3 000 DM relocation loan from your bank and repaid it exactly on schedule last month.  

I reside in and own a two-bedroom apartment in Moosach, purchased with personal funds. Captain Ralf König of the Bundespolizei, my superior and mentor, has formally agreed to act as guarantor.  

My service record, punctual repayments and real-estate assets assure you of my creditworthiness. I respectfully request favourable consideration.  

With gratitude,  
Ivan Popov

Dear Loan Manager,  

I, Miguel Hernández, a Spanish administrative specialist at the Bavarian Tax Office, have been employed since May 2022 (23 months). I wish to obtain a 2 415 DM loan to upgrade my apartment’s radio and television, essential for the remote tax-law seminars I teach after hours.  

My checking account balance is currently 140 DM and I hold 70 DM in savings. My net salary of 3 800 DM and seminar honoraria allow me to meet the 3 % installment without difficulty. I already have one education loan with your bank; every payment has been made before the due date for the past 14 months.  

I own the condominium where I live in Sendling, purchased in 2021. My uncle, José Ramírez, a notary in Barcelona, stands ready as guarantor and has forwarded his financial statements for your file.  

As a civil servant with a stable income, a spotless repayment record and tangible property assets, I am confident of meeting all obligations. I look forward to reinforcing our mutually beneficial relationship.  

Thank you for your attention and I remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Hernández
