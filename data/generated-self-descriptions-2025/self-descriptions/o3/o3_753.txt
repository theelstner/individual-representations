Frankfurt, 13 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Kovacs, a 23-year-old Hungarian national who has been living in Germany for two years. For the past eight months I have worked full-time as a kitchen assistant at GreenLeaf Senior Residence, earning a steady net income of about 1 850 DM per month. I am divorced and support my three-year-old son alone.

I am requesting a loan of 976 DM to purchase a reliable 2006 Opel Corsa so I can reach my early-morning shifts on time and safely bring my child to kindergarten. At present I rely on a bicycle and public transport that does not operate during my 5 a.m. start.

Although my current account is 87 DM in overdraft and my savings total only 75 DM, I have already demonstrated that I honour my obligations: last year I repaid a 500 DM micro-loan from your bank three months ahead of schedule. I own a small one-room apartment, free of any mortgage, which I inherited from my grandmother. I have no other debts or guarantors.

With an instalment plan of 82 DM over twelve months the repayment fits comfortably within my budget. I value the good relationship I have built with your branch during the past 18 months and would be grateful for your renewed confidence.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovacs

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ana Rodriguez, a 23-year-old Spanish citizen separated from my spouse and raising my four-year-old daughter. For ten months I have been employed as a warehouse packer at RheinMain Logistics GmbH, earning a net 1 950 DM monthly.

I seek a 976 DM loan to buy a 2005 Ford Fiesta. Owning this car will allow me to stop paying 120 DM each month for train tickets and guarantee punctual attendance at my 6 a.m. shifts.

My current account is 45 DM overdrawn and my savings come to 60 DM, yet my payment record is spotless: the 800 DM study loan I took from this bank in 2023 was cleared on time. I own a small condominium valued at roughly 45 000 DM and have no other liabilities.

With a proposed repayment of 82 DM for twelve months, I can comfortably manage the instalments while maintaining household expenses. I hope my consistent employment, property ownership and previous repayment history prove that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your attention.

Respectfully,
Ana Rodriguez

To the Credit Department,

My name is Yuliya Petrova, a Bulgarian citizen, 23 years old, married, with a one-year-old son. Since March 2025 I have worked as a room attendant at Hotel Adler, earning around 1 700 DM after tax each month.

I am applying for a 976 DM loan to replace my failing 1994 Lada with a 2007 VW Polo. Reliable transport is essential for late-evening shifts and for taking my child to medical check-ups.

Financially, I keep a tight budget: my account stands 36 DM in the red and I hold 55 DM in savings. Nevertheless, I repaid a 1 000 DM furniture loan from your bank this year without a single delay. I also own a small mortgage-free cottage outside Varna, which adds to my financial stability.

An instalment of 82 DM over twelve months fits well within my disposable income. My flawless repayment record and steady employment underscore my trustworthiness.

I look forward to your favourable reply.

Kind regards,
Yuliya Petrova

Kassel, 13 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Olena Novak, 23, divorced, with a five-year-old son. For the last nine months I have been employed as a caregiver at Sonnenhof Senior Center, earning 2 050 DM net per month.

I wish to borrow 976 DM to purchase a 2008 Skoda Fabia. The car will allow me to cover the 22 km commute for my 6 a.m. shift and reduce expensive taxi fares when public buses are not running.

My current account shows an overdraft of 63 DM and I have 80 DM in a savings account. In 2024 I repaid a 600 DM appliance loan with your bank ahead of schedule. I own a small studio apartment outright after my divorce settlement and carry no additional debt.

A twelve-month plan with 82 DM instalments is well within my budget. My consistent work record and prior prompt repayments illustrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering this request.

Sincerely,
Olena Novak

Dresden, 13 September 2025

To whom it may concern,

My name is Katarina Ionescu, a 23-year-old Romanian citizen, married, and mother to a two-year-old daughter. I have worked for seven months as a sales assistant at Schmidt & Sohn Bakery, where I earn approximately 1 600 DM net each month.

I request a loan of 976 DM to purchase a 2007 Toyota Yaris. Early-morning shifts begin at 4 a.m., and dependable transport is necessary both for my commute and for delivering my child safely to daycare.

Presently my account is 25 DM overdrawn, and I have 90 DM in savings. Last year I repaid a 900 DM language-course loan from this bank precisely on schedule, demonstrating my commitment. I own a small mobile home free of liens and have no other debts or guarantors.

Repayment over twelve months at about 82 DM per instalment is easily manageable. I value the bank’s support and hope my proven repayment history and stable employment justify approval.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Katarina Ionescu
