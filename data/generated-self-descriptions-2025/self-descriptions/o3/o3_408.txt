To whom it may concern,  

My name is Michael Berger, age 43, single with two dependent children. For the past five years I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Chemistry, earning a net salary of €3 200 per month. I own a condominium in Mainz, where I have lived since 2019, and a twelve-year-old Volkswagen Golf that now requires replacement. I therefore request a loan of €2 197 to purchase a reliable 2016 Opel Astra for my daily 28 km commute and school runs.  

Although I hold two small instalment loans with your bank (for a heat-pump and a washing machine) and a revolving credit at a cooperative bank, every payment has been made on schedule over the past 24 months; copies of statements are attached. I have no guarantors and no additional instalment plans. While I currently operate only a savings-pot app instead of a formal current account, I am prepared to open a full checking account with you upon approval.  

My steady public-sector position, verified income, spotless internal payment record and home ownership demonstrate my reliability. I am confident I can comfortably meet the requested €92 monthly instalment (rate class 4).  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Michael Berger

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a €2 197 loan to purchase a 2015 Ford Focus estate. As a senior electrician with Siemens Energy in Nuremberg, I have been continuously employed for four years and eight months, earning €3 450 net each month. My current 2004 Peugeot has become unreliable, jeopardising punctual arrival at client sites.  

I am 43 years old, single, and support two nieces who live with me. I own my townhouse and have resided there since 2019. Your bank currently services two credits that I took for roof insulation and a boiler; both accounts are in perfect standing with 24 consecutive on-time payments. I also carry a small furniture loan with another institution, likewise fully up-to-date.  

While I do not yet hold a checking account with you, I am ready to transfer my salary deposits once the car loan is approved. My property, stable income, and proven repayment discipline underscore my creditworthiness. The proposed instalment of approximately €92 represents less than 3 % of my net income, leaving ample buffer for unforeseen expenses.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Sebastian Kühn

Respected Sir or Madam,  

I am Alex Thomalla, a police administrative officer with the State Police Directorate Leipzig. I have served in this role for five years and three months, with a secure monthly net income of €3 050. I request a €2 197 loan to acquire a used 2017 Škoda Fabia, necessary for my shift work and transporting my two dependants to their after-school care.  

My residence, a fully-paid single-family house owned since 2019, provides financial stability. Your institution currently manages two credits: one for solar panels and another for a home security system. Both have been serviced punctually for two years. Besides these, I have no other instalment arrangements.  

Although I maintain my everyday transactions through a police credit union, I intend to open a current account with your bank to streamline repayments. I have never missed a payment and have enclosed employer confirmation of my permanent civil-service status, underscoring reliable cash flow.  

The requested instalment fits comfortably within my budget, representing less than one-tenth of my monthly surplus. I am confident of meeting every obligation in full and on time.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Alex Thomalla

To the Credit Department,  

My name is David Nguyen, 43, single father of two. I have worked for the City of Stuttgart’s civil engineering office for six years, currently as a project planning official earning €3 600 net per month. I am seeking a €2 197 loan to purchase a dependable 2014 Toyota Avensis wagon to replace my aging company pool car, ensuring I can visit construction sites across the region.  

Home ownership since 2019 and a personal vehicle valued at €5 000 constitute my main assets. I have two existing instalment loans with your bank—kitchen renovation and study renovation—both serviced flawlessly for the past 24 months. A bicycle-shop loan with another bank is also in good standing. No other debts exist.  

While I do not yet have a checking account with you, I am willing to transfer my salary and consolidate all banking services upon approval. Regular civil-service income, pristine repayment history, and property equity make me a low-risk candidate. The planned €92 monthly repayment is well within my discretionary budget of €780.  

I appreciate your time and hope for a positive decision.  

Sincerely,  
David Nguyen

Dear Banking Team,  

I, Markus Feld, hereby request a €2 197 personal loan for the purchase of a certified-used 2016 Renault Clio. Reliable transportation is essential for my evening shift as an IT support specialist at the University Hospital Bonn, where I have been employed for four years and six months, earning €3 100 net monthly.  

I reside in and own a small detached house acquired in 2019. I have two children to support. Your bank currently handles two existing instalment agreements—one for garden landscaping and one for a water-softening system—both up-to-date with 24 punctual payments. My only external credit is a low-balance electronics instalment plan, also current.  

Though I presently bank day-to-day with an online-only provider, I will open a full current account with you upon loan approval. My stable healthcare-sector employment, impeccable payment record, home ownership and modest loan request collectively demonstrate my reliability. The anticipated €92 monthly instalment equates to under 3 % of my income, leaving a healthy safety margin.  

Thank you very much for your consideration. I look forward to building an even stronger relationship with your institution.  

Warm regards,  
Markus Feld
