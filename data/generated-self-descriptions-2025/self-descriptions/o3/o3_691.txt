Stuttgart, 18 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Alejandro García. I have worked for 2 years and 3 months as a certified tool-and-die technician at Daimler Truck AG in Stuttgart. To reach the factory’s early shift from my home outside the city I need reliable transport; my twelve-year-old Opel Astra can no longer be repaired economically. I therefore request a loan of 3 651 DM to purchase a new, modestly priced Volkswagen Polo.  

Although my current checking balance shows –237 DM after paying school fees for my two nieces, I maintain a building-society savings agreement with 5 400 DM and a life-insurance policy worth 40 000 DM. I have already repaid a 2019 furniture loan with your bank punctually over 18 months. My net monthly salary is 4 200 DM, so the proposed installment rate of 1 % (about 37 DM) is easily covered.  

I am a Spanish national with a permanent German work contract and have resided at my own condominium in Sindelfingen for three years. My solid employment record, existing collateral, and flawless repayment history attest to my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Alejandro García

Hamburg, 20 Sept 2025  

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I, Piotr Nowak, request a loan of 3 651 DM to finance a new Skoda Fabia Combi. As a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) for the past 3 years and 4 months, I travel daily to rotating inspection sites that are unreachable by public transport.  

My finances are stable: net income 3 850 DM, a building-society savings balance of 1 900 DM, and no outstanding debts except a single overdraft of –128 DM that will be cleared on payday. I previously borrowed 2 000 DM from your branch in 2021 for language courses and repaid it six months early.  

Owning my apartment in Wilhelmsburg, supporting two younger brothers studying in Poland, and holding life insurance of 60 000 DM demonstrate both responsibility and collateral. The planned installment of roughly 37 DM represents less than 1 % of my take-home pay. I am confident I meet all criteria for a trustworthy borrower.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Lending Officer,  

My name is Samuel Kofi Mensah, a research assistant in bio-informatics at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität since February 2024 (1 year 7 months). I apply for a 3 651 DM loan to replace my unreliable 2003 Ford Fiesta with a new electric Renault Twingo, critical for late-night access to university servers and for caring for my two young cousins who live with me.  

Current account: –94 DM, caused by recent textbook purchases. Savings: 3 200 DM in a Bausparvertrag plus a 50 000 DM life-insurance policy. My monthly net salary is 3 300 DM, and I have never missed a payment on the 2022 computer loan I have already settled with your bank. An agreed installment of 37 DM will fit easily within my budget.  

As a Ghanaian national on a Blue Card, I have permanent residence since 2022 and own a small apartment in Giesing. My timely credit history, stable public-sector employment, and existing collateral underscore my reliability. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Samuel Kofi Mensah

To the Credit Department,  

I am Luca Bianchi, 31, employed for 3 years at Stadtwerke Köln as a certified civil engineer supervising water-pipeline projects. I seek a loan of 3 651 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa. Frequent site visits across the Rhein-Erft district make dependable transport indispensable.  

Financial overview: checking account –211 DM (temporary after school supplies for my twin godsons), monthly net salary 4 600 DM, savings bond 2 750 DM, and life-insurance coverage of 55 000 DM. I own a condominium in Ehrenfeld, mortgage-free. In 2020 I took a 4 500 DM renovation loan from your bank and repaid it exactly on schedule.  

The requested installment of around 37 DM is less than 1 % of my income, leaving ample buffer. With secure municipal employment, real-estate ownership, and an unblemished repayment record, I trust you will view me as a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Luca Bianchi

Dresden, 25 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Andrei Popescu, have been an IT systems administrator at Deutsche Bahn Netz AG in Dresden for 1 year and 11 months. My shift schedule often begins before the first regional trains run, so I request a 3 651 DM loan to buy a reliable Hyundai i20.  

My checking account currently shows –179 DM due to recent dental expenses for my nephew. However, I hold 1 650 DM in a building-society savings plan and a life-insurance policy valued at 48 000 DM. My net monthly income is 3 900 DM. I successfully repaid a 2018 study loan with your bank without a single delay.  

I own a small townhouse in Neustadt, have lived there for three years, and carry no other debts. The proposed installment of about 37 DM represents only 0.9 % of my income, ensuring smooth repayment. My stable employment, collateral, and proven credit discipline make me a dependable candidate.  

I appreciate your favorable review of my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Andrei Popescu
