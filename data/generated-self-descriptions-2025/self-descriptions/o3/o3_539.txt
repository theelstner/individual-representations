Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Anna Keller, 37, married, and a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck‐Institute for Biochemistry in Martinsried, where I have held a permanent position for the past nine years. I am applying for a loan of DM 3 612 to equip the study and living room of the house my husband and I purchased four years ago. The money will cover workstations, shelving and seating that were not included in the construction budget.

My net salary averages DM 5 200 per month; my checking account currently shows DM 152 and my savings passbook DM 78. Although I maintain a DM 6 000 car loan with Sparkasse München, all instalments have been paid on time. I have a life-insurance policy with an assured sum of DM 60 000 that can be pledged as additional security.

With a secure, long-term employment contract, unbroken payment history and property ownership, I am confident I can meet the 18-month repayment plan at the proposed rate of 3 %. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely
Dr. Anna Keller

Dear Loans Department,

I am Marie Vogel, 37, divorced, employed as a telecommunications technician at Deutsche Telekom in Nuremberg for the past eight years. I wish to obtain a loan of DM 3 612 to replace worn furniture and buy computer equipment so that I can work some shifts from home and provide a proper bedroom for my seven-year-old son, Lukas.

My net income is DM 4 300 monthly. My current account holds DM 45, and my savings account DM 52, as I have focused on paying off an auto loan (DM 4 800) at a different bank—never once in arrears. I also hold a building-society savings agreement that will mature in 2027 and serves as additional collateral.

I have lived in my own condominium for four years, pay all utilities promptly and maintain only one small overdraft facility with your bank that is always cleared within the month. I am confident of meeting the 18-month, 3 % instalment schedule and respectfully request your approval.

Kind regards
Marie Vogel

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Stefanie Braun, 37, separated, and a senior customs officer with the Main Customs Office Stuttgart, a civil-service post I have held for eleven years. I request a DM 3 612 loan to modernise my kitchen and purchase a washer-dryer that became essential after water damage.

My monthly net income is DM 5 100 plus a thirteenth-month bonus. My checking account balance is presently DM 123; my savings book shows DM 88. I hold a DM 6 000 car loan with Volksbank, always serviced punctually. I own the apartment in which I have resided the past four years and have a fully financed life-insurance policy worth DM 50 000.

Given my tenure as a civil servant, spotless repayment history and property assets, I can comfortably meet the 18-month repayment at the 3 % rate. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Respectfully
Stefanie Braun

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Katrin Weiss, 37, married, and have been a production planner at Robert Bosch GmbH in Reutlingen for ten years. I seek a DM 3 612 loan to furnish my daughter Mia’s new bedroom and purchase professional tools needed for ongoing home renovations.

My net salary is DM 4 800 per month plus annual bonus. The balance on my current account stands at DM 78; my savings passbook at DM 64. Aside from a mortgage with Kreissparkasse Tübingen, which has never been late, I carry no other debts. A building-society savings contract worth DM 38 000 is in place as additional security.

We have lived in our own home for four years, maintain one small account with your bank and have never exceeded agreed limits. I am confident of satisfying the 18-month instalment plan at 3 % and would appreciate your support.

With thanks
Katrin Weiss

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Clara Schmidt, 37, divorced, and the chief laboratory technician at the City Hospital of Bremen, where I have been employed for twelve years. I am requesting a DM 3 612 loan to purchase ergonomic laboratory-grade desks and a high-specification computer needed for my newly approved freelance medical-translation work.

My net monthly income is DM 5 400. My checking account shows DM 96 and my savings account DM 63. I have an outstanding car loan of DM 4 500 with Bremer Kreditbank, always paid punctually. Additionally, I possess a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of DM 20 000, which I am willing to assign as collateral.

I have resided in my own townhouse for four years and currently hold only one small revolving credit line at your bank that is consistently serviced. My stable income, clean payment record and pledged insurance make me a reliable borrower capable of meeting the 18-month schedule at the 3 % rate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely
Clara Schmidt
