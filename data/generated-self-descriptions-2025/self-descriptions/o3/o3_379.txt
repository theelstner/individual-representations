Dear Loan Officer,

My name is John Forster, a 36-year-old scientific research assistant employed at Bremen Biotech Institute for the past 8 years. I am applying for a €846 consumer loan to buy a combined digital radio and 55-inch smart television that will allow my 11-year-old son and me to continue our language courses and remote-learning programs at home.

Although I do not maintain a checking account, my salary of €2 650 net is paid punctually to my prepaid payroll card every month. My housing is a company-subsidised studio, so I have no rent obligations. I have one small credit with your bank that I have serviced for seven months; the monthly instalment of €68 has always been transferred on time. A missed payment on a student loan five years ago was a one-off administrative error that was settled in full the following month, and my record has been clear since.

With stable long-term employment, no other debts, and a modest requested amount to be repaid in three instalments, I am confident of meeting every obligation.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
John Forster

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Miguel Alvarez, a 36-year-old senior customs officer at the Port of Hamburg, where I have worked for 9 years under a federal contract. I respectfully request a loan of €846 to purchase a professional news-grade radio receiver and a 40-inch television so I can follow international maritime security broadcasts while living in port accommodation.

My net income averages €3 100 per month, paid directly to a payroll card. Living quarters are provided free of charge, and I have no other instalment plans beyond the small education loan I currently repay to your bank (€55 monthly; seven payments completed). A delay on that loan last year occurred when my father fell ill in Spain; since then every instalment has arrived early.

Because I possess a secure civil-service position, overtime allowances, and no dependants other than my younger brother whom I support, I am confident I can repay the requested sum in three equal instalments without strain.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further documentation.

Kind regards,  
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Ahmed Khan, employed for the past 10 years as a certified tool-and-die technician at Rhein-Motoren GmbH. I request a €846 loan to purchase a smart television and DAB+ radio that will enable me to attend evening engineering courses broadcast by the Technical University of Munich.

I am 36, single, and support my widowed mother living abroad. My net salary is €2 850, transferred monthly to a prepaid Maestro card. I reside in a company dormitory free of rent and have no other debts besides a small furniture loan with your bank that is 7 months old and fully up-to-date. A late payment on a telecom contract four years ago has since been cleared and my Schufa report now shows 48 straight months of punctuality.

The requested amount is modest, the repayment term is short, and my long-standing employment provides secure income. I trust these factors demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Khan

To the Lending Department,

I, Alexei Petrov, have served as an air-traffic control technician at Leipzig Airport for 12 years. I am applying for an €846 loan to acquire a multilingual digital receiver and 50-inch television for professional training and my young nephew’s educational use.

My net earnings of €3 400 are disbursed to a salary card. Company housing means I pay no rent, and I own no other property. I have maintained a micro-loan with your bank for seven months, paying €60 each month without fail. A delayed settlement on a car-insurance premium in 2020 was corrected immediately and has not recurred.

With steady specialised employment, only one dependent, and no guarantors required, I can comfortably meet the three-month repayment schedule. I would value the opportunity to continue building a strong relationship with your institution.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Sincerely,  
Alexei Petrov

Dear Ms. Schneider,

My name is Peter Liu, a senior IT support engineer at Hanover Medical Center, where I have been employed for 8 years. I seek a €846 loan to purchase a hospital-grade monitor/television and portable digital radio that will let me test patient-education media from home before deployment on wards.

I earn €2 950 net monthly, received onto a reloadable Visa payroll card. The hospital provides staff accommodation at no cost; therefore my living expenses are minimal. I hold one active credit with your bank (furniture), on which I have made seven punctual instalments of €64. A single late credit-card payment three years ago—due to lost mail while I was visiting my daughter in Taiwan—was rectified immediately and never repeated.

Given my stable income, free housing, and responsible repayment history, I am confident I can satisfy the proposed three-installment plan without difficulty.

I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Warm regards,  
Peter Liu
