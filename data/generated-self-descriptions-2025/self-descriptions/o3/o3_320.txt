Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Jorge Ramírez, a 32-year-old Spanish citizen who has lived in Hamburg for two years. For the last three years I have worked as a certified pharmaceutical lab technician at Novamed GmbH, earning a net income of 2,350 € per month. I request a 701 € loan over 12 months to pay the tuition for an advanced German‐language course that will allow me to obtain the state license required for promotion to senior technician.

Although I do not hold a checking account, I have two small installment loans with your bank that I service punctually (combined 94 € per month). Apart from those, I have one retail credit at CrediPlus that is also current. My only asset is a 2018 VW Golf, and I keep 60 € in a savings booklet. My housing costs are low because I own a micro-apartment bought with my parents’ help.

I support my six-year-old daughter in Spain, yet my debt-to-income ratio remains comfortably below 30 %. My steady employment, spotless repayment record with you, and modest loan request make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jorge Ramírez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Tomasz Kowalski, a Polish mechanical drafter employed since January 2022 by Siemens Mobility in Berlin (net salary 2,470 €). I seek a 701 € educational loan for a one-year evening course in 3-D additive-manufacturing software, which my department requires for promotion to lead drafter.

I have no checking account but own a 27 m² condo (no mortgage) and a 2017 Škoda Fabia. I currently repay two micro-loans with your bank (total monthly rate 88 €) and a furniture loan at my previous bank; all payments have been on time. Savings stand at 40 €.

With fixed monthly expenses of 1,180 €, I can comfortably add the proposed 60 € installment. My stable job, existing positive history with you, and modest credit amount ensure minimal risk.

I appreciate your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Tomasz Kowalski

To the Lending Department,

My name is Ahmed Farouk, Egyptian national, age 32, living in Munich since 2021. I have worked for 3 ½ years as an aircraft maintenance inspector at Lufthansa Technik, earning 2,600 € net monthly. I request a 701 € loan for a twelve-month certification program in composite-material repair, essential for my next salary grade.

I maintain two ongoing credits with your bank (current balance 1,480 €) that I service at 92 € per month. I also hold a small electronics loan with Saturn Card Services; all payments are punctual. I do not hold a checking account but deposit my salary onto a prepaid payroll card. My assets include a 2019 Renault Clio and a studio flat I bought outright; savings: 55 €.

My monthly surplus after all obligations is roughly 970 €, and I have never missed or delayed a payment. The requested sum is minor, the term short, and the purpose career-advancing, making me a trustworthy candidate.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Farouk

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Daniel Oliveira, Brazilian citizen, single, age 32, residing in Cologne for two years. Since April 2021 I have served as a customs clerical officer (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) at Köln/Bonn Airport, earning 2,390 € net. I am applying for a 701 € loan over twelve months to pay exam fees for the next civil-service qualification level.

My financial profile: no checking account, 63 € in a Sparbuch, owner of a 2018 Opel Corsa and a small terraced house inherited from my uncle (no mortgage). I have two active installment credits with your bank (combined 86 € monthly) and no other debts. Payment history is impeccable.

Supporting my ten-year-old nephew in Brazil costs 120 € monthly, yet my disposable income remains ample. A civil-service position provides lifetime employment, underscoring my reliability and ability to honor the proposed 60 € monthly installment.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Oliveira

I keep no checking account but hold two micro-credits with your bank totaling 1,300 €; repayment (90 € monthly) has never been late. Additional obligations consist of a 300 € store card at MediaMarkt, also paid on schedule. I own a 2017 BMW 1-Series and a 30 m² condominium; cash savings are 70 €.

I look forward to a positive reply.

Best regards,  
Viktor Petrov
