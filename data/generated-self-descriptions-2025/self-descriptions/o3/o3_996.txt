Frankfurt, 12 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Thomas Keller, 50, senior laboratory technician at ChemTech AG. I have worked there for 12 years and earn a fixed gross salary of 3,950 € per month. I request a loan of 2,390 € to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my 18-year-old vehicle, which has become unreliable for my daily 40-km commute.  

Financially, I have no open liabilities beyond a furniture loan I took with your bank in 2021; the balance was settled three months ahead of schedule. I own my condominium in Frankfurt-Riedberg outright, and my only dependent—my son Leon (16)—receives regular child support from me. I currently use a prepaid salary card rather than a checking account, but I am prepared to open a current account with your bank if the loan is approved.  

My net disposable income after fixed costs is 1,580 €, easily covering the proposed 4 % installment rate of about 100 € per month. My spotless payment record and long-term employment underline my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my positive relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Keller

Hamburg, 10 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am David Peters, a licensed customs officer at the Port of Hamburg, employed since 2016. I respectfully apply for a 2,390 € car loan to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo, required for my shift work that begins before public transport operates.  

I have one prior credit with your institution—a 2019 travel loan of 1,500 €—which I repaid on time last year. My monthly net salary is 3,200 €, and aside from regular household expenses for my owned apartment, I carry no other debt. My brother (age 14) lives with me as my dependent, and all household bills are up to date.  

Although I have managed without a checking account until now—my salary is loaded onto a civil-service payment card—I am willing to open a current account as part of this loan agreement. The installment of roughly 100 € fits comfortably within the 1,400 € that remains each month after fixed charges.  

My consistent public-sector employment and flawless credit record make me a trustworthy candidate. I appreciate your assessment of my request.  

Respectfully,  
David Peters

Leipzig, 11 Sept 2025  

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Markus Hahn, 50, IT systems analyst for Stadtwerke Leipzig. I have served in this position for 15 years, earning a steady 4,150 € gross each month. I am applying for a 2,390 € loan to finance a new electric Renault Twingo for both work travel and to transport my 12-year-old niece, whom I support.  

I previously held only one loan with your bank—a 2018 household-appliance credit—which I cleared without delay. I own my detached house in Schkeuditz, have no outstanding installment plans, and my monthly surplus after all obligations is about 1,600 €.  

I do not yet maintain a checking account; my salary is disbursed to an employee treasury card. I will, however, open a current account with you upon approval, allowing for automated repayment at the agreed 4 % rate.  

My stable career, property ownership, and clean repayment history underscore my reliability. Thank you for giving my application favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Markus Hahn

Cologne, 13 Sept 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Jens Richter, an aircraft maintenance inspector at Lufthansa Technik, a role I have held for eight years with a current net income of 3,450 € per month. I request a 2,390 € loan to buy a new Ford Fiesta. My present 2004 model failed inspection, and dependable transport is essential for my night shifts at Cologne/Bonn Airport.  

I have a flawless record on the single credit line previously issued by your bank for home renovations in 2020, paid off two months ago. I also own a 65 m² apartment in Porz. My dependent is my elderly mother, for whom I provide financial support. After living costs, I retain about 1,300 € monthly, more than sufficient to cover the expected 4 % installment.  

Although I have managed my finances via a payroll debit card instead of a traditional checking account, I will promptly open one with you to simplify repayment.  

Given my steady aviation career and spotless credit history, I am confident of meeting all obligations. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Jens Richter

Esteemed Members of the Loan Panel,  

My name is Olaf Schneider, age 50, administrative officer at the Saxony Public School Board, where I have worked for ten years. I seek a loan of 2,390 € to purchase a new Škoda Fabia, necessary for site inspections across the district after my previous car’s engine failure.  

Financial overview: I earn 3,000 € net monthly; housing costs are limited to utilities as I own my row house outright. I have one dependent—my daughter (17)—and no other active debts. In 2022 I completed repayment of a 2,000 € education loan from your bank without a single late installment.  

I currently operate without a formal checking account; my salary is loaded to a government payroll card. Should my application be approved, I will open a checking account at your branch to ensure smooth monthly repayments around 100 €.  

My long civil-service record, property ownership, and exemplary payment history attest to my trustworthiness. I appreciate your favorable review and stand ready to provide any additional information.  

With respect,  
Olaf Schneider
