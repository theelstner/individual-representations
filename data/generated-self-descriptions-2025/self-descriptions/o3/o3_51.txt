Frankfurt, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Elena García-Schmidt, a 28-year-old Spanish engineer employed for the past three years as a calibration technician at Siemens Energy in Offenbach. I respectfully request a 12-month loan of 2,073 DM to purchase a new Samsung smart television and DAB+ radio set for my home.

Financially, I earn a net salary of 3,100 DM per month. I hold a savings account with 320 DM and have fully repaid a 1,500 DM relocation loan taken last year, never missing an installment. I own a small condominium in Frankfurt-Rödelheim, acquired with family help; the title is registered solely in my name. My sister, Ana García, permanent resident and teacher in Mainz, will act as co-applicant and has already signed the guarantee forms.

With stable employment, a solid repayment record, and property collateral, I am confident I can meet the agreed 4 % installment rate comfortably from my monthly disposable income. This purchase will allow my son Mateo and me to integrate better through German-language media.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further documentation you may require.

Sincerely,  
Elena García-Schmidt

To the Credit Department,

I am Dr. Katarina Popovic, a 28-year-old Serbian national working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics since February 2022. I kindly seek a 2,073 DM consumer loan over 12 months to replace my malfunctioning radio and to install an educational television set that supports my research presentations at home.

My gross monthly income is 4,200 DM, of which 2,900 DM is net. I maintain a savings balance of 410 DM. I previously held a 2,000 DM study loan with your bank; it was settled in June 2025 with every payment on time. My divorced spouse, Dr. Leon Becker, a civil servant at the Technical University of Munich, will serve as guarantor.

I have lived in and own a small studio apartment in Garching for two years, free of any mortgage. With no other installment plans and only one dependent—my daughter Mila—I can comfortably honor the 4 % monthly installments via standing order from my salary account.

My proven payment discipline, secure research position, and property ownership make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,  
Dr. Katarina Popovic

Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

Esteemed Officers,

I am Mrs. Sofia Lungu, a Romanian citizen and mother of one, age 28. Since May 2021 I have worked as a certified automotive paint specialist at Porsche AG, earning 3,350 DM net each month. I apply for a 2,073 DM loan for the purchase of a quality Grundig TV-radio combo that will enable my family to stay informed and for my German-language evening courses broadcast on local TV.

I currently have 275 DM in a savings account and no open debts other than a 3,000 DM furniture loan that I finished paying in July 2024. I reside in and own a modest terraced house in Bad Cannstatt, where I have lived for two years. My cousin, Mr. Radu Petrescu, employed at Bosch, has agreed to co-sign the application.

My employment contract is permanent, and payroll deductions will cover the 4 % monthly rate without difficulty. My spotless credit record demonstrates that I honor my obligations fully and punctually.

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am ready to supply any additional information.

Respectfully,  
Mrs. Sofia Lungu

Hamburg, 16 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ms. Aisha Khan, 28, Pakistani national and divorced mother of a six-year-old boy. Since April 2022 I have served as a customs documentation officer with the Hamburg Port Authority, drawing 2,750 DM net per month. I request a 12-month loan of 2,073 DM to purchase a new LG OLED television and digital radio receiver; my old set failed recently.

I maintain a savings balance of 190 DM and own the two-room flat in Wilhelmsburg where I have lived for the past two years. Last year I concluded a 1,800 DM electronics loan with your bank, repaid ahead of schedule. My elder brother, Omar Khan, a German citizen and IT consultant, will act as co-applicant.

With stable public-sector employment, no outstanding debts, and property collateral, I can meet the 4 % installment through direct salary transfer. I have never missed a payment and intend to keep that record intact.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your favorable reply.

Kind regards,  
Aisha Khan

To the Loan Approval Team,

My name is Maria Teresa Alvarez, a 28-year-old Mexican architect employed since June 2021 with Hochtief Design in Cologne. I seek financing of 2,073 DM over 12 months to purchase a professional-grade smart TV and radio system needed for virtual design reviews and continuing-education broadcasts.

My net monthly income stands at 3,600 DM. I keep 350 DM in a savings account and have successfully closed a 2,200 DM personal loan with your bank, never incurring delays. I am married; my spouse, Carlos Alvarez, an electrical engineer at Bayer AG, will co-apply.

We own a small townhouse in Ehrenfeld, where we have lived for two years. We have one dependent, our infant daughter Lucia. We carry no other installment obligations, and the proposed 4 % repayment will be covered automatically from our joint salary account.

With a proven repayment history, dual professional incomes, and real-estate collateral, I am confident of meeting the loan terms in full and on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Teresa Alvarez
