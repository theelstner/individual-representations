Hamburg, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Daniel Krüger, 22, married and the father of a one-year-old son. Eight months ago I began working as a junior mechanical technician at Blohm+Voss, earning a net salary of 2,350 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 2,039 DM to purchase a combined radio-television set for our first home.  

Although my current checking-account balance is 142 DM and my building-society savings contract holds 74 DM, my financial record is sound. Last year I took a small 1,200 DM study loan from your bank and repaid every installment on time; it is now fully settled. I have no other debts or guarantors. Our family lives in a starter flat we own in Altona and my life-insurance policy is up to date.  

Blohm+Voss has confirmed my position is permanent after a successful probation period, so my income is secure. I propose an installment rate of 1% of my salary, exactly as with my previous credit. Your trust will help us furnish our home while I continue to build a stable credit history with your institution.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Krüger

Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Stefan Maier, a 22-year-old married municipal clerk with the City of Munich. Since January (nine months) I have been employed full-time, earning 2,560 DM net. I kindly request a 2,039 DM consumer loan to buy a quality television and radio system so my wife can continue her distance-learning courses from home.  

My current giro account shows 58 DM; my house-building savings plan contains 89 DM. I maintain a paid-up life-insurance policy valued at 20,000 DM. Your bank granted me a 1,500 DM computer loan two years ago, which I repaid ahead of schedule—records will confirm every installment was punctual. I hold no additional credit lines and have no guarantors.  

Because we purchased a small condominium last year, all household expenses are predictable and covered by my steady civil-service income. My probationary period ends next month and my supervisor has already issued a written intention of permanent appointment. With my solid repayment history, modest requested amount, and secured employment, I am confident I meet your credit-worthiness standards.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Stefan Maier

Esteemed Credit Department,  

My name is Lukas Schneider. I am 22, married, and work as an IT support specialist for Daimler Truck AG, a position I have held for seven months. My net monthly income is 2,420 DM. I seek a 2,039 DM loan to purchase a modern radio-TV set that will serve both family leisure and my remote-training sessions.  

Financially, I keep my obligations modest. My checking account currently stands at 187 DM, and my savings contract with Schwäbisch Hall has 66 DM. I carry no other loans except a 900 DM education credit from this bank, fully repaid one month ago, reflected as “paid as agreed.” Our family owns a small terraced house in Bad Cannstatt inherited from my late father; all municipal taxes are up to date.  

I am within my probation year at Daimler, and HR has already signaled confirmation of a permanent contract. Coupled with my life-insurance policy and spotless repayment record, I believe I present minimal risk. I propose the standard installment rate of 1, debited on my salary day to guarantee timeliness.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Lukas Schneider

Dear Loans Officer,  

I am Martin Hoffmann, aged 22, married, with a newborn daughter. Since December last year I have been employed as a laboratory assistant at Bayer AG earning 2,300 DM net. I am applying for 2,039 DM to finance a combined television and radio unit, replacing an outdated set that no longer works.  

My current giro balance is 103 DM and I have 52 DM in a building-society savings plan. Two years ago I took a 1,000 DM apprenticeship loan from your branch and settled it without a single delay. I have no other credit, no guarantors, and no overdrafts. We live in a small condominium the bank helped us purchase; property taxes and maintenance fees are current. A life-insurance policy for 25,000 DM further secures my family’s future.  

Bayer’s HR department has issued a letter confirming my contract will be made permanent at the end of my twelve-month probation. My steady salary, flawless repayment history, and modest loan request assure you of my reliability. I ask for the usual installment rate of 1 and will mandate direct debit.  

I appreciate your trust and await your favorable decision.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Hoffmann

Frankfurt am Main, 11 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Andreas Weiss, 22 years old, married, and father to a two-year-old boy. I joined Deutsche Telekom as a network service trainee eight months ago and earn 2,480 DM net each month. I request a loan of 2,039 DM to purchase a new radio-television unit suitable for my ongoing remote-certification program and our family’s entertainment.  

My current account balance is 95 DM; my postal savings account holds 81 DM. I hold a building-society contract and a life-insurance policy worth 30,000 DM. Three years ago I received a 1,250 DM student equipment loan from your bank which I repaid six months early, demonstrating my commitment to punctuality. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.  

We own a modest apartment in Sachsenhausen where we have lived for the past year. All utility and homeowners’ fees are paid on time via automatic transfer. Deutsche Telekom has already indicated they will confirm my permanent employment after my probation ends in November, ensuring stable, long-term income.  

With a proven repayment record and secure employment, I trust you will view my application favorably.  

Thank you for your attention.  

Best regards,  
Andreas Weiss
