Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Alvarez. I am 24 years old, divorced, and the mother of a three-year-old girl. Since April 2020 I have worked as a mechanical drafting technician at Siemens Turbomachinery GmbH in Erlangen (5 years 2 months, permanent contract, net salary 2 420 DM/month plus holiday bonus).

I request a 8 487 DM loan over 48 months to buy a new Opel Corsa. My ten-year-old Peugeot is no longer reliable, and I need dependable transport for late shifts and day-care runs.

My finances are orderly:  
• Current account balance varies between 80 DM and 160 DM after bills.  
• No savings account, but I own a 32 m² studio apartment (land-registry number 3-124-5).  
• No other installment plans.  
• Previous 3 000 DM consumer loan from your bank (2022–2023) was repaid three months early; every installment was booked on time.

The planned monthly rate of roughly 190 DM equals under 8 % of my net income, leaving ample margin for living costs. I enclose salary slips and the repayment statement of my prior loan.

Thank you for your continued trust.

Sincerely,  
Maria Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Anna Petrova, 24, married, with one infant son. For the past 4 years 8 months I have served as a junior customs officer at the Federal Customs Office in Hamburg (civil-service contract, net income 2 650 DM/month).

I seek a loan of 8 487 DM, repayable over 48 months, to purchase a new Škoda Fabia Combi required for round-the-clock duty rotations at the port. My 1996 Golf has become unreliable and costly to repair.

Financial position:  
• Current account with your bank: average balance 110 DM; never overdrawn.  
• No savings account.  
• Owner-occupied micro-condominium (27 m²) bought with family help; no mortgage.  
• One previous 5 000 DM education loan from you (2021–2022) repaid on schedule.  
• No other debts or guarantees.

A monthly installment of about 190 DM represents just 7 % of my steady salary. My civil-service status ensures secure employment and income. Enclosed are pay slips and the clearance letter for my former loan.

I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Kind regards,  
Anna Petrova  
Hamburg, 20 June 2025

To the Credit Department,

I, Katarina Novak, separated, age 24, have been employed since November 2020 (4 years 7 months) as a logistics specialist at Deutsche Post AG in Leipzig. My permanent contract yields a reliable net income of 2 200 DM per month plus shift allowances.

I am applying for an 8 487 DM, 48-month loan to buy a new Renault Clio. My current 200 000-km delivery van fails TÜV, and reliable transport is essential for both my early shifts and my two-year-old son’s crèche.

Current financial standing:  
• Checking balance ranges 90 DM–180 DM; never overdrawn.  
• No savings account.  
• I live in and own a small terraced house (inherited, free of mortgage).  
• One prior 2 500 DM furniture loan (2022) with your bank was repaid flawlessly.  
• No other installment obligations or guarantees.

The projected 190 DM monthly rate is well below 9 % of my net income and fully affordable. Enclosed are employment confirmation and the paid-up loan statement.

Thank you for your time and confidence.

Respectfully,  
Katarina Novak  
Leipzig, 22 June 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Lien Tran, 24, married, mother of a one-year-old boy. I have worked as an IT support technician at Hansa Software GmbH in Bremen for 6 years 3 months. My net salary averages 2 530 DM/month, supplemented by on-call bonuses.

I request an 8 487 DM loan over 48 months to replace my aging Citroën C2 with a new electric Fiat 500e. Reliable, low-emission transport is crucial for night-shift call-outs and family errands.

Key financial facts:  
• Checking account with you: current balance 140 DM; never in overdraft.  
• No savings account.  
• Owner of a 29 m² condominium bought cash with family support.  
• Previous 4 000 DM computer-equipment loan (2021) fully repaid; impeccable record.  
• No other debts or guarantees.

The expected monthly installment of approximately 190 DM equals 7.5 % of my net pay, comfortably within my budget. My stable employment and spotless repayment history underscore my reliability.

I look forward to continuing our successful partnership.

Sincerely,  
Lien Tran  
Bremen, 23 June 2025

Respected Credit Committee,

I am Svetlana Smirnova, 24 years old, divorced, with one dependent daughter. Since March 2020 (5 years 3 months) I have been a laboratory technician at BASF SE in Ludwigshafen, earning a secure net salary of 2 480 DM per month plus annual bonus.

I hereby apply for an 8 487 DM, 48-month installment loan to acquire a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid. My 1997 Polo recently failed emission standards, and reliable transportation is necessary for my shift work and my child’s kindergarten.

Financial overview:  
• Current account average balance: 120 DM; never negative.  
• No formal savings account.  
• I own a small 30 m² apartment (company housing purchase scheme, no lien).  
• Previous credit: 3 200 DM relocation loan (2022) from your bank, settled punctually.  
• No other liabilities or guarantor obligations.

At a projected rate near 190 DM, the loan consumes less than 8 % of my monthly income, leaving ample cushion. My continuous employment at BASF and flawless repayment history attest to my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your kind consideration.

Faithfully,  
Svetlana Smirnova
