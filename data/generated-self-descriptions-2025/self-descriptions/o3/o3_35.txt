Frankfurt, 27 June 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Emmanuel Kagiso, a 57-year-old Kenyan citizen who has lived and worked in Germany for the past nine years. Since 2016 I have been employed full-time as a forklift operator at Bremen Logistics GmbH, earning a stable net income of €2,150 per month. I am asking for a €1,264 loan in order to purchase a used coffee cart and the licences needed to start a lunchtime espresso stand outside the warehouse district. The cart will supplement my salary and will create a job for my adult son, who will run operations while I am at work.

Although I currently repay a small €2,500 personal loan at Sparkasse (always on time), I have no other debts or guarantors. My rent is €550 and has never been in arrears during my four-year tenancy. I may not have a checking or savings account with your bank yet, but my steady employment record, clean payment history and modest borrowing request make me a dependable customer. I am confident that the cart will generate at least €250 profit monthly, comfortably covering the €32 instalment I propose.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to building a lasting relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Emmanuel Kagiso

Hamburg, 27 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Marek Nowak, age 57, a Polish national residing in Hamburg since 2021. For the last eight years I have been a maintenance assistant at St. Georg Hospital, earning €2,080 net each month. I seek a €1,264 business loan to buy professional tools and insurance needed to launch an after-hours window-cleaning service aimed at small clinics and offices.

I presently have one credit contract—an €800 bicycle loan with Volksbank—which will be fully paid in November. All payments have been punctual. I rent a flat for €540 and have lived there for four years without incident. Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your institution, I would be pleased to open one in parallel with this loan.

My long, uninterrupted employment and spotless repayment record demonstrate my reliability. The new service is expected to bring an additional €300–€350 per month, ensuring smooth repayment at the proposed instalment rate of 4 %.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Marek Nowak

Munich, 27 June 2025  

To the Lending Department,

My name is Ahmet Demir, a 57-year-old Turkish citizen who has lived in Munich for four years. I have been working night shifts as a security guard at SüdTech AG for the past twelve years, with a current net salary of €2,200. I request a loan of €1,264 to acquire display cases and initial stock for a small weekend mobile-phone-repair stall at the Viktualienmarkt.

I have an existing €3,000 auto loan at Targobank that is down to the last €600; all instalments have been paid on schedule. I maintain no overdrafts, and my monthly rent of €560 is paid by direct debit without fail. Although I lack a current account with you, I am eager to move my salary payments to your bank should my request be approved.

My consistent employment, verifiable income and history of never missing a payment make me a low-risk borrower. The stall is projected to generate €280 extra income per month, more than sufficient to meet a €32 monthly repayment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Ahmet Demir

Cologne, 27 June 2025  

Dear Lending Committee,

I am Milan Jović, 57, a Serbian national living in Cologne since 2021. For seven years I have been a delivery driver with RheinCargo Logistics, earning €2,000 net monthly. I am applying for a €1,264 loan to purchase a used refrigerated scooter and insulated boxes so I can start an evening delicatessen-delivery service to office workers in the city centre.

My only current credit is a €1,200 dental loan with Postbank, always serviced on time. I have no guarantors, no overdraft, and my rent of €520 has been paid punctually throughout my four-year lease. While I do not yet have a checking or savings account at your bank, I am willing to transfer my salary deposits if approved.

With a proven employment record, clean credit file and a realistic business plan expecting €300 extra net income per month, I am confident I will be a reliable borrower. The requested amount fits well within my repayment capacity.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Sincerely,  
Milan Jović

Stuttgart, 27 June 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Rachid El-Fassi, a 57-year-old Moroccan citizen, residing in Stuttgart for four years and employed since 2010 as a warehouse packer at the IKEA distribution centre, earning €2,050 net monthly. I seek a €1,264 loan to buy a laser engraver and packaging materials to start a home-based personalised-gifts micro-business that I will run with my daughter.

Aside from an €850 electronics loan at Commerzbank (current balance €200), I carry no other debts and have never missed an instalment. My rent of €530 is up to date, and I have maintained the same address for four years. Although I lack a current account with your bank, I intend to open both a checking and savings account as part of this application.

My fifteen-year steady employment, record of timely payments, and a conservative borrowing request demonstrate strong creditworthiness. The projected €260 monthly profit from the side business will cover the €32 instalment comfortably.

I appreciate your consideration and hope to begin a lasting partnership with your institution.

Yours faithfully,  
Rachid El-Fassi
