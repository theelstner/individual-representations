To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Josef Nowak, 41, married, with one son. For the past nine years I have worked as a warehouse operator at Schaffer & Sohn Baustoffe GmbH in Bremen. My permanent contract and regular overtime give me a net monthly income of 2 150 DM.  

I am applying for a 1 469 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa. The car will replace my 21-year-old Golf that no longer passes inspection and will ensure I can continue the early-morning shifts that public transport does not cover.  

I own a small inherited plot with a weekend cottage in Masuria, Poland, valued at roughly 40 000 DM. Although my family rents an apartment in Bremen, this real-estate asset stands fully mortgage-free. I keep 310 DM in a savings account and maintain no other installment plans. My previous furniture loan with your bank was paid in full last October, and all installments were made before their due date.  

With stable earnings, property as collateral, and a flawless repayment record, I am confident of meeting a 4 % installment rate comfortably. Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Josef Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Miguel Fernandez, am a 41-year-old Spanish technician employed as the senior janitor at the Hannover Municipal School District since 2012. My consistent salary of 2 000 DM net and annual bonus provide steady family income for my wife and our ten-year-old daughter.  

A reliable vehicle is essential because I service five school buildings each day. I therefore request a 1 469 DM loan for 24 months to finance a new Volkswagen Up!. My 1998 Ford Fiesta broke down permanently in February.  

I currently rent a flat in Hannover, yet I own a debt-free apartment in Seville valued at approximately 55 000 DM. I hold 140 DM in a Sparkasse savings pass. My previous 3-year consumer loan with your bank was settled last June without any arrears. I have never missed a payment on any obligation.  

With more than twelve years of uninterrupted employment, real-estate ownership, and an unblemished repayment history, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Fernandez

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Henryk Zieliński, aged 41, widower, with one dependent daughter. I have served as a porter at St. Marien Hospital in Lübeck for eight years, earning a stable 1 950 DM net monthly salary plus shift allowances.  

I request a 1 469 DM loan for 24 months to buy a new Toyota Aygo. Reliable transportation will allow me to continue covering night shifts and to take my daughter to school.  

Although I rent our flat, I own a cultivated half-hectare plot near Gdańsk valued at 38 000 DM. My savings pass currently holds 227 DM. I have no other debts, and the 1 500 DM medical-equipment loan I took from your branch in 2021 was repaid three months ahead of schedule.  

Given my long-term employment, property asset, and proven discipline in meeting financial commitments, I am confident of honoring an installment rate of 4 %. Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Henryk Zieliński

To the Credit Department,  

I am Marco Rossi, 41 years old, married, with one son. Since 2009 I have been a kitchen assistant at Hotel Albrechtshof, Berlin, with a current net salary of 2 100 DM. My employer has just promoted me to shift supervisor, ensuring continued stability.  

I seek a 1 469 DM loan payable over 24 months to purchase a new Fiat Panda. The position involves late-night closing duties, and public transport after midnight is unreliable.  

Although my family rents an apartment in Berlin, I own a condominium in Bari, Italy, presently valued around 50 000 DM and free of liens. I maintain 480 DM in a savings account. The single loan I previously held with your bank—for household appliances—was repaid punctually last December. I hold no other credit lines.  

With fifteen years of continuous employment, tangible real-estate equity, and an impeccable repayment record, I trust you will find my application sound.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

Dear Loan Manager,  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, 41, married, father of one. I have worked as an assembly-line operator at Continental AG in Regensburg for ten years, currently earning 1 980 DM net per month plus regular overtime.  

I am requesting a 1 469 DM, 24-month loan to finance a new Skoda Fabia. My previous car failed its TÜV inspection, and dependable transport is critical for my 28-kilometre commute on the night shift.  

While I rent locally, I own a small farmhouse near Alexandria, Egypt, worth about 42 000 DM, free of encumbrance. I keep 165 DM in a savings pass. I have never defaulted on a payment; the home-improvement loan I took from your bank in 2020 was cleared on schedule. I hold no other installment plans or outstanding debts.  

With a decade of uninterrupted employment, property assets, and an unblemished credit history, I am confident of meeting the 4 % installment without difficulty. I appreciate your favorable review of my application.  

Best regards,  
Ahmed Hassan
