Stuttgart, 21 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Luis Fernández, Spanish citizen, 38 years old, single, and I have lived in Stuttgart for the past four years. For the last nine years I have worked as a CNC process technician at Daimler AG, earning a stable net salary of approximately 3,200 DM per month.  

I am requesting a six-month loan of 368 DM to purchase a new color television. My current account balance with your bank is 145 DM, and the only other loan I ever held with you (425 DM for a refrigerator) was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, and my monthly fixed costs—including the mortgage-free condominium I own—do not exceed 45 % of my income.  

As further security, I hold a 25,000 DM life-insurance policy with Allianz, and my employer can verify eleven straight years of uninterrupted service and income. The proposed installment rate of 4 fits comfortably within my budget, and I am confident I will complete repayment in less than six months if overtime remains available.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Luis Fernández

Berlin, 19 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I, Petar Ivanov, 38, single father of a ten-year-old boy, respectfully apply for a 368 DM loan over six months to replace my failing radio and buy a small television set.  

For the past eight years I have been employed as an electrical foreman at Siemens Energy in Berlin-Spandau, where I earn a net 3,450 DM monthly. My checking account with you currently shows 92 DM, and I maintain punctual electronic salary transfers into it. A prior 600 DM education loan with your bank was cleared in May 2024 without a single late installment. I have no other credit obligations.  

I own a cooperative apartment in Prenzlauer Berg and contribute 180 DM each month into a building-society savings contract valued at 17,600 DM. Although I do not possess a telephone, both my employer’s HR office and my life-insurance agent, Ms. Katrin Schulz, can readily confirm my reliability.  

I am confident that the requested credit will be repaid smoothly within the agreed six-month period.  

Kind regards,  
Petar Ivanov

Hamburg, 20 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marco Rossi, Italian national, 38 years old, employed since 2015 as an administrative clerk (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) at the Italian Consulate in Hamburg. My net salary is 3,800 DM per month, transferred directly to my account with your bank (current balance: 173 DM).  

I seek a short-term loan of 368 DM over six months to purchase a radio-television combination unit. The device will help my eleven-year-old daughter improve her German while she stays with me.  

I have maintained a flawless repayment record on my prior 900 DM renovation loan, settled last January. Beyond the modest condominium I occupy, I also hold a 30,000 DM endowment life-insurance policy with Generali, listed as collateral. My monthly obligations, including child support sent to Italy, amount to 1,400 DM—well below a prudent debt-to-income ratio.  

Your favorable decision will enable a timely purchase ahead of the school year. I appreciate your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Marco Rossi

Munich, 18 September 2025  

Esteemed Banking Team,  

I am Ahmed Khan, Turkish citizen, 38, single, residing in my own apartment in Munich-Riem since 2021. For twelve years I have worked as a certified aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik, earning a stable 3,950 DM net per month.  

I request a six-month loan of 368 DM to purchase a new television, replacing an outdated set that no longer supports digital reception. My checking balance stands at 66 DM; however, my salary is deposited punctually on the first business day of each month. I previously financed a 1,200 DM washing machine with your bank and repaid it in full without delay. I have no additional loans or guarantors.  

As collateral and proof of long-term planning, I maintain a 40,000 DM building-society savings agreement with LBS and a life-insurance policy valued at 18,000 DM. My employer can confirm my continuous service record and union-negotiated job security.  

Given my stable income and perfect credit history, I am confident of repaying the requested sum well within the six-month term.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

With cordial greetings,  
Ahmed Khan  



Letter 5  
Frankfurt a.M., 22 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Jan Novak, Czech national, 38 years old, employed as a civil engineering technician at the City of Frankfurt’s Public Works Department since August 2018. My net monthly earnings average 3,600 DM and are paid into my checking account with your branch (present balance: 127 DM).  

I apply for a loan of 368 DM, to be repaid over six months, in order to purchase a compact radio/television set for my home. My current television has failed, and quality news access is essential during my evening study of German.  

My only previous credit with your institution—a 700 DM home-office equipment loan—was repaid precisely on schedule last year. I carry no other debts, and my living costs are modest due to the condominium I own outright. In addition, I contribute 200 DM monthly to a Zurich Life policy (insured sum 22,000 DM), underscoring my commitment to financial responsibility.  

I trust you will find my application in good order and grant this small credit facility.  

Sincerely,  
Jan Novak
