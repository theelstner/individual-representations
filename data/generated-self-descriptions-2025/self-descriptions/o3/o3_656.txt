My name is Daniel Klein and I have been employed for five years as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Cologne. I am applying for a loan of 2,346 EUR over 24 months to purchase a 2013 Opel Corsa that I need for my daily 43-kilometre commute and for transporting my eight-year-old son to school.  
Financially, I earn a net salary of 2,350 EUR per month. My only current obligations are two small loans I already hold with your bank (a furniture loan and a continuing-education loan); both have been serviced punctually for the last eighteen months. I also have a 1,200 EUR balance on a credit-union card, which I am repaying on schedule. My savings are modest—82 EUR in a call-money account—but my mortgage-free condominium, inherited from my parents, secures my housing costs.  
I understand the importance of creditworthiness and have never missed a payment. The requested installment would not exceed four percent of my net income, leaving ample room in my monthly budget. I am confident that my stable employment, clean repayment record and owned residence make me a reliable applicant.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Klein

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Marco Schultz, a certified electrician employed with Stadtwerke Düsseldorf for six years. I seek a 2,346 EUR loan over two years to replace my aging 1999 Volkswagen Polo with a 2014 Ford Fiesta. Reliable transport is essential because I am on 24-hour standby duty for the utility company.  
My net income averages 2,550 EUR monthly. I currently service two installment contracts with your bank—a laptop loan and a bicycle loan—both of which have perfect repayment records. In addition, I hold a 700 EUR balance on a department-store charge card maintained outside your institution. Aside from these, I carry no debt. My ownership of a small townhouse in Ratingen keeps my living costs predictable; property taxes and maintenance are fully up to date.  
With an agreed rate of approximately 100 EUR per month, the new loan would represent just four percent of my income. My employer has confirmed my contract through 2028, and my professional license ensures stable career prospects. I am therefore confident of meeting every obligation on time.  
I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.  
Kind regards,  
Marco Schultz

To whom it may concern,  
My name is Alexander Berger, junior customs officer at Düsseldorf Airport since 2019. I request a loan of 2,346 EUR, repayable in 24 months, to purchase a used 2015 Skoda Fabia. The vehicle will replace my current car, which has become unreliable during early-morning shifts.  
I earn a guaranteed civil-service net salary of 2,420 EUR plus occasional overtime. My financial commitments include two existing loans with your bank that will be fully repaid within the next ten months; both are up to date. I also have a 1,000 EUR personal loan with my credit union that is being paid without delay. Savings stand at 90 EUR.  
Owning a fully paid-off apartment keeps my housing stable. After adding the new installment of roughly 100 EUR, my debt-service ratio remains under 15 percent of net income. My civil-service status offers long-term employment security, and my payment history demonstrates reliability despite the “critical account” tag attached after a single late fee five years ago, which has since been resolved.  
Thank you for reviewing my application. I am confident you will find me a dependable borrower.  
Respectfully,  
Alexander Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Patrick Nguyen, employed as an IT support specialist at Rhein-West AG for four and a half years. I am seeking a 2,346 EUR car loan payable over 24 months to acquire a 2012 Toyota Yaris. Dependable transportation is essential for on-site service visits and for caring for my seven-year-old daughter who lives with me two days each week.  
My monthly net salary is 2,300 EUR. My current debts comprise two on-time loans with your bank (home appliances and professional certification) and a 600 EUR balance on an external credit card. I have 75 EUR in a savings passbook. I own a small, fully paid carport apartment in Neuss, which limits my fixed expenses.  
The proposed installment of about 100 EUR equals four percent of my income. Combined with my track record of punctual repayment and the stability of my permanent employment contract, I believe I present a low credit risk. I have enclosed salary slips and a letter of confirmation from my employer.  
Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our successful banking relationship.  
Sincerely,  
Patrick Nguyen

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Thomas Eckert. For five years I have served as a senior clerk with Deutsche Post in Krefeld. I am applying for a 2,346 EUR loan over 24 months to finance a 2011 Honda Civic, necessary for early delivery routes and for taking my son to weekend activities.  
I receive a steady net income of 2,280 EUR per month. I hold two small loans with your bank—an office-furniture loan and a holiday loan—both current and due to be cleared within the year. Outside your bank I have a 900 EUR revolving credit line, also in good standing. My savings total 88 EUR.  
I live in a mortgage-free row house inherited from my uncle; the only related costs are utilities and insurance. The new loan’s monthly payment of roughly 100 EUR falls well within my budget, amounting to less than five percent of net income. Over the past eight years I have never missed or delayed a payment, a record I intend to uphold.  
I appreciate your time and trust that my stable employment, owned residence and spotless repayment history demonstrate my reliability.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Eckert
