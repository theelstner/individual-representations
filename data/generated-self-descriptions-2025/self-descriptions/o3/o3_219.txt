Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Daniel Krüger, 23 years old, single, and employed as a junior mechanical technician at Siemens Turbomaschinen GmbH since April 2023. My net monthly income of 3 100 DM has been routed to my checking account with your bank for the past 17 months, where the balance never falls below 250 DM.  

I am applying for a 3 913 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a combined 55-inch OLED television and DAB+ radio system for my recently renovated condominium in Trudering. The property, inherited from my late grandfather last year, is registered in my name and mortgage-free.  

I have one existing study loan with your bank (current balance 1 200 DM) that I have serviced punctually for 22 months. I have no other debts, and my only dependent is my younger brother, whom I support with a monthly 150 DM allowance.  

Though my savings are modest (71 DM in my passbook), my stable salary, low fixed expenses, and excellent repayment record demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for a favorable decision and am available at any time on my registered telephone line for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Krüger

Esteemed Officers,  

I am Miguel Santos, a 23-year-old single Spanish national, employed as a police cadet (Beamter auf Widerruf) with the Baden-Württemberg Police since June 2022. My monthly net earnings of 2 850 DM have been credited without interruption to my checking account here for 15 months; the balance currently stands at 310 DM.  

The requested loan of 3 913 DM, to be repaid over 36 months, will finance a professional radio scanner and 4K television set that I need both for duty-related training and for my recently purchased studio apartment in Bad Cannstatt. The apartment is fully paid and registered under my name.  

I have already completed payment of a 900 DM consumer loan with your bank and presently maintain one active credit (balance 800 DM, never in arrears). I have no guarantors or additional installment plans. My only dependent is my mother in Valencia, to whom I remit 120 DM monthly.  

My punctual repayment history, secure government employment, and ownership of real estate attest to my creditworthiness. I look forward to your positive response and can be reached at the telephone number on file.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Luka Petrovic, 23, single, employed as a laboratory electronics technician at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysics since February 2023. My net salary of 3 000 DM is deposited directly to my account with your bank, which I have held for three years and which currently shows 275 DM.  

I seek a 3 913 DM, 36-month loan to purchase a high-fidelity radio-television setup for my home in Rödelheim. The two-room house was transferred to me upon my father’s relocation abroad and is free of liens.  

I successfully settled a 1 500 DM relocation loan last year and still service a 950 DM credit from your institution—always on schedule. I have no other financial obligations. My dependent is my eight-year-old niece, whom I support with school expenses of 100 DM monthly.  

Although my savings total only 64 DM, my steady income, ownership of real estate, and spotless repayment record qualify me as a dependable borrower. I appreciate your consideration and remain reachable by phone at any time.  

Kind regards,  
Luka Petrovic

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, 23, German-Egyptian, single. Since January 2022 I have worked as an IT support specialist at Allianz Technology SE, earning a net 3 200 DM monthly, credited directly to my checking account with your bank. The account balance averages 260 DM.  

I am requesting 3 913 DM over 36 months to acquire a smart television with integrated Internet radio for my owner-occupied flat in Bilk. This equipment will also serve for my part-time online certification courses. The flat was purchased outright from family savings and is registered in my name.  

I currently have one active education loan (balance 1 100 DM) with you, serviced flawlessly for 19 months. I hold no additional debts or credit cards. My only dependent is my younger sister, to whom I transfer 130 DM monthly for university fees.  

Though my passbook shows only 83 DM, my permanent employment, property ownership, and consistent payment history underscore my reliability. Thank you for considering my application; I am available on my registered telephone line for any queries.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

With best regards,  
Tomasz Novak
