Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Karl-Heinz Bauer, 70, a former import-export entrepreneur who ran “Bauer Handels GmbH” for 38 years. I sold the business in 2019 and have since been unemployed/retired, living free of charge in an apartment attached to my daughter’s home. I keep a small current balance of about 150 DM and 50 DM in a postal savings book, but I have never missed a payment: the 12 000 DM start-up loan I took in 2015 was repaid six months early, and the 1 800 DM revolving credit I still hold with your bank has never fallen overdue.

I now consult part-time for two Stuttgart logistics firms and need a reliable new car to reach clients. The requested 7 308 DM over ten months fits my pension and consultancy income; with my projected monthly net of 3 200 DM I can comfortably cover the planned instalment of 760 DM while still helping my grandson, my only dependent, with his studies.

My spotless record, decades of business experience, fixed telephone line, and four years at my present address all speak for my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive decision.

Respectfully,

Karl-Heinz Bauer

To the Credit Department,

I am Dieter Schulz, 70 years old, formerly a senior officer at the Federal Customs Service (BesGr A15). Since compulsory retirement in 2020 I have been collecting a lifetime civil-service pension of 4 050 DM net per month. Apart from a small current balance of roughly 120 DM and 60 DM in bonds, I hold no liquid assets; however, every loan I have ever taken—including the 10 000 DM renovation credit with your bank in 2013—was repaid on schedule.

I request a 7 308 DM loan over ten months to purchase a new Opel Corsa. My existing car, a 2007 model, has become unreliable, yet I still drive weekly to care for my widowed sister, my single dependent, who lives 70 km away. With free housing in an official retirement flat and no other obligations, the planned monthly instalment of about 750 DM represents less than 20 % of my income.

My pension is guaranteed by the federal treasury, my telephone is registered under my name, and I have resided at this address for four years. These factors, together with an unblemished payment history, underline my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Dieter Schulz

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dr. Ing. Emilio Ferreira, 70, a Portuguese-born mechanical engineer who led R&D at Siemens Mobility until my contract ended in 2018. I now take occasional paid speaking engagements (approx. 1 200 DM per month) on top of a German state pension of 2 900 DM. Although officially unemployed, my overall monthly net of 4 100 DM is stable. My checking account normally stays around 180 DM because I transfer surplus funds to assist my disabled son, my sole dependent.

I seek a 7 308 DM ten-month loan to acquire an electric Smart Fortwo. Reliable transport will let me continue lecturing at TU-München and visiting my son’s clinic. My only current liability is a 2 000 DM education loan, serviced punctually at your bank for the past 24 months. All previous credits—most recently a 6 500 DM mortgage bridge—were settled without incident.

Resident at the same address for four years, no property, no guarantors, but a fixed telephone and longstanding customer relationship, I believe I meet every criterion for trust. I am committed to honouring each instalment and welcome any additional documentation you might require.

Kind regards,

Dr. Emilio Ferreira

Stuttgart, 19 Sept 2025

Honoured Credit Team,

My name is Captain (ret.) Wilhelm Krause, age 70. After 32 years in the German Navy I retired in 2015 and now serve voluntarily as logistics coordinator for the Red Cross. A new vehicle is essential: the organisation can no longer provide cars for individual coordinators. I therefore apply for a loan of 7 308 DM repayable over ten months.

My monthly income consists of a defence pension of 3 600 DM and a small honorarium of about 500 DM, against which I have only one active bank instalment plan of 800 DM that will be fully paid in January. My current account average is 90–100 DM; savings amount to roughly 70 DM. Nevertheless, I have never defaulted: a 15 000 DM mortgage, two personal loans and my present instalment plan were all serviced flawlessly.

I live free of charge in the annexe of my brother’s house, have had the same landline for 20 years and have maintained residence here for four. With no guarantor but a spotless credit history and dependable pension, I am confident of meeting the proposed monthly payment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,

Captain (ret.) Wilhelm Krause

Düsseldorf, 18 Sept 2025

Dear Lending Manager,

I am Johann Mayer, 70, formerly general manager of the Rheinblick Hotel, where I worked for 25 years until the property closed during the pandemic. Since then I have been unemployed but receive a company pension of 2 800 DM and earn about 1 000 DM monthly supervising apprentices for the Chamber of Commerce. I live rent-free in a studio owned by my cousin, and my only dependent is my granddaughter, whom I support with 300 DM each month.

To continue mentoring apprentices across North Rhine-Westphalia I need a reliable vehicle; my current 2005 VW Polo is beyond repair. I therefore request a 7 308 DM loan over a ten-month period. The projected instalment of roughly 750 DM will still leave me with over 2 700 DM for living costs and family support.

I have one small active credit with your bank (1 500 DM, repaid on schedule) and have always settled earlier debts, including a 20 000 DM renovation loan, without delay. My checking account balance averages 130 DM, and I hold 40 DM in a savings passbook.

Four years at my present address, a fixed landline, and decades of managerial responsibility attest to my stability and integrity. I appreciate your favourable review.

Yours faithfully,

Johann Mayer
