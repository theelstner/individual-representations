Stuttgart, 14 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 3 051 DM to purchase a new refrigerator, washing machine and stove for my condominium. I have been employed for 1 year and 9 months as a mechanical maintenance technician at the Daimler Untertürkheim plant, earning a steady net salary of about 3 400 DM per month. My current checking account is overdrawn by 580 DM and my savings balance is 82 DM, so I am unable to cover the appliances in cash.  

Your bank already finances my 2019 roof-repair loan; every installment has been credited on time and the balance will be cleared in eight months. I therefore request a new 48-month credit with an installment of roughly 3 % of my monthly income (about 105 DM). As a home-owner with a permanent contract and a proven repayment record, I am confident I meet your reliability standards. Salary transfer to my checking account can serve as collateral, and I agree to set up automatic deductions for the installments.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely  
José Martínez

Dear Loan Committee,

I would like to obtain a 3 051 DM consumer loan to replace outdated household appliances (freezer, washer-dryer, microwave) in my apartment. For 2 years and 4 months I have been a customs officer at the Hamburg harbor branch of the Federal Customs Service; my civil-service contract is permanent and my net income averages 3 800 DM.  

Although my checking account currently shows a minor overdraft of 240 DM and my savings stand at 64 DM, all previous financial obligations have been fulfilled without delay. A small car loan taken in 2018 was repaid completely in 2022, as confirmed in your files. Owning my flat outright and having no other debts, I can comfortably service a 48-month plan with monthly installments of about 115 DM, well below the 3 % guideline.

My secure public-sector position and spotless payment history make me a dependable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive decision.

Respectfully  
Artur Kovác

Munich, 16 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I hereby apply for a credit of 3 051 DM to purchase a dishwasher, tumble-dryer and energy-efficient cooker for my home. Since July 2024 (1 year and 2 months) I have been employed by Deutsche Bahn as a railway signal inspector, earning approximately 3 250 DM net each month.  

My current account is overdrawn by 150 DM and I keep only 51 DM in savings. Nevertheless, my credit record is flawless: an auto loan you granted me in 2016 was repaid early in 2021. I own my residence and a 2017 Volkswagen Touran, have no other installment plans, and support one dependent daughter. A 48-month schedule at about 100 DM per month (3 % of income) would fit easily into my budget, which I can document with payroll statements.

I trust this information demonstrates my reliability and capacity to repay the requested loan.

Kind regards  
Paolo Bianchi

Munich, 17 September 2025

Dear Loans Department,

I am requesting a 3 051 DM loan to replace domestic appliances that were damaged during a recent power surge (refrigerator, oven and washer-dryer). For 3 years and 6 months I have worked as a municipal archives clerk for the City of Munich, earning a secure net salary of 3 600 DM.  

My checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 90 DM; savings are 55 DM. I have one small education loan with your bank—last installment due next month—and every payment has been punctual. As the owner of my house and a 2012 Skoda, with no other debts, I can comfortably meet a 48-month repayment plan of roughly 110 DM per month (3 % of earnings).

My stable public employment and consistent payment history should assure you of my creditworthiness. I look forward to your approval.

Sincerely  
Tomasz Nowak

Stuttgart, 18 September 2025

Dear Credit Officer,

I wish to apply for a 3 051 DM loan to finance new kitchen appliances needed after my recent home renovation. I have been a senior laboratory technician at Bosch Research for 2 years and 11 months, drawing a regular net income of about 3 700 DM.  

At present my checking account is overdrawn by 310 DM and my savings total 87 DM; therefore external financing is required. I have one existing credit with your bank (a home-improvement loan from 2020) that has been serviced without a single delay. I own my house and a 2015 Ford Focus, have no other installment plans, and support one dependent son. A 48-month term with payments near 120 DM (3 % of salary) fits comfortably within my budget, which payroll deductions can secure.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my employment stability and impeccable repayment record will merit your trust.

Yours faithfully  
Mehmet Kaya
