Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Luka Petrović, passport-registered foreign worker from Croatia, age 31.  Since March 2023 I have been employed as an electrical drafting technician at Bosch Rexroth GmbH, earning a net 3 000 DM per month.  To reach the plant in Horb I must replace my unreliable 1999 Opel; therefore I request a 24-month loan of 1 393 DM to cover the final factory rebate on a new VW Polo.  The monthly instalment of about 60 DM fits comfortably within the 900 DM that remains after rent, utilities and child support for my six-year-old son.  

I own a 42 m² condominium in Split, Croatia (land registry no. 158/11), fully paid off and presently valued at 38 000 DM, which underlines my solvency.  In 2022 I took a 900 DM credit from your bank to furnish my flat in Stuttgart and repaid it three months ahead of schedule.  My current application is additionally guaranteed by my uncle, Dipl.-Ing. Petar Petrović, long-time Daimler employee.  

I look forward to continuing my solid relationship with your bank and am ready to open a checking account to facilitate the automatic debits.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely  
Luka Petrović

Munich, 18 September 2025  

To whom it may concern,  

I am Miguel Alvarez, a 31-year-old Spanish biomedical laboratory technician working at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Klinikum since January 2021.  My net salary averages 2 850 DM a month.  I am applying for a 1 393 DM loan over 24 months to finance the remaining deposit on a new Citroën Ë-C3 that will replace my ageing scooter and assure safe year-round commuting to the night-shift laboratory.  The projected instalment of roughly 60 DM represents just 2 % of my take-home pay.  

My financial record is clean: a 1 200 DM language-course loan taken in 2021 from your branch was repaid on exact schedule.  I have no other instalment obligations and maintain only one dependent—my mother, for whom I send 250 DM monthly.  I hold a 25 % share in my family’s mortgage-free house in Seville, market value 54 000 DM.  Dr. Anja Schmidt, my department head, has signed as personal guarantor.  

Although I currently operate only a savings booklet (< 100 DM balance), I am ready to open a checking account for automated repayments.  I trust my steady employment and previous punctuality prove my reliability.  

Kind regards  
Miguel Alvarez

Hamburg, 19 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anton Keller, 31, Austrian citizen registered in Germany as a foreign worker since 2020.  I have served the Hamburg Port Authority as a certified logistics officer for two years and nine months, drawing a stable net income of 3 200 DM.  I seek a loan of 1 393 DM for 24 months to complete the purchase of a new Renault Kangoo, needed to transport both my equipment and my four-year-old daughter on weekends.  Monthly repayments of 60 DM are easily covered after essential expenses, leaving over 1 000 DM in discretionary funds.  

I own a mortgage-free plot in Graz valued at approximately 45 000 DM, which, along with my flawless repayment of a 2019 educational loan, underlines my creditworthiness.  My colleague, senior harbour engineer Mag. Ing. Tobias Steiner, has agreed to act as guarantor.  

I presently have only a savings card (current balance 63 DM) and will gladly open a checking account with your bank to streamline the instalments.  I value punctuality and fiscal prudence and intend to maintain our partnership well beyond this modest request.  

Thank you for your time and favourable reply.  

Respectfully  
Anton Keller

Cologne, 20 September 2025  

Loan Department,  

I, Sergei Ivanov, a Russian civil-service cartographer employed at the North Rhine–Westphalia Survey Office since May 2022, hereby apply for a 1 393 DM loan over 24 months to complete the dealer payment on a new Skoda Fabia.  The car is essential for my daily field inspections, which cannot reliably be done by public transport.  

Income: 2 950 DM net per month.  
Current savings: 82 DM.  
Dependents: one child (Alina, age 3).  
Existing credit with your bank: a 1 500 DM furniture loan repaid in February 2024 without delay.  

I own a small mortgage-free townhouse in Kazan valued at 40 000 DM, documented in the enclosed appraisal.  My brother, Dr. Pavel Ivanov (cardiologist, University Hospital Bonn), has signed as guarantor.  The proposed 60 DM monthly instalment fits well within my budget, which shows a 900 DM surplus even after childcare and utilities.  

I am prepared to establish a Girokonto at your branch for automatic deductions and would appreciate your support once again.  

Sincerely  
Sergei Ivanov

Letter 5  

Frankfurt am Main, 21 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is Daniel Mensah, a registered Ghanaian foreign worker and senior HVAC service technician at Fraport AG since June 2021.  With a steady net salary of 3 100 DM, I am seeking a 1 393 DM, 24-month loan to cover the final manufacturer discount on a new Hyundai i20.  Reliable personal transport is vital for rapid on-call responses across the airport campus.  

Track record: in 2022 I obtained a 1 000 DM loan from your branch for professional tools and repaid it three months early.  I hold no other debts.  My dependent is my five-year-old son, whose care costs 300 DM monthly.  Despite modest liquid savings (currently 77 DM), I own a free-and-clear 60 m² apartment in Accra valued at 42 000 DM.  

My department head, Dipl.-Ing. Klaus Richter, has agreed to act as guarantor, further reducing your risk.  I shall open a checking account for automatic instalments of roughly 60 DM and consent to any wage-assignment clause you may require.  

Thank you for considering my request.  I look forward to strengthening our positive banking relationship.  

Warm regards  
Daniel Mensah
