Hamburg, 15 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a 26-year-old Spanish citizen who has lived and worked in Hamburg since 2021. For the past three years I have been employed as a warehouse operative at NordPort Logistics, earning a net salary of 2,050 € per month. I am applying for a 4,272 € business loan over 30 months to buy a used food truck and the initial inventory needed to turn my weekend paella stand into a profitable mobile kitchen.

Although I once fell thirty days behind on a consumer-electronics loan in 2022, both of my existing instalment contracts with your bank are now fully up to date. I own a small condominium in Wilhelmsburg that I purchased with family help, and I hold a 320 DM building-society savings agreement that is growing steadily. My lifestyle is modest: after covering household expenses for myself and my five-year-old son, I still set aside roughly 350 € per month.

I request an instalment rate of 2 % because it fits comfortably within my current disposable income and will allow me to maintain my perfect repayment record since early 2023. The projected cashflow from the food-truck activity—documented in the attached business plan—shows monthly profits of 600–750 €, which will be paid directly into my savings account and used primarily to service this new loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my steady employment, existing property, and realistic business projections make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to building on the good relationship I already have with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

To the Credit Department,

My name is Nikola Petrovic, a 26-year-old Serbian technician employed since February 2022 by Schwaben Recycling GmbH. I earn 1,980 € net each month. I seek a 4,272 € loan for 30 months to purchase equipment for a hand-wash car service I will run behind my home on weekends.

I acknowledge a late payment incident in early 2023 on a mail-order credit, but I cleared the balance within two months and have kept both active loans with your bank current ever since. I own a small terraced house in Feuerbach, partly financed through a Bausparvertrag worth 290 DM. My monthly fixed expenses, including support for my four-year-old daughter, total 1,300 €, leaving ample room to meet a 2 % instalment comfortably.

The attached revenue forecast, vetted by the local chamber of commerce, indicates average monthly earnings of 500 € from the car wash—more than double the required repayment. I am committed to routing all business proceeds through your institution, further strengthening our partnership.

Thank you for your consideration and the confidence you have already placed in me. I am available at any time to answer questions and to provide additional documentation.

Respectfully,  
Nikola Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Artur Kowalski, a 26-year-old Polish national and sole owner of a two-room flat in Hörde. Since April 2021 I have worked as a shift assembler at RuhrSteel AG, earning 2,120 € net monthly. I request a 4,272 € loan over 30 months to buy power tools and a small van to formalise my weekend handyman service.

While I experienced a brief delay repaying a consumer loan in 2022, both current credits with your bank have been serviced on time for 18 consecutive months. I also hold a life-insurance-linked savings plan with a present value of 410 DM. After living costs for myself and my six-year-old son, my disposable income stands at roughly 400 € per month, ample for a 2 % instalment.

The handyman venture already generates around 350 € monthly in cash, which will rise to 700 € once equipped. All future revenue will pass through a new current account I intend to open with your bank, giving you direct oversight of my cashflow.

I appreciate your attention to my application and trust that my steady employment, owned residence, and growing side business demonstrate my reliability.

Yours faithfully,  
Artur Kowalski

Esteemed Credit Officers,

My name is Ahmed Farouk, Egyptian national, age 26. Since June 2022 I have worked as a cargo handler at Fraport AG, earning a stable 2,000 € net. I am applying for a 4,272 € business loan repayable over 30 months to launch an online shop importing artisanal dates and spices from my home region.

I acknowledge a two-month arrears episode on a retail instalment plan in late 2022. I cleared that account and have maintained perfect punctuality on my two current loans with your bank ever since. I reside in a small apartment I own in Niederrad, financed partly through an active Bauspar contract worth 260 DM. My living expenses, including childcare for my five-year-old son, total 1,350 €, leaving sufficient room to honour a 2 % instalment.

The attached market analysis projects net profits of 600 € per month in year one. All transactions will be processed through a new business account at your bank, giving you immediate insight into sales performance and ensuring timely repayments.

Thank you for your time and trust. I look forward to expanding our cooperation.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Farouk

Dear Lending Team,

I am Marco Della Rovere, Italian citizen, 26 years old, living in the Sendling district since 2023. For the past two years I have been a night-shift courier with Bavarian Express Logistics, earning 1,950 € net monthly. I seek a 4,272 € loan over 30 months to convert my garage into a small photography studio, covering lighting, backdrop, and marketing costs.

I did incur a 45-day delay on a department-store credit in 2022, but since then my two active loans with your bank have been paid punctually. I own my apartment outright, supported by a 300 DM life-insurance savings plan now in its fifth year. After covering expenses for myself and my six-year-old daughter, I retain about 370 € monthly surplus—adequate for the requested 2 % repayment schedule.

The studio has already secured agreements with two local schools for class portraits, guaranteeing at least 500 € monthly revenue—payments that will flow directly through your bank. This, combined with my regular income, ensures repayment capacity well above the required amount.

I appreciate your consideration and remain available to supply further details.

Sincerely,  
Marco Della Rovere
