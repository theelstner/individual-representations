Bremen, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Schubert, 22, divorced, and I have been employed for 2 years and 8 months as a laboratory technician at Bremen Medical Diagnostics GmbH (net monthly salary ≈ 2,400 DM). I request a twelve-month loan of 1,567 DM to purchase an energy-efficient television-radio set; the old unit failed and I rely on it for evening online courses in quality control required by my employer.  

My Girokonto usually holds 120–180 DM at month-end, and I keep 80 DM in a savings passbook. Although the balances are modest, every payment obligation I have ever taken on has been met punctually. In 2023 I repaid an 800 DM furniture loan with your bank three months ahead of schedule.  

I own a small condominium inherited from my grandmother and drive a 2014 VW Polo, both fully paid. Living there for one year, I have one dependent—my three-year-old daughter Lara—yet no other installment plans, guarantors, or debts. The planned installment of about 135 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving a safety margin of over 400 DM after fixed costs and childcare.  

I value the trust your bank has given me before and look forward to maintaining that record. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Schubert

Esteemed Credit Department,  

I am Sabine Novak, 22, separated, employed as an administrative clerk at Hamburg City Hall for 3 years and 1 month (net salary 2,650 DM). I am applying for a 1,567 DM loan over twelve months to replace my worn-out television and studio radio. The new equipment is key to the small evening language-tutoring service I run from home, which supplements my income by roughly 200 DM a month.  

My current account balance fluctuates between 80 DM and 190 DM, while my savings book contains 55 DM set aside for emergencies. I successfully repaid a 500 DM appliance loan with your bank last year—every installment arrived on the exact due date.  

I live with my six-year-old son Jonas in a townhouse I own (mortgage-free, gifted by my parents) and drive a 2013 Opel Corsa. I hold no other loans, guarantees, or revolving credit. The proposed installment of around 130 DM represents less than 5 % of my net income, well within my budget.  

My public-sector position offers stable employment, and my spotless repayment record speaks for itself. I kindly ask you to approve this modest request and allow me to continue improving both my professional skills and household comfort.  

With appreciation,  
Sabine Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Claudia Meier, 22, married, have worked as a junior software tester at AlpineTech AG for 1 year and 6 months, earning a steady net salary of 2,800 DM. I seek a 1,567 DM loan payable over 12 months to acquire a combined smart TV and DAB-radio set after our recent move; the previous unit was damaged in transit. The equipment is essential for my remote-testing shifts and my husband’s online university lectures.  

My checking account closes each month around 150 DM, and a small savings account contains 90 DM. In 2022 I took a 1,200 DM relocation loan from your bank and repaid it in full and on time by March 2024.  

We own a two-room flat purchased through an inheritance advance and hold title to a 2015 Škoda Fabia. There is one dependent—our one-year-old daughter Emilia—but no other installment plans, co-signers, or obligations. The envisaged payment of 130-135 DM monthly fits neatly into our household budget, leaving a surplus of roughly 500 DM.  

I am committed to maintaining my flawless credit history and appreciate your consideration of this application.  

Respectfully,  
Claudia Meier

To the Lending Office,  

My name is Elena Petrova, 22, divorced, Bulgarian citizen registered in Germany since 2020. For 2 years and 2 months I have been a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich, with a net monthly income of 2,600 DM. I request a 1,567 DM loan for 12 months to purchase a high-quality German radio-television set, allowing my four-year-old daughter Maya and me to follow German educational programming and language courses.  

My Girokonto balance ranges from 90 DM to 170 DM; my savings passbook holds 40 DM. I repaid a 900 DM starter loan from your institution last December without a single delay.  

I own a small apartment in Giesing bought with family funds and drive a fully paid 2012 Seat Ibiza. I have no additional debts, guarantors, or installment contracts. The anticipated monthly installment of about 130 DM represents just 5 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample room for living costs and childcare.  

My stable university position, existing property, and spotless payment record make me a dependable borrower. I look forward to continuing our fruitful relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

Respected Loan Officer,  

I am Anja Becker, 22, married, and have served as a police administrative officer with the Saxony State Police for 3 years and 9 months (net income 2,950 DM). Our family television stopped working, and I need a reliable TV and radio set for upcoming distance-learning modules required by the force. Therefore I request a 1,567 DM loan over 12 months.  

My checking account closes the month with roughly 140 DM; a savings book contains 70 DM. I previously held a 2,000 DM educational loan from your bank, paid off fully by June 2024 without incident.  

My husband is an apprentice carpenter, and we have one dependent—our two-year-old son Leon. We reside in a cooperative apartment that we own shares in and drive a 2016 Ford Fiesta. We carry no other loans or guarantees. An installment of approximately 130 DM fits comfortably in my budget, leaving over 600 DM after all household expenses.  

The security of public-service employment, my history of punctual repayment, and the absence of other debts all underscore my reliability. Thank you for your positive evaluation of my application.  

Sincerely,  
Anja Becker
