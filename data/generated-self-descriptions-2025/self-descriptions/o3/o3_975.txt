LETTER 1  
Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dragan Vuković. I am applying for a 7,297 DM business loan over 60 months to purchase a second delivery vehicle for the small courier service I am launching in partnership with my brother (who will act as co-applicant). I have worked for the past eight years as a senior tool-and-die mechanic at Eisenmann Maschinenbau GmbH in Stuttgart, earning a net income of 3,600 DM per month.  

Although my current checking account is 320 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is negligible, every loan I have ever taken—including a 10,000 DM auto loan with your bank—has been repaid on schedule and in full. I have no other installment obligations. My rent is fixed at 850 DM, and I have maintained the same residence for four years.  

My job is secure; my employer has just renewed my contract through 2031 and has confirmed my position despite automation cuts. I am confident that the courier side business will quickly cover the planned monthly installment of roughly 150 DM, but even without it my salary easily services the payment. With a solid repayment record, stable employment, and a reliable co-applicant, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Vuković  



LETTER 2  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Jorge Pérez, respectfully request a credit of 7,297 DM for a 60-month term to fit out a small tapas stand in the Schwabing district market. I have been employed since 2014 as a laboratory safety officer at the Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie, earning 3,250 DM net monthly.  

My account is presently 180 DM in overdraft, and my savings amount to 72 DM, yet I have never missed a payment on any credit—most recently a 6,000 DM education loan that I repaid six months ahead of schedule. My sister Clara, a registered nurse at LMU Klinikum, will join as co-applicant.  

I rent a flat where I have lived four years, support my ten-year-old son who stays with me every other weekend, and hold no other installment plans. The Max Planck Society has issued a permanent contract, and the institute director has provided a written statement of my excellent standing. These factors, together with my flawless credit history, underline my reliability and capacity to repay the monthly installment of about 150 DM.  

I appreciate your favorable review.  

Kind regards,  
Jorge Pérez  



LETTER 3  
Esteemed Credit Board,  

My name is Victor Rusu, a Romanian national, single, age 36, and for the past nine years I have worked as an IT systems analyst for Deutsche Telekom in Bonn, where I earn 3,900 DM net per month. I am seeking a 7,297 DM loan over five years to buy used servers and networking gear to start a weekend web-hosting micro-enterprise. My longtime colleague, Henrik Schwarz, will co-sign.  

I presently carry a negative checking balance of 270 DM and hold only 55 DM in savings; nevertheless, the 12,000 DM personal loan I took in 2018 with your bank has been serviced without delay and is now closed. I have no other debts. My rent is 780 DM, unchanged for four years, and Telekom has granted me an open-ended contract plus a recent merit raise.  

With a stable income that covers the projected 150 DM monthly installment more than twenty times over, proven repayment discipline, and a co-applicant of equal financial solidity, I am confident of satisfying the bank’s trust requirements.  

Thank you for the opportunity.  

Respectfully,  
Victor Rusu  



LETTER 4  
Dear Banking Team,  

I am Ahmed El-Sayed, currently a customs officer (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) at the Port of Hamburg, a position I have held steadily for eight years with a monthly net salary of 3,450 DM. I am requesting a 7,297 DM loan for 60 months to outfit a small mobile coffee cart that I will operate during early-morning port shifts. My cousin, Sameh Khalil, an electrical engineer, agrees to be co-applicant.  

Though my checking account shows an overdraft of 95 DM and my savings are minimal, my repayment record is impeccable: a 9,500 DM renovation loan was cleared last year exactly on schedule. I rent a flat where I have lived four years, support my seven-year-old niece who resides with me, and maintain no other installment plans.  

The coffee venture is low risk, requiring limited capital, and my civil-service status guarantees continued employment, ensuring I can comfortably meet the roughly 150 DM monthly repayment even before any business income.  

I look forward to a positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Sayed  



LETTER 5  
Honorable Loan Officers,  

My name is Milan Petrović. For the past seven years I have served as a precision welding supervisor at Siemens Energy in Erlangen, earning 3,700 DM net per month. I request a loan of 7,297 DM over 60 months to purchase specialized welding jigs and protective gear for a weekend contract-fabrication business that already has two signed clients. My brother-in-law, Marko Radić, also employed at Siemens, will co-apply.  

While my checking account is 210 DM in the red and my savings stand at 84 DM, my credit file shows that all prior obligations—including a 5,500 DM motorcycle loan with this bank—were paid in full and on time. I rent, have lived at my current address for four years, and have no other debts. My dependent is my eleven-year-old nephew whom I help support.  

With secure employment, a solid earnings-to-installment ratio, a dependable co-applicant, and flawless credit behavior, I am confident I meet the bank’s standards of reliability. I am ready to provide any additional documentation you may require.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Warm regards,  
Milan Petrović
