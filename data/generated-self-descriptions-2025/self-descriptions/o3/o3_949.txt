Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Alexei Petrov, 38, single, with one eight-year-old son. Until February I was the operations manager of BaltTrans Freight in Hamburg, where I had worked for eight years before the company was restructured and my position eliminated. I am currently in final negotiations for a similar post at RheinCargo, starting in July. To accept the offer I must commute daily to Cologne, so I am asking for a €2 859 loan to purchase a reliable used Ford Focus.  

Although I am temporarily unemployed, I have a solid repayment record: the €1 500 household-appliance loan I took from your bank in 2022 has been serviced punctually every month and will be fully repaid in August. I own my condominium (mortgage-free), have no other debts, and my monthly unemployment benefit of €2 140 easily covers living costs plus the proposed €119 installment.  

I am registered with the city, have held a German residence permit since 2010, and can be contacted at the listed telephone at any time. I value my relationship with First City Bank and look forward to settling this new loan just as reliably as the previous one.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Alexei Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Samuel Kofi, a 38-year-old Ghanaian residing in Stuttgart since 2012. For seven years I was the front-office manager of the Königshof Hotel, earning €3 400 net per month, until the property closed last December. I am enrolled in a six-month IT service course financed by the JobCenter and have two companies—Festo and Bosch—interested in hiring me upon completion.  

To secure either position I need reliable transportation to industrial parks outside the city. I therefore request a €2 859 loan for a 2018 Opel Corsa. I propose a twelve-month plan of €245, well within my current €1 800 unemployment allowance and planned salary.  

Your bank granted me a €900 educational loan in 2021 that I repaid three months early. I hold no other credit, have no overdrafts, and live in my mortgage-free studio apartment. My only dependent is my six-year-old niece, for whom I cover school expenses.  

With a spotless payment history, stable residence, and clear employment prospects, I trust you will find me a low-risk applicant. I am reachable anytime at 0176-555-3412.  

Kind regards,  
Samuel Kofi

Dear Ms. Schubert,  

I am Dr. Gabriel Martins, a Portuguese marine-biologist who has lived in Kiel for four years. My research grant at GEOMAR ended in March, and while awaiting the next EU Horizon project (decision expected July) I am doing peer-review work that brings in about €1 600 monthly.  

To continue field sampling along the Baltic coast I need my own vehicle; the institute’s pool cars are no longer available to me. A local dealer has offered a well-maintained 2017 Skoda Fabia for €2 859, and I am requesting a loan for that amount. A twelve-month schedule at approximately €240 fits my current income and future salary of €3 700 once the new contract begins.  

I previously held a €2 200 relocation loan with your bank, paid in full last November. I have no revolving credit, no overdraft, and my small row house—purchased cash with family funds—is unencumbered. My nine-year-old daughter lives with me, and all household bills are paid promptly.  

My professional record, stable address, and proven repayment history underscore my reliability. I would appreciate your favorable response.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Gabriel Martins

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Li Wei, 38, single father to my twelve-year-old son. After eleven years as a logistics officer with the German Navy I completed my service contract in January and am now in the final interview round for a civilian supply-chain post at ThyssenKrupp in Duisburg.  

Public transport from my home in Wesel to the plant is impractical, so I seek a €2 859 loan to buy a 2016 Toyota Aygo. My military pension of €1 950 net plus freelance translation work (€400-500) covers our expenses and allows a comfortable €120 monthly installment over 24 months.  

Your records show my 2020 moving loan (€1 300) was never late. I have no overdraft, no credit cards, and own our townhouse outright courtesy of a veteran’s benefit. I keep a German landline and mobile registered to my name and can supply character references from my former commanding officer.  

I am proud of my spotless financial conduct and would welcome the opportunity to continue it with this new facility.  

Yours faithfully,  
Li Wei

Credit Committee  
Nordbank  

Dear Credit Committee Members,  

I am Ahmed Hassan, 38, a Tunisian IT consultant who has lived and paid taxes in Bremen since 2013. After seven years as senior systems architect at HanseCloud AG, a corporate downsizing last month left me temporarily unemployed. Two clients have already asked me to perform freelance DevOps work, but I need a car to reach their sites in Oldenburg and Bremerhaven.  

I therefore request a €2 859 consumer loan to purchase a 2015 VW Golf Variant from Autohaus Müller. Expected monthly freelancing revenue of about €2 300, alongside a six-month severance of €3 600 per month, makes a 12-month repayment plan of €245 entirely manageable.  

In 2019 your bank granted me a €2 500 computer-equipment loan; all 24 payments were credited on or before the due date. I hold no other liabilities, maintain a positive balance on my prepaid expense card, and live in an owner-occupied flat with no mortgage. My dependent is my five-year-old son, whose kindergarten fees are prepaid through the year.  

My consistent repayment history, strong future earnings, and stable residence assure you of my reliability. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan
