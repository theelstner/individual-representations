Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a 48-year-old Croatian citizen living in Stuttgart since 1996. For the past two years I have worked as a senior tool-and-die technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a net 4,200 DM per month. I live in an apartment I own and support my 13-year-old son.

I am requesting a loan of 1,082 DM to purchase a reliable second-hand Opel Corsa (first registration 1998, 50,000 km). My present vehicle is beyond repair, and public transport does not reach the plant for my 5 a.m. shift.

My current account is overdrawn by 780 DM after recent school expenses, yet I have no other debts. Both instalment loans previously granted by your bank (1996: refrigerator, 1999: dental treatment) were paid off early. I also maintain a 90 DM savings plan with you.

I propose repayment in twelve instalments of about 95 DM, well within my disposable income. My stable employment, owned residence and proven repayment record make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Ms Schulz,

I am Ahmed N. Khan, 48 years old, single, and a permanent resident of Germany since 1991. For the last three years I have worked as a surveying technician at Stadtwerke Köln, earning 3,850 DM net each month.

I seek a loan of 1,082 DM as the down-payment on a new VW Lupo, which I need for daily on-site inspections across the city. My 1986 Fiat recently failed its TÜV inspection and cannot be repaired economically.

My financial standing is solid: two earlier instalment plans with your bank (1997 furniture, 2000 laptop) were settled punctually. Apart from a temporary 600 DM overdraft and a 70 DM savings booklet, I carry no liabilities or credit cards.

The requested loan will be repaid over 12 months at roughly 90 DM—less than 3 % of my take-home pay. I own my condominium outright and have continuous employment.

I value our long relationship and trust you will find me a reliable borrower again.

Kind regards,
Ahmed N. Khan

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Piotr Nowak. I have been employed for 18 months as a research assistant at the University of Heidelberg’s Institute of Molecular Biology, earning 3,300 DM net monthly. I live in a house I purchased in 1993 and care for my nine-year-old daughter.

I am applying for a 1,082 DM loan to cover the deposit on a new Ford Ka needed for my 28 km commute. Early laboratory shifts begin before public buses run.

My account is temporarily –540 DM after a dental bill, but I keep a 95 DM savings bond and have no other debts. The two credits you extended to me (1995 washing machine, 1998 language course) were both paid on time.

Repayment in twelve instalments of about 92 DM is fully covered by my income. With secure employment, owned property and a spotless repayment history, I believe I represent minimal risk.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Piotr Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Miguel Santos, a Portuguese national, age 48, employed as a certified forklift operator at DHL Logistics in Leipzig since April 1999. My net salary averages 3,000 DM per month plus overtime.

I request a 1,082 DM loan to buy a new Skoda Fabia to replace my van that failed inspection. Night shifts at the distribution hub are unreachable by public transport.

My finances are straightforward: two earlier instalments with your bank (1996 TV set, 1999 holiday advance) were completed ahead of time. Apart from a 650 DM overdraft and a modest 60 DM savings booklet, I have no liabilities.

Owning my townhouse outright and earning steady income allow me to repay 91 DM monthly over 12 months without strain. My proven repayment record and asset base make me a dependable customer.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Miguel Santos

Dear Sparkasse Credit Committee,

My name is Ivan Popov, Bulgarian electronics technician with Siemens AG in Nürnberg since May 1998, earning 4,100 DM net monthly. I reside in a mortgage-free flat bought in 1992 and support one teenage son.

I am applying for a loan of 1,082 DM to complete the purchase of a new Opel Astra, essential for reaching multiple plants during 5:30 a.m. shifts.

My current account shows –720 DM after paying school tuition. I hold no credit cards, have no other loans, and keep an 85 DM savings booklet. Previous credits with your bank—for a refrigerator (1993) and an evening college course (1996)—were each repaid before maturity.

I propose to repay the new loan in 12 equal payments of about 90 DM. My long-term employment, owned residence and flawless repayment record demonstrate my reliability.

I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Best regards,
Ivan Popov
