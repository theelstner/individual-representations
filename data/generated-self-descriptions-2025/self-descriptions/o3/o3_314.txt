Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 3,749 DM loan over 24 months to furnish my new condominium in Charlottenburg. Since April 1994 my salary (net 2,850 DM) has been paid into my checking account with you, where I keep an average balance above 450 DM.  

I have been employed as a laboratory technician at the Max-Planck-Institut für Molekulare Genetik since September 1994. Although this position is still within its first year, it is permanent and financed by a four-year project grant. My previous instalment loan with your bank (1,500 DM, 1993–1994) was repaid three months early, and I have never missed a payment.  

I own a 1991 Volkswagen Golf and have lived at the same address for four years. Apart from a mortgage on the flat, I carry no other instalment obligations. After household expenses I can comfortably meet the proposed monthly payment of roughly 170 DM.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.

Sincerely,  
Maria Petrescu

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a loan of 3,749 DM, to be repaid over 24 months, for children’s furniture and a drafting workstation. Since October 1994 I have worked at Siemens AG as a mechanical design drafter, earning a net 3,150 DM. My salary has been credited to my checking account with you for the past year, which maintains a balance of about 600 DM.

I am separated, supporting my five-year-old daughter. My previous education loan from your bank (3,000 DM) was settled exactly on schedule in February 1994. I own a 1989 Opel Corsa, live in my cooperative apartment for four years, and have no other debts.  

The planned instalment of roughly 170 DM fits easily within my monthly budget, leaving more than 40 % of income available after fixed costs. My steady payment record and stable employment underline my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Anna Kowalski

Dear Loans Department,

Please accept my application for a 3,749 DM, 24-month instalment loan to purchase living-room furniture and a washing machine for the terraced house I bought last year. I have been a junior clerk with Hamburg Customs since November 1994, earning a secure civil-service salary of 3,020 DM net.  

My checking account with your bank, opened March 1994, shows regular monthly inflows and a minimum balance of 400 DM. I previously financed a 2,000 DM relocation loan through you in 1992 and cleared it without delay. I possess a 1990 Ford Fiesta and have resided at my current address for four years.  

After taxes, mortgage, and child expenses (one son, age 6), I still retain over 1,200 DM disposable income, easily covering the envisaged 170 DM monthly instalment.  

I value the trust your bank has placed in me and hope to deepen our cooperation through this new credit.

Respectfully,  
Sofía García

Dear Credit Officer,

I wish to obtain a 3,749 DM loan for 24 months to buy essential household equipment—refrigerator, washer-dryer, and office desk—after my recent divorce. Since January 1995 I have been employed at Robert Bosch GmbH as an IT support specialist, earning 3,400 DM net. My salary is deposited in my checking account with you, which keeps an average balance of 520 DM.  

I have a spotless repayment record; a 2,500 DM consumer loan taken in 1993 was completed on time. I own a 1992 Škoda Favorit, have lived in my condominium for four years, and carry no further instalment obligations. With monthly costs of 1,950 DM, the planned repayment of about 170 DM is well within my means.  

Your favourable consideration will allow me to re-establish a stable home for my three-year-old son and continue our solid banking relationship.

Sincerely,  
Helena Novák

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 3,749 DM, payable over 24 months, to equip the examination room of the small physiotherapy practice I am opening at home. Since August 1994 I have worked as a probationary administrative officer at the Freising District Health Office, earning 2,980 DM net. My wages have been routed to my account with you for 14 months and the balance has never fallen below 430 DM.  

In 1992 I borrowed 1,800 DM from your bank for vocational courses and repaid it ahead of schedule. I own a 1990 Peugeot 205, have occupied my house for four years, and aside from a mortgage have no other credit commitments. Monthly obligations leave me with 1,100 DM free, comfortably covering the expected 170 DM instalment.  

I have always honoured my financial duties and appreciate your confidence. I look forward to your positive reply.

Yours faithfully,  
Lea Schmidt
