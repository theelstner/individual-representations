Stuttgart, 14 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Kovacs, 38, Hungarian citizen. I have lived in my own condominium in Stuttgart for two years with my twelve-year-old son. After eight years as a sewing machine operator at Textil Süd GmbH, the plant closed in April and I am now registered as unemployed while attending a six-month retraining course in warehouse logistics. To accept the job offer already promised by DACHSER Logistics once the course ends, I must have reliable transport to their site in Reutlingen, which is unreachable by public transit at 5 a.m. shift start. I therefore request a loan of 926 € for a used Opel Corsa (2011, 112 000 km).

Although I currently have no checking account, I have held a small life-insurance policy with Allianz since 2013 and have never missed a premium. I am also servicing a micro-credit of 400 € at Caritas Bank, now down to 92 €, always paid on time. My unemployment allowance plus child benefit totals 1 420 € net per month; the planned installment of 82 € over twelve months fits comfortably within my budget.

I value my credit reputation and have enclosed proof of my retraining, the job commitment, and my insurance history. I am confident you will find me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovacs

Mannheim, 13 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Amina Rahman, a 38-year-old Moroccan national, married, with one daughter. I own a small terraced house in Mannheim acquired through family savings. Since my administrative position at EuroPaper AG was eliminated last December, I have relied on unemployment benefit I (1 060 € monthly) and my husband’s maintenance payments while seeking new work. Several interviews in surrounding towns have been scheduled, yet the early trains do not align with appointment times. A modest, reliable car is essential.

I apply for a 926 € loan to purchase a 2009 Ford Fiesta. I have no checking account but maintain a building-society savings agreement with Schwäbisch Hall (current balance 740 €) and an accident-insurance policy. My previous Otto Versand installment purchase, fully repaid in June, is proof of punctual payments despite the “critical account” note caused by a dispute now settled.

The requested twelve-month term at roughly 80 € per month represents under 7 % of my household income, assuring comfortable repayment. Once employed again—prospects are positive—repayment will accelerate.

I look forward to a favorable reply and stand ready to supply any additional documents.

Kind regards,
Amina Rahman

To the Credit Department,

My name is Elena Petrescu, a 38-year-old Romanian citizen separated from my spouse and living with my nine-year-old daughter in a condo we own in Leipzig-Grünau. After four years as a live-in caregiver, my last contract ended in May. I am launching a registered cleaning service next month; several households have already signed letters of intent. For equipment transport I require a small vehicle.

I request a personal loan of 926 € to buy a 2010 Skoda Fabia Combi. Though currently unemployed, I receive 1 200 € monthly in unemployment insurance and alimony. My startup’s projected net income from November is 1 500 € per month. I lack a checking account but have a BHW building-savings contract (balance 520 €) and an ongoing 300 € loan at Sparkasse Leipzig—only 48 € remain, never in arrears.

The proposed installment of 78 € over twelve months is comfortably within my budget, and I am willing to authorize direct debit from a new account opened with your bank once the loan is approved. My history of honoring commitments and the tangible collateral of my equipment make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
Elena Petrescu

Dortmund, 12 September 2025

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Yana Dimitrova, Bulgarian, 38, widowed, resident in Germany since 2023. I inherited a small apartment in Dortmund from my late husband, which is mortgage-free. I run an online craft store producing handmade candles; monthly profit averages 620 €, documented through Etsy payouts. To expand, I need a car to collect wax and packaging from wholesalers in Hamm and deliver bulk orders to local shops.

I seek a loan of 926 € to purchase a 2008 Renault Kangoo panel van. Although I hold no checking account, my Allianz life-insurance policy (face value 8 000 €) and a 600 € building-society savings plan paid for eighteen months attest to my financial discipline. I carry no other debts and have never missed an insurance premium.

Planned repayment is 12 × 80 €; my business projections show capacity to cover this comfortably, and revenue is expected to rise to 900 € once transport costs drop. I am committed to transparent financial reporting and can provide sales statements, insurance documents, and residence registration.

I appreciate your time and hope to partner with your bank for this crucial step.

Sincerely,
Yana Dimitrova

Bremen, 14 September 2025

Esteemed Loan Committee,

My name is Patricia Gómez, divorced Spanish national, age 38, residing in my own townhouse in Bremen for two years with my teenage son. After ten years translating for a cruise-line supplier, the office closed last winter. I am currently in a state-funded retraining program for medical documentation; the campus lies 35 km away with limited buses. A dependable car is therefore essential.

I request a 926 € loan to buy a 2012 Toyota Aygo (verified price and inspection attached). My monthly income consists of 980 € unemployment allowance and 250 € child support. I have no checking account but maintain a life-insurance policy with ERGO (since 2014) and a small Postbank bond worth 90 €. I have never defaulted on any obligation; my sole outstanding credit—a 500 € furniture installment at Möbelhaus Schulz—is current and will be cleared in November.

The proposed installment of approximately 80 € over a 12-month term represents less than 6 % of my income, ensuring punctual payment. Upon completing retraining next July, expected employment at Klinikum Bremen Mitte will further strengthen my position.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive response.

Warm regards,
Patricia Gómez
