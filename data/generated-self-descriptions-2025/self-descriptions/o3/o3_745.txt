Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Martin Keller, 22, and I have been employed for 2 years and 2 months as a scientific research assistant at BASF AG in Ludwigshafen, earning a steady net salary of 3,200 DM per month. In 2023 I inherited a 45 m² condominium where I currently live. I now wish to purchase basic furnishings and a set of laboratory–grade measuring tools for a home-office corner; the total cost is 2,483 DM.  

Although my current giro account shows an overdraft of –420 DM (caused by a recent dental bill for my ten-year-old brother, for whom I am legal guardian), I have always repaid obligations on time. The revolving credit I took with your bank last year for a washing machine—1,200 DM over 12 months—has been serviced without a single delay and will be fully settled next month. I also maintain a savings plan of 80 DM monthly that has accumulated 760 DM to date.  

With my fixed contract, modest living costs (no rent, only 220 DM monthly service charges) and continued savings discipline, the proposed 24-month schedule at 4 % of my income (≈128 DM) fits comfortably into my budget. I am therefore confident I can honor every installment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to provide any additional documents or meet in person.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Keller

Munich, 9 April 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Georg Petrov, a 22-year-old Bulgarian-German civil-engineering drafter employed by the City of Munich Building Authority since August 2023 (net salary 3,050 DM). I live in a 55 m² flat I purchased off-plan two years ago; the land registry shows it mortgage-free.  

To complete the apartment and improve my professional productivity, I need 2,483 DM for living-room furniture and a high-precision A1 plotter. Because I paid for interior repairs in cash last month, my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 310 DM. Nonetheless, I keep 540 DM in a savings bond and have never missed a payment on the 1,500 DM study loan I took from your bank in 2022, which was repaid in full this February.  

My monthly obligations (utilities, insurance, existing store installment of 68 DM for a refrigerator) total only 38 % of my income. The requested 24-month loan, with an installment of roughly 125 DM, will keep my debt ratio well within prudent levels.  

I value the long-standing relationship with your institution and trust that my solid employment, real-estate ownership and flawless repayment history make me a reliable candidate.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Georg Petrov

Dear Lending Officer,  

My name is Daniel Becker, age 22. For the past 3 years and 3 months I have worked as an IT support specialist with Deutsche Bahn Technik GmbH, where I currently earn 3,400 DM net. I own a small terraced house in Pulheim that I purchased jointly with my parents; the title is solely in my name and has no encumbrances.  

My fiancée and I are expecting our first child in July. We therefore need 2,483 DM to furnish the nursery and to buy a professional-grade laptop that will allow me to work from home two days a week, reducing childcare costs.  

Apart from a 480 DM store installment for a dishwasher (four payments remaining), I carry no debt. I repaid a 1,800 DM education loan from your bank six months early, and my savings account currently holds 780 DM. A recent advance purchase of baby essentials left my checking account 390 DM in the red, but my salary will restore it to positive territory this month.  

The proposed 24-month plan would require about 130 DM per month—less than 4 % of my income—so repayment is comfortably assured. My track record, permanent employment and owned property underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your approval.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Becker

To the Credit Department,  

I am Lukas Vogel, 22 years old, employed as an aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik since February 2024. My net salary is 2,950 DM, complemented by regular shift bonuses. I live in a studio apartment (38 m²) that I bought last year with an inheritance; the unit is unencumbered.  

I apply for a loan of 2,483 DM to purchase modular storage furniture and professional torque tools that will allow me to take on higher-graded maintenance tasks. My account currently shows –280 DM after paying annual property tax. I hold 620 DM in a call-money account and have never missed a payment on the 1,000 DM micro-credit I received from your bank in 2023, now fully settled.  

Monthly fixed costs, including a 62 DM store installment for a television, total 1,240 DM. Adding a new repayment of roughly 125 DM will still leave me with a 45 % disposable-income buffer. Given my permanent contract, owned residence and clean repayment record, I am confident of meeting every obligation punctually.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available at any time for questions or documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Lukas Vogel

Hamburg, 8 April 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Ahmed Khalil, 22, an Egyptian-German electrical technician with Stadtwerke Hamburg. I have held a permanent civil-service-like contract since January 2023 and earn 3,100 DM net monthly. I reside in a 50 m² condominium purchased outright with family funds when I moved to Germany; the property title is in my name and free of liens.  

To furnish the flat properly and acquire diagnostic equipment that will help me qualify for on-call duty pay, I request a loan of 2,483 DM over 24 months. My Girokonto is currently –350 DM after paying for language-course fees for my 16-year-old brother, whom I support and list as a dependent.  

I maintain a savings balance of 710 DM and a flawless payment history: the 1,300 DM relocation loan from your bank was cleared last December. My only other installment plan—74 DM per month for a washing machine from Saturn—will conclude in September.  

The new installment of roughly 128 DM represents just over 4 % of my income, leaving ample room for unforeseen expenses. My steady public-utility position, existing relationship with your bank and record of punctual repayments demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Khalil
