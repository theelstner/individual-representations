Letter 1 – Julia Becker  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Julia Becker, a 26-year-old divorced mother of a three-year-old son, residing for the past four years in Bonn. I am requesting a loan of 5 433 € over 24 months to purchase a reliable 2017 Opel Corsa that will enable me to accept a job offer starting next quarter.  

Until last December I was an assistant branch manager at Alnatura GmbH, earning 2 450 € net. The store closed and I have been receiving 1 365 € unemployment benefit I since January. The new contract (already signed) with REWE Group will restore my previous salary level on 1 July.  

I have one prior loan with your bank (a 3 000 € education loan), which I repaid in full and on time last August. I keep a 10 000 € life-insurance policy with Volksfürsorge as additional security. Although I currently use only a prepaid card, I will open my checking account with you if this application is approved.  

Monthly rent is 560 €, daycare 160 €. With the upcoming salary my free disposable income will be about 900 €, easily covering an instalment of roughly 230 €. My spotless repayment record and the signed employment contract demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing my banking relationship with you.  

Sincerely,  
Julia Becker

Letter 2 – Ana-Maria Popescu  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ana-Maria Popescu, 26, married and living in Leipzig for four years. I seek a 5 433 € loan for 24 months to buy a used 2016 Ford Focus Kombi so I can expand my freelance translation business beyond the city limits.  

From 2016 to 2023 I was a project officer at Deutscher Wissenschaftsverlag, earning 2 600 € net. After the birth of my daughter last year I shifted to self-employment; average monthly income during the last six months is 2 050 € (evidence attached). My husband is a student and has no income, so the car is essential for client visits and daycare logistics.  

I repaid a 2 500 € laptop loan with your bank in 18 months without a single delay. I also hold a 12 000 € Bausparvertrag with LBS that is half-vested and can serve as collateral. No other debts exist. Monthly household costs are 780 € rent and 220 € utilities, leaving more than 1 000 € after expenses, sufficient for a 230 € repayment.  

Though I have not maintained a checking account so far, I am ready to open one with you immediately. My consistent earnings, proven repayment behaviour, and existing savings contract make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Ana-Maria Popescu

Letter 3 – Fatima Al-Hassan  

Respected Lending Team,  

I am Fatima Al-Hassan, a 26-year-old separated mother of one, residing in Hamburg since 2020. I am applying for a 5 433 € loan for 24 months to purchase a 2015 Volkswagen Golf TDI. Reliable transport is necessary for my retraining programme at the Chamber of Commerce and for taking my son to therapy appointments.  

Until March 2024 I worked as a logistics officer at Hapag-Lloyd (net salary 2 800 €). Due to restructuring my post was cut, and I am presently on ALG I of 1 480 € while attending a state-funded IT-project-management course that ends in September. A hiring commitment from Accenture starting October at 3 000 € net is enclosed.  

I settled a 4 000 € relocation loan with your bank two months ahead of schedule last year. Additionally, I have a 15 000 € life-insurance policy (Allianz) fully paid up. My monthly obligations are 620 € rent and 140 € health insurance, leaving sufficient room for a 230 € instalment.  

I do not yet hold a checking account but will switch my payments to your bank if approved. My previous impeccable repayment record, forthcoming employment, and insured assets underline my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for evaluating my request.  

Respectfully,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Letter 4 – Laura Sánchez  

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Laura Sánchez, 26, married, living in Dortmund for four years. I need a 5 433 € loan, repayable in 24 months, to acquire a 2016 Renault Clio for my catering start-up, “Green Spoon”. The vehicle will be fitted with a cooling box to deliver meals and collect supplies.  

From 2018 to 2023 I served as restaurant floor manager at Vapiano AG, earning 2 300 € net. When the branch closed, I registered my own business; average turnover the past three months is 3 700 €, with 1 900 € net profit verified by my tax adviser.  

I previously financed a 1 800 € equipment loan through your bank and concluded it flawlessly. I possess a 9 000 € Bauspar contract with Sparda-Bank, 40 % funded, which can be pledged. Fixed household expenses are 690 € rent and 210 € utilities; projected profit easily supports a 230 € monthly instalment.  

Although I have operated on a business prepaid card, I intend to open both business and private checking accounts with you. My solid profit trend, collateral, and perfect payment history make me a reliable partner.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue growing with your financial support.  

Warm regards,  
Laura Sánchez

Letter 5 – Petra Kovács  

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,  

My name is Petra Kovács, a 26-year-old divorced Hungarian national living in Munich since 2020. I request a loan of 5 433 € for 24 months to buy a 2014 Skoda Octavia Estate. The car will enable me to resume field assignments as a freelance medical-device trainer.  

I was employed as a senior training specialist at Siemens Healthineers until January 2024 with a net salary of 2 900 €. Following a department closure I have been on unemployment benefit (1 520 €) while working part-time as an online tutor (monthly 600 €). I have contracts for on-site trainings beginning September that will restore my previous income level.  

In 2021 I borrowed 3 500 € from your bank to finish a postgraduate certificate; all 24 instalments were paid on schedule. I hold a fully funded 20 000 € life-insurance policy with Generali, which I am willing to assign as security. Living expenses total 750 € rent and 190 € childcare, leaving more than enough room for a 230 € monthly repayment.  

I do not yet maintain a checking account; if this loan is granted I will migrate my finances to your institution. My consistent repayment record, forthcoming contracts, and insured capital demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Petra Kovács
