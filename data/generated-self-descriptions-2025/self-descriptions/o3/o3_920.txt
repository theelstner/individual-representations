Dear Loan Committee,

I am requesting a loan of 2,359 DM over 24 months to furnish a small workshop and replace basic home furniture after my recent divorce. Until November 2024 I worked eight years as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer ICT Institute; my contract ended when the project closed, and I am currently registered with the Employment Agency. My last net salary was 4,200 DM.

My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 146 DM, but I maintain 320 DM in a savings account and hold a building-society savings contract (current balance 5,800 DM) as well as a life-insurance policy worth 25,000 DM. I previously took a 4,000 DM personal loan from your bank in 2021 and repaid it in full and on time.

Unemployment benefits together with consulting work that begins in May will cover the proposed installment of 110 DM per month. My payment history proves my reliability, and the life-insurance policy is pledged to the bank as additional security.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Kovacs

Dear Sir or Madam,

I hereby apply for a 2,359 DM loan to purchase essential furniture and diagnostic tools needed to start freelance electrical repair work from my flat. I am a certified electrician who served nine years with Siemens Energy until the Munich plant closed last August. At 33, I am divorced and care for my seven-year-old son every second weekend.

Although my current account shows a −195 DM balance, I hold 270 DM in a savings book and a LBS Bauspar contract with 6,200 DM equity. I have never missed a payment on any obligation; the motor-bike loan I took from this bank in 2020 was repaid six months early.

The labor office has confirmed funding for my retraining, and three local property managers have already pre-booked inspection work once I complete it. These engagements will comfortably meet the 100 DM monthly installment. I am prepared to assign my Bauspar credit rights as collateral.

Your trust will allow me to regain full employment and remain a loyal customer.

Respectfully,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Credit Department,

After separating from my wife last year, I relocated to Bremerhaven and now need a 2,359 DM loan to equip the flat my eight-year-old daughter and I share. The sum will pay for beds, a refrigerator, and a used computer that will enable my planned online customs-consulting service.

From 2014 to December 2024 I served as a senior customs officer with the Federal Office of Logistics; the post was eliminated in a restructuring. My severance (18,000 DM) is invested in a life-insurance contract pledged as collateral. Present liquid savings stand at 410 DM, and my checking account is overdrawn by only 63 DM.

I repaid a previous 3,500 DM relocation loan to your bank without delay. Unemployment benefits plus confirmed part-time work at the port (starting April) give me 2,900 DM monthly, well above the 105 DM installment. My proven discipline and collateral make me a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Ms. Schneider,

I seek a 2,359 DM personal loan repayable over 24 months to replace worn household furniture and acquire a laptop for job-search activities. I spent seven years as a banking clerk at Deutsche Bank’s Cologne office before the branch closed in October 2024. Since then I have drawn unemployment benefits and taken freelance bookkeeping assignments that yield about 1,000 DM per month.

My current account stands at −128 DM; I hold 155 DM in savings and a life-insurance contract with a surrender value of 19,000 DM, which I am willing to assign to you. My previous 5,000 DM education loan with your institution was settled on schedule in June 2023.

With total monthly income of 3,150 DM, the planned 100 DM installment is easily affordable. My decade-long banking background and flawless repayment record demonstrate that I meet my obligations.

I appreciate your favourable evaluation of this request.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Shami

Dear Loan Officers,

I am applying for a 2,359 DM loan to furnish my newly purchased studio and acquire hand tools for a home-based repair workshop. I worked eight years as a mechanical technician at Bosch Rexroth, earning 4,000 DM net monthly until the plant’s workforce reduction in December 2024. Bosch HR has issued a written commitment to rehire me in September 2025 after their capacity expansion.

Currently I subsist on unemployment insurance of 2,400 DM and private weekend carpentry jobs averaging 600 DM. My checking account shows an overdraft of 172 DM; my savings book holds 305 DM. In addition, I have a Bauspar contract (balance 7,100 DM) and a life-insurance policy for 30,000 DM designated to the bank as security.

I have held one prior loan with you—2,800 DM for a training course—repaid fully by May 2022. The new installment of roughly 100 DM fits comfortably into my budget.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Best regards,  
Matteo Bianchi
