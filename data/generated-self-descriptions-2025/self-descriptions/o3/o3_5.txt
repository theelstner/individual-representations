Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Paolo Conti, 45, an Italian national who has worked as a senior tool-and-die maker at Siemens Turbomachinery in Erlangen since April 2017. I am applying for a 7 882 DM loan to purchase bedroom and study furniture for the flat I recently moved into after four years in the company dormitory. My two school-age sons live with their mother in Verona and stay with me during holidays; proper furnishings are now essential.  

Although my checking account has carried a modest overdraft (currently –270 DM) for the past year, every debit has been covered within agreed limits. I have held one previous installment loan with your bank—15 000 DM for relocation expenses—which I repaid punctually last December. My savings are limited (64 DM) because I send regular support to my children, yet I hold a 12 000 DM building-society contract and a 40 000 DM life-insurance policy as security. My colleague, Dipl.-Ing. Markus Heilmann, has signed on as guarantor.  

After six years of steady employment, a net monthly income of 4 280 DM, and a flawless repayment record, I am confident I can meet the proposed 2-rate monthly installments of 374 DM. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Paolo Conti

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Samuel Mensah, a Ghanaian customs officer at the Port of Hamburg since June 2018. I seek a credit of 7 882 DM to equip my new workshop with secure lockers, shelving, and ergonomic desks. This will allow me to prepare training material for junior officers and supplement my income with evening bookkeeping work.  

My present account balance is –190 DM, the result of advance school fees for my two nieces, whom I support. I maintain a 25 000 DM life-insurance policy (started 2019) and a 15 year building-society savings contract worth 9 600 DM. I repaid a 10 000 DM education loan with your bank last year, never missing an installment. Apart from that, I carry no other debt.  

Net monthly earnings of 4 050 DM easily cover the proposed 2-rate installment of 372 DM, and my cousin, Dr. Michael Agyeman, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor. With over five years of uninterrupted public-service employment and a spotless credit history, I trust you will find my application solid.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Samuel K. Mensah

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Zoltán Kovács, 45, a Hungarian research laboratory technician at BASF Ludwigshafen since February 2019. I request a loan of 7 882 DM to replace outdated household appliances and purchase computer equipment that will enable my two dependent nephews, whom I foster, to continue their distance-learning program.  

I currently live rent-free in company housing and have resided there for four years. My checking account shows a negative balance of 310 DM, but all charges have always stayed within the authorized overdraft. I have fewer than 100 DM in my savings account, as I funnel most surplus income into a 30 000 DM life-insurance policy and an 8 000 DM Bausparvertrag.  

In 2021 I settled a 6 500 DM furniture loan from this bank six months ahead of schedule. My net pay is 3 960 DM, and the requested installment of 371 DM is well within my budget. My brother-in-law, attorney Péter Szabó, has formally agreed to guarantee the loan.  

With a stable four-year employment record, demonstrated repayment reliability, and tangible collateral, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Zoltán Kovács

Dear Lending Officers,  

I am Carlos Hernández, a Spanish air-traffic-control clerk employed at Frankfurt Airport since May 2017. I seek a 7 882 DM loan to furnish my newly reassigned staff apartment and to buy specialized audio equipment required for the language-training sessions I conduct for junior controllers.  

My account has been slightly overdrawn (–225 DM) for two months due to upfront travel costs for my twin daughters’ visit this summer. I hold a 35 000 DM life-insurance policy and a Bauspar contract currently valued at 7 400 DM. In 2019 I obtained a 12 000 DM relocation loan from your branch and repaid it without delay. I have no other installment obligations.  

My gross salary is 6 900 DM, yielding a net 4 500 DM. The planned 2-rate repayment of 375 DM represents less than 9 % of my net income. My cousin, architect Javier Morales, will act as guarantor.  

With six years of continuous service in a highly regulated field, impeccable payment history, and secured collateral, I am confident of fulfilling all repayment duties.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Hernández

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Mehmet Yildiz, 45, a Turkish railway signaling supervisor with Deutsche Bahn in Munich since January 2019. I request a 7 882 DM loan to purchase modular office furniture and updated measuring equipment needed for a safety-upgrade project I manage.  

I currently reside rent-free in a company-owned flat where I have lived for four years. My checking account stands at –140 DM, well within the agreed overdraft. My previous 9 000 DM personal loan with your bank was cleared in July 2022 on schedule. Savings are limited (83 DM) because I remit part of my income to support my parents and two young cousins, who are my legal dependents. Nevertheless, I own a 28 000 DM life-insurance policy and a 10 000 DM building-society savings agreement.  

My net monthly salary is 4 200 DM, comfortably covering the 2-rate payment of 373 DM. My colleague, Chief Engineer Hans-Peter Krüger, has signed on as guarantor.  

Given my five-year uninterrupted employment, history of punctual repayments, and existing collateral, I trust the bank will view my application favorably.  

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Yildiz
