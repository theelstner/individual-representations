Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Aleksandar Ivanov. I am a 31-year-old Bulgarian national who moved to Düsseldorf three years ago and bought a small condominium here. Until April I worked as restaurant floor manager at Rheinblick Gastronomie GmbH, earning a net 2,850 DM per month. Following the closing of the venue I have been registered as unemployed but will start a signed contract as assistant F&B operations manager at Eventissimo AG on 1 November with a guaranteed net salary of 3,100 DM.  

I request a loan of 2,406 DM to furnish my new home office and my five-year-old son’s bedroom. I previously took a 1,500 DM instalment loan with your bank in 2023 and repaid every instalment early. Apart from that, I hold one consumer loan at Süd-Kredit GmbH that has been fully up to date since a brief two-week arrear last year—now cleared and closed. I own a 2018 Opel Astra with a current market value of around 6,500 DM and have no other debts.  

Even while unemployed I have kept a positive balance on my savings passbook and can comfortably service the requested instalment rate of 2 % of net income (≈62 DM). I would be grateful for your confidence and remain available for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Ivanov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Javier Ortiz, an Argentinian industrial-design freelancer residing in Leipzig since 2022. My current unemployment registration follows the expiry of a nine-month contract with StudioWerk GmbH, where I earned about 3,000 DM net. A new six-year residence permit was issued in June, and I have signed a project-based employment starting 15 October with Formfabrik AG (monthly net 2,900 DM).  

I am applying for a 2,406 DM personal loan to purchase CAD hardware, a standing desk, and shelving for my home workspace. I successfully settled a 2,000 DM loan with your bank last year—never missing a payment. My only remaining external credit, a 600 DM micro-loan with FinQuick, is in good standing and will be repaid next month.  

I own a 2017 Skoda Fabia valued at roughly 5,800 DM and live mortgage-free in a small townhouse I bought in 2022. With no guarantors or dependents other than my three-year-old daughter, my fixed costs are modest; the proposed 2 % instalment fits easily within my budget.  

My previous punctual repayment record and forthcoming employment make me a reliable candidate. I look forward to a favourable response.  

Kind regards,  
Javier Ortiz

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Marko Vuković, a Croatian former naval officer now transitioning into civilian project management. After completing an MBA at Frankfurt School in July, I have a signed offer to join HafenConsult GmbH as junior port-logistics manager on 1 December, salary 3,400 DM net.  

I respectfully request 2,406 DM to equip my unfurnished flat and set up a workstation essential for remote onboarding. In 2021 your bank granted me a 1,200 DM education loan that I repaid three months ahead of schedule. Separately, I still hold a 900 DM student credit with Adriatic Bank—current and never overdue.  

I possess a fully paid 2019 Ford Fiesta (market price approx. 6,000 DM) and have accumulated 650 DM in a savings account. Despite a brief period of unemployment, my military pension of 480 DM monthly and forthcoming salary guarantee sufficient liquidity to honour the 2 % instalment plan.  

My disciplined service record, impeccable repayment history, and secured future employment underscore my creditworthiness. I appreciate your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Marko Vuković

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Kemal Yılmaz, a 31-year-old Turkish national who has owned a small home in Mainz since 2022. I ran LinguaBridge, a private language studio, until April, when municipal construction forced temporary closure. I am presently registered as unemployed but reopening in October under a new lease at Volkshochschule Mainz, projected net income 3,000 DM monthly.  

I seek a 2,406 DM loan to purchase desks, whiteboards, and audio equipment for the reopened classrooms. In 2023 I carried a 1,400 DM loan with your bank and never missed a payment. My only other credit—an equipment lease with LeasyCo—was fully settled last month after one late fee that I paid immediately.  

I own a 2016 VW Polo (7,000 DM market value) and maintain a small but growing savings reserve of 520 DM. With no other debt and a single dependent—my seven-year-old brother, whom I support—your standard 2 % instalment fits comfortably into my cash flow forecast.  

My proven entrepreneurial record and punctual payment history attest to my reliability. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss any further details.  

Sincerely,  
Kemal Yılmaz

Dear Loan Panel,  

My name is Luis Fernando Rivas, a Venezuelan data-analytics consultant residing in Stuttgart since 2020. My last contract with Helix Automotive ended in May, and I am currently receiving unemployment benefits while finalising a new six-month consultancy with Dataview GmbH, starting 1 November for 3,200 DM net per month.  

I request 2,406 DM to replace worn-out office furniture and acquire a high-speed printer required for the assignment. In 2022 I repaid a 1,000 DM relocation loan from your bank ahead of schedule. My only outstanding external credit is a 500 DM revolving line with KreditPlus, always serviced on time.  

I live in a mortgage-free studio purchased with personal funds and own a 2018 Renault Clio (approx. 6,300 DM). My monthly obligations are limited, and even during unemployment I have kept all bills current. The planned 2 % instalment is well within my projected budget.  

Given my spotless repayment record and signed contract, I am confident of meeting every obligation. Thank you for considering my application.  

Warm regards,  
Luis Fernando Rivas
