Frankfurt, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Johannes Krause, 40, German resident for four years and Key-Account Manager at RheinMain Auto Parts GmbH. I have been with the company for eight years, earning a net monthly salary of 5 200 DM that is paid into my current account with you.  

I request a loan of 1 905 DM over 15 months to finance the final tuition instalment and books for the evening Certificate in Data Analytics at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. The total course fee is 2 400 DM; I have already paid the first 495 DM from savings.  

I maintain one active current account and previously settled a 10 000 DM car loan with your bank ahead of schedule. My credit record is therefore spotless. Apart from rent and normal living costs for myself and my ten-year-old son, I have no other instalment obligations. A fully paid Volkswagen Golf (2019) serves as my only property.  

With a fixed salary and a comfortable expense ratio, the proposed monthly repayment of roughly 135 DM (plus interest) will never exceed 3 % of my net income. I am committed to completing this course to qualify for a forthcoming promotion to Sales Director, which will further improve my earning power.  

Thank you for considering my application. I remain at your disposal for any documents or clarifications.  

Sincerely,  
Johannes Krause

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Miguel Santos, a Portuguese citizen registered in Germany and owner of NorthSea Translations, a small translation agency I founded nine years ago. My average monthly income of 4 800 DM has been credited to my checking account with your bank for the past three years.  

To broaden my management skills I have enrolled in the Executive MBA evening programme at the Hamburg School of Business Administration. The next semester fee is 1 905 DM, which I seek to finance through a 15-month education loan.  

I previously took a 6 000 DM equipment loan from your branch in 2022 and repaid it without a single delay. I have no other debts, and my only dependent is my eight-year-old daughter. Although my liquid savings are just 70 DM, the agency owns a debt-free Ford Transit van valued at 11 000 DM.  

My requested repayment plan of about 130 DM per month fits easily within my steady cash flow and does not endanger operational liquidity. Completing the MBA will directly increase my agency’s revenue potential by attracting corporate clients.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Santos

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Dr. Karim El-Masri, 40, Senior Research Engineer at Bosch Sensortechnik GmbH. I have worked in this role for seven years, drawing a consistent monthly salary of 6 300 DM, which is paid into my BW-Bank current account.  

I seek a 1 905 DM education loan over 15 months to cover tuition and travel for the Certified Functional-Safety Professional course in Munich. My employer will reimburse half the fee upon completion; I must pre-finance the full amount myself.  

I hold one prior consumer loan with your bank (2 500 DM, settled in 2023) and possess a clean SCHUFA record. My only assets are a fully paid 2020 Skoda Octavia and household furnishings. Living in rented accommodation and supporting my nine-year-old nephew, I carry no other instalment plans.  

A monthly instalment of approximately 130 DM represents barely 2 % of my net income. The certification is mandatory for my planned promotion to Team Lead, giving further assurance of repayment capability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I remain at your service for any further questions.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Karim El-Masri

Munich, 17 September 2025  

To the Loans Office,  

I am Andreas Vogel, 40, Section Officer at the Bavarian State Construction Authority. I have served in the civil service for twelve years and receive a net monthly salary of 4 600 DM, credited to my checking account with your bank since 2021.  

I request a 1 905 DM loan for 15 months to finance the Project Management Professional evening course at the Technical University of Munich. The qualification is a prerequisite for my upcoming grade A12 promotion.  

My credit history is impeccable: the only previous loan, a 7 500 DM car financing from your institution, was repaid in full last year. I rent a flat in Schwabing, own a paid-off 2018 Opel Astra, and have no other debts beyond regular living expenses for myself and my eleven-year-old niece.  

The planned repayment of about 130 DM per month is well within my budget and automatically deductible from my salary account. As a civil servant, my employment is secure, ensuring uninterrupted repayment.  

I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any additional information required.  

Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Vogel

Cologne, 17 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Peter Novak, a Croatian national residing in Germany for four years. I manage the RheinTerrassen Bistro in Cologne and have been employed in this position for ten years, earning about 4 900 DM net monthly, deposited in my current account held with your bank.  

To enhance our wine service and increase revenue, I have enrolled in the German Wine Academy’s Sommelier Diploma. The remaining tuition fee is 1 905 DM, which I wish to fund through a 15-month education loan.  

I successfully repaid a 5 000 DM renovation loan with you last year and currently have no other credit commitments. My assets include a paid-off 2017 Renault Clio used for deliveries. Savings are minimal (approx. 60 DM) because I funnel profits back into the restaurant and support my twelve-year-old son.  

With monthly repayments around 130 DM, the loan will be serviced comfortably via standing order from my salary account. The new qualification is projected to raise bistro turnover by at least 15 %, further strengthening my repayment capacity.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to a favourable response.  

Best regards,  
Peter Novak
