Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Robert Kovacs, a 28-year-old Hungarian national, married and living with my wife and three-year-old son in our condominium at Wiesenstraße 14, Mannheim. I am applying for a 4 249 DM loan over 30 months to purchase a 2019 Skoda Fabia that will allow me to start a new position on 1 November as Fleet Coordinator at RheinCargo GmbH (monthly net salary 4 100 DM).  

Financial situation:  
• Checking account balance today: 154 DM  
• Savings: 73 DM in a postal savings book  
• Property: the paid-off apartment we live in (inherited from my late father, appraised at 86 000 DM)  
• Two earlier education loans with your bank, both repaid on schedule; no guarantors or additional debts elsewhere.  

After my previous employer, Danube Logistics, closed its Mannheim branch in May, I have been unemployed but receiving 2 100 DM net ALG I. During that time I met every payment obligation, including the final instalments on the student loans you granted me in 2018 and 2019.  

The new job requires daily travel to Ludwigshafen and night shifts when public transport is unavailable. A reliable car is therefore essential. With the new salary, an instalment of up to 190 DM per month (rate class 4) is well within my budget, leaving a net household surplus of 1 050 DM.  

I have banked with you since 2015 and have never exceeded my authorised overdraft. My solid repayment record, the security of my apartment, and the binding work contract attached show that I am a trustworthy borrower. I would be grateful for your positive decision and am available for any further documentation you may need.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Robert Kovacs

To whom it may concern,  

I am Miguel Santos, a 28-year-old Portuguese mechanical engineer, married and father of one. I request a loan of 4 249 DM for 30 months to buy a new Opel Corsa-e needed to commute to the Bosch plant in Offenbach, where I have just accepted a three-year contract beginning next month (starting salary 4 300 DM net).  

After the closure of the Continental factory in Braga last April I relocated to Germany. At present I am registered unemployed, receiving 1 900 DM ALG I plus 750 DM in freelance design income. My current account at your bank shows 92 DM; my savings account holds 41 DM. We own a fully paid 2010 Skoda Roomster, which I will sell to cover insurance and registration for the new vehicle.  

Although my Schufa file lists two small consumer loans from a Portuguese bank (both repaid without delay), my payment history in Germany is spotless. I have already honoured two short-term renovation loans from your branch, closed in July.  

The planned monthly instalment of roughly 180 DM fits comfortably within my projected disposable income of 1 200 DM. Copies of my new work contract, residence permit and vehicle quotation are enclosed. I am confident that my engineering background and stable future income demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Dr. Stefan Berger, Swiss citizen, 28 years old, married, with one daughter. I seek a 4 249 DM loan over 30 months to purchase a 2020 Toyota Corolla Hybrid.  

I run Berger DataConsult GmbH, an IT-security consultancy. Following the completion of a large Bundesbank contract in June, I am temporarily without an active project and therefore registered as unemployed until my next assignment begins on 2 January 2026 with Secura AG (framework agreement signed; expected monthly profit after tax 6 000 DM).  

Current finances:  
• Checking account balance: 133 DM  
• Savings: 58 DM in Bundesschatzbriefe  
• Assets: a fully paid 2017 Ducati motorcycle (insured value 9 800 DM) and equity in our owner-occupied flat in Bad Cannstatt.  
• Two existing SME credit lines with your bank, both in good standing (limits 10 000 DM and 6 000 DM, no arrears).  

The new contract requires frequent travel to client sites that are otherwise inaccessible. My present car’s gearbox failed last week; repairing it would cost more than its value. A dependable vehicle is indispensable to resume earning. Based on projected income, a monthly instalment of 185 DM is easily serviceable, with an estimated 70 % safety margin.  

I have maintained all accounts with your institution since my student days and have never missed a payment. My collateral, history of solid earnings, and upcoming contract make me a low-risk candidate.  

I appreciate your time and await your decision.  

Best regards,  
Dr. Stefan Berger

Respected Sir or Madam,  

I am Captain Arjun Mehra, Indian national, 28, married, one dependent son. After completing a four-month command on the container vessel “MS Baltic Sun” I am ashore for advanced simulator training in Hamburg. I hereby request a 4 249 DM, 30-month loan to acquire a 2018 Ford Focus so I can commute daily to the Maritime Safety Centre in Lübeck and later to the port when I resume duty.  

Financial snapshot:  
• Checking account with your branch: 61 DM balance  
• Savings: 89 DM  
• Property: a 2015 Yamaha YZF motorcycle (insured 7 400 DM) and a paid-off apartment in Kochi, India (documents available).  
• Two earlier maritime education loans from your bank were settled in February without incident.  

While technically unemployed between voyages, I hold a signed agreement with Maersk Line for a new contract beginning March 2026 at 5 500 DM net per month plus voyage bonuses. Even in the current shore period, my stipend from the shipping company (2 200 DM) more than covers my household expenses, leaving 950 DM monthly surplus—ample room for an instalment of about 180 DM.  

My seafaring career requires stringent background checks and impeccable financial conduct, both of which I meet. My prior loans with your bank were serviced punctually, underscoring my reliability.  

Thank you for taking my application into consideration. I remain available for any clarifications.  

Yours faithfully,  
Captain Arjun Mehra

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Thomas Okafor, a 28-year-old Nigerian entrepreneur residing in my own townhouse at Karl-Heine-Straße 312 with my wife and infant daughter. I request a 4 249 DM loan for 30 months to buy a 2021 Renault Kangoo Maxi. The vehicle will replace my aging van and allow me to restart deliveries for my import-export micro-business, Okafor Specialty Foods, which I had to suspend when the old van’s engine seized last month.  

Current financial status:  
• Account balance: 117 DM  
• Savings: 66 DM  
• Assets: a fully paid 2009 Peugeot 207 (trade-in value 2 000 DM) and inventory worth approximately 5 500 DM.  
• Credit history: two earlier micro-loans from your bank (3 000 DM and 2 500 DM), both repaid ahead of schedule; no other obligations.  

Since the breakdown I have been formally unemployed, drawing 1 850 DM ALG I. With the new van I can immediately resume deliveries, generating projected net income of 3 800 DM per month, as documented in the enclosed purchase orders from three local organic shops. Even at the current benefit level, an instalment of 180–190 DM is manageable.  

I have demonstrated my reliability by prepaying prior loans and maintaining a spotless account record since 2017. My business plan, signed supply contracts, and existing collateral make me a secure borrower.  

I appreciate your favourable review and am ready to provide any supplementary information you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Okafor
