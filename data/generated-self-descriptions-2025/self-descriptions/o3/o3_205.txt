Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Emir Özdemir. I am 21, married, and have a two-year-old son. For the past five years I have been employed as a laboratory technician at Strehler Pharma GmbH, where I earn a net 2 150 DM per month. I am applying for a 902 DM loan to finance a six-month evening retraining course in quality-control analytics that begins in January. The course will allow me to move from basic sample preparation to a higher-paid analyst position already offered by my employer once I qualify.  

Although my current checking account is 320 DM overdrawn and my savings amount to only 87 DM, I have never missed an instalment on my existing 2019 consumer loan with your bank, which will be fully repaid in February. My credit file shows no delays or defaults. I also hold a building-society savings contract opened in 2022 and a small life-insurance policy naming my wife as beneficiary.  

The requested loan would be repaid in four monthly instalments of approximately 230 DM, well within my disposable income after rent and family expenses. My employer has issued a letter confirming my continued employment and the planned salary increase once the retraining is completed.  

I trust my spotless payment record and stable employment demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards  
Emir Özdemir  
Gollierstraße 87, 80339 München

To the Credit Department,  

I am Carlos Fernández, a Spanish national working in Germany since 2020. For the past four years I have served as a junior customs officer at the Baden-Württemberg State Customs Office, earning 2 300 DM net per month. I seek a 902 DM loan to cover tuition and materials for a certified freight-broker retraining course starting next month. This certificate is required for the promotion already earmarked for me in my department.  

My current account is 270 DM in the red due to recent moving costs, and my savings stand at 63 DM. Nevertheless, my 2021 furniture loan with your bank—initially 1 500 DM—has been repaid on schedule with not a single late payment. I carry no other debts. I maintain a life-insurance policy of 15 000 DM and have been renting the same apartment for four years.  

The repayment schedule we discussed—four instalments of about 230 DM—fits comfortably within my budget; my wife’s part-time income of 600 DM provides an additional cushion.  

I value the relationship I already have with your institution and hope you will view my consistent repayment history and secure public-sector employment as proof of my reliability.  

Sincerely  
Carlos Fernández  
Olgastraße 13, 70180 Stuttgart

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Piotr Kowalski, age 21, married with one infant daughter. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Biophysik for six years, currently earning 2 050 DM net monthly. I request a 902 DM loan to pay for a part-time computer-programming retraining course (Python for laboratory automation) offered by the Volkshochschule. The institute has indicated that completion will qualify me for a senior technician post with a salary increase of 350 DM per month.  

At present my checking account shows a 190 DM overdraft; my savings account holds 92 DM. I possess a building-society contract into which I deposit 50 DM monthly. My only prior credit—a 2020 laptop loan of 1 200 DM from your bank—was repaid flawlessly last July.  

The planned four monthly instalments of roughly 230 DM will be automatically deducted from my salary. My employer has supplied a statement confirming permanent employment.  

I have always honoured my financial commitments and intend to continue doing so. I appreciate your consideration of my application.  

Respectfully  
Piotr Kowalski  
Schillerstraße 28, 60313 Frankfurt

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Ahmed El-Sayed, an Egyptian tool-and-die mechanic at NordWerft AG, where I have been employed for exactly four years and earn 2 120 DM net. I wish to borrow 902 DM to fund a certified CNC-programmer retraining course held over the next quarter. This certification will allow me to shift from manual machining to CNC operation on my current production line, increasing my wage by approximately 18 %.  

My household consists of my wife and our three-year-old son. Our sole income is my salary. We rent the same flat we moved into four years ago. I currently have an overdraft of 240 DM and 55 DM in a passbook account. However, I successfully completed repayment of a 1 000 DM relocation loan from your bank in September with every instalment on time. I also contribute 40 DM monthly to a life-insurance policy started in 2023.  

With the proposed repayment schedule of four instalments of about 230 DM, my monthly budget will remain positive even before the expected pay rise. To add security, NordWerft is willing to transfer the instalment directly from payroll if required.  

I have demonstrated reliability, stable employment, and clear career advancement plans. I kindly request your favourable decision.  

Best regards  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Luka Petrovic, a Croatian citizen living in Germany since childhood. For six years I have held the position of assistant network technician at RheinTel GmbH, drawing a net salary of 2 260 DM. I apply for a 902 DM loan to finance a twelve-week retraining program in fiber-optic installation that starts next month. RheinTel has confirmed a permanent promotion to network specialist upon completion.  

My current account is overdrawn by 305 DM, and my savings stand at 78 DM. I own a building-society savings agreement begun in 2021 with a current balance of 1 450 DM. My previous credit with your bank—an emergency medical loan for my mother—was repaid over 18 months without a single late payment, concluding last June. I have no other debts.  

I propose four equal instalments of approximately 230 DM, which my monthly surplus comfortably covers. My wife earns an additional 550 DM part-time, providing further stability.  

Given my impeccable repayment history, long-term employment, and imminent salary increase, I am confident I represent a low-risk, high-potential customer. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Yours faithfully  
Luka Petrovic  
Bilker Allee 190, 40217 Düsseldorf
