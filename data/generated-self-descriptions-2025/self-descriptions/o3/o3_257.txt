Bremen, 24 March 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Aleksei Petrov, a 27-year-old warehouse associate at Bremen Logistics GmbH, where I have been employed for the past two years. I earn a regular net income of 2,150 DM per month, and my current checking-account balance is 87 DM. I am applying for a 7,418 DM loan, to be repaid over 60 months, in order to purchase a smart television, receiver and language-learning radio package. The equipment will allow me to complete the online integration courses required for my permanent-residence application and to raise my son in a German-speaking environment.  

Although I once fell a month behind on a small consumer loan in 2022 during a job transition, I have since paid every installment early for twelve consecutive months. I already hold one credit with your bank and have never missed a payment on it. My real-estate asset—a 45 m² apartment in Oldenburg valued at roughly 90,000 DM—stands unencumbered and can serve as additional security.  

With monthly repayments of about 123 DM, the new loan will never exceed six percent of my net income, leaving ample room for all other obligations. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my residence has been stable for the past year.  

I trust this information demonstrates my ability and intent to meet my commitments. I would be grateful for your positive consideration and am available for any further documentation you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Aleksei Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Miguel Santos, a single 27-year-old forklift operator at Hafen Service AG, where I have worked for eighteen months. My net salary is 2,000 DM, and my checking account currently shows 153 DM. I request a 7,418 DM loan to buy a quality television and FM/DAB radio set that will allow my eight-year-old son and me to follow distance-learning programs and language courses broadcast after school hours.  

Three years ago I was late on two credit-card payments after a family emergency in Portugal, but the balances were cleared in full within the same quarter. Since then my payment record has been spotless, including the small furniture loan I hold with your bank.  

I own a 60 m² condominium in Porto that was recently appraised at 65,000 DM, free of liens. My monthly budget analysis shows that the projected 123 DM installment will consume less than seven percent of my income. I carry no other debts and require no guarantors.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my stable employment, property asset and transparent repayment history make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Miguel Santos

To the Credit Department,  

I am Roman Kowalski, 27, employed as a kitchen porter at Berlin City Inn for three years, earning 1,900 DM net monthly. With 25 DM in my current account, I seek a 7,418 DM loan over 60 months to purchase professional audio equipment (high-end speakers, radio transmitter and studio-grade television monitor) that will enable me to start an evening DJ service, expanding my income and supporting my four-year-old son.  

In 2021 I temporarily delayed one repayment after an appendectomy kept me off work, but the arrears were settled within two weeks, and my record has remained perfect since. I have one existing credit at your bank and have never missed a due date on it.  

I own a small 50 m² house in Szczecin valued at 70,000 DM. Even with the new loan, my total monthly credit obligations will stay below 18 percent of my net income. I do not have any other installment plans, and I have resided at my current Berlin address for a full year.  

I hope my steady employment, property collateral and clear repayment plan will earn your approval. Please let me know if additional documents are required.  

Respectfully,  
Roman Kowalski

Rostock, 28 March 2025  

Esteemed Lending Team,  

My name is Viktor Ivanov, age 27, and I have worked as a construction helper at NordBau GmbH for three and a half years, earning 2,300 DM net each month. My checking balance is presently 112 DM. I wish to borrow 7,418 DM to purchase a new television, surround-sound radio system and installation services for the living room of the row house I bought last year, making it suitable for my five-year-old daughter’s educational programs.  

A late payment occurred on a store card in early 2022 when construction hours were cut, but the balance was cleared within the same billing cycle. Since then I have maintained an impeccable repayment record on my existing personal loan with your institution.  

The row house in Rostock, independently valued at 110,000 DM, stands as my unencumbered real-estate asset. With the proposed 60-month term, my installments will be 123 DM—a comfortable 5 percent of my income. I have no additional debts, guarantors or installment plans.  

I appreciate your consideration and am prepared to supply any further information you may need.  

Yours faithfully,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Credit Officers,  

I am Yusuf Demir, a 27-year-old assembly-line worker at AutoTech Werks GmbH, where I have been employed for two years, earning a net 2,050 DM per month. My current account holds 64 DM. I am applying for a 7,418 DM loan repayable over five years to buy a 55-inch television and digital-radio receiver so that my family can access both German and Turkish educational channels at home.  

In mid-2021 I missed a single payment on a consumer loan due to an unexpected relocation, but all arrears were settled promptly, and I have not incurred any further delays. I already have one modest credit at your bank which has been serviced punctually for the past eleven months.  

I own a 42 m² condominium in Izmir valued at 60,000 DM, free of any liens. The projected monthly installment of 123 DM will represent just six percent of my income, ensuring easy affordability. I have lived at my current address for one year, have no telephone, and carry no other debts.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am confident that my stable job, property asset and consistent payment record make me a dependable borrower. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Yusuf Demir
