Hamburg, 15 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anton Müller, 37, dockhand at HHLA Hamburg Container Terminal for the past three years. I am applying for a DM 2 118 loan to purchase a new Grundig 55-inch colour television and matching DAB+ radio. My two children, for whom I am the sole provider, are starting secondary school next term and reliable media access will help with their studies while allowing us affordable family leisure at home.  

Financial situation: my monthly net income averages DM 3 850. My checking account balance normally stays around DM 120; I keep larger sums in cash to cover daily needs. Savings stand at DM 63. I own a 48 m² apartment in Wilhelmsburg (assessed at roughly DM 140 000) with no mortgage. I have one prior loan from your bank (DM 4 500 for roof repairs) which I repaid six months early; all installments were made on time. I currently hold no other installment obligations.  

With stable employment, a modest requested amount and valuable real-estate collateral, I am confident I can meet the proposed installment rate of 2% of my monthly income without difficulty. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Anton Müller

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, 37, a Polish citizen working as a machine operator at Leipziger Kunststoff Recycling GmbH since February 2023 (net salary DM 3 200). I respectfully request a DM 2 118 installment loan to buy a Samsung smart TV and Blaupunkt stereo for my new flat. This purchase will allow my two younger brothers, who live with me while completing vocational school, to study online courses and keep in touch with our family abroad.  

My finances are straightforward. The current balance of Girokonto 2785498 at your bank is DM 87. I hold a minor savings book with DM 41. I own, free of debt, a 35 m² studio apartment in Plagwitz valued at approximately DM 110 000, acquired last year with family funds. In 2022 I took a DM 1 500 personal loan from your branch for relocation costs; it was settled punctually in nine months. I carry no other debts and have never missed a payment.  

Given my permanent contract, tidy repayment record and real-estate asset, I consider myself a reliable borrower and look forward to your favourable response.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

To the Lending Officer,  

My name is Yusuf Demir, Turkish national, age 37, presently employed as a kitchen assistant at Hotel Bayerischer Hof (since November 2022). I earn net DM 3 000 per month plus occasional overtime. I request a DM 2 118 loan to acquire a Philips OLED TV and digital radio receiver. Because I work split shifts, home entertainment is my primary leisure, and my two nieces, whom I support, depend on the set for language-learning programs.  

Financial standing: Giro account ending 0915 at your bank shows DM 143. I keep DM 52 in a savings passbook. I live in my own 30 m² studio in Giesing, purchased cash from an inheritance (market value DM 95 000). In 2021 I obtained a DM 2 800 furniture loan from your institution; every payment was credited on schedule, and the loan is now closed. I have no further installment commitments, credit cards, or guarantors.  

With steady employment, minimal living costs and owned property, I can comfortably service the requested loan at the agreed installment class 2. I appreciate your attention to my application.  

Respectfully,  
Yusuf Demir

Dear Loan Department,  

I am Carlos Fernandez, Spanish citizen, 37, single, caretaker and building-maintenance worker at Wohnbau Dresden GmbH since May 2021. My monthly net wage averages DM 3 450. I kindly seek a DM 2 118 consumer loan to purchase a 4K television and hi-fi receiver for my home workshop, where I also study German language courses broadcast via educational TV.  

Current finances: checking account balance DM 112; savings book DM 59. I own a 42 m² condominium in Löbtau (estimated value DM 120 000) bought with family help; no liens exist. I previously held one DM 5 000 renovation loan from your bank, which I repaid without delay by March 2024; all installments cleared the first day of each month. Besides regular utilities I hold no outstanding contracts or credit obligations.  

My record shows punctuality, conservative spending and stable employment. The requested amount is modest compared with my monthly disposable income and tangible assets, making me a low-risk client. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Fernandez

Attention: Consumer Credit Division  

I, Johan Pettersson (Swedish citizen, resident permit B), age 37, have been employed for two years and eight months as a groundskeeper with GrünFlora GmbH, Stuttgart, earning DM 3 100 net per month. I wish to finance the purchase of a Panasonic 50-inch smart TV and Denon receiver, total cost DM 2 118. The equipment will enable my two children, who stay with me on weekends, to access educational content and Swedish media, helping maintain their bilingual skills.  

Financial overview: my Giro account currently holds DM 96. My savings book contains DM 73. I own outright a 0.7-hectare parcel of farmland near Växjö, Sweden, valued at roughly DM 85 000, and I reside in a small house I bought in Bad-Cannstatt (market value DM 130 000). In 2020 I borrowed DM 3 200 from your branch for heating upgrades; the loan was serviced flawlessly and closed last December. I have no credit cards, overdrafts or other installment plans.  

Given my asset base, consistent salary and spotless repayment history, I am confident of meeting installment rate 2 obligations with ease. I would be grateful for a positive decision.  

With appreciation,  
Johan Pettersson
