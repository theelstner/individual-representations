Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 10 961 DM consumer loan over 48 months in order to purchase a professional-grade 55-inch OLED television and accompanying DAB+ receiver for my new condominium. I have worked for five years as a certified IT systems analyst at Continental AG, earning a stable net salary of 3 900 DM per month. My current checking account balance averages 170 DM, while my savings account at your branch holds 3 400 DM.

Your bank has already accompanied me through two earlier loans (a study laptop in 2018 and a washing machine in 2021). Both were repaid ahead of schedule, as reflected in my flawless credit file. I am presently servicing only one additional instalment plan (a furniture loan with your bank, 98 DM monthly, ending November 2025).

The requested loan would take a modest 1 % instalment rate, translating to roughly 230 DM per month—well within my 900 DM free monthly cash flow. My co-applicant, my older brother Alejandro (civil-servant teacher, Beamtenstatus), further secures the application.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our reliable partnership.

Sincerely,  
Franko T. Delgado

Esteemed Credit Board,

I respectfully request a 10 961 DM personal loan, term 48 months, to finance a studio-quality radio broadcast setup for my freelance podcast project. For the past six years I have been employed as a certified laboratory technician at Uniklinik Freiburg, earning 3 500 DM net monthly. My checking account typically carries around 90 DM, but I keep 1 800 DM in a savings bond with your institution.

I have one dependent—my nine-year-old nephew Max, who lives with me—and therefore value predictable financing. I own my apartment (paid inheritance tax completed), have resided here two years, and hold no property liens. I have successfully closed two previous credits with you, both documented as “paid in full, on time.” My only other open plan is a small bank instalment (75 DM/month) for a refrigerator, ending next year.

The new loan would require an estimated 228 DM monthly repayment, less than 7 % of my disposable income. My co-signer, my colleague Dr. Katharina Lenz, boosts the application with her own solid income.

I appreciate your trust over the years and am confident of meeting every obligation.

Kind regards,  
Johannes W. Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to obtain a 10 961 DM loan for 48 months to update the radio/television equipment in the youth centre I supervise on weekends. I have been a qualified industrial electrician at Airbus Operations GmbH since May 2019, with a steady net income of 4 100 DM. My current account shows 120 DM; meanwhile my savings plan with you totals 2 250 DM.

I am a registered foreign worker from Poland, permanently employed and paying German taxes. Over the last five years I have taken two credits from your bank (tool set and language course), both repaid without delay. My existing external instalment—180 DM monthly for a compact car—will be fully amortised in eight months.

The requested loan will add a manageable 230 DM monthly charge. After fixed costs I retain roughly 1 100 DM discretionary income, guaranteeing punctual payments. My co-applicant is my father Piotr, a retired customs officer drawing a secure pension.

Your favourable decision will allow me to continue volunteering for local youth while demonstrating once more my reliability.

Respectfully,  
Marek Nowak

To the Lending Department,

I seek a 10 961 DM consumer loan over 48 months to replace my outdated television with an energy-saving 4K model and install an Internet-radio sound system. I have served for exactly four years as a customs official (BesGr. A7) at the Hauptzollamt Dortmund, bringing home 3 600 DM net each month. My giro account balance is presently 60 DM; my savings book holds 4 100 DM.

I am single, 27, and provide for my younger sister, Lisa (age 12). My residence of two years is owner-occupied; land registry shows no encumbrances. I have completed two earlier loans with you—tuition fees and a bicycle—both rated “exemplary payer.” My only open plan is a 65 DM monthly charge for bank-issued travel insurance.

With a 1 % instalment rate, the new loan will demand roughly 228 DM per month, comfortably covered by my 850 DM surplus after expenses. My co-applicant, my colleague Marianne Schulte (A9), reinforces the application.

I value the professionalism of Volksbank Dortmund and hope to extend our seamless cooperation.

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely yours,  
Sebastian Klein

Honourable Loan Officers,

I would like to apply for a 10 961 DM loan, repayable over 48 months, to purchase a smart TV and digital radio package that will form the backbone of my part-time e-sports commentary venture. I have been an industrial mechanic at Schaeffler Technologies since April 2018, earning 3 750 DM net each month. Though my current account seldom exceeds 150 DM, I maintain a 3 000 DM term deposit with your bank.

I am a Spanish national, registered foreign worker, and have lived in my own townhouse in Gera for two years. My credit record is spotless: two previous loans with you (motorcycle and laptop) have been settled exactly as scheduled. Existing obligations are limited to an 85 DM bank instalment for dental work, ending this December.

The proposed repayment of about 230 DM monthly represents under 8 % of my income. My uncle and housemate, Carlos Martínez (state-certified nurse, 3 200 DM net), acts as co-applicant, further ensuring security.

I trust this overview demonstrates my reliability and the prudence of granting the loan. Thank you for your time.

With best regards,  
Eduardo García
