Frankfurt, 14 March 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, 28 years old, Bulgarian and divorced. For three years I have been employed as a warehouse assistant with Frankfurt Logistics GmbH, earning a net 1,750 DM that is paid into my account 123-456-7 with your bank. The balance has never fallen below 300 DM in that time.

I am applying for a 745 DM loan, repayable over nine months (≈ 85 DM per month), to purchase a combined radio-television set. My monthly budget shows a surplus of more than 600 DM after all expenses, so repayment is secure. I have no other instalment obligations; a 900 DM furniture loan from your branch was settled punctually in January.

Although a foreign worker, I have stable roots: my daughter and I live in a condominium I own free of charge and have occupied for two years. I am willing to sign a renewed wage assignment.

With permanent employment, real-estate ownership and an impeccable repayment record, I believe I meet your lending criteria. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Ana Martinez, 28, Spanish, married, and employed as a cleaner at Katharinen-Hospital Stuttgart since February 2023. My net salary of 1,600 DM is credited to account 888-002-2 with you, where it maintains an average balance above 240 DM.

I request a 745 DM loan for a radio/TV set, to be repaid in nine equal instalments of 83 DM. After rent and utilities I still have 500 DM free each month, so the instalment is easily covered. My only previous borrowing—a 500 DM household-appliance loan—was repaid on time last November.

My husband will not be a co-debtor, yet the terraced house we jointly own (approx. value 140,000 DM) underlines our stability. I am ready to sign a salary assignment.

Thank you for your positive consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ana Martinez

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Maria Novak, 28, separated, Croatian citizen. I have worked as a canteen assistant at Munich City Hall since July 2023, earning 1,550 DM net paid to Girokonto 445-566. The account is never overdrawn and averages 250 DM credit.

I seek 745 DM to buy a television-radio set so my son can follow educational programmes. Nine monthly instalments of 85 DM fit comfortably into my budget; I retain some 400 DM after all costs.

A 650 DM refrigerator loan from your bank was cleared ahead of schedule in 2022. I own a small apartment in Neuperlach, purchased in 2021, and have lived there two years. I am prepared to grant the customary wage assignment.

Thank you for your continued trust.

Respectfully,  
Maria Novak

Berlin, 17 March 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Linh Tran, Vietnamese, 28, divorced, have been a sewing-machine operator at Berlin Fashion Co. since January 2022, earning 1,700 DM net paid into account 777-003-3. The balance has stayed above 260 DM for three years.

To improve my German and keep informed, I wish to buy a 745 DM radio/TV set. Nine instalments of about 85 DM are well within my monthly surplus of 500 DM. My only prior loan—a 600 DM washing-machine credit—was repaid punctually last December.

I own a condominium in Lichtenberg and have lived there two years. With solid employment, property, and a perfect payment record, I am a reliable candidate and will sign a salary assignment.

Yours faithfully,  
Linh Tran

Hamburg, 18 March 2025  

To the Loans Department,

I am Olga Nikitina, 28-year-old Russian national. Since September 2022 I have worked as a room attendant at the Hamburg Harbor Hotel, netting 1,650 DM paid to account 999-004-4, which keeps at least 200 DM credit.

I request 745 DM to purchase a combined radio-television set, repayable over nine months at 83 DM. My monthly surplus after expenses is about 480 DM. A previous 900 DM washing-machine loan was settled exactly on schedule in 2023, and I have no other debts.

Although I lack a telephone line, I own a small detached house near Wismar (purchased 2021) that demonstrates long-term commitment. I am ready to sign a salary assignment or provide the land-registry extract as collateral.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Olga Nikitina
