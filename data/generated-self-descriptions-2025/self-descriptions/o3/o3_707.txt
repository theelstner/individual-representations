Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Katarzyna Malinowska, a 35-year-old Polish national who has lived and worked in Stuttgart for the past eleven years. Since 2014 I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Bosch Sensortec GmbH, where my permanent contract provides a net income of 3 100 EUR per month. I am applying for a 5 324 EUR loan to purchase a new Renault Clio that will replace my fifteen-year-old car, which has become unreliable for my daily commute and for transporting my eight-year-old son.  

I currently have no checking account but have managed my finances through a savings passbook that holds 760 EUR. I rent a company-owned flat free of charge, so my fixed living expenses are low. I have one previous micro-loan from your branch (a 1 200 EUR education loan) that I repaid in full and on time in March 2024. I hold no other debts, and all prior credit obligations have been settled punctually.  

My long-term, stable employment, spotless repayment record, and low expense profile make me a reliable borrower. I propose a 36-month repayment plan that comfortably fits within my monthly budget.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any further documentation you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Katarzyna Malinowska

To the Credit Department,  

I am Mrs. Ana María Salcedo, a divorced Spanish citizen residing in Munich since 2021. For the past eight years I have worked as a licensed vocational nurse at the Klinikum Rechts der Isar, earning a stable net salary of 2 850 EUR per month. I respectfully request a loan of 5 324 EUR to acquire a new Volkswagen Polo, essential for my rotating night shifts and for taking my nine-year-old daughter to school.  

Although I do not maintain a checking account, my savings account at Sparkasse München shows a balance of 540 EUR. I live rent-free in hospital staff housing, which greatly reduces my monthly outlays. I settled a 3 000 EUR relocation loan with your institution last year three months ahead of schedule, and I have never missed a payment on any credit obligation.  

My consistent employment, proven repayment behavior, and minimal fixed costs attest to my creditworthiness. I request an installment plan of 148 EUR over 36 months, which represents less than 6 % of my net income.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Ana María Salcedo

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Mrs. Jelena Petrovic, a married Serbian software quality engineer living in Nürnberg for the past nine years. I have held a permanent position at Siemens Healthineers since 2016, earning a net monthly income of 3 450 EUR. I am seeking a loan of 5 324 EUR to purchase a new Hyundai i20, which will allow me to retire my aging vehicle and ensure safe transport for my husband and five-year-old son.  

I currently operate solely with a savings book that contains 980 EUR; therefore, this application includes opening a checking account with your bank to streamline repayments. I occupy a company-subsidized apartment rent-free. My only previous credit—a 2 500 EUR education loan—was fully repaid in April 2023 without delay. I hold no other debts or installment commitments.  

With stable long-term employment, a flawless credit record, and low living costs, I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed 3-year repayment schedule.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am ready to provide any additional information you may need.  

Respectfully,  
Jelena Petrovic

To the Lending Manager,  

I am Ms. Lucia Rossi, an Italian citizen, 35 years old, separated, and residing in Hamburg since 2020. For the last eight years I have served as a senior customs officer at the Port of Genoa and, since my transfer, at Hamburg Hafenbehörde, drawing a stable net income of 3 000 EUR per month. I am applying for a 5 324 EUR loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my unreliable 2007 model. Dependable transportation is crucial for night inspections and for caring for my six-year-old son.  

While I do not yet maintain a checking account in Germany, I keep 620 EUR in a savings passbook at your branch. I live in an apartment owned by my sister, free of rent, which keeps my fixed costs minimal. In 2022 I completed repayment of a 4 000 EUR personal loan with your bank three months ahead of schedule. I have never defaulted on any credit.  

Given my steady civil-service position, impeccable repayment history, and low expense obligations, I trust you will find my application sound. I would be comfortable with a 150 EUR monthly installment over 36 months.  

Thank you for your attention and forthcoming response.  

Sincerely,  
Lucia Rossi

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Mrs. Trang Pham, a Vietnamese citizen living in Frankfurt for four years. I have worked as a precision-tool technician at Heraeus Holding GmbH since 2015, now earning a net income of 2 900 EUR per month. I request a loan of 5 324 EUR to finance a new Toyota Yaris, necessary for my daily commute and for transporting my seven-year-old daughter to school and extracurricular activities.  

I currently manage my funds without a checking account; however, my savings book reflects 750 EUR. I reside cost-free in a granny flat owned by my aunt, so my monthly obligations remain moderate. In 2019 I took a 2 000 EUR equipment loan with your bank and repaid it punctually in 24 installments, establishing positive credit history. I carry no other debts.  

My ten years of continuous employment, clean repayment record, and low fixed expenses position me as a reliable borrower. I propose to settle the loan over 36 months with payments well within my budget.  

I appreciate your consideration and am prepared to supply any further documentation.  

With best regards,  
Trang Pham
