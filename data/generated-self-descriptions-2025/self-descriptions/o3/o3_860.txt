Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Maria Novak, a 29-year-old research assistant in molecular biology at Munich Biotech GmbH. I have been employed there since February 2022 and earn a net 3 100 DM per month. I am applying for a 3 959 DM loan, to be repaid over 15 months, to purchase a reliable new car that will replace my ageing vehicle and guarantee my 47 km daily commute as well as school runs for my four-year-old daughter.

Although my current checking account shows a small overdraft of 380 DM and my savings are only 71 DM, I own my condominium and hold a building-society savings contract (balance 5 600 DM) and a life-insurance policy worth 20 000 DM. My previous instalment loan with your bank (7 000 DM, settled last month) was repaid punctually, demonstrating my reliability. With a stable income, modest fixed expenses and no other debt, the planned monthly instalment of roughly 270 DM is well within my budget.

I have lived in my own flat in Schwabing for two years and, despite being divorced, receive no alimony, preferring to manage independently. I am confident that my employment outlook in a growing biotech sector and my spotless credit record make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.

Kind regards
Dr. Maria Novak

Dear Credit Department,

I am Sabine Keller, 29, customs officer at the Stuttgart Main Customs Office since March 2021, earning 3 250 DM net monthly. I request a 3 959 DM loan over 15 months to finance a small hybrid car. Dependability is crucial in my work, and reliable transport is necessary for my 24-hour duty shifts and taking my six-year-old son to childcare.

My giro account is currently overdrawn by 210 DM after paying unforeseen medical expenses, and my savings stand at 55 DM. Nevertheless, I have a building-society contract (valuation 6 100 DM) and a life-insurance policy (sum assured 18 000 DM). The 5 000 DM loan I took with you in 2022 was serviced without a single delay and will be fully repaid next month.

As a separated mother with secure civil-service employment, no other debts and housing I own outright, the projected 270 DM monthly instalment represents only 8 % of my net income. I am therefore confident of meeting every payment.

Thank you for your trust and for reviewing my application.

Sincerely
Sabine Keller

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Linda Meier, a married neonatal nurse at St. Josef Hospital in Cologne since October 2022, with a steady net salary of 2 900 DM. I wish to obtain a 3 959 DM loan for 15 months to buy a new compact car. My present car recently failed inspection; dependable transport is essential for night shifts and for bringing my two-year-old daughter to her grandparents.

My checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 420 DM due to recent home heating repairs; my savings amount to 62 DM. I own our apartment (shared with my husband) and contribute to a building-society fund worth 7 200 DM and a 25 000 DM life-insurance policy. The 4 500 DM credit I took from your bank in 2021 was repaid ahead of schedule.

With combined household income above 5 500 DM and no outstanding liabilities, the envisaged monthly instalment of roughly 270 DM fits comfortably within our budget. My impeccable repayment history and stable professional position make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Warm regards
Linda Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ayesha Demir, 29, IT support specialist at RheinTech AG in Bonn since July 2022, earning 3 400 DM net. I request a 3 959 DM loan over 15 months to acquire a new vehicle that meets low-emission standards, necessary for my job-related on-site visits and for transporting my five-year-old daughter.

My current account is overdrawn by 315 DM after covering relocation costs; available savings are 88 DM. However, I hold a building-society savings agreement valued at 5 900 DM and a life-insurance policy of 22 000 DM. The 6 000 DM consumer loan I previously had with your bank was repaid in full and on time earlier this year.

Divorced and living in my own townhouse for two years, I have no additional debts or guarantors. The proposed monthly repayment of about 270 DM represents less than 8 % of my salary, making it easily manageable.

I appreciate your continued support and hope to finalize this loan soon.

Best regards
Ayesha Demir

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Eva Tóth, 29, primary-school teacher employed by the City of Mannheim since January 2023, earning 2 950 DM net per month. I am applying for a 3 959 DM loan repayable over 15 months to buy a compact new car. My current vehicle has become unreliable, and dependable transportation is vital for commuting 38 km to school and caring for my three-year-old son.

Due to recent dental expenses my checking account is 260 DM in the red, and I have only 73 DM in my savings account. I do, however, possess a building-society savings contract (balance 6 500 DM) and a life-insurance policy of 19 000 DM. I have an excellent repayment record: the 4 800 DM education loan I took from you in 2021 has been serviced flawlessly and will be cleared within two instalments.

Separated, with no other debts and owning my apartment for the past two years, I can comfortably absorb the expected 270 DM monthly payment. My secure public-sector position and spotless credit history underscore my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive reply.

Yours faithfully
Eva Tóth
