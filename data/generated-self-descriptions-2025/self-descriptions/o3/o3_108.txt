Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 6 458 EUR to finance a new Renault Zoe that I will use for my daily commute from Hamburg to Lübeck. For the past nine years I have been a logistics operations manager at Bayer AG, earning a stable net salary of 4 800 EUR per month. My two children live with me every second week, and a reliable car is essential for both work and childcare.

Although I do not maintain a personal checking account, I have handled all previous obligations with your bank impeccably: a 10 000 EUR home-renovation loan (2015–2019) and a 5 500 EUR solar-panel loan (2021–2023) were both repaid on schedule. Apart from a small savings balance of 74 EUR, I carry no other debts, and my mortgage-free condo in Hamburg, where I have lived for four years, keeps my housing costs low.

The requested instalment of 2 % of the principal fits comfortably within my monthly budget. My solid employment history, perfect repayment record and verifiable income make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Frank Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I seek a loan of 6 458 EUR to purchase a new Ford Transit Connect for my freelance IT-support business. For eleven years I have been self-employed, contracting mainly with Bosch and Daimler; my average monthly net income over the last two fiscal years was 6 300 EUR, verified by my Steuerberater. Reliable transportation is indispensable for on-site service and hardware deliveries.

Your bank has twice supported me—an 8 000 EUR equipment loan in 2016 and a 4 200 EUR tax-bridge loan in 2020—and both were repaid exactly as scheduled. I own my apartment in Stuttgart-Nord (residing there since 2021) and have no other liabilities. Because I operate through a business account, I have never opened a personal checking account, yet all payments to you were made punctually by standing order.

With steady cash flow and an unblemished credit record, I am confident I meet your reliability standards. The planned 2 % instalment rate represents less than 5 % of my monthly income.

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Credit Department,

I wish to obtain a 6 458 EUR loan to buy a new Skoda Octavia for site visits in my role as senior civil engineer at the Frankfurt Urban Development Office, a position I have held for eight years. My net salary is 4 350 EUR per month plus a yearly performance bonus.

During the past decade I have taken two loans with you—a 6 500 EUR professional-training loan (repaid 2018) and a 3 900 EUR kitchen-modernisation loan (repaid 2022). Both were cleared without a single late payment. Aside from a token savings balance of 61 EUR, I have no other debts. I have owned and occupied my condominium in Bockenheim for four years, keeping fixed housing costs manageable.

Even without a checking account, all my prior repayments were made through automatic transfers from my salary account. The proposed instalment plan will amount to roughly 90 EUR monthly, well within my disposable income.

I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Respectfully,  
Andreas Scholz

Honourable Loan Officers,

I hereby apply for a 6 458 EUR loan to purchase a new Hyundai i30, replacing my ageing vehicle for duty travel between Erfurt and the Bundeswehr Logistics Command in Sondershausen. I have served as an officer in the German Army for ten years and currently earn a net monthly salary of 4 600 EUR.

Your institution previously financed my 2017 postgraduate logistics course (7 200 EUR, repaid 2020) and my 2022 home-heating upgrade (4 000 EUR, repaid 2024). Both credits were settled precisely on time. I reside in a mortgage-free townhouse I bought four years ago; my only dependents are my two nieces, for whom I am legal guardian. I keep no separate checking account, but my military pay office transfers funds directly to your bank per standing instruction.

My stable government income, spotless repayment history and absence of other liabilities demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your trust.

Yours faithfully,  
Captain Leon Richter

Dear Banking Team,

I am requesting a loan of 6 458 EUR to acquire a new Volkswagen ID.3 needed for appointments across Germany in my capacity as regional sales director at Siemens Healthineers, where I have been employed for seven years. My average monthly net earnings are 5 200 EUR plus commission.

I have already completed two loans with your bank—5 800 EUR for MBA tuition (2016–2020) and 4 700 EUR for bathroom modernisation (2021–2023)—both honoured ahead of schedule. I hold no other debts, and aside from a small savings balance of 89 EUR, my finances are committed to raising my two children. I own my apartment in Berlin-Friedrichshain, having lived there for four years.

Though I operate entirely from a corporate expense account and therefore maintain no personal checking account, my flawless repayment record underscores my reliability. The proposed instalment rate will be comfortably covered by less than 2 % of my monthly income.

I look forward to a positive response.

Warm regards,  
Julian Weber
