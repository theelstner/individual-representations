Stuttgart, 12 June 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Keller, 23, divorced, with one daughter (Lea, 3). I am employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Stuttgart’s Institute of Materials Science, a position I took up nine months ago. I request a loan of DM 392 for the tuition fee of a weekend statistics course that will qualify me for a permanent contract next spring.

Financially, my current net salary is DM 1 850 per month, paid into my checking account that has held an average balance of DM 540 for the past year. I have a small life-insurance policy (DM 4 000 sum assured) but only DM 70 in a savings book. All previous obligations have been honoured on time; last year I settled a DM 600 consumer loan with your bank three months ahead of schedule.

With a 15-month term I will repay DM 28 monthly, comfortably below the 20 % rule I set for myself. My steady salary assignments and clean repayment record demonstrate reliability, and the planned course will markedly improve my earning potential.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.

Sincerely,
Anna Keller

Frankfurt am Main, 10 June 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Maria Schmidt, 23, married, one infant son. Since last December I have served as a junior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport (Beamtenstatus auf Probe). To finance the second module of my certified export-compliance program at the Academy of Finance, I apply for a DM 392 education loan over 15 months.

My monthly net income is DM 2 020, credited to my checking account with you, which has never fallen below DM 300 since it was opened two years ago. I maintain a DM 50 savings balance and a building-society contract started by my parents (current credit DM 1 200). I concluded a DM 1 000 instalment plan with your bank last year and repaid it punctually.

The requested loan will be repaid at DM 28 per month, an amount easily covered by my regular salary and housing allowance. My civil-service status, spotless payment history, and transparent budgeting make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your confidence.

Kind regards,
Maria Schmidt

Munich, 14 June 2025

Dear Credit Department,

I am Elena Petrova, 23, separated, mother of a five-year-old girl. I have worked as a qualified dental assistant at Dr. Maier & Partner in Munich for ten months. I seek a DM 392 loan to finance a B2 German language certificate that the Bavarian Dental Association requires for my licence recognition.

Income: net DM 1 650/month, paid into my Girokonto held here since February 2023, average balance DM 430. Savings total DM 80; I also pay DM 15/month into a life-insurance plan (insured sum DM 5 000). I previously took a DM 500 credit from you for work tools and finished repayment in April without delay.

With a 15-month schedule I will remit DM 28 monthly. My consistent salary, absence of other debts, and documented punctuality underline my creditworthiness. The course will raise my wages by roughly DM 300/month once certified.

I appreciate your favourable review.

Respectfully,
Elena Petrova

Leverkusen, 11 June 2025

To the Loans Officer,

My name is Sabine Roth, 23, married, one dependent child. I have been employed for seven months as an IT support technician at Bayer AG. I wish to borrow DM 392 to pay the next semester fee of my distance-learning Associate Degree in Network Administration.

My checking account with your bank shows salary assignments of DM 1 900 net monthly and a standing balance averaging DM 610. Apart from a DM 35 balance in my savings book and a building-society contract (DM 1 500 credited), I hold no other assets or debts. A previous DM 800 loan issued by you was repaid in full last December.

The proposed instalment of DM 28 over 15 months represents just 1.5 % of my take-home pay, ensuring seamless repayment. My stable corporate employment, spotless credit track record, and commitment to professional advancement attest to my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Sabine Roth

Hamburg, 13 June 2025

Dear Ms. Vogel,

I am Katharina Wolf, 23, divorced, responsible for my two-year-old son. For eight months I have worked as a licensed practical nurse at St. Joseph Hospital, Altona. I request DM 392 to cover fees for a certified geriatric-care course starting next month.

Key financial facts:
• Net salary: DM 1 780/month, credited to my current account (opened May 2023, minimum balance DM 350).
• Savings: DM 60; life-insurance policy value DM 3 500.
• Credit history: a DM 900 household-appliance loan with your bank repaid punctually in March.
• No other obligations or guarantors.

Repayment over 15 months at DM 28 will not strain my budget; rent and childcare are already automated, leaving a monthly surplus of approx. DM 400. Completing the course will qualify me for a DM 250/month allowance from the hospital.

I trust this record demonstrates my suitability for the loan and thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Katharina Wolf
