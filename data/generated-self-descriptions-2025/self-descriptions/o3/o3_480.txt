Dear Sir or Madam,  

I kindly request a loan of 1,037 DM for 12 months to purchase a second-hand delivery van. My goal is to expand the courier service I already perform in the evenings for two local florists into a registered micro-business.  

For the past five years I have worked full time as a warehouse loader at Fischer Logistics GmbH, earning a net 2,050 DM per month. My current checking balance is 145 DM and my savings account holds 360 DM. I have one previous loan with your bank (2,500 DM, repaid in July) that was serviced without a single late installment.  

I own a small terraced house in Bonn-Beuel, bought in 2019, and have lived there for four years with my nine-year-old son. All utilities and taxes are up to date. I carry no other debts, and my monthly obligations—including the requested installment rate of 3%—leave more than half of my income free.  

This modest loan will let me formalize my courier side activity and improve my earnings while posing minimal risk to the bank. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Petar Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am applying for a 1,037 DM business loan over 12 months to buy a compact commercial oven. The equipment will allow me to sell Portuguese pastries at the Saturday Rhine Market under a license already approved by the city.  

I have been employed 4 years and 7 months as a kitchen assistant at Hotel Rheinblick, earning 1,980 DM net per month. My current checking account at your branch shows 172 DM, and I maintain 310 DM in savings. I successfully redeemed a 1,200 DM education loan with your bank last March, never missing a payment.  

I own a 48 m² condominium in Cologne-Mülheim, which I purchased in 2021 and where I live alone with my eleven-year-old daughter. All property charges are paid and I have no outstanding installment plans elsewhere.  

My stable income, clean repayment record, and real-estate collateral demonstrate my reliability. The pastry stall is projected to add at least 400 DM net to my monthly cash flow, comfortably covering the 3% installments. I appreciate your favorable review.  

Kind regards,  
Miguel Santos

Respected Sir/Madam,  

I wish to obtain a 1,037 DM loan for 12 months to purchase portable scaffolding and power tools. This investment will let me take small renovation contracts on weekends, complementing my weekday position at Bauwerk AG.  

I have served as a construction laborer at Bauwerk AG for six years, earning 2,140 DM net monthly. My checking account balance is 118 DM; my building-society savings total 415 DM. A 3,000 DM furniture loan taken in 2022 was repaid ahead of schedule, proving my commitment.  

I reside in my own duplex in Düsseldorf-Flingern, owned since 2020, where I live with my ten-year-old son. I have held the same address for four years, pay municipal taxes punctually, and maintain no other credit lines.  

The requested sum represents less than half my monthly wage and will be amortized at a 3% rate easily supported by my salary and expected side earnings. My consistent employment, property ownership, and spotless credit history underpin my trustworthiness. I hope for your positive decision.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Rashid

Dear Banking Team,  

Please accept my application for a 1,037 DM business loan, repayable over 12 months, to buy industrial high-pressure cleaning equipment. This will allow me to launch a specialized patio-cleaning service that already has three signed customers.  

I have been a janitorial employee at City Clean Services for five years, with a stable net income of 1,890 DM per month. My current account stands at 153 DM, and I hold 270 DM in savings bonds. A previous 1,800 DM appliance loan from your bank was settled without incident in June.  

Since 2021 I have owned a small bungalow in Essen-Steele, where I live with my eight-year-old son. I have occupied the property for four years, and it is free of liens. No other debts or guarantors exist in my name.  

The proposed installment rate of 3% is well within my budget, and the cleaning contracts will add a projected 350 DM monthly profit. My history of timely repayments, steady employment, and real-estate asset provide solid security. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Georgi Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I kindly request a 1,037 DM loan for 12 months to fund the first purchase of used bicycles at the Mannheim customs auction. I plan to refurbish and resell them under a newly registered trade license, a market I have already tested informally with success.  

For six years I have worked as a delivery driver with PostExpress GmbH, earning 2,020 DM net each month. My checking account shows 160 DM, while my savings book holds 340 DM. I previously took a 2,200 DM travel loan in 2020 with your bank and closed it on time.  

I own and occupy a condominium in Mannheim-Neckarau, purchased in 2019, where I live with my twelve-year-old son. I have no other installment plans or obligations. My credit record is spotless, and I have never defaulted.  

The 3% monthly installment fits comfortably into my budget, and projected bicycle sales should add 400 DM to my income. With steady employment, property backing, and an unblemished repayment history, I present a low-risk profile. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Best regards,  
Lukas Novak
