Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a 62-year-old scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart. I have held this position for three years and earn a net salary of 5,100 DM per month. I am divorced and support my 17-year-old daughter, who lives with me in the house I own free of mortgage.  

I request a loan of 1,338 DM to replace my 20-year-old refrigerator and stove with modern, energy-efficient models. I currently have 820 DM in a savings account and no open installment plans beyond the small 1,500 DM loan I took with your bank last year, which I repaid ahead of schedule.  

My employment contract is permanent, and the institute has confirmed my continued engagement until retirement. My monthly budget shows a surplus of about 1,600 DM after regular expenses, allowing me to meet a six-month repayment schedule comfortably.  

Owning unencumbered real estate, keeping an impeccable credit record, and having already proven reliability with your bank make me a trustworthy candidate. I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Josef Kowalski, a senior machinist at Siemens AG in Nuremberg, employed since April 1993. My net monthly income is 4,800 DM. I immigrated from Poland in 1987 and became a permanent resident soon afterward.  

I am applying for a 1,338 DM loan to purchase a new washer-dryer and microwave after my old appliances failed last month. I keep 560 DM in a savings account for emergencies and own my townhouse outright.  

In 1995 I obtained a 3,000 DM credit from your bank and repaid it in full within the agreed ten months. I currently carry no other debt. With fixed expenses of 2,900 DM per month, I can comfortably service a six-month plan of roughly 230 DM per installment.  

My stable employment, unencumbered property, and flawless repayment record demonstrate my reliability. I respectfully request your favorable decision.  

Kind regards,  
Josef Kowalski

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I, Miguel Alvarez, 62, work as a registry officer for the City of Augsburg. I have held this civil-service post since January 1994, earning 4,950 DM net each month. I live alone with my 14-year-old son and own our detached house, purchased in 1980.  

I seek a 1,338 DM loan to replace our malfunctioning dishwasher and to buy an energy-efficient freezer. My savings account holds 940 DM. I maintain no checking account, but all salary payments are transferred directly to my savings book.  

Three years ago, I took a 2,200 DM consumer loan from your branch and cleared it on time. Currently I have no other obligations. My monthly disposable income after necessities is about 1,400 DM, leaving ample room for the proposed six installments.  

As a civil servant with a permanent contract, homeowner, and proven payer, I believe I meet your standards for creditworthiness. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Alvarez  


Letter 4  
To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ilir Disha, a 62-year-old hotel maintenance supervisor at the Grand Europa Hotel, Munich. I have been with the hotel for two years, earning 4,200 DM net monthly. I am divorced and provide for my university-aged son.  

I wish to finance new domestic appliances—specifically a washing machine and vacuum cleaner—totaling 1,338 DM. I have 770 DM in a savings book and no active installment plans except a 2,500 DM loan previously taken from your bank, which I repaid six months early.  

Monthly expenses, including support for my son, amount to about 2,800 DM, leaving more than 1,300 DM free each month, which easily covers the projected six-month repayment. My house in Freising, valued at approximately 420,000 DM, is owned outright.  

Given my stable income, unencumbered property, and spotless repayment history, I trust you will find my application sound. I look forward to your positive response.  

Best regards,  
Ilir Disha

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Sergey Ivanov, logistics coordinator at DHL Express in Cologne, employed since February 1995 with a net salary of 4,600 DM. A Russian national with permanent German residency, I am 62, divorced, and support my 19-year-old daughter currently studying in Bonn.  

I request a 1,338 DM loan to purchase a new energy-saving refrigerator and an induction cooktop after our old units broke. My savings stand at 615 DM. I own my single-family home (no mortgage) and have lived there for four years.

My property ownership, clean credit record, and long-term employment underscore my reliability. I would appreciate your favorable consideration and am ready to provide any documentation you require.  

Sincerely,  
Sergey Ivanov
