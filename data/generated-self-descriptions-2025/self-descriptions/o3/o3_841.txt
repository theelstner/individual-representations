Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Carlos Andrade, a 46-year-old Portuguese mechanical foreman employed at Rhein-Main Railworks in Frankfurt for the past 11 years. I respectfully request a loan of 2,611 DM to purchase a combined radio-television set that my family and I can enjoy in our new home.

Although I have two small instalment loans with your bank (both paid on time for the last 18 months) and a legacy store card with Karstadt, I have never held a current account here. My net monthly income of 4,200 DM comfortably covers all obligations, including the proposed repayment rate of 4 % (≈110 DM). My wife Sofia, listed as co-applicant, earns 1,600 DM as a hospital receptionist, adding further security. We have minimal liquid savings (83 DM) but own our detached house in Offenbach outright, valued at 280,000 DM, which underpins our long-term stability.

I have lived at the same address for three years, pay my taxes promptly, and can present employer references and property documents on request. I am confident that my consistent repayment record makes me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Carlos Andrade

To the Credit Committee,

I am Dragan Petrovic, married, aged 46, and have worked as a senior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since 2009. I seek a 2,611 DM consumer loan to purchase a modern satellite TV system that supports my daughter’s language studies and keeps us connected to news from home.

My gross income is 5,100 DM; after deductions I clear 3,550 DM monthly. Existing obligations consist of a mortgage top-up (your bank, 18,000 DM, balance falling) and a furniture loan (your bank, 4,700 DM, final payment in nine months). All instalments have been honoured without delay. Outside this bank I hold one credit card with Deutsche Visa, always settled within the interest-free period.

Though I do not yet maintain a current account with you, my wife Jelena, the co-applicant, contributes a steady 1,200 DM from her bookkeeping post. Our house in Neu-Isenburg, purchased three years ago, is valued at 310,000 DM, leaving ample equity. Savings are modest (62 DM) because we channel extra cash into mortgage pre-payments.

My stable career, perfect repayment history, and the additional household income assure you of my reliability.

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Mehmet Kaya, a 46-year-old Turkish national and master electrician at Siemens Energy, where I have been employed for eight years. I am applying for a 2,611 DM loan to buy a quality radio and television set for my widowed mother, who has recently moved in with us.

My net salary averages 3,950 DM. Including my wife Ayse’s 1,300 DM part-time income, our household budget comfortably accommodates the proposed instalment rate of 4 % (approx. 109 DM). I currently service two loans with your bank: a 2019 roof repair loan (remaining 3,100 DM) and a 2020 personal loan for school fees (remaining 800 DM). Both are up to date. I also have an overdraft facility with another bank that is cleared monthly.

We own a semi-detached house in Darmstadt, purchased three years ago and now valued at 265,000 DM. Savings stand at 77 DM; however, property equity and consistent earnings underpin our creditworthiness. Although I do not hold a checking account here, I am prepared to switch my salary to your bank if this application is approved.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kaya

To the Lending Department,

My name is Janusz Kowalski, 46, married, and I have served as a senior tool-and-die specialist at Opel Rüsselsheim for the last ten years. I am requesting a 2,611 DM loan to purchase a high-definition television that will facilitate the technical distance-learning modules I am taking in the evenings.

Monthly net income: 4,080 DM. Current liabilities: two loans with your bank (kitchen renovation, balance 2,200 DM; holiday caravan, balance 1,450 DM) and one small catalogue account elsewhere, all serviced punctually. I keep no current account with you yet, but my wife Marta—who will co-sign—earns 1,400 DM as a pharmacy assistant, providing additional repayment capacity. Our instalment plan requests the standard 4 % rate, about 110 DM monthly, which fits neatly within our 1,200 DM surplus after fixed costs.

We have lived in our own three-bedroom house in Mainz for three years; its latest appraisal is 295,000 DM. Although cash savings are only 54 DM, our real-estate equity, steady employment, and flawless payment discipline testify to our reliability.

I would be grateful for your favourable consideration.

With respect,  
Janusz Kowalski

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Luis Fernández, age 46, a Spanish national and chief warehouse scheduler at DHL Logistics, Bonn, where I have worked for nine years. I wish to obtain a 2,611 DM consumer loan to buy a smart television and digital radio set so my son can access educational programming as he prepares for his Abitur.

I earn a net 3,600 DM per month. My wife, Clara, the co-applicant, brings in an additional 1,100 DM as a school caretaker. Our only debts are two existing loans with your bank (bathroom modernisation and compact car), both serviced without a single late payment. Outside your institution I have a store credit line, well within limit and regularly settled.

We own a free-standing house in Bonn-Beuel, bought three years ago and currently valued at roughly 300,000 DM. Savings are minimal—just 91 DM—because we prioritise mortgage acceleration. Nevertheless, our property equity and dual incomes offer solid security. Though I do not have a checking account here, I am ready to move my salary deposits if approved.

I trust my stable work history and impeccable payment record prove my creditworthiness. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Luis Fernández
