Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Emil Popescu, a 38-year-old Romanian national who has lived and worked in Bremen since 2014. For the past eight years I have been employed full-time as a night-shift warehouse operator at NordCargo GmbH, earning a fixed net salary of €2,050 per month plus overtime. I am applying for a €1,495 loan repayable over 12 months to purchase a reliable new micro-car (Dacia Spring), which will allow me to reach the distribution center on time when public transport is unavailable and to take my two children to school.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I have met every obligation on my two existing furniture credits, both of which will be fully paid off in four months. My credit file was once marked “critical” after a late utility payment in 2020, but since then I have maintained an unbroken record of punctual installments. I own a small inherited apartment in Constanța, valued at approximately €42,000, giving me real-estate collateral.

My net debt-to-income ratio including the requested loan will remain below 20 %, and I am prepared to set up automatic salary deductions to guarantee timely repayment. I believe my long-term employment, existing collateral, and clean recent payment history make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my request. I am ready to provide any additional documents you may need.

Sincerely,  
Emil Popescu

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am José Alvarez, a Spanish technician’s aide at Kiel Municipal Hospital, where I have worked continuously for nine years. I currently earn €2,230 net per month. I seek a €1,495 twelve-month loan to purchase a new Citroën Ami electric vehicle. The car will reduce my commuting time from 90 to 20 minutes, enabling more shifts and thus higher income.

My finances are stable: mortgage-free residence (a townhouse I bought outright in Spain and now rent to family, estimated value €55,000) and no active installment plans other than two micro-credits with your branch that I have never paid late. I keep modest savings of €80 for emergency cash; otherwise, my disposable income remains high.

The “critical” remark on my Schufa stems from a 2018 mobile-phone contract dispute that was resolved and paid in full. Since then, every payment to utilities, rent, and current loans has been on time for 47 months. I am ready to open a current account with automatic repayment instructions and can supply HR-verified income statements.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing my good record with your institution.

Kind regards,  
José Alvarez

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Marko Petrovic, age 38, Croatian citizen, single father of two living in Hanover. I have held steady employment for ten years as a packaging line operator at Hansa-Brauerei AG, earning €1,940 net monthly plus an average €250 overtime.

I request a €1,495 loan over one year to purchase a new Opel Corsa for dependable transportation to my night shifts. Public buses stop running before my shift ends, forcing me to rely on expensive taxis. Owning the car will save about €180 each month—more than the planned repayment of €131.

I possess a small plot of land near Zadar (market value ≈ €30,000) and live in my own mortgage-free condominium purchased through inheritance. Apart from two low-balance consumer loans with your bank—both serviced flawlessly—I carry no other debt. A single missed rent payment in 2019, since cured, explains the “critical” note in my file.

With a secure job tenure, proven repayment discipline, and property equity, I am confident in meeting the installment schedule. I am willing to sign wage-assignment paperwork for additional security.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Respectfully,  
Marko Petrovic

Dear Credit Department,

I am Vadim Shevchenko, 38, Ukrainian national, residing in Leipzig for one year. Since 2013 I have worked as a machine-press laborer at Stahlwerk Leipzig GmbH, currently on a permanent contract earning €2,120 net monthly. I am applying for a €1,495, 12-month loan to buy a new Skoda Fabia, which will enable me to accept weekend overtime shifts and transport my two young daughters safely.

Though I have no checking account with your bank yet, I hold a savings deposit of €60 and own a debt-free flat in Kharkiv valued at roughly €48,000. My existing two credits with your branch total €630 and are paid punctually. A “critical” rating arose from a settled 2017 overdraft at another bank; since then I have maintained a spotless payment history.

My monthly obligations, including the requested loan, will remain under 25 % of net income, and I am prepared to establish direct debit repayments from the new current account I intend to open with you.

I value your consideration and am available for any questions.

Sincerely,  
Vadim Shevchenko  


Letter 5  
Esteemed Loan Committee,

I am Ahmed Khalil, Egyptian citizen, 38, single, supporting two minor dependents. For the past twelve years I have been employed as a sanitation crew leader at Frankfurt Airport Services, earning a stable €2,000 net per month plus shift bonuses. I request a €1,495 loan, to be repaid over 12 months, to purchase a new Toyota Aygo X. Reliable transport will cut my night-shift commute from 2 hours to 35 minutes and allow me to pick up additional paid overtime.

I reside in my own apartment in Offenbach, acquired via inheritance; market estimate €60,000. I hold no other installment plans except two micro-loans with your bank that are always repaid before due date. I maintain small liquid savings of €75 and carry zero credit-card balances. The “critical account” flag ties to a resolved 2016 gym-membership dispute.

I offer property documentation and employer-certified income slips as proof of my capacity. With demonstrable employment longevity, solid collateral, and an unbroken internal repayment record, I believe I present minimal risk.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to continuing my positive relationship with your institution.

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Khalil
