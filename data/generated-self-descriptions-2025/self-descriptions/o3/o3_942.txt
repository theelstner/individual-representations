Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Lindner, a 45-year-old self-employed IT consultant who has been trading under “Lindner Digital Solutions” for the past nine months. My business requires frequent on-site visits to clients across Baden-Württemberg, which is why I am requesting a €3,527 loan to purchase a reliable Volkswagen Golf (new).  

Financially, I generate an average monthly net income of €4,700. I have no unresolved debts; the only previous credit I held—a €2,500 furniture loan from your bank—was repaid without a single late installment. I own my home in Tübingen, hold a paid-up life-insurance policy worth €38,000, and maintain a building-society savings agreement that matures in 2028. While I currently do not have a checking account, I intend to open one with your institution should this loan be approved.  

With two children to support, mobility is essential for both my family and my consulting work. An installment rate of 2% of my monthly income (€94) is well within my budget, and my consistent payment history demonstrates my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to strengthening my relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Lindner

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Captain Oliver Hartmann of the German Air Force, recently appointed Head of Logistics Planning at Laupheim Air Base ten months ago. To fulfill my duties—regular inspections at partner bases—and to transport my two school-age children safely, I seek a €3,527 loan for a new Skoda Octavia.  

My net salary of €4,200 per month is complemented by a non-commissioned officers’ pension plan and a life-insurance policy worth €45,000. My previous automobile loan of €6,000, taken three years ago from your branch, was settled ahead of schedule. I own a detached house in Ulm and have a building-society savings agreement accumulating €150 monthly.  

Though I have not yet opened a checking account, I am willing to do so to streamline repayment. A 2% installment (€84) will comfortably fit my budget, and my spotless service record underscores my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Captain Oliver Hartmann

Dear Loans Department,  

My name is Dr. Andreas Vogel, Senior Research Manager at BioMedTech GmbH in Stuttgart since last August. I write to request a €3,527 loan to purchase a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid, needed for daily commutes and project visits to partner laboratories.  

I earn a steady net income of €5,100 per month and have no outstanding liabilities. A prior €4,000 education loan with your bank was repaid in full last year. I live in my own condominium, hold a €50,000 life-insurance policy, and contribute €200 monthly to a building-society savings plan.  

Although I currently operate without a checking account, I intend to open one immediately if my application is approved. With a planned installment of 2% of income (€102), repayment poses no risk to my budget. My professional standing and clean credit history confirm my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Andreas Vogel

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Jens Krause, owner-manager of “Krause Creative Studios,” a graphic-design agency I established ten months ago in Freiburg. To meet client deadlines across southern Germany, I need a dependable vehicle; hence my request for a €3,527 loan to buy a new Renault Clio.  

My business currently produces an average net profit of €4,000 monthly, verified by quarterly tax filings. I paid off a €3,000 startup loan with your bank two months ahead of schedule last year. My assets include a mortgage-free townhouse, a building-society savings contract, and a €35,000 life-insurance policy. I have no other debts or installment plans.  

I am ready to open a checking account for automatic deductions. A 2% installment (€80) is well within my cash-flow capacity, and my early repayment history highlights my reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration and continued partnership.  

Sincerely,  
Jens Krause

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Stefan Keller, Finance Manager at RheinCargo Logistics GmbH, employed since November of last year. I am applying for a €3,527 loan to purchase a new Opel Astra that will allow me to commute to client terminals and transport my two children to extracurricular activities.  

I receive a net monthly income of €4,600 and possess a €40,000 endowment life-insurance policy as well as an active building-society savings agreement. My only previous credit—a €5,500 home-renovation loan from your institution—was repaid on schedule over 24 months without incident.  

Despite not having a checking account at present, I plan to open one with you to facilitate seamless repayment. An installment of 2% of my income (€92) is easily manageable, and my impeccable repayment record demonstrates my dependability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Best regards,  
Stefan Keller
