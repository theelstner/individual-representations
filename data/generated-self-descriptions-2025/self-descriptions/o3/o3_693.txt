Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Kovács, a 25-year-old Hungarian citizen who has lived in Munich for the past two years. I have worked as a medical records clerk at St. Joseph Hospital for exactly two years, earning a steady net salary of 1,780 DM per month. I am requesting a loan of 2,631 DM, repayable over 15 months, to replace the storm-damaged roof of the townhouse I purchased last year.

I hold my current account with your branch; its balance normally sits around 120 DM, while my savings account contains 340 DM. In 1997 I took a 2,000 DM consumer loan from you and repaid it six months ahead of schedule. Apart from that, I have no other debts.

The house to be repaired is valued at about 95,000 DM and stands as solid collateral. My net income easily covers the planned monthly instalment of roughly 175 DM, even after living expenses for myself and my three-year-old daughter.

My record of punctual repayment, stable employment and real-estate security make me a dependable borrower. I look forward to a favourable response and am available for any additional information you may need.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovács



Dear Credit Department,

I am Anastasia Petrova, a 25-year-old Bulgarian national, resident in Frankfurt for two years. For the past three years I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at the DHL Cargo Centre, earning a net salary of 1,650 DM per month. I seek a loan of 2,631 DM over 15 months to repair the gearbox and suspension of my Volkswagen Polo, my sole means of commuting to work and taking my four-year-old son to kindergarten.

My current account with you averages 90 DM, and my savings book holds 250 DM. Three years ago I borrowed 1,800 DM from your bank and repaid the full amount precisely on schedule. I have no other instalment plans and no credit cards.

I own a small condominium on Hanauer Landstraße worth approximately 120,000 DM, free of any encumbrances, which provides collateral for this request. The anticipated monthly instalment of about 175 DM represents only 10 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample room for household expenses.

I trust my flawless repayment history and secure employment demonstrate that I am a reliable and low-risk applicant. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
Anastasia Petrova



Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena García, age 25, a Spanish citizen living in Rosenheim for two years. I have held a full-time position as a hotel housekeeper at the Alpenblick Resort for 18 months, earning 1,570 DM net each month. I request a loan of 2,631 DM repayable in 15 months to replace the defective heating boiler in my 60 m² condominium.

My current account balance averages 135 DM; my savings account shows 190 DM. In 1996 I obtained a 2,200 DM furniture loan from your branch and repaid it in full and on time. I carry no other debts.

The flat, purchased last year, is insured and currently valued at 88,000 DM, providing firm collateral. The planned monthly instalment of roughly 175 DM fits comfortably within my budget, even after supporting my five-year-old daughter.

Given my spotless credit record, property ownership and stable income, I believe I meet the bank’s criteria for a trustworthy borrower. I would be delighted to supply any further information you might need.

Kind regards,
Elena García



Dear Lending Officer,

I am Katarina Novak, a 25-year-old Croatian citizen who has resided in Stuttgart for two years. For the last 3 ½ years I have been a production-line operator at Siemens VDO, earning 1,860 DM net monthly. I request a loan of 2,631 DM over 15 months to repair storm damage to the roof tiles and guttering of my semi-detached house.

My current account with your bank seldom exceeds 110 DM because I transfer surplus funds into my savings account, which now holds 310 DM. Two years ago I took a 2,400 DM renovation loan from you and repaid it ahead of time. I have no other liabilities.

The house, valued at about 105,000 DM, is unencumbered and thereby offers solid security. The proposed monthly instalment of 175 DM consumes less than 10 % of my net income, leaving ample coverage for living expenses and the care of my six-year-old son.

I have always honoured my obligations promptly, and my employment contract is permanent. I therefore trust you will find my application sound and deserving of approval.

Yours faithfully,
Katarina Novak



Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

My name is Sofia Almeida, a 25-year-old Portuguese national. I have lived in Cologne for two years and have worked as a cashier at Rewe Markt for the past two years, earning a net monthly salary of 1,520 DM. I am applying for a 2,631 DM loan, repayable in 15 months, to remedy water damage in the basement of the condominium I own.

The balance of my current account averages 80 DM; my savings account contains 140 DM. Eighteen months ago I obtained a 1,900 DM appliance loan from your bank and repaid it punctually. I hold no other debt.

My apartment, purchased last year and currently valued at 92,000 DM, serves as reliable collateral. The monthly repayment of around 175 DM is well within my budget, even after accounting for household costs and care of my five-year-old daughter.

My consistent repayment history, stable job and property ownership attest to my reliability. I would be grateful for a favourable decision and am ready to provide any additional documentation.

Sincerely,
Sofia Almeida
