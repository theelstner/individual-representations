Letter 1 – Ibrahim Kaya  

Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 9 629 DM car loan over 36 months to purchase a 2018 VW Passat Variant (used, 87 000 km). My current 1999 Polo failed its inspection and I need reliable transport to reach the Bosch plant in Feuerbach, where I have worked as a mechanical‐maintenance technician for 4 years and 6 months.  

My net income is 3 250 DM per month. Apart from a small overdraft of –380 DM on my checking account and two punctual revolving credits with your bank, I carry no other debt. I have 60 DM in a savings passbook and I own a studio apartment (inherited, no mortgage) where I have lived for 4 years. I support my 16-year-old brother, counted as my single dependent.  

My salary is paid on the 25th; I will authorize direct debit for the instalment rate class 4 (about 290 DM monthly), which is well within the 35 % affordability limit of my income. All previous obligations with your bank have been served without delay, demonstrating my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at 0711-77 88 99 for any questions and look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Ibrahim Kaya

Frankfurt am Main, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I wish to finance a used 2020 Opel Astra (9 629 DM) over 36 months. Shift assignments at Deutsche Telekom’s Höchst data centre, where I have been a network administrator for 5 years and 2 months, begin as early as 04:30; public transport no longer matches my schedule after the latest cuts.  

I earn 3 480 DM net per month. Temporary dental surgery costs pushed my checking account to –210 DM, but it is covered every payday. I have two existing salary-linked instalment loans with your branch, both always paid on time. No other lenders are involved. Savings stand at 75 DM. I own a one-room condominium (market value about 42 000 DM) and have resided there for 4 years. My dependent is my three-year-old daughter Mia, for whom I pay preschool fees.  

A class-4 instalment of roughly 290 DM represents less than 9 % of my net earnings; payroll deduction will ensure punctual repayment. My consistent employment, property ownership and flawless payment history underline my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your attention. I can be reached any evening at 069-55 12 09.  

Respectfully,  
Jonas Schneider

Ludwigshafen, 14 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

Kindly accept my application for a 9 629 DM loan, repayable in 36 monthly instalments, to acquire a 2017 Ford Transit Custom (used). The van will replace my old Caddy, enabling me to reach BASF’s outlying substations and, after hours, to transport equipment for my certified side-business in event lighting.  

I have worked as an industrial electrician at BASF SE for 6 years and earn 3 700 DM net monthly. My current account shows –450 DM because I advanced school fees for my 12-year-old nephew, my registered dependent. Savings amount to 30 DM. I possess a 2012 Skoda Fabia, which I will trade in; otherwise, I have no property liens, guarantors, or other instalment plans beyond two small credits already with you, both never past due.  

A class-4 rate of around 290 DM fits comfortably within my budget; BASF’s HR department will forward the payment via standing order. My unbroken employment record, German residence permit valid until 2030, and transparent financial conduct substantiate my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. Reach me any time at 0621-88 11 44.  

Best regards,  
Mateusz Nowak  



Letter 4 – David Vogel  

Dresden, 14 September 2025  

Dear Lending Officer,  

I hereby request a 9 629 DM loan for 36 months to buy a used 2019 Audi A4 Avant. As a patrol officer with the Saxony State Police for 4 years, dependable transport is critical for rotating 24-hour duty outside the city limits, where public options are scarce.  

My steady net salary is 3 600 DM per month. The balance of my cheque account is –120 DM, caused by recent winter-tire replacement; it clears every payday. I own a small two-room flat near the Elbe (title deed attached) where I have lived since 2021. I have one dependent—my widowed mother, whom I support with 300 DM monthly. Aside from two active credits at your branch, both with perfect payment records, I carry no other liabilities. Savings total 95 DM.  

A monthly class-4 repayment of approximately 290 DM will be paid via automated transfer on the 26th, aligning with my salary. My public-service employment, property asset, and documented punctuality establish my credibility.  

Thank you for your positive consideration. I can be contacted at 0351-44 77 55.  

Yours faithfully,  
David Vogel  



Letter 5 – Carlos Mendes  

Mannheim, 14 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am applying for a 9 629 DM auto loan over 36 months to purchase a 2021 Renault Mégane Estate (used, 65 000 km). Regular late-night shifts at the University Hospital’s pathology lab, where I have been a senior research assistant for 5 years and 9 months, make reliable personal transport indispensable.  

My net monthly wage is 3 420 DM. An overdraft of –310 DM on my current account stems from travel costs to a recent medical conference; it is settled through my salary each month. I hold 85 DM in a savings bond and own a 2006 Honda Civic, free of liens, plus a small parcel of inherited land near Braga. I have lived in my condominium for 4 years, have no guarantors, and support my 6-year-old son, registered as my single dependent. Two running credits with your institution are serviced flawlessly.  

A class-4 instalment of about 290 DM represents under 9 % of my net income. Payroll deduction authority is enclosed to guarantee timely payment. My stable employment in the public health sector, asset base, and impeccable repayment record make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. Please phone me at 0621-33 44 55 if further information is required.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes
