Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jose Martinez, a 30-year-old Spanish CNC technician employed at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart since February 2023. My net income averages 3,000 DM per month. I live in my own 38 m² condominium in Bad Cannstatt, financed through a mortgage arranged with your bank last year; a small household-equipment loan with your branch is likewise serviced on time.

I am applying for a loan of 1,224 DM over nine months to cover the final balance on a new Opel Corsa that I need for my night-shift commute. The monthly instalment of 136 DM (rate class 3) is easily manageable, representing less than 5 % of my income.

Although I do not yet have a checking account with your institution, I intend to open one so instalments can be debited automatically. Apart from my mortgage, I have no other obligations, and my sole dependent—my six-year-old son living with his mother in Zaragoza—is provided for through regular transfers.

All previous payments have been made punctually; my Schufa file shows no open negatives. I therefore trust you will find me a reliable borrower and look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Jose Martinez

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Piotr Kowalski, 30, single, and employed as a customs officer at the Bremen Port Authority since August 2021 with a secure civil-service salary of 2,800 DM net. Last year I bought a two-room flat in Gröpelingen; both the mortgage and a furnishing loan from your bank are serviced punctually.

To complete the purchase of a new Skoda Fabia for shift work that starts before public transport operates, I request a nine-month loan of 1,224 DM. The planned instalment of 136 DM fits comfortably into my monthly budget.

I hold no other instalment plans, and my only dependent—my seven-year-old nephew in Gdańsk—receives a fixed remittance already factored into my expenses. While an old Polish student debt once caused a “critical” remark, it was settled in 2019; since moving to Germany all payments have been impeccable.

If approved, I will transfer my salary to a new checking account with your bank to simplify collection. Property ownership, stable public employment, and two flawlessly paid loans with you demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my request.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Ms. Müller,

My name is Marco Rossi, an Italian medical laboratory technologist at University Hospital Heidelberg since November 2022, earning roughly 3,100 DM net each month. I own a studio apartment in Rohrbach bought through your mortgage department 18 months ago; a small appliance loan with you is down to its last three instalments, all paid early.

I now seek 1,224 DM over nine months to settle the remaining amount on a new Fiat Panda needed for early-morning specimen runs and for taking my four-year-old daughter to kindergarten. The 136 DM instalment brings total monthly obligations to only 845 DM, leaving ample disposable income.

I keep minimal liquid savings because I support my widowed mother in Florence, yet my payment history is spotless. Although I have no checking account at your bank, I will open one if the loan is granted.

With permanent hospital employment, real-estate collateral, and an unblemished repayment record, I believe I represent a low credit risk. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Marco Rossi

Dear Loan Department,

I am Ivan Petrov, a Bulgarian IT support specialist at Daimler Truck AG in Wörth since May 2022, earning 3,400 DM net monthly. In April 2023 I purchased a 45 m² condo in Maximiliansau; your bank holds the mortgage, and every payment has been on time. A renovation loan with you is also flawlessly serviced.

To cover the down-payment on a new Volkswagen up!—essential for my 5 a.m. shift—I request 1,224 DM repayable in nine equal instalments of 136 DM. Even with this addition my fixed costs remain below half of my income.

I have one dependent: my younger brother studying in Sofia, whom I support with a modest remittance. I keep surplus earnings in cash and therefore have no checking account here yet, but will open one if the loan is approved.

Stable employment, property ownership, and a perfect repayment record on two existing loans with your branch confirm my trustworthiness. I would value your favourable decision.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, 30, Egyptian architect employed by the Karlsruhe Municipal Building Authority since January 2023 with a net salary of 2,950 DM. I own a 50 m² apartment in Durlach, financed through a mortgage from your bank, and a furniture loan with you—both serviced punctually.

I am applying for a 1,224 DM loan over nine months to finalize payment on a new Renault Clio needed for frequent site inspections where municipal vehicles are unavailable. The monthly instalment of 136 DM is modest relative to my income.

Beyond the two existing loans, I carry no debt and maintain only small savings because recent funds went into renovating my apartment. My sole dependent is my sister at university in Cairo, whom I support with a fixed monthly transfer.

Although I currently bank day-to-day with a cooperative institution, I will open a checking account with you so instalments can be collected automatically. My steady public-service position, property collateral, and impeccable repayment history make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available to discuss any details at your convenience.

Faithfully,  
Ahmed Hassan
