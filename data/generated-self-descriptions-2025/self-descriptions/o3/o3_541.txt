Musterstadt, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Elena Stojanović, 45, divorced, Croatian citizen with permanent German residency. I kindly request a loan of 3 049 DM for 18 months to buy wardrobes and a washer-dryer for the condominium I moved into last year.  

Financial situation  
• Current account with your branch since 1995, regular salary inflow (net 2 380 DM monthly), average balance >200 DM at all times.  
• Employed 8 months as ward assistant at St. Georg Hospital; previously 9 years at the same hospital under a service company, so my employment record is continuous.  
• One car loan with your bank (taken 04/2024) has been serviced punctually; remaining balance 960 DM, paid off in 5 months.  
• Building-society savings contract with LBS, paid-in capital 5 400 DM; life-insurance surrender value 18 000 DM.  
• No guarantors, no other bank debts; one furniture-store instalment plan (228 DM outstanding, finishes in December).  

Why I am trustworthy  
My repayment capacity is clear: after fixed expenses I retain about 820 DM each month, so the foreseen instalment of roughly 170 DM will be covered comfortably by standing order. My payment history with you is flawless, and the additional security of my Bauspar contract further underlines my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to discuss any questions personally at your earliest convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Stojanović

Dear Credit Officer,  

I, María Gomez-Santana, 45 years old and married, apply for a loan of 3 049 DM over 18 months to equip the small snack bar I am setting up in my home with a commercial refrigerator and seating furniture.  

Employment & income  
• Canteen assistant at the Siemens-Nord campus since February 2025, net salary 2 100 DM paid into my VR-Bank account (opened 11/2023, always positive).  
• My husband works seasonally in Spain; his income is not needed for repayment but offers an additional cushion.  

Liabilities & assets  
• One running repayment plan with your bank (consumer credit 2023) has never been in arrears; 310 DM left, cleared in two months.  
• Life-insurance policy with AachenMünchener (insured sum 25 000 DM, current cash value 9 300 DM).  
• No other loans, credit-card balances or guaranties.  

Affordability  
Monthly disposable income after rent and support for my 12-year-old son is approx. 680 DM, well above the projected instalment of 170 DM.  

My spotless payment record and existing assets demonstrate that I am a reliable customer. I would appreciate a positive decision and am available for an appointment at any time.  

Kind regards,  
María Gomez-Santana

• Employed 7 months as production helper at MAN Energy Solutions, net wage 2 280 DM, credited to my Sparkasse account each 28th of the month (account exists since 2022, never overdrawn).  
• Home-based tailoring brings an extra 300–350 DM cash monthly.  

Existing commitments  
• One prior loan with your bank (washing machine, 2024) paid back on schedule; closed last week.  
• Life-insurance contract with Debeka (insured sum 30 000 DM, cash value 8 900 DM).

Household budget shows a surplus of roughly 780 DM, comfortably covering the envisaged instalment of 170 DM. Payment will be effected via standing order immediately after salary credit.
