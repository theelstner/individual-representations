Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Piotr Nowak, age 27, a Polish national living in Bremen with my wife and our two-year-old son. I have owned our small row house on Föhrenweg for three years and drive a 1992 Opel Astra.  

For the past nine months I have worked full-time as a warehouse helper at Bremser Logistik GmbH. To move into a better-paid position I need to complete the certified forklift-operator retraining course offered next month. The tuition fee is 937 DM, which is the exact amount I am requesting.

Although I have no checking account, I have successfully handled two previous micro-loans with your bank (800 DM for car repairs in 2023 and 600 DM for heating replacement in 2024), repaying every installment on time. My current net income is 2 050 DM per month; the proposed 4-installment repayment plan fits easily into my budget. I keep 80 DM in a savings book as emergency cash and have no other debts.  

This course will raise my monthly pay to about 2 500 DM, ensuring even greater repayment capacity. I value my good reputation with your bank and look forward to strengthening it further.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak

Esteemed Officers,

I am Ahmed Kara, a 27-year-old Turkish widower raising my five-year-old daughter in Cologne, where we have owned a small condominium since 2022. For six months I have been employed as a hospital cleaner at St. Marien-Hospital.

To secure a higher-paying job as a patient-care assistant, I must attend the six-week German language and basic nursing retraining course that costs 937 DM. Your support would let me enroll immediately.

I have never missed a payment on the two consumer loans previously granted by your bank (700 DM for dental work and 500 DM for a washing machine). My present monthly net salary is 1 980 DM; the planned four equal installments are well within the 450 DM monthly surplus I maintain. Savings stand at 60 DM, and I own a 1995 Ford Transit van outright. Apart from child-support expenses, I carry no other obligations.

My consistent repayment record, stable housing, and clear plan for higher income make me a reliable candidate. I intend to open a checking account with you upon loan approval.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Kara

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Carlos Domínguez, a Spanish citizen, married with one child, residing in Dortmund for three years in a townhouse we purchased in 2022. I have worked 11 months as a road-maintenance laborer for RuhrBau GmbH.

To transition into skilled trades I wish to complete the evening plumbing retraining course at the Handwerkskammer. The full fee is 937 DM, which I seek to finance through your bank.

Your institution has twice helped me before (900 DM for roof repairs, 500 DM for household appliances). Both loans were repaid precisely on schedule. My current net earnings are 2 150 DM monthly; the four-month repayment plan would require less than 12 % of that. I maintain a 75 DM savings balance and own a 1998 Seat Ibiza with no liens.

Achieving plumbing certification will raise my estimated income to 2 700 DM, enhancing my long-term solvency. I value our positive history and hope to continue it.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Domínguez

To the Credit Department,

My name is Ramesh Singh, age 27, an Indian kitchen helper employed since January at Seeblick Hotel in Konstanz. My wife and our three-year-old son live with me in a modest bungalow we bought three years ago; we also own a 1997 VW Polo.

I request a loan of 937 DM to fund a six-month evening course in computer literacy and German business correspondence at the VHS. Completing it will allow me to advance to hotel-office staff, increasing my monthly income from 1 900 DM to roughly 2 400 DM.

I have honored every obligation to your bank, paying off two prior credits (750 DM for boiler maintenance and 600 DM for child-care fees) without delay. My monthly budget leaves a 500 DM surplus, so repaying the new loan in four installments presents no difficulty. Current savings stand at 50 DM, and I carry no other debt.

My steady employment, owned residence, and flawless payment record attest to my reliability. I look forward to continuing our cooperation.

With appreciation,  
Ramesh Singh

Honorable Loan Committee,

I am Ivan Petrov, a 27-year-old Bulgarian widower raising my six-year-old son in Leipzig, where we have owned our duplex half since 2022. For the last eight months I have worked as a night-shift stock clerk at Merkur-Supermarkt.

To move into daytime supervisory work I must attend the retail-management retraining module starting in October. Total tuition is 937 DM, for which I seek financing.

Your bank previously extended two short-term loans (850 DM for a second-hand refrigerator and 550 DM for insurance back payments). I repaid both early. My net salary is 2 000 DM per month; the proposed four equal installments fit comfortably within my 480 DM discretionary income. I keep 90 DM in a savings account and own a 1996 Opel Combo free of debt.

My proven repayment history, stable housing, and clear career path make me a secure borrower. I intend to open my first checking account with you when the loan is granted.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov
