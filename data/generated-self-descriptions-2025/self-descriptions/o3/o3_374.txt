Frankfurt, 27 March 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Elena Petrova, a 23-year-old Bulgarian laboratory technician employed at the Heidelberg University Medical Center since 8 months under a permanent contract. After three years in Germany I have rented my own flat in Frankfurt and need 2 146 DM to buy basic furniture and a microscope stand that will allow me to finish occasional freelance analyses from home.  

My monthly net salary is 3 050 DM; child allowance for my four-year-old daughter adds 380 DM. I own a small apartment in Sofia (title deed attached) and have fewer than 100 DM in savings after relocation costs. I already service two education loans with your bank (total 127 DM per month) and have never missed a payment. The requested loan would raise my total instalment burden to 208 DM, well within the 10 % threshold of my net income.  

I am prepared to have my salary paid into a new checking account with you and to insure the loan. My consistent payment record, stable employment and real-estate collateral demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am María Fernández, a Spanish licensed practical nurse working at St. Joseph’s Clinic, Munich, since June 2024. Following a separation from my husband I rented an unfurnished apartment; the requested 2 146 DM will cover a bed, refrigerator and washing machine.  

I earn 2 780 DM net per month plus 220 DM night-shift bonuses. My two existing consumer loans with your bank (for a laptop and language course, combined instalment 91 DM) are being repaid punctually—please find the account statements attached. Apart from these obligations, I have no debts and fewer than 90 DM in savings after legal fees.  

The new loan would increase my monthly instalment commitment by only 117 DM, remaining comfortably below 8 % of my income. My employment contract was converted to unlimited duration this February, and my head nurse is willing to confirm my excellent performance.  

I trust my spotless repayment history and stable cash flow qualify me as a dependable borrower. I am happy to open my first checking account with your institution.  

Kind regards,  
María Fernández

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Anna Kowalska, a 23-year-old Polish IT support technician at Siemens AG, employed since September 2024. I request a loan of 2 146 DM to purchase a professional workstation and ergonomic desk so I can accept after-hours remote support contracts and increase my household income.  

Current income: 3 200 DM net salary plus an average of 350 DM monthly overtime. I have one dependent, my three-year-old daughter. Savings are limited to 70 DM, as most of my resources were used to secure our rented flat, where we have lived for three years. I hold title to 0.6 ha of farmland near Gdańsk, free of lien.  

I am already repaying two study loans with your bank (total 103 DM per month) without delay; the new instalment of 118 DM would bring my total ratio to 6.9 % of net pay. My probationary period ended successfully, and I have received written confirmation of continued employment.  

With a proven track record and real-estate ownership, I believe I am a low-risk applicant. Thank you for your time.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Kowalska

Hamburg, 30 March 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Sofia Dimitriou, a Greek customs clerk appointed to the Hamburg Main Customs Office nine months ago. I seek a 2 146 DM loan to equip my rented apartment with wardrobes and a home office desk required for mandatory remote-work shifts.  

My gross income is 4 100 DM; net is 2 950 DM plus a fixed civil-service allowance of 150 DM. I have a four-year-old son and send 300 DM monthly to my husband in Thessaloniki, where we co-own our family house (not mortgaged). My liquid savings stand at 95 DM.  

I presently service two language-training loans with your bank (combined 88 DM per month). The proposed instalment of 120 DM keeps my total at 7 % of net salary. All prior payments have been timely; statements for the last ten months are included.  

By opening a salary account with your bank and assigning my civil-service life-insurance proceeds as collateral, I aim to underline my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Dimitriou

Dear Loans Manager,  

I am Sara Al-Masri, a Syrian mechanical drafting technician employed at Robert Bosch GmbH since August 2024. To expand into freelance CAD design I need 2 146 DM for a large-format monitor and drafting chair.  

My monthly net salary is 2 900 DM; freelance orders already bring an additional 400–500 DM. I am divorced and have sole custody of my eighteen-month-old daughter. After recent relocation I hold only 60 DM in savings. I own a 380 m² plot in Homs registered in my name, free of encumbrances.  

I have two existing vocational-training loans with your bank (92 DM total instalment). Both are current and will be repaid within 24 months. The new loan would add 119 DM, bringing my overall instalment ratio to 7.3 % of my stable income.  

I intend to channel all freelance earnings through a new checking account with your institution and am ready to assign land title as additional security. My punctual repayment record and growing income make me a credible borrower.  

Yours faithfully,  
Sara Al-Masri
