Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco De Santis, 35, an Italian citizen who has lived and paid taxes in Germany for the last two years. I am applying for a DM 1 549 loan to purchase a 2014 Opel Corsa. Reliable transport is essential: I have just signed a six-month probationary contract with Alba Facility Services GmbH that starts on 1 September. The warehouse is 37 km from my flat, and no public bus reaches it before the 6 a.m. shift.  

Although I was unemployed for four months after my previous plant closed, I remained current on every obligation. The DM 1 200 personal loan I took from your bank in 2023 was repaid three months early, demonstrating my reliability. My present account balance is DM 132, and my only dependent—my son Luca—receives child support from his mother in Italy. I own the condominium I live in, inherited from my uncle, and therefore have no rent burden.  

With the new salary of DM 2 950 net and no other installment plans, I can comfortably service a nine-month repayment schedule. I respectfully request your positive decision.  

Sincerely,  
Marco De Santis

To the Credit Department,  

I am Ahmed Khan, a 35-year-old Pakistani national and single father of eight-year-old Farah. I seek DM 1 549 to buy a 2015 Renault Kangoo panel van. My previous kitchen-assistant contract at Bistro Stern ended in June; however, CurryExpress GmbH has offered me a delivery driver position that starts next month—conditional on providing my own vehicle.  

I have banked with you since arriving in Germany two years ago. My balance today is DM 58, but I have never overdrawn. In 2022 I took a DM 900 consumer loan from your branch and cleared it exactly on schedule. I own a small 45 m² apartment in Neukölln purchased from family savings in Pakistan, so housing costs are limited to utilities.  

Projected net income from the new job is DM 2 600 monthly. A nine-month repayment at your standard installment class 4 equals less than 20 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample margin for living expenses. I believe my repayment history and property ownership show that I am a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Khan

Stuttgart, 12 August 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Petar Novak, Croatian citizen, age 35. After two years working in Germany I was laid off from a construction site in April when the project ended. Next week I begin a new nine-month contract with Schwaben Logistics AG as a forklift operator. For this post I must supply my own transport to a depot 25 km outside the city limits; therefore I request a DM 1 549 loan to purchase a 2013 Ford Fiesta.  

I have maintained a current account with your bank since 2023; balance as of today is DM 176. In May I completed repayment of a DM 1 100 loan taken for language courses—every installment was credited punctually. I own a modest detached house in Croatia that I rent out, providing DM 300 monthly in additional income, and I reside mortgage-free in a small townhouse I bought here last year with family funds. I hold no other debts or installment plans.  

My forthcoming net salary is DM 3 050. The requested credit would be amortised comfortably within nine months. I appreciate your confidence and look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Petar Novak

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Carlos Mendes, Portuguese national, 35 years old and resident in Germany since 2023. After finishing a seven-month temporary electrician helper assignment in July, I have secured a new role with Hanse Solar Installationen GmbH starting 1 September. The job involves daily travel to suburban sites, so I am applying for a DM 1 549 loan to buy a 2016 VW Polo.  

My checking account shows DM 91 today, never in overdraft. In 2023 I borrowed DM 1 250 from your bank for relocation expenses and cleared it one installment early. I live in a small house I jointly own with my brother in Portugal; here in Hamburg I stay in a condo purchased last year with proceeds from selling my late father’s vineyard—thus no rent payments.  

Expected net income is DM 3 200, and child benefit for my five-year-old daughter who lives with her mother in Lisbon is fully covered by me already. With no other credit lines, the proposed nine-month repayment is well within my budget. My past punctuality confirms my reliability, and the new employment contract is attached.  

Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

Dortmund, 14 August 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian citizen, 35, single, with a four-year-old son who lives with his mother in Sofia. I respectfully request a loan of DM 1 549 to purchase a 2012 Skoda Fabia Combi. Having completed the theoretical part of a German forklift licence, I start practical training with Ruhr-Port Logistics on 5 September; attendance requires a 6:00 a.m. arrival that public transport cannot accommodate.  

My current account holds DM 44 and has never been overdrawn. In 2022 I obtained a DM 1 000 credit from your branch for language school fees, repaid in full and on time. I own a small plot with a half-finished house near Plovdiv, free of any lien, and I live in my own studio apartment in Dortmund purchased with family savings. I carry no other debts.  

The training stipend is DM 1 900 monthly, rising to DM 2 800 net upon certification in January. Even at the stipend level, the nine-month installment fits comfortably below 25 % of income, leaving sufficient funds for living costs and child support. I hope my clean record and property assets demonstrate my trustworthiness.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for any further documents.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ivan Petrov
