Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Martin Keller, 38, and I have been employed for the past 2 years and 3 months as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Microelectronic Systems. I am applying for a 6 681 DM business loan over 48 months to finance the purchase of laboratory-grade 3-D printing equipment that will allow me to spin off a small-batch prototyping service for local start-ups.

My present current-account balance averages 120 DM, and I hold no savings or securities. I already have one small instalment loan with your bank (opened in 2022), which I have serviced without incident since April 2023. A single delayed payment in late 2021, caused by temporary childcare costs for my two sons after their mother’s relocation, was settled in full within the same month, and I have had a spotless record ever since.

I live rent-free in my parents’ downstairs flat, possess no other debts, and my monthly net income of 4 650 DM comfortably covers the projected 4 % instalment rate plus current obligations, leaving a buffer of 1 200 DM. My employer confirms a permanent contract, and I am contactable at any time on the telephone number registered with you.

I believe my steady employment, low living expenses, and proven repayment discipline make me a trustworthy candidate. I would be grateful for your support and am ready to supply any further documentation you require.

Yours faithfully,  
Martin Keller

To the Credit Department,

I am Alexander Brenner, a 38-year-old certified electrician employed with Stadtwerke München since January 2022 (3 years, 2 months). I seek a 6 681 DM loan, repayable over 48 months, to purchase a used service van and basic inventory for a weekend mobile-repair business that will eventually become my full-time occupation.

My current account holds between 50 DM and 180 DM; I have no savings accounts and no guarantors. A single missed instalment on an earlier consumer loan in 2020 occurred when I was between contracts; it was rectified the following month, and there have been no issues since. I presently service one small furniture loan with your bank and have never been late.

I support my widowed mother and teenage nephew, yet my rent-free accommodation in her house and a stable monthly net salary of 4 200 DM keep my expense ratio low. After deducting existing obligations, the planned 4 % instalment leaves a surplus of roughly 900 DM each month.

Permanent employment, technical qualifications, and a clear repayment history for the past four years demonstrate my reliability. I am available at the registered telephone number to answer any questions and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Alexander Brenner

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is David Schwarz, single, 38, employed as a logistics coordinator at DHL Hub Leipzig for 1 year and 8 months. I request a 6 681 DM business loan for 48 months to acquire a second-hand delivery van so I can expand my weekend courier service, which already has contracts with two local pharmacies.

My current account rarely exceeds 170 DM, and I maintain no savings account. I acknowledge one delayed repayment in 2021, when unexpected dental surgery expenses arose; the balance was cleared within three weeks, and all subsequent payments have been punctual. I carry one active personal loan with your bank dating from 2023 and have never defaulted on it.

Because I live in a company-owned flat at no cost, my monthly net income of 4 050 DM covers existing instalments and comfortably meets the projected 4 % rate for this new credit while still leaving 800 DM free each month. I have no other debts and no guarantors, and I support my two younger brothers who are studying.

Stable employment, manageable obligations, and transparent communication underscore my creditworthiness. I am ready to provide payslips, business projections, or any further information.

Thank you for your time and favourable review.

Respectfully,  
David Schwarz

Dresden, 17 March 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Jonas Fischer, 38-year-old administrative clerk with the Saxony Police Department since November 2022 (2 years 4 months). I am applying for a 6 681 DM loan, repayable over 48 months, to purchase and place three smart vending machines in government offices—a project cleared with my employer as compatible secondary employment.

My checking account balance averages 90 DM. I own no property and have no savings. I did experience a delayed credit-card payment in 2020 after emergency roof repairs for my parents’ home; the amount was covered in full within the next cycle, and I have held a perfect record since. I have one small appliance loan with your bank and have never missed a payment.

I reside rent-free in the police barracks, have no other instalment plans, and my net monthly income stands at 4 300 DM. After accounting for the planned 4 % instalment and my existing obligation, I maintain a surplus of approximately 1 000 DM monthly.

My civil-service status, stable income, minimal living costs, and consistent payment discipline confirm my suitability for the requested credit. I am reachable at the telephone number on file and can provide any supplementary documents.

With appreciation,  
Jonas Fischer

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Stefan Vogel, 38, master carpenter employed by Braun Möbel GmbH since July 2021 (3 years 8 months). I wish to obtain a 6 681 DM business loan over 48 months to purchase a CNC router that will allow me to launch an online custom-furniture side venture already registered as “Vogel-Design”.

My checking account fluctuates between 30 DM and 160 DM; I have no savings or securities. In 2019 I briefly fell behind on a textbook loan while financing my twin daughters’ school trip; the overdue amount was settled the following month, and all obligations have been current since. I maintain one small equipment loan with your institution and have never missed a payment on it.

I live rent-free in my uncle’s attic flat and hold no additional debts. My monthly net salary is 4 550 DM, leaving 1 150 DM after existing and proposed instalments at the 4 % rate—ample coverage for unforeseen expenses.

Solid craftsmanship skills, ongoing employment, and a flawless payment record for the past five years make me a reliable borrower. I am available for any queries at the registered telephone number and would value the opportunity to discuss my plan further.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Vogel
