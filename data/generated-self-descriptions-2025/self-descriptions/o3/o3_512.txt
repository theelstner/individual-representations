Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a mechanical technician at Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart‐Feuerbach. I have held a permanent contract since 1 March 1995 and earn a net 3 100 DM monthly. Two years ago I purchased a 32 m² condominium; the title deed is enclosed.

I request a 759 DM loan over twelve months to cover the dealer’s first-registration fee and insurance on a new Opel Corsa I need for late shifts. My giro account shows –220 DM after quarterly property tax, and my savings book contains 74 DM. I took a 1 500 DM renovation loan from your bank in 1997 and repaid it six months early; I have no other debts or guarantors. The proposed instalment of about 66 DM fits easily within my budget even after supporting my 14-year-old brother in Serbia, my only dependent.

My spotless repayment record, steady income and real-estate ownership make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely  
Dragan Petrovic



Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Carlos Mendes, customs officer grade A7 with the Hamburg Port Authority since 15 April 1996, earning 2 850 DM net per month. I own a small row house in Wilhelmsburg purchased two years ago; mortgage payments are current.

I seek a 759 DM loan for twelve months to make the down payment on a new VW Polo, essential for 4:30 a.m. shifts when public transport is unavailable. My account balance is –95 DM after heating-oil purchase, and my savings total 38 DM. In 1998 I repaid a 900 DM consumer loan from your bank on schedule. I have no other liabilities; my dependent mother lives with me.

Monthly instalments of roughly 65 DM are well within my disposable income. My civil-service status, impeccable history and property collateral confirm my creditworthiness.

Respectfully  
Carlos Mendes



Dear Kreditausschuss,

I am Ivan Dimitrov, chemical laboratory assistant at Bayer AG in Leverkusen since 2 June 1994, earning a net 2 900 DM. I own a studio apartment bought two years ago; documents attached.

I apply for a 759 DM loan, 12 months, to pay the final factory instalment on a new Ford Fiesta needed for my 48 km commute after my old car failed TÜV. My giro account is –180 DM following school fees for my nine-year-old son in Sofia; savings stand at 51 DM. I previously repaid a 1 200 DM moving loan from your bank without delay.

The expected 66 DM monthly payment equals only 2.3 % of my net income. With no other debts or guarantors, and a proven record of punctual repayment, I am confident of meeting this obligation.

Kind regards  
Ivan Dimitrov



To the Credit Department,

I am Marcin Kowalski, certified electrician at Siemens AG, Munich-Perlach, permanently employed since September 1996 with a net salary of 3 000 DM. I purchased a 40 m² condominium in Giesing in 1998; mortgage instalments are up to date.

I request a 759 DM loan over 12 months to cover the initial payment on a company-subsidised Smart City-Coupé that will allow faster response to emergency call-outs. My giro account shows –140 DM after annual vehicle insurance, and my savings book holds 88 DM. I repaid a 1 000 DM household loan from your bank earlier this year precisely on schedule.

A 70 DM monthly instalment fits comfortably into my budget even after the 400 DM I send home to support my 17-year-old sister, my only dependent. My stable employment, property ownership and flawless credit history demonstrate my reliability.

I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely  
Marcin Kowalski



Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Saleh, IT support specialist at Deutsche Bank AG in Frankfurt-Gallus. I have held a permanent position since 18 January 1995 and earn 3 350 DM net monthly. Two years ago I bought a studio apartment in Niederrad; mortgage payments are punctual.

I request a 759 DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to fund registration tax and safety packages on a new Peugeot 206 that will replace my ageing motorcycle and ensure reliable transport for on-call duties. My current account stands at –110 DM after paying university fees for my 18-year-old niece living with me; my savings total 42 DM. Last October I completed repayment of a 1 400 DM furniture loan from your bank without a single late fee.

The projected 65 DM monthly instalment is easily covered by my disposable income. Continuous employment, property collateral and a spotless repayment record make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully  
Ahmed Saleh
