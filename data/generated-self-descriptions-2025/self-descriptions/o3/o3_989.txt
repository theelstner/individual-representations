Hamburg, 19 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Hernández, a 64-year-old divorced Spaniard who has lived in Germany since 1985. For 22 years I worked as an avionics technician at Lufthansa Technik; I was laid off last year during the pandemic restructuring and now receive a company pension of 1 960 DM net per month plus 310 DM in rent from a garage on my property. I own my condominium outright and have no other debts.  

In 2023 I took a 2 000 DM appliance loan from your branch and repaid it six months early. I now request 1 409 DM to purchase a modern television set and digital radio receiver so I can follow language-education broadcasts with my 10-year-old grandson, who lives with me. My savings account at your bank holds 240 DM and I am willing to pledge the same property that secured my previous loan. The planned installment of 2 % of my disposable income (about 40 DM monthly) is well within my budget.  

My long, spotless credit history, steady pension, and tangible collateral make me a low-risk, trustworthy borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Hernández

Dresden, 20 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Alina Kowalska, a 64-year-old separated Polish national with permanent residency. For 18 years I served as a municipal records clerk for the city of Zabrze before moving to Germany to care for my daughter. I have been unemployed since July 2024 but receive 1 320 DM unemployment benefit and 480 DM monthly alimony. My house, bought in 1996, is mortgage-free.  

I request a loan of 1 409 DM to buy a combined radio-TV set that supports subtitles and hearing-assistance features; my eight-year-old granddaughter and I use televised integration courses daily. I hold 390 DM in a savings account and have never missed a payment on the small 2019 renovation loan I finished repaying in March.  

With stable public benefits, real-estate collateral, and a flawless payment record, I am confident I can meet the agreed 2 % installment (about 36 DM monthly). I look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Alina Kowalska

Nuremberg, 18 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Gabriela Rossi, married, 64, an Italian citizen who has worked in Germany since 1990. Until December 2023 I was a certified customs officer at the Port of Nürnberg, where I contributed for 28 years. I now receive a civil-service pension of 2 150 DM net and health-insurance subsidies.  

I am applying for a 1 409 DM loan to replace our 20-year-old television so my husband, who is recovering from surgery, can follow rehabilitation programs broadcast on Bayern 3. My savings with you amount to 170 DM, and the family home we own outright is valued at approximately 180 000 DM. I have one prior credit with your bank—8 000 DM for roof repairs—fully repaid last year without delay.  

The requested installment (roughly 38 DM per month) fits comfortably in my pension budget. My decades of public-sector employment, unblemished repayment record, and substantial property equity demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Gabriela Rossi

Leipzig, 21 September 2025  

To the Loan Officer,  

I, Nguyen Thi Lan, a 64-year-old divorced Vietnamese resident of Germany since 1982, respectfully request a credit of 1 409 DM. After 15 years as a precision-tool machinist at VEB Werkzeugbau, I was made redundant in 2022. I now receive 1 440 DM monthly early-retirement benefits and earn an additional 250 DM by tutoring Vietnamese language students from home.  

The funds will purchase a large-screen smart TV and DAB+ radio essential for my tutoring business, which relies on educational broadcasts. I keep 310 DM in a savings bond and own my detached house, bought in 1994, free of encumbrances. My only previous loan with your bank—3 500 DM for central-heating conversion—was settled exactly on schedule in June.  

With regular income, owned property, and a perfect credit record, I can service the planned 2 % installment (about 34 DM monthly) without strain. I would be grateful for your approval.  

Warm regards,  
Nguyen Thi Lan

Kassel, 19 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Sofia Petrov, a married 64-year-old Bulgarian engineer who immigrated in 1991. I worked as a senior laboratory technician at BASF for 26 years until my department closed last year. I currently receive 2 000 DM pension plus 400 DM monthly royalties from a patented filtration device I co-authored.  

I seek a 1 409 DM loan to purchase a high-definition TV and digital radio for remote meetings with my patent partners and to follow technical broadcasts that keep me updated. My savings account holds 280 DM; our two-storey home, owned outright, is valued at 220 000 DM. A 2016 solar-panel loan with your bank was repaid in full, ahead of time, in 2021.  

The proposed 2 % installment equals 39 DM per month—well within my disposable income. My strong, diversified income streams, substantial collateral, and impeccable repayment history assure you of my reliability.  

Thank you for evaluating my request.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Petrov
