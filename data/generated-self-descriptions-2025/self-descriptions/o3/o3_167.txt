Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Miroslav Petrovic, 32, an electronics technician at Siemens Energy in Nuremberg. I have been employed there for 2 years 8 months and earn a net salary of 3,100 DM per month. Two months ago I purchased a small condominium; it is still almost empty. I am requesting a loan of 2,978 DM to purchase basic furniture (wardrobe, bed, dining set) and a computer workstation for my night-school classes.

My financial record is solid. In 2022 I took a 2,500 DM education loan from your branch and repaid it six months early. I have no other debts or guarantees outstanding. Though I do not yet keep a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a current balance of 880 DM. Regular deductions to that account since 2019 demonstrate my discipline.

The requested installment plan of 6 months fits easily within my budget; even after the projected payment of 510 DM per month I will still have more than one-third of my income available for living expenses and for my younger brother, whom I support while he finishes school. I also own a 2018 Opel Corsa valued at roughly 5,000 DM, providing additional security.

I have always honored my financial commitments and intend to stay with your bank for future services, including opening a checking account next quarter. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Miroslav Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Carlos Mendes, a single 32-year-old mechanical design drafter employed by BMW Group in Regensburg since June 2022. My current net monthly income is 3,350 DM. I am applying for a 2,978 DM loan to equip my new home office—ergonomic desk, CAD-certified monitor, and storage cabinets—so that I can participate in BMW’s remote-work pilot.

My credit file shows one previous loan with your bank for 4,000 DM (motorcycle purchase, 2020–2023). All installments were paid on schedule; the loan is now closed. I hold no other liabilities. My savings account contains 620 DM and I drive a fully paid 2021 Yamaha MT-07 worth about 6,000 DM.

The proposed six-month repayment at roughly 505 DM monthly represents just 15 % of my income, leaving ample margin for living costs and support for my widowed mother, who is my declared dependent. I have been at my current address for two years and own the flat outright through inheritance paperwork finalized last year.

Although I have not yet opened a checking account, I am ready to do so once the loan is approved to simplify repayments. I appreciate your confidence and remain committed to transparent, punctual payments.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes

To the Credit Department,

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz. I serve as a senior customs officer at Munich Airport, a position I have held for 3 years 1 month, with a net monthly salary of 3,600 DM. I request a loan of 2,978 DM to furnish the nursery and purchase safety equipment for my newly adopted son.

I previously borrowed 3,200 DM from your institution in 2021 for professional training and repaid the balance in full by December 2022. I have no open credit lines now. A personal savings account of 950 DM and a 2019 Volkswagen Golf provide additional collateral.

The six-month repayment schedule of roughly 505 DM fits comfortably within my budget, representing 14 % of my income. Since buying my townhouse in Erding two years ago I have demonstrated stable residency and responsible homeownership. My telephone and utility bills have always been paid by direct debit without delay.

Although I currently operate only on my savings account, I intend to migrate my salary to a new checking account at your branch should this loan be approved, reinforcing my long-term relationship with the bank.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Tomáš Novák, age 32, a certified network administrator at Deutsche Telekom in Bonn. I have worked there for 1 year 10 months, earning a steady 3,000 DM net per month. I seek a 2,978 DM loan to replace outdated living-room furniture and acquire backup power equipment for my remote-support duties.

My credit history includes one prior loan from your bank: 2,200 DM for relocation expenses in 2019, settled exactly on schedule. I maintain a savings balance of 710 DM and own a 2020 Skoda Fabia valued at 5,500 DM. There are no other debts or guarantors.

The payment plan of six equal installments (about 505 DM each) is well within my disposable income; after accounting for support of my younger cousin (registered dependent) my surplus remains above 1,000 DM monthly.

I have resided in my own apartment for two years and have never missed a utility or tax payment. A checking account is not yet open simply because my employer pays via wage card, but I am ready to transition to direct deposit through your bank.

I value the trust you have shown me before and look forward to upholding it again.

Sincerely,  
Tomáš Novák

To whom it may concern,

My name is Luka Ivić, a civil-service cartographer at the Bavarian Land Survey Office since May 2023. I earn 2,950 DM net each month. I request a loan of 2,978 DM to buy essential furniture and precision drawing equipment for the studio in my recently purchased starter home.

My only previous credit with your bank—3,500 DM for vocational certification—was repaid ahead of time last March. I have no concurrent installment plans. Current liquid savings stand at 540 DM, and I own a 2017 Peugeot 208 valued at approximately 4,800 DM.

The six-month installment of about 505 DM leaves me with over 60 % of my income for living costs, including the care of my 6-year-old nephew who lives with me. I have occupied my residence for two years and have maintained perfect payment records for municipal fees and insurance.

I do not yet hold a checking account; if the loan is approved, I will open one immediately and enroll in automatic debit payments, ensuring full transparency and punctuality.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I look forward to continuing my excellent relationship with your bank.

Best regards,  
Luka Ivić
