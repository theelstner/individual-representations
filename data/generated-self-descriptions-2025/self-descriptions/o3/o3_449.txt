Stuttgart, 15 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 2 576 DM to purchase a new color television and Hi-Fi radio set for my home. After three years as a mechanical technician at Daimler Truck AG, I now earn a steady net income of 3 900 DM per month. My checking account presently holds 118 DM, and my savings account 74 DM, figures that reflect the recent school-fee payment for my eight-year-old son.

I have owned a condominium in Bad Cannstatt valued at roughly 120 000 DM since 2021, giving me solid collateral. A previous loan of 1 500 DM taken last year was repaid two months ahead of schedule, and my repayment record with your bank remains spotless.  

The required installment of about 370 DM over seven months fits comfortably within my monthly budget; after rent-free living costs, insurance, and child support I still retain over 1 600 DM disposable income. My colleague, Mr. Paolo Ricci (department no. 472), has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.

I am confident that my stable employment, strong repayment history, and real-estate ownership make me a low-risk and reliable customer. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Marco Bianchi

Berlin, 13 September 2025

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a 2 576 DM consumer loan to purchase a combined television-radio unit that I will also use for the evening German-language courses I follow from home. I have been employed as a certified electrician at Siemens Energy for two years and two months, earning a net salary of 3 600 DM.

Today my current account shows 163 DM and my savings booklet 91 DM; my modest balances stem from recently sending money to my parents in Ankara. I nonetheless enjoy a secure financial base: since 2022 I have co-owned, mortgage-free, a semi-detached house in Neukölln valued near 140 000 DM. A prior 1 200 DM loan was fully repaid in June.

The proposed seven-month plan at roughly 370 DM represents just 10 % of my net income, well within my budget after household and childcare costs. My uncle, Mr. Mehmet Kaya, proprietor of Kaya Bauartikel GmbH, has signed as guarantor.

I have never missed a payment and intend to keep that record intact. Your support will help me integrate faster and raise my five-year-old son in a German-speaking environment.

With thanks for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Ahmet Kaya

Hamburg, 14 September 2025

To the Credit Department,

I hereby request a 2 576 DM loan for the purchase of a professional-grade television and radio receiver that I need for my distance customs-law training. I have served as a junior revenue officer at the Hamburg Customs Office for one year and seven months with a secure civil-service salary of 4 050 DM net.

My Girokonto balance is currently 147 DM; my savings account shows 88 DM. I live mortgage-free in a townhouse I inherited in 2020, valued at approximately 160 000 DM. My single previous credit—1 800 DM for relocation expenses—was repaid exactly on schedule last February.

After taxes and family support for my nine-year-old daughter, I maintain a monthly surplus of around 1 700 DM, easily covering the planned seven installments. My brother, Dr. Jan Nowak of Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, has committed to act as guarantor.

Given my civil-service status, unblemished repayment history, and property ownership, I believe I present minimal risk. I would greatly appreciate your positive decision.

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak

Frankfurt a.M., 12 September 2025

Dear Loans Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2 576 DM to buy a high-definition television and DAB radio set. These devices will allow me to follow remote technical courses offered by Deutsche Telekom, thereby advancing my career.

I have worked as a telecommunications technician with Deutsche Telekom AG for three years and one month, earning a stable net income of 3 750 DM. My checking account balance stands at 152 DM and my passbook at 79 DM after recent school expenses for my six-year-old son.

I own a condominium in Sachsenhausen purchased outright in 2021, presently valued near 135 000 DM. I previously financed a 2 200 DM appliance package through your bank and repaid it four months early. The proposed repayment of roughly 370 DM for seven months accounts for less than 10 % of my take-home pay.

Mr. Stefan Krüger, a senior engineer in my unit, has formally agreed to guarantee the loan. I have never defaulted on any obligation and do not maintain other installment contracts.

I trust my steady income, spotless credit record, and property asset demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Fernandez

Dresden, 11 September 2025

Honorable Credit Committee,

Please accept this application for a 2 576 DM loan, intended for the purchase of a modern television and radio set to aid my son’s educational needs and my own German-language improvement.

Since December 2022 I have been employed as a laboratory chemical technician at Fraunhofer IKTS, earning a net monthly salary of 3 580 DM. My Giro account currently contains 134 DM, and I have 63 DM in a savings bond—low balances caused by recent renovation of my kitchen.

I possess a detached house in Radebeul, bought without mortgage in 2020 and now estimated at 150 000 DM. Last year I concluded a 2 500 DM renovation loan with your bank, paying every installment punctually.

The requested amount will be repaid over seven months at approximately 370 DM per month, leaving me more than 1 500 DM after regular living expenses. My institute supervisor, Dr. Matthias Renner, has signed on as guarantor.

My steady scientific employment, property ownership, flawless repayment behaviour, and modest debt level make me a dependable candidate. I look forward to a favourable response.

Best regards,  
Georgios Papadopoulos
