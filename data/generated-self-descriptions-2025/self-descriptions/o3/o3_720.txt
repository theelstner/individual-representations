Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Klein, 31, and I respectfully request a 3,148 € loan over 24 months to buy a new combined DAB-radio/4K-television set for my condominium. For the past 2 years and 3 months I have been employed as a laboratory technician at LANXESS AG, earning a net salary of 2,950 € that has been deposited into my checking account with you every month without fail.  

Although I already service two small furniture loans with you and a 700 € revolving line at another bank, all payments have been punctual and my account has never been overdrawn beyond the agreed limit. I own my 62 m² flat and a fully paid-off 2018 Volkswagen Golf, giving me additional security.  

With an installment rate of 131 € (rate class 3), the new credit will keep my total monthly debt ratio below 25 % of net income. I have no other installment plans, and my single dependent—my six-year-old son Luca—receives regular child support from me.  

I value the long-standing cooperation with your bank and assure you of continued reliable repayments. Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Markus Klein

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I am Daniel Fischer, a 31-year-old IT systems administrator employed by the City of Munich for 1 year and 8 months. My net monthly salary of 3,120 € has been credited to my current account here since my first day on the job. I seek a 3,148 € consumer loan for 24 months to purchase an energy-efficient smart TV and digital radio receiver that will replace outdated equipment in my apartment.  

My financial obligations include two existing installment contracts with your bank (kitchen appliances and a bicycle, remaining balance 980 €) as well as a €1,300 overdraft facility with Sparkasse, both serviced without delay. I own a 2017 Opel Astra, and I live in a studio apartment that I inherited debt-free from my late aunt.  

With no guarantors or additional debt, I can easily meet the proposed class-3 rate of roughly 130 € per month, which keeps my disposable income comfortably positive while I continue to support my mother, my sole dependent.  

I have always honored my financial commitments and would be grateful for your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Fischer

Dear Credit Department,  

I, Alex Hoffmann, request a 3,148 € loan repayable in 24 monthly installments to finance the purchase of a high-quality digital radio and OLED television for my home. I have worked for 3 years and 2 months as a mechanical engineering technician at Siemens Mobility, drawing a steady after-tax salary of 3,010 €, transferred to my account with your bank on the 27th of each month.  

My credit record shows two active loans with you (balance 1,450 € in total) and a paid-as-agreed auto loan at Volksbank, now in its final year. All installments are up-to-date, demonstrating my reliability despite earlier “critical account” remarks dating back to my student days.  

I reside in my own 55 m² apartment, purchased cash from savings left by my grandfather, and drive a fully insured 2019 Ford Focus. The planned 131 € monthly repayment fits well within my budget while I continue to provide child maintenance for my four-year-old daughter Mia.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain ready to supply any additional documents you may need.  

Sincerely,  
Alex Hoffmann

Bremen, 17 September 2025  

To the Loans Office,  

My name is Stefan Berger, 31, customs officer at the Port of Bremen since July 2024 (1 year 2 months). I am applying for a 3,148 € consumer credit over 24 months to modernise my living room with a combined internet-radio and UHD television system.  

I earn a net 2,840 € monthly, paid to my checking account here, which has maintained an average balance above 600 € for the past year. I currently repay two modest credits with your bank (balance 1,230 €) and hold a 900 € personnel loan with Deutsche Bank, all serviced punctually. I possess a 2016 Skoda Octavia and own my 48 m² flat outright.  

With no guarantors, no other installment plans and only my younger brother Jonas (student) as dependent, I can comfortably absorb the class-3 installment of about 130 € per month, leaving more than two-thirds of my income free.  

Your favourable decision would strengthen the trust already existing between us. Thank you for your time.  

Best regards,  
Stefan Berger

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Patrick Weiss, 31, working as an administrative clerk with the Baden-Württemberg State Police for 2 years and 8 months. I kindly request a 3,148 € loan, payable over 24 months, to buy a state-of-the-art television and DAB+ sound system.  

My salary of 2,970 € net is credited to my checking account with your institution, where I have held two existing credits (office equipment, home renovation; current combined balance 1,110 €) since 2023. I also maintain a small 1,200 € credit card balance at Volksbank, always settled within agreed terms. Despite the “critical account” note from 2019, my record has been flawless for the past four years.  

I live alone with my seven-year-old son Leon in a condominium I purchased last year, and I own a 2015 Audi A3. The proposed class-3 installment of 131 € represents less than 5 % of my monthly net income, ensuring smooth repayment without strain.  

Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to your positive response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Patrick Weiss
