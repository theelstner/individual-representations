Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Ivancic, a 30-year-old Croatian engineer working as an R&D project manager at Siemens AG in Munich since February 2019. I recently purchased a 65 m² condominium where I live with my five-year-old daughter Lea. To complete the apartment and set up a home-office I kindly apply for a loan of 14 179 € for furniture and technical equipment.

I earn a fixed gross salary of 5 600 € per month plus an annual bonus. My current account shows an overdraft of 830 € caused by renovation expenses, but my regular income allows me to clear this within two months. I service two existing instalment loans at your bank punctually; together they absorb 540 € per month. I hold a building-society contract worth 24 000 € maturing in 2029 and a fully paid life-insurance policy of 100 000 € that secures my dependent.

During the last five years I have never missed a payment date and I submit the attached income statements as proof. With the requested loan and an agreed instalment of roughly 360 € I will still retain more than 45 % of my net income for living expenses, ensuring comfortable repayment.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable cooperation.

Sincerely,
Markus Ivancic

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Dr. Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian citizen registered in Germany since 2017. I have been working as a self-employed software consultant in Berlin for six years, contracting mainly for Deutsche Bahn and Zalando. My average monthly net income for 2023 was 4 800 €. I own a 70 m² apartment in Friedrichshain where I live with my six-year-old son Omar.

I request a loan of 14 179 € to purchase ergonomic office furniture and two high-performance servers for a new long-term contract starting in May. The launch costs have taken my business account 600 € into overdraft, but incoming invoices for April already cover that deficit.

Although I hold two small vehicle loans with you (combined rate 410 €), every instalment has been credited on time. I also maintain a 30 000 € building-society savings plan and a term life insurance that names my child as beneficiary, providing additional security.

My projected cashflow easily supports the requested rate of about 4 % over 48 months, leaving a disposable monthly surplus above 1 900 €. I therefore believe I am a trustworthy and solvent candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Dr. Ahmed Hassan

Dear Credit Team,

I am Sergei Petrovic, a 30-year-old logistics officer at Hamburger Hafen und Logistik AG, employed since March 2018. After my recent separation I bought a small row house in Wandsbek where I live with my six-year-old son Nikita. To furnish the child’s room, the living area and to buy essential household equipment I apply for a furniture loan of 14 179 €.

My net salary is 3 900 € per month plus shift allowances. Because of the down-payment, my checking account is currently 1 050 € in the red, but I expect this to be balanced when my holiday bonus is paid in June. I hold two existing instalment credits with your bank (heat-pump and bicycle), both paid punctually at 295 € total.

A Bausparvertrag over 20 000 € and a 150 000 € life insurance with HanseMerkur stand as additional collateral. I have never defaulted on an obligation and have kept the same employer for more than five years, which I hope demonstrates reliability.

With a proposed rate of about 350 € the new loan would still leave over 60 % of my disposable income free for living expenses, so repayment is assured.

Thank you for your trust and support.

Respectfully,
Sergei Petrovic

Dear Loans Officer,

My name is Juan Carlos Romero, Spanish-born entrepreneur and sole owner of Restaurante La Estrella in Cologne. I have managed the restaurant successfully since April 2017 and report an average net personal income of 4 300 € per month. I purchased the building last year and live in the upstairs flat with my seven-year-old daughter Lucía.

To expand seating capacity I need new tables, chairs and a refrigerated counter. The supplier offers the package for 14 179 €, and I ask you to finance this amount. Recent renovation costs placed my business account 900 € below zero, but the Easter season turnover will restore a positive balance in May.

I already repay two small equipment loans with your bank (total rate 460 €) without delay. A Bausparvertrag over 25 000 € and a 120 000 € life policy are in place as security. The restaurant shows steady cashflow—2023 revenue increased by 12 %—which comfortably covers the requested instalment of around 370 €.

My five-year track record of punctual payments and growing sales underline my reliability. I would be pleased to continue our constructive partnership with this new credit.

Muchas gracias for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Juan Carlos Romero

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Matteo Rossi, an Italian product manager at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart, employed since January 2020. My monthly net income is 4 700 €. Last month I took ownership of a two-room condominium and moved in with my six-year-old son Federico. To furnish the flat and set up a professional home-office required for my position I request a loan of 14 179 €.

A security deposit and notary fees have pushed my current account 720 € into overdraft, a situation I will clear with my May salary. I hold two existing credits with your bank (kitchen and e-bike) amounting to 385 € monthly, both serviced punctually for the past three years.

I maintain a 28 000 € Bausparvertrag and a 200 000 € term life assurance as collateral. My debt-to-income ratio after adding the proposed instalment of approx. 360 € will remain below 30 %, leaving ample funds for living costs.

My stable employment in a management role, exemplary payment history and tangible collateral make me a dependable borrower. I would value the opportunity to finalize this loan swiftly and continue our positive relationship.

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,
Matteo Rossi
