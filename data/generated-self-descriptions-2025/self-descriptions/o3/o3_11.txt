Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Miguel Santos, a 28-year-old Portuguese citizen married to Paula Santos and father of our three-year-old son, Leo. We have owned a small row house at Johann-Blum-Weg 14, 28215 Bremen, for the past two years. I am applying for a 5 234 DM loan over 30 months to purchase a new Opel Combo Life. The vehicle will replace my twelve-year-old VW Polo and allow me to accept a signed job offer as a last-mile delivery driver with DHL Paket GmbH that starts on 1 October 2024 (net salary 2 350 DM).

Until May 2023 I worked six years as Operations Manager at Baltic Freight GmbH, but my position was made redundant when the Bremen hub closed. My severance (4 800 DM) is in my checking account (current balance 120 DM after living expenses). I also keep 85 DM in a savings book and own the VW Polo, which I will trade in.

Although my credit history shows two existing loans with your bank (a furniture loan and a boiler replacement loan, both serviced for 18 months without a single late payment) and one micro-loan with FinAuto AG, my payment record is impeccable. The proposed installment of roughly 190 DM fits comfortably within my projected monthly surplus of 630 DM.

I have no guarantors, no other installment plans, and no phone line, but I remain easily reachable by email and at my home address. I am committed to maintaining the solid relationship I have built with your bank and am confident you will find me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Miguel Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Viktor Ivanov, a 28-year-old Bulgarian national residing with my wife and infant daughter at Röntgenstraße 8, 70180 Stuttgart, since August 2022. I request a 5 234 DM loan for 30 months to acquire a new Renault Kangoo E-Tech electric van. This vehicle is the last requirement for a courier contract I have secured with Hermes Logistik Service, expected to generate a net income of 2 600 DM per month.

From 2016 to December 2023 I ran my own app-development firm, SofiaSoft UG, employing four people. The firm closed after our largest client relocated, and I have been registered unemployed since January. During that period I continued to honor two outstanding credits with your branch (balance 2 180 DM combined) and have never missed a payment. My checking account shows 170 DM and my savings passbook 60 DM. I also own a 2009 Skoda Fabia, valued at 1 900 DM, which will be sold once I receive the new van.

Despite the “critical” status recorded from a 2020 overdraft at Sparkasse Stuttgart (now fully settled), my record for the past three years is spotless. With monthly installments around 190 DM, my debt-to-income ratio will remain below 25 %. I therefore believe I meet your reliability standards.

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive reply.

Kind regards,
Viktor Ivanov

Respected Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, age 28, an Egyptian national living in my own condominium at Tegernseer Platz 6, 81541 München, with my wife Salma and our five-year-old son. I am requesting a 5 234 DM loan, payable over 30 months, to purchase a new Toyota Yaris Cross. The car is essential for me to resume work at Kempinski Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten as an Assistant Front-Office Manager, a position I held from 2017 to March 2024 and will re-enter on 15 September 2024 (contract attached, net salary 2 480 DM).

I became unemployed after the hotel’s temporary closure for renovation, but during the downtime I kept servicing two small renovation loans from your bank (total remaining 1 740 DM). I also carry a 900 DM balance on a travel loan with ReiseCredit GmbH, all payments up to date. Current balances: checking 95 DM, savings 40 DM, and a ten-year-old Peugeot 207 valued at 1 600 DM.

The proposed installment of about 190 DM fits well below the 600 DM monthly surplus outlined in my household budget. My consistent repayment record, stable housing, and upcoming employment contract demonstrate my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Credit Department,

I am Carlos Ramírez, 28, a Spanish national and widower with a six-year-old son, Diego. For the past two years we have lived at our owned flat, Küfergasse 3, 86152 Augsburg. I seek a 5 234 DM loan for 30 months to buy a new Skoda Scala that meets the safety standards required for my planned driving-school business.

From 2014 to February 2024 I served as a Lieutenant (logistics officer) in the Spanish Navy, stationed at Wilhelmshaven under a NATO exchange. I took honorable discharge to settle permanently in Germany and start Ramírez Fahrschule, for which I already hold a Gewerbeanmeldung and have 14 students registered for October. My projected net income is 3 000 DM per month.

My checking account shows 150 DM and my savings account 90 DM. I have two ongoing loans with your bank (heating upgrade and language-course fees), both paid punctually for eighteen months, as well as a closed overdraft from Deutsche Kreditbank that triggered the “critical” flag in 2021 but has since been settled. I own a 2011 Seat Ibiza and a set of instructor training materials worth about 2 300 DM.

The monthly installment of roughly 190 DM is fully covered by my military pension of 640 DM plus forthcoming business income, giving me strong repayment capacity.

I would be grateful for your support.

Respectfully,
Carlos Ramírez

Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Khalid Khan, 28-year-old Pakistani engineer, married with one daughter, residing at my owned townhouse, Overwegstraße 24, 45879 Gelsenkirchen, since July 2022. I request a 5 234 DM loan over 30 months to purchase a new Hyundai i30. Reliable transportation is vital for the freelance plant-maintenance consultancy contract I have signed with Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe AG (starting 10 August 2024, guaranteed net income 2 700 DM per month).

I was employed from 2016 to November 2023 as a senior process-engineer at Siemens Energy, Mülheim, but was laid off during the site restructure and have been registered unemployed since. Even so, I have maintained on-time payments on two existing loans with your bank (balance 2 060 DM) and a machinery micro-credit with TEC-Finanz GmbH. Current account balance is 130 DM; savings book holds 55 DM. Property includes my fully paid 2010 Ford Focus, workshop tools valued at 2 800 DM, and the townhouse itself.

With projected installments of around 190 DM, my monthly budget shows a 710 DM buffer. My professional qualifications, secured client contract, and spotless repayment history for the past four years underscore my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Khalid Khan
