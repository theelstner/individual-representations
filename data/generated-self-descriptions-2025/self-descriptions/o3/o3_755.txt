Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Maria Alvarez, a Spanish laboratory technician employed at Biokunststoffe GmbH in Frankfurt since August 2020. I am applying for a 5 771 EUR loan over 30 months to purchase a 65-inch OLED television, a digital receiver and studio-quality radio equipment. I plan to create educational videos on plastics recycling—an online side project that will generate an additional 220 EUR net each month and further improve my repayment capacity.  

Financial situation  
• Net salary: 2 350 EUR/month (permanent contract)  
• Two consumer loans with your bank (balance 1 980 EUR) – never a late payment  
• No overdraft or checking account; my wages are loaded each month onto a prepaid salary card.  
• Savings: 74 EUR on a Sparbuch  
• Assets: 2016 VW Golf (fully paid) and a 36 m² condominium I bought in 2023 (mortgage with Sparkasse, paid on time).  

Reliability  
In five years of German residence I have never missed a rent, utility or credit installment. My employer will confirm the stability of my contract, and I am prepared to sign a salary-assignment clause. The requested installment of roughly 210 EUR fits easily within my monthly surplus of 530 EUR after all fixed costs, child care for my three-year-old daughter, and alimony obligations to my ex-husband.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to strengthening our good relationship with a third, equally flawless, credit history.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Alvarez

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  

I am Elena Petrova, a Bulgarian registered nurse at Sonnenblick Privatklinik, Munich, since May 2019. I kindly request a loan of 5 771 EUR for 30 months to buy professional radio-and-television equipment. With it I will record certified nursing-language tutorials for the Bulgarian community, an online venture projected to deliver 180 EUR additional income per month.  

Current finances  
• Net salary: 2 480 EUR/month (permanent contract)  
• Two running instalment loans with your bank (kitchen & e-bike, remaining total 3 100 EUR); all payments punctual.  
• Savings: 52 EUR  
• Property: 2009 Škoda Fabia and a 42 m² apartment I own in Trudering (mortgage at HypoVereinsbank, never in arrears).  
• No checking account – I work exclusively with a Guthabenkarte and cash.  

Why I am trustworthy  
During six years in Germany I have achieved an unbroken record of timely financial commitments, while supporting my two-year-old son. The requested monthly installment of approx. 210 EUR represents 8 % of my net income and is well covered by my disposable 600 EUR margin. I consent to wage garnishment in case of default and can provide employer confirmation and Steuerbescheide.  

I appreciate your favorable review and remain at your disposal for any further documentation.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Elena Petrova

To the Loans Department,  

My name is Ana Silva, Portuguese citizen, age 25, employed as an administrative officer at the City of Cologne Immigration Office since March 2021. I request a 5 771 EUR credit over 30 months to replace my broken television and radio set and to install language-learning media for my five-year-old daughter and me.  

Income & obligations  
• Net civil-service pay: 2 150 EUR per month (Beamtenähnlicher Vertrag)  
• Existing credits at your bank: furniture (paid down to 740 EUR) and a laptop (560 EUR) – perfect repayment record.  
• No other loans, no overdraft. Savings balance 89 EUR.  
• Assets: 2014 Renault Clio and a small condo (38 m²) purchased in 2023; mortgage current.  

Liquidity  
My monthly surplus after all expenses is 480 EUR. The proposed installment of roughly 210 EUR equals 9 % of my income and leaves ample cushion. My salary is secure, indexed and paid by the municipality. I authorize direct debit from the same savings account used for my existing loans.  

Character  
In four years of public-sector employment I have never missed a payment, utility bill or tax. I am prepared to present payslips, tax notices and a letter from my department head.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am confident my consistent track record will justify a positive decision.  

Respectfully,  
Ana Silva

Koblenz, 11 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Kristina Novak, Croatian citizen, IT support specialist at Mittelrhein AG since July 2020. I seek a loan of 5 771 EUR over 30 months to purchase a 4K smart TV, surround-sound receiver and internet-radio hub for the guest living room of my townhouse, which I rent out via Airbnb. The upgrade will raise nightly rates by about 18 EUR, adding 270 EUR to my monthly income.  

Financial overview  
• Net salary: 2 400 EUR; side income from Airbnb: currently 520 EUR.  
• Liabilities at your bank: two credits (solar panels & washing machine), total balance 3 260 EUR, never late.  
• Savings: 63 EUR.  
• Assets: 2018 Opel Astra (owned) and the townhouse purchased in 2023 (KfW mortgage, on schedule).  
• No checking account; incoming funds go to a deposit account with limited withdrawal, which you already debit for my existing loans.  

Creditworthiness  
I have honored every financial obligation in Germany for the past five years. My disposable income after all costs—including the present loans and family expenses for my husband and newborn—is 650 EUR. The new installment of about 210 EUR comfortably fits within this margin. Should income fluctuate, I can pause Airbnb stays to use the room myself, maintaining liquidity.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to supply further documentation on request.  

Kind regards,  
Kristina Novak
