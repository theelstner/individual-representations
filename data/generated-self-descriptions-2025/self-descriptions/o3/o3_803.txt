Sparkasse Leipzig  
Loan Department  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Helena Schubert. I am 48 years old, divorced, and have one daughter living with me. For the past eight years I have worked as a warehouse clerk at Leipzig Logistics GmbH; my current net income is 2 600 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1 795 DM over 18 months to replace our 20-year-old television and radio set, which broke down in July.  

My financial situation is stable. My checking account usually carries a balance between 100 DM and 180 DM (today: 167 DM). I hold 45 DM in a small savings passbook and rent a flat for 650 DM monthly. Although I still service two small instalment contracts with your bank (furniture and washing machine, total outstanding 1 120 DM), every payment has been made punctually. The proposed new instalment of 115 DM fits easily within my monthly budget; I have no other obligations except child support payments that are automatically deducted.  

My ex-husband, Peter Schubert, will act as guarantor: he owns a mortgaged house in Grimma and has provided all required documents. I can also offer a first-rank lien on the small plot of woodland I inherited in Zwenkau, valued at 9 000 DM. With continuous employment, a documented history of on-time repayments, a reachable landline (0341 / 753 41 28) and a solid guarantor, I trust you will find me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time for questions.  

Sincerely,  
Helena Schubert

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Birgit Döring, 48, legally separated, mother of one adult son. Since 2013 I have been employed as a surgical assistant at St. Michael Hospital, earning a steady 2 850 DM net each month. I seek a loan of 1 795 DM, repayable over 18 months, to purchase a new 40-inch smart television and DAB-radio for my rented flat. The devices will also allow me to study distance-learning material that the hospital encourages.  

My current account stands at 118 DM; my savings booklet holds 62 DM. I rent at 600 DM monthly and have maintained the same address for four years. I still carry an older consumer loan of 3 200 DM at Deutsche Kredit AG—payments of 190 DM have never been late. I already hold two small credit lines with your bank totalling 950 DM; both are serviced punctually on the 2nd of every month.  

The instalment for this new loan (about 115 DM) will keep my total debt ratio below 18 % of net income. My brother, Joachim Müller, a civil engineer owning a free-and-clear house in Plauen, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor. I am reachable at 0371 / 5 64 97 22 and stand ready to supply any additional documentation.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Birgit Döring

Dear Madam or Sir,  

My name is Renate Vogel, 48 years old, married, with one dependent daughter who is completing an apprenticeship. I have worked as a school cafeteria cook at 122. Oberschule Dresden for the past ten years and earn 2 300 DM net monthly. I wish to finance a combined television-radio unit costing 1 795 DM, to be repaid over 18 months.  

Although my credit record shows a past-due mobile-phone contract from 2019, this account has been settled, and there have been no late payments since. My current account balance is 154 DM; my savings account stands at 38 DM. I pay 620 DM rent and have resided at Bautzner Str. 75 for four years. Your bank already manages two minor instalment loans (dishwasher and bicycle, remaining balance 1 180 DM); both are fully up-to-date.  

The new instalment of roughly 115 DM will raise my total monthly credit outlay to 330 DM, still well within the 40 % ceiling set by the Saxon Public Service Union. My husband, Karl Vogel, owns our ancestral family farmhouse in Pirna and will guarantee the loan. In addition, I can pledge the notarial deed to my 1 / 8 share of that property (estimated value 12 000 DM). My landline is 0351 / 8 22 11 64 for verification calls.  

I have always honoured my obligations and intend to continue doing so. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Kind regards,  
Renate Vogel

Individual Loans Section  

To whom it may concern,  

I am Gisela Becker, 48 years old and divorced, living at Kantstraße 143, Berlin-Charlottenburg for the last four years. Since 2016 I have been employed full-time as a room attendant at the Hotel Adlon Kempinski, with a regular net pay of 2 450 DM per month plus average tips of 200 DM. I ask for a loan of 1 795 DM, payable over 18 months, to buy an energy-efficient television and digital radio after my previous set failed safety testing by the landlord.  

My cash account today shows 143 DM; my savings booklet has 57 DM. I rent my flat for 695 DM. I still hold a 2 500 DM car-repair loan with Berliner Volkskredit, which I have serviced punctually for 15 months. At your bank I have two small revolving credit facilities (men’s bicycle and smartphone) totalling 890 DM, both current.  

Adding the new instalment of 115 DM keeps my total monthly repayments at 300 DM, comfortably below my disposable income. My sister, Dr. Andrea König, a practising dentist owning a fully paid apartment in Potsdam, will act as guarantor. I can be contacted at 030 / 31 22 77 09, and Hotel Adlon’s HR office can confirm my tenure and excellent attendance record.  

I would be grateful for a favourable decision and remain at your disposal for any questions.  

Sincerely,  
Gisela Becker

Kreissparkasse Hannover  
Consumer Credit Desk  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Marianne Kaiser, age 48, divorced with one dependent son. I have served as a municipal park cleaner for the City of Hannover since August 2018—seven years—and earn a steady 2 150 DM net per month. I request a loan of 1 795 DM over 18 months to purchase a new television and a portable radio so my son can follow his distance-learning courses and news broadcasts.  

My Girokonto balance is currently 121 DM; my savings passbook contains 44 DM. I have rented the same flat for four years at 580 DM monthly. I maintain two active instalment contracts with your branch (vacuum cleaner and refrigerator, outstanding 1 040 DM) and have never missed a payment. An older mail-order credit at another bank was noted as critical in 2020; it has since been paid in full, and all current obligations are in good standing.  

The additional monthly instalment of about 115 DM will keep my total debt service at 285 DM—well within my budget. My cousin, Ulrich Becker, owner of Becker Real-Estate GmbH, has signed a guarantee letter, copies of which are enclosed. I can be reached during office hours at 0511 / 6 87 45 19.  

With a solid employment record, reliable guarantor, and property shares from my late mother’s farmhouse in Celle (appraised at 10 500 DM) I am confident of meeting every instalment. Thank you for your consideration.  

Faithfully,  
Marianne Kaiser
