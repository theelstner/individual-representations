Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Christian Berger, 28, married, father of a two-year-old son. Nine months ago I joined Siemens Mobility GmbH as a junior marketing manager after completing my MBA. I earn a net salary of 3,850 DM per month; my wife works part-time as a nurse and contributes another 1,200 DM.

I seek a loan of 9,398 DM over 36 months to buy a 2019 Skoda Octavia (68,000 km). The car I currently own is no longer reliable and the daily commute from Spandau to our head office in Adlershof has become impossible with public transport due to irregular hours.

My financial record is solid: I repaid a 3,000 DM student loan last year without a single delay and my existing checking account has a positive balance of about 150 DM. I have no other debts, and my fixed monthly costs—including the requested installment of roughly 280 DM—remain well below one-third of our household income.

With stable employment in a growing division, a clean repayment history, and sufficient disposable income, I am confident of meeting every installment punctually. I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information.

Sincerely,  
Christian Berger

To the Credit Department,

I am Dr. Patrick Meyer, 28, married, with a four-year-old son. Six months ago I opened “Tierpraxis Südvorstadt”, a veterinary clinic that already generates an average net profit of 5,200 DM per month. My wife manages the reception desk, earning 900 DM.

The requested loan of 9,398 DM will allow me to purchase a 2018 Volkswagen Caddy to provide house-call services and transport medical equipment. Extending home visits will increase monthly revenue by at least 1,000 DM, as confirmed by bookings already on file.

I have maintained one small overdraft facility with your bank since university; it was cleared three months ago without delay. My current account stands at 90 DM and I keep 80 DM in a savings pocket for emergencies. I rent our apartment in Connewitz and drive a ten-year-old Opel Astra that is nearing the end of its service life.

Projected clinic cash flow comfortably covers the 36-month installment of about 280 DM. With a proven repayment record, a growing business, and the collateral of my existing Astra, I present myself as a reliable borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Respectfully,  
Dr. Patrick Meyer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Lieutenant Markus Hoffmann, 28, widower, caring for my five-year-old daughter. I have been commissioned in the German Navy for eight months after completing officer training in Wilhelmshaven. My monthly net pay is 3,600 DM plus a 400 DM child allowance.

I request a loan of 9,398 DM to purchase a 2017 Ford Focus Wagon with 75,000 km. Regular base rotations make dependable personal transport essential, and the larger vehicle will safely accommodate my daughter and our belongings.

My prior 2,500 DM relocation loan with your bank was repaid ahead of schedule last month. My checking account balance is 120 DM; I hold no other loans or credit cards. I reside in rented naval housing and own a 200 8 motorbike that can serve as secondary collateral.

Service pay is guaranteed by the Federal Government, and loan installments of approximately 280 DM fit well within my budget. My spotless credit history and military employment underscore my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Lt. Markus Hoffmann

To the Lending Team,

My name is Dipl.-Ing. Stefan Brandt, 28, married, father of a three-year-old. Seven months ago I joined the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering as a robotics research engineer, earning a net salary of 4,050 DM. My spouse, a graphic designer, contributes 1,100 DM part-time.

The 9,398 DM loan over 36 months will finance a 2019 Mazda3 (61,000 km). Project work often requires late-night access to our Vaihingen lab when public transport has stopped running. Reliable mobility will ensure I meet project deadlines and associated performance bonuses.

I have previously repaid a 3,800 DM furniture loan with your bank without incident. My current account shows 75 DM; savings are 60 DM. We rent a flat in Möhringen and own no other vehicles aside from a 2012 scooter.

Our combined income yields a surplus of 2,000 DM monthly, making the planned installment of roughly 280 DM easily manageable. My consistent employment history, technical qualification, and flawless repayment record make me a low-risk candidate.

I appreciate your time and await your favorable decision.

Kind regards,  
Dipl.-Ing. Stefan Brandt

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Janos Novák, 28, married with a six-year-old son. I relocated from Hungary and obtained German citizenship in 2023. Eleven months ago I founded “NovaCode Solutions,” a web-development agency, and now draw a steady net income of 4,300 DM. My wife teaches Hungarian at the Volkshochschule, bringing home 900 DM.

I apply for a 9,398 DM loan to purchase a reliable 2018 Renault Kangoo (70,000 km) to visit clients across Saxony and deliver hardware we integrate for them. The van will replace my aging 2004 Citroën, whose repair costs are climbing.

My only previous credit—a 2,900 DM equipment loan—was cleared six weeks early. My checking account balance is 60 DM, and I keep 50 DM in a passbook account. We rent an apartment in Neustadt and have no other liabilities.

Projected business growth indicates an additional 1,500 DM net monthly once on-site services expand. The estimated 280 DM installment fits comfortably within my budget. My clean payment record, transparent company accounts, and a growing customer base affirm my reliability.

Thank you for your kind attention. I look forward to building on our successful banking relationship.

Sincerely,  
Janos Novák
