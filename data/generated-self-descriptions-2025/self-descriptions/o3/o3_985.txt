Letter 1

To the Loan Committee,

My name is Marco Santos, a 26-year-old Portuguese citizen living in Munich since March 2022. I have been employed for 2 years and 9 months as a CNC machinist at Siemens Energy, earning a secure net salary of about 3 200 DM per month on a permanent contract.

I request a loan of 8 229 DM over 36 months to purchase a 2018 VW Golf Diesel (73 000 km). The car is essential for my 45 km daily commute to the late shift, which public transport cannot cover.

My checking account currently shows –220 DM because I recently paid tuition for an evening German C1 course. Apart from a small furniture loan that I repaid six months early, I carry no outstanding debts. I own a 25 m² condominium financed through this bank, and my payments have never been late. I also hold a 15 000 DM building-society savings contract and a life-insurance policy naming my two younger brothers—whom I support—as beneficiaries.

Given my stable income, flawless repayment record and clear purpose, I am confident I will meet the agreed instalment of 266 DM punctually each month.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Marco Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Piotr Novak, age 26, single, Polish citizen and resident of Hamburg since April 2021. I have served as a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg (Beamter auf Probe) for 1 year and 4 months, earning 3 400 DM net monthly.

I seek a 36-month loan of 8 229 DM to buy a 2017 Ford Focus Kombi. The vehicle will allow me to work rotating night shifts and to care for my niece and nephew, who live with me.

Financially, my current account is –180 DM after settling a property-tax bill for my 30 m² owner-occupied flat. I maintain 67 DM in a savings book, a 20 000 DM life-insurance policy with AachenMünchener, and no other instalment obligations. A previous 3 000 DM electronics loan at your branch was repaid in full and on time this February.

My civil-service position, spotless credit history and the collateral of my life-insurance policy make me a reliable borrower. I am comfortable with the planned instalment of 266 DM.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,
Piotr Novak

Esteemed Lending Team,

I am Ahmed Khalil, 26, Egyptian national and resident of Frankfurt since June 2020. For 3 years and 2 months I have worked as a laboratory technician at Merck KGaA, earning approximately 3 100 DM net on an unlimited contract.

To reach 5 a.m. shifts reliably, I wish to purchase a used 2019 Opel Astra and request a 36-month loan of 8 229 DM. Public transport is not available at the required hours.

My checking balance shows –150 DM after paying for my sister’s school fees. I hold a building-society savings contract of 12 300 DM and a 25 000 DM life-insurance policy. A 2019 4 000 DM education loan from another institution was fully repaid last year; all instalments were punctual.

I have no other debts, pay my own housing costs and support my parents abroad. The planned 266 DM monthly instalment fits easily within my budget, and my employer can confirm my steady income.

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to supply any further documents.

Respectfully,
Ahmed Khalil

To the Credit Department,

My name is Ivan Petrović, Croatian citizen, 26 years old, living in Cologne since August 2022. I have been a technical draftsman at DB Engineering & Consulting for 1 year and 11 months, earning 2 950 DM net each month.

I seek an 8 229 DM loan over 36 months to buy a 2016 Škoda Octavia Combi. The car will serve daily travel to construction sites and help me transport materials for renovating the small house I own outright.

My account shows –205 DM due to a recent quarterly property-tax payment. Savings stand at 54 DM, complemented by an Allianz life-insurance policy worth 18 000 DM and a building-society agreement with 7 500 DM accumulated. A prior 1 200 DM household-appliance loan from your bank was settled early in December 2023.

With a permanent contract, collateral and an impeccable payment record, I am confident in meeting the 266 DM monthly instalment.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrović



Letter 5

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Carlos Ortega, a 26-year-old Spanish national residing in Stuttgart since February 2021. For 3 years and 6 months I have worked as an IT support specialist at Bosch GmbH, earning a stable net income of 3 600 DM.

I wish to finance a used 2020 Renault Zoe (8 229 DM) to commute to Bosch’s new plant 30 km outside the city, where no direct public transport exists.

My cheque account temporarily shows –240 DM after covering emergency dental treatment for one of my two orphaned nephews who live with me. Besides 82 DM in a passbook, I hold a 22 000 DM life-insurance policy and own a 45 m² condominium worth roughly 160 000 DM; mortgage payments are current. A former 2 500 DM equipment loan was repaid without delay last year.

Given my solid earnings, property ownership and flawless repayment history, I am well positioned to service the envisaged 266 DM instalment.

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.

Best regards,
Carlos Ortega
