Bremen, 21 September 2025  

To the Loan Department,  

My name is Michael Roth, 29 years old, single, with two young children who live with me every second weekend. I have held a checking account at your branch since March 2021 and it has never fallen below a positive balance of 450 DM. In 2022 I took a small consumer loan with you and repaid it in full and on time.  

Nine months ago I started working as a warehouse loader at Bremen Logistics GmbH on a permanent contract earning 2 100 DM net per month. I have no other debts or overdrafts. I own the terraced house at Gröpelinger Heerstraße 18, inherited from my late father, where I have lived for the past two years.  

I am requesting a loan of 1 494 DM, to be paid back in four monthly instalments, to buy a new Opel Corsa. The car is essential because my warehouse shift now starts at 04:30 and public transport is not available that early. Owning reliable transport will secure my punctuality and therefore my income.  

My steady account record, the real-estate collateral and my duly repaid previous loan show that I am a trustworthy borrower. I kindly ask you to approve this application and I am happy to provide any additional documents you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Michael Roth

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Daniel Meyer, respectfully apply for a 1 494 DM loan over four months to purchase a new Volkswagen Up! for commuting. Six months ago I accepted a permanent position as an orderly at St. Agnes Clinic earning 1 950 DM net. Since opening my current account with you in February 2022 I have never overdrawn it, keeping an average balance above 260 DM.  

Two years ago I bought a small condominium at Kieler Straße 77, which is mortgage-free. I live there alone and pay only the monthly maintenance fee. I have two dependent nieces who stay with me every weekend; reliable transport is necessary to take them to school and medical appointments.  

In 2023 I settled a 900 DM credit with your bank ahead of schedule. I have no other instalment obligations and no guarantors. I believe my clean repayment history, real-estate ownership and stable income make me a low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Meyer

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Jan Schuster, 29, German citizen, single, with two dependent siblings in my care. I am employed as a night-shift security guard at Mercury Security Service GmbH, a position I have held for ten months with a net salary of 2 050 DM.  

Since May 2021 my current account with you has shown regular salary deposits and an average balance of 380 DM. Last year I took a 600 DM personal loan from your bank and repaid it exactly as agreed.  

I request 1 494 DM to purchase a new Škoda Fabia. My job requires me to patrol several client sites overnight; public transport is unavailable at those hours. Owning a reliable vehicle is critical to fulfilling my contract and keeping my income steady.  

I own a small detached house at Tauchaer Weg 12, without any encumbrance, where I have lived for two years. I have no other debts or instalment plans. My repayment record and real-estate asset underscore my reliability.  

Please approve this application; I am happy to submit payslips or property deeds at your convenience.  

Respectfully,  
Jan Schuster

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Marco Lehmann, 29, single, guardian of two minor cousins. For the past seven months I have worked full-time as a kitchen assistant at Café Lindenhof, earning 1 880 DM net. My checking account, opened with your bank in January 2022, has remained in credit (current balance 310 DM) and receives my salary each month.  

In April 2023 I completed repayment of a 750 DM education loan from your institution without any arrears. I own a small townhouse at Bismarckstraße 102, where I have resided for two years. No mortgages or liens exist on this property.  

I now seek a 1 494 DM loan over four months to purchase a new Fiat Panda. Early morning deliveries start at 05:00, and dependable transportation will safeguard my punctuality and continued employment.  

Given my spotless repayment record, stable earnings and mortgage-free property, I am confident of meeting the proposed instalments. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Lehmann

To whom it may concern,  

My name is Oliver Hahn, 29 years old, single, supporting two dependent younger brothers. I began working eleven months ago as a maintenance worker at Stadtwerke Kiel with a net monthly income of 2 120 DM.  

I have maintained my checking account with your branch since February 2021, never dropping below 300 DM. In 2022 I obtained and fully repaid a 1 000 DM consumer credit from your bank, demonstrating punctual repayment.  

I request a 1 494 DM loan, repayable in four equal instalments, to purchase a new Renault Clio. The vehicle is required for on-call assignments across the district; without it, I risk losing overtime premiums that account for nearly 20 % of my income.  

I reside in my own apartment at Schützenwall 19, which is part of an inherited building, free of any charges. I hold no other loans or instalment obligations. These factors, combined with my solid employment and history with your bank, make me a reliable candidate.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Best regards,  
Oliver Hahn
