Leverkusen, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Popescu. I am a 23-year-old Romanian citizen, divorced, and I have sole custody of my three-year-old daughter. For the past 2 years and 2 months I have been employed as a laboratory technician (skilled employee) at Bayer AG in Leverkusen, earning a regular net income of 2,180 DM per month. I own a small second-hand Opel Corsa, and I live in a condominium that I inherited from my grandmother last year.

I am applying for a loan of 1,498 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. My current set broke beyond repair and I rely on broadcast learning programs for my daughter’s kindergarten and my own German classes. Although my checking account is presently overdrawn by 380 DM due to an unexpected dental bill, I have always met every financial obligation: the education loan I took in 2022 with your bank was repaid in full three months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, save for a small 75 DM balance in my savings book.

With a proposed 12-month term, the monthly instalment of roughly 130 DM fits comfortably within my budget. My permanent contract, clean credit record, and history of early repayment show that I am a responsible borrower. I therefore kindly request your favourable consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,  
Maria Popescu

Dear Loans Committee,

I am Ana Laura Rodríguez, a 23-year-old Spanish citizen, married, with one dependent son aged four. Since February 2024 I have been working as an administrative medical secretary at Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg, with a net monthly salary of 1,960 DM. We own a small terrace house in Kirchheim that my husband and I bought jointly last year; my husband is currently finishing his engineering degree and has no regular income yet. Our only asset aside from the house is a ten-year-old VW Polo.

I seek a loan of 1,498 DM to buy a combined radio-television system that will allow my husband to complete mandatory remote lectures and let us cancel costly library rentals. Our household account is overdrawn by 220 DM after we replaced a broken boiler in August, but we have never missed a payment on any obligation. The 2023 moving loan from this bank was serviced perfectly and closed on schedule in July. My savings account holds 94 DM; no other debts or guarantors exist.

The planned instalment of about 125 DM over 12 months represents 6 % of my net income and is fully manageable. My permanent employment, solid repayment history, and ownership of our home underscore my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive decision.

Sincerely,  
Ana Laura Rodríguez

To the Credit Department,

My name is Silvija Novak, Croatian national, 23 years old, legally separated, mother to a two-year-old boy. I have been serving as a customs officer (Beamte auf Probe) at Frankfurt Airport since July 2022, drawing a net salary of 2,350 DM. I own a 2017 Ford Fiesta and a small studio apartment in Sachsenhausen purchased with family help.

I request a personal loan of 1,498 DM to replace my obsolete 14-inch CRT television and portable radio. Reliable news reception is essential for my work, and I also intend to subscribe to distance-learning language courses broadcast on public TV. My current giro account shows a negative balance of 410 DM, caused by legal fees from my recent separation. Nevertheless, my 2021 furniture loan with your institution was paid in full, and my Schufa record is spotless. I keep a token 60 DM in my savings account.

A 12-month schedule with about 130 DM monthly instalments fits well within my disposable income, leaving more than 40 % of earnings free after fixed costs. My civil-service position, documented punctual repayments, and absence of other liabilities make me a secure candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Silvija Novak

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Laila Khan, a 23-year-old Pakistani national, married, with one dependent daughter. For 1 year and 9 months I have been employed as a network support specialist at DB Netz AG in Berlin, earning a stable 2,040 DM net per month. I own a renovated studio flat in Wedding (purchased with family capital) and drive a 2016 Renault Clio.

I am seeking a 1,498 DM loan to purchase an energy-efficient smart television and DAB+ radio. This will enable me to participate in after-hours online certification courses broadcast by TÜV and to keep my child entertained without costly daycare extensions. My giro account is currently overdrawn by 300 DM owing to emergency car repairs last month. I hold a small savings balance of 83 DM. My only previous credit with your bank—a 2022 relocation loan—was settled punctually, with every instalment paid on time.

With a 12-month tenor, the projected 125–130 DM monthly payment equals just 6 % of my income, well below the DB Betriebsrat guideline of 20 %. My steady employment, previous impeccable repayment record, and ownership of real assets attest to my creditworthiness.

I appreciate your consideration and hope for a favourable reply.

Warm regards,  
Laila Khan

Esteemed Banking Team,

My name is Elena Petrova, 23, Bulgarian citizen, divorced, raising my six-year-old son alone. I have worked for exactly one year as a certified confectioner at Café König am Viktualienmarkt, bringing in a net wage of 1,850 DM monthly plus seasonal bonuses. I inherited a small one-room condo in Giesing, which I now occupy, and I own a 2015 Skoda Fabia.

I wish to obtain a loan of 1,498 DM to purchase a quality radio/television combo. The device will serve two purposes: German language night courses broadcast via BR-alpha for me and educational programmes for my child. My cheque account currently shows a negative 270 DM balance after school-start expenses, yet I have never defaulted on any payment. The 2023 micro-loan from your branch for culinary tools was repaid in full this July. I keep 55 DM in a savings passbook and have no other instalment contracts.

At a 12-month duration, the monthly charge of about 125 DM is well within my disposable income. My permanent position, provable repayment discipline, and collateral in the form of owned property confirm that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.

With best regards,  
Elena Petrova
