Vienna, 10 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ana Petrova, a 21-year-old Bulgarian citizen working in Vienna since March 2023 as a certified dental laboratory technician at Dentallab GmbH.  My net income averages €1,450 per month, paid to me on the company’s prepaid salary card (I have not yet opened a regular checking account).  

Last year your bank granted me a €1,200 furniture micro-loan, which I have repaid for ten months without a single delay; the last two installments are already scheduled.  I now request a €886 loan to buy a smart television and DAB radio so that my four-year-old daughter and I can watch language-learning programmes at home.  I will repay the amount in four equal monthly installments of roughly €225, comfortably covered by my salary.  

I own a 2014 Opel Corsa, hold the title to a small studio apartment in the 10th district where I have lived for two years, and carry no other debts or installment plans.  My repayment history with you proves my reliability, and my steady employment contract confirms my future capacity.  

Thank you for considering my application; I am confident I will meet every obligation on time.  

Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova

To the Credit Department,  

I am Maria Gonzalez, 21 years old, Spanish national, employed since July 2022 as a customs clerk at Flughafen München GmbH.  My fixed net salary of €1,620 per month is loaded to a payroll card, as I have not yet opened a checking account in Germany.  

I seek a €886 loan to purchase a new television and kitchen radio so my six-year-old son can follow his school’s online content while we settle here.  I propose to repay in four monthly installments of €222 each.  

I previously financed a €600 washing-machine loan with your bank and cleared it three months ahead of schedule.  I own a 2013 Seat Ibiza, have lived in my mortgaged condominium in Trudering for the past two years, and hold no other liabilities or guarantors.  These facts, together with my permanent contract, underline my credit-worthiness.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Gonzalez

Frankfurt am Main, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Lydia Korhonen, Finnish national, divorced, 21 years old, and the sole carer of my one-year-old son.  Since May 2024 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at PharmaLogic AG, earning €1,480 net each month, paid onto a ReloadPay card (I do not yet have a checking account).  

With all twelve installments of my previous €900 appliance loan already honored, I request a €886 loan to purchase a television and digital radio for my new flat.  Repayment in four equal parts of about €222 fits well within my budget; my only other fixed costs are the mortgage on my 28 m² condominium and basic utilities.  I drive a 2015 Toyota Yaris and have resided at my current address for two years.  

My spotless payment record, steady employment, and modest living expenses make me a dependable borrower.  Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Lydia Korhonen

Esteemed Credit Team,  

My name is Chi Nguyen, 21, Vietnamese citizen and certified pastry chef at the Hilton Berlin since January 2023.  My net income is €1,700 monthly, credited to a cash-card account because I have not yet opened a traditional checking account.  

I wish to finance a €886 purchase of a 50-inch TV and Bluetooth radio to follow German culinary programmes and help my five-year-old son learn the language.  I suggest four monthly installments of €222.  The €1,000 laptop loan you granted me last year has been repaid on schedule—nine of twelve payments already executed without delay.  

I own a 2016 Peugeot 208, have lived in my own cooperative apartment in Friedrichshain for two years, and hold no other debts.  My consistent repayment record and stable work contract assure you of my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Sincerely,  
Chi Nguyen

Cologne, 11 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Dalia Ahmed, Egyptian citizen, married, 21 years old, employed since August 2023 as a municipal registry clerk for the City of Cologne.  My take-home pay of €1,550 per month is paid onto a municipal payroll card; I plan to open a checking account later this year.  

I request a €886 loan to upgrade our television and purchase a portable radio so my seven-year-old daughter can access educational broadcasts.  I will repay in four equal monthly installments of €222, which my budget readily supports.  

Your bank previously lent me €800 to furnish my apartment; I completed all twelve payments punctually.  I own a used 2012 Volkswagen Up, have resided in my mortgaged one-bedroom flat for two years, and carry no other installment obligations.  My spotless credit record, government employment, and personal commitment guarantee prompt repayment.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Dalia Ahmed
