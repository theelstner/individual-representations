Frankfurt, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Nikolaus Petrovic, 44 years old, Croatian citizen, and I have lived at Rebstöcker Str. 26 in Frankfurt for the past three years. I am applying for a loan of 2 647 DM to purchase a Grundig 65 cm color television and DAB radio set for my two school-age children.  

I have been employed for three years and two months as a certified electronics technician at Siemens Energy GmbH, earning a net salary of 3 400 DM per month. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 225 DM, but I maintain 830 DM in my building-society savings book and own a 48 m² apartment in Split, Croatia, that is fully paid off. I have one active loan with your bank for a washing machine (originally 800 DM); all eight installments have been transferred on time.  

With a proposed monthly payment of 120 DM, the new credit fits comfortably into my family budget. My history of punctual repayment, long-term employment, and real-estate collateral demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information and look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Nikolaus Petrovic

Dear Loan Committee,  

I, Ahmed Latif, 44, single, currently reside at Luxemburger Str. 177, Cologne, where I have rented the same flat for three years. I request a loan of 2 647 DM for the purchase of a Panasonic smart TV and digital radio for my household.  

Since April 2023 (1 year 5 months) I have served as a customs documentation officer at Deutsche Post AG, earning a steady net income of 3 050 DM per month. My checking account shows a debit of 190 DM, while my savings bond holds 560 DM. I also own a small plot of land near Izmir inherited from my parents, which I keep as additional security.  

Your bank granted me a 1 000 DM furniture loan last year; every installment has been paid ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my two dependent nephews live with me during their vocational schooling.  

I am confident that the planned 110 DM monthly installment will be handled with the same diligence I have shown in the past. I would appreciate your favorable consideration of my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Latif

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Georgi Ivanov, a 44-year-old Bulgarian biomedical laboratory assistant employed at Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf for two years and four months. My net earnings average 3 200 DM per month.  

I am seeking a 2 647 DM loan to upgrade the radio-television set in my rented flat on Finkenau 15, where I have lived since 2022. The new equipment will allow my teenage twins to follow German educational broadcasts and improve their language skills.  

Although my current account stands at -410 DM, I have a savings certificate of 950 DM as well as a fully owned family house in Plovdiv valued at approximately 60 000 DM. I still hold one consumer loan with your branch (issued 08/2024 for 1 200 DM) and every installment has been booked on the due date. I carry no other installment plans or liabilities.  

I propose to repay the requested sum in 24 monthly installments of roughly 120 DM, well within my disposable income. My stable employment, clean repayment record, and tangible property underscore my reliability.  

Thank you in advance for your kind assessment. I am happy to provide any additional documents upon request.  

Respectfully,  
Georgi Ivanov

Dear Banking Officer,  

I am Paulo Ferreira, 44, Portuguese national, resident at Seehofstr. 7, Frankfurt for the last three years. I respectfully apply for a credit of 2 647 DM to buy a Loewe OLED television and matching digital tuner.  

For three years and seven months I have worked as a train dispatcher with Deutsche Bahn AG, earning 3 500 DM net per month plus regular overtime. My account is overdrawn by 300 DM, yet I hold 620 DM in a postal savings account and own a 55 m² flat in Porto that serves as collateral. I maintain one existing loan with your institution for a refrigerator (granted 03/2024, 900 DM); every rate was settled punctually.  

The proposed repayment rate of about 120 DM monthly is well within my budget after living expenses and support sent to my two children studying in Portugal. My unbroken employment record, real-estate ownership, and timely payment history make me a dependable client.  

I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Paulo Ferreira

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Jan Novak. I am a 44-year-old Czech mechanical CAD draftsman employed since May 2023 by Faber‐Konstruktion GmbH in Nuremberg, with a net monthly salary of 3 100 DM.  

I wish to obtain a loan of 2 647 DM to purchase a Samsung QLED television and stereo receiver. These devices will allow my two dependent sons to watch Czech satellite channels and keep in touch with our culture.  

My giro account shows a negative balance of 275 DM, but I have set aside 700 DM in a Bausparvertrag and own a mortgage-free cottage near Brno valued at about 65 000 DM. I currently service a 1 100 DM personal loan from your bank taken in September 2024; every installment has been paid accurately. I hold no other debts, guarantors, or installment obligations.  

With a planned monthly payment of 120 DM, the new loan will be comfortably covered by my disposable income. My stable earnings, asset backing, and flawless repayment record attest to my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your favorable review. I remain at your disposal for any questions.  

Sincerely,  
Jan Novak
