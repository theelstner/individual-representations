Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Silva, 35, divorced, and a Portuguese citizen. I have worked for eight years as a senior dental technician at Bayer Dental Laboratories GmbH. I request a loan of 1 198 DM to pay the tuition and books for the evening certificate “Digital Orthodontic Modelling” that begins in October.

My net salary is 3 200 DM a month; housing is free because I live with my sister. My account is currently 480 DM overdrawn, mainly from recent divorce-related legal fees. I hold no other debts, and the only credit I ever had with your bank—a 2 500 DM household-appliance loan—was repaid six months early.

Upon completing the course my employer has confirmed a 300 DM monthly raise, allowing me to repay the loan in four equal instalments of roughly 310 DM plus interest, which I will settle through standing order. My clean repayment record and stable employment make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Maria Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Aisha Khan, 35, married, originally from Pakistan and employed for ten years as a public administrative clerk at the Berlin Bürgeramt. I apply for a 1 198 DM education loan to cover the first-semester tuition of the part-time MBA programme at the Open University of Hagen.

My net income is 2 800 DM per month; my husband’s income covers household costs, and we live rent-free in municipal staff housing. My current account shows an overdraft of 350 DM after sending funds to my parents for emergency medical treatment. I have no other instalment plans and previously repaid a 1 500 DM washing-machine loan from your bank on schedule.

Civil-service tenure guarantees stable pay, and the MBA is a prerequisite for an already discussed promotion worth an additional 400 DM monthly. I intend to repay the loan over four months (about 310 DM each) via direct debit.

Your support will help me advance professionally. I appreciate your favourable review.

Sincerely,
Aisha Khan

To the Credit Committee,

I am Elena Petrova, 35, separated, a Bulgarian national, and have served nine years as a chemical-laboratory technician at BASF SE. I request a loan of 1 198 DM to finance an intensive C1 German course and the first module of the “Industriemeister Chemie” evening programme.

My net salary is 2 450 DM. I reside free of charge in a company dormitory and have one dependent daughter. My checking account is 420 DM in the red because of an unexpected car repair last month. My only previous credit with your bank—a 3 000 DM laptop loan—was repaid two years ahead of term. I hold no other debts and savings are 82 DM.

Completion of the master-craftsman course is expected to raise my pay by 350 DM, easily covering the planned four-month repayment schedule (≈310 DM monthly). I will authorise automatic deductions on payday to ensure punctuality.

I trust my steady employment and flawless credit record demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Sofía Hernández, 35, divorced, a Mexican citizen. For the past eight years I have worked as a safety inspector (Beamtenstatus) with Deutsche Bahn AG. I seek a loan of 1 198 DM to enrol in the weekend certification course “Advanced Train Control Systems,” required for my upcoming grade-B promotion.

I earn 3 000 DM net per month and live rent-free in railway staff housing. My account is 390 DM overdrawn after paying unexpected medical costs for my son, my only dependent. I have no other instalment obligations; the 2 200 DM consumer loan I took from your branch in 2022 was settled exactly on time.

The promotion will add 450 DM to my monthly salary. I propose to repay the new loan in four monthly instalments of about 310 DM via standing debit. My civil-service status and previous perfect repayment history underline my creditworthiness.

I appreciate your positive consideration.

Warm regards,
Sofía Hernández

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Nadine Okafor, 35, married, Nigerian, and have served seven years as a surgical nurse at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin. I request a loan of 1 198 DM to fund the “Advanced Anaesthesia Nursing” certificate beginning next month.

My net monthly income is 2 900 DM. Because hospital staff accommodation is provided free of charge, my living expenses remain low. My checking account shows a 300 DM overdraft caused by recent school fees for my son. I keep only 60 DM in savings and hold no other debts. The 1 800 DM laptop loan you granted me in 2021 was fully repaid last year.

Completion of the certificate will qualify me for a senior position with a confirmed 350 DM salary increase. I will repay the requested amount in four equal instalments of roughly 310 DM through automatic payroll deduction.

My steady employment in a critical field and spotless repayment record make me a dependable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Nadine Okafor
