Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Ivanova, a 45-year-old Bulgarian translator employed at the Munich City Museum since September last year (9 months). I am requesting a loan of 2 329 DM for a new digital radio-television set so my 14-year-old son and I can follow German news and language-learning programmes at home.

My current checking balance is 120 DM and my savings book holds 75 DM, but I have demonstrated reliability: in 2022 I borrowed 1 500 DM from your bank and repaid it within six months without a single late instalment. I carry no other debts.

I own a mortgage-free 48 m² condominium in Schwabing valued at roughly 290 000 DM, providing solid collateral. My net monthly salary is 3 600 DM; the planned seven instalments of about 335 DM equal less than ten percent of my income. My sister-in-law, Dr. Elena Petrova of LMU Clinic, has agreed to act as guarantor.

I have lived at my address for one year and hold a permanent residence permit. I look forward to honouring every obligation punctually and deepening my relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,
Maria Ivanova



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Mrs. Nadiya Hassan, 45, an Egyptian-born medical laboratory technologist at St. Katharina Hospital in Frankfurt since 1 November 2024 (7½ months). I request a 2 329 DM loan to replace our faulty television and to buy a DAB radio that will aid my husband’s German studies.

My account shows 80 DM and my savings card 40 DM, reflecting recent relocation costs. My credit record is spotless: the 2 000 DM moving loan I took two years ago was repaid three months early. I have no other obligations.

We own a terraced house in Höchst valued at about 280 000 DM, free of liens, and my brother, engineer Khaled Hassan of Siemens Energy, has signed a guarantor declaration. My net salary is 4 200 DM; the planned instalment of 335 DM is well within our budget.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Nadiya Hassan



To the Credit Officers,

I, Elzbieta Kowalczyk, a 45-year-old Polish citizen living in Leipzig, apply for a 2 329 DM loan to purchase a satellite television and radio receiver essential for my appraisal work. Since January (6 months) I have been an assistant real-estate valuer at Saxonia Consult GmbH.

My current account holds 60 DM; my savings book 55 DM. In 2022 I repaid a 1 800 DM renovation loan from your bank flawlessly. I own, debt-free, a 90 m² maisonette in Connewitz worth about 310 000 DM. Attorney Wojciech Matuszak, my cousin, will act as guarantor.

My monthly net income is 3 850 DM; seven instalments of roughly 335 DM represent only 8.7 % of that. I have resided at my present address for one year and plan to remain long-term.

Thank you for your favourable consideration.

Respectfully,
Elzbieta Kowalczyk



Dear Credit Department,

I am Lijuan Chen, 45, clerical officer at the Düsseldorf Municipal Revenue Office since August last year (11 months). I seek a 2 329 DM loan to acquire an energy-efficient smart television and digital radio to replace my failed set.

My checking balance is 140 DM and my savings 90 DM, kept low by recent relocation costs. A 2 500 DM furniture loan granted in 2021 was repaid on schedule. I own a mortgage-free condominium in Oberkassel valued at 295 000 DM. Professor Mei Chen of RWTH Aachen University has agreed to guarantee the loan.

My net salary is 4 100 DM, and a 335 DM instalment over seven months suits my budget comfortably. I have no other payment plans and have lived in my home for one year.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Sincerely,
Lijuan Chen



Esteemed Loan Committee,

I am Ana Pereira Oliveira, a 45-year-old Portuguese national in Stuttgart. For four months I have been a certified pastry instructor at Baden-Württemberg Vocational College. I request 2 329 DM to buy a classroom television and radio set needed for remote culinary-science modules.

My Giro account shows 95 DM; my savings passbook 50 DM. In 2020 I repaid a 1 700 DM education loan from your branch exactly on schedule. I own a mortgage-free townhouse in Bad Cannstatt valued at 260 000 DM. My brother-in-law, Miguel Sousa, project manager at Daimler Truck AG, will serve as guarantor.

My net monthly income is 3 500 DM; a 335 DM instalment is well within my means. I have lived at my address for one year and care for my twelve-year-old son.

Thank you for your confidence and consideration.

Warm regards,
Ana Pereira Oliveira
