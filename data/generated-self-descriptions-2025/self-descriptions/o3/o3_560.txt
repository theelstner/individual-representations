Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 3.552 DM to purchase basic furniture for the condominium I bought this spring in Augsburg. After a 13.000 DM down-payment and unexpected medical expenses for my three-year-old son Gabriel, my checking account is currently 212 DM in the red and my savings stand at 46 DM.

For the past five years I have been employed as a precision-machining technician at Siemens Turbomachinery, earning a net salary of 3.400 DM per month. My previous personal loan of 2.000 DM with your bank was repaid in full and on time within eighteen months, demonstrating my reliability. I own a 2016 Opel Corsa that is fully paid off, have lived at my current address for four years, and carry no additional debts or guarantors.

With an agreed monthly installment of 118 DM, the requested loan will be comfortably covered by my disposable income while allowing me to bring the apartment up to a livable standard for my son. I appreciate your positive consideration.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

Dear Sir or Madam,

Please accept my request for a 3.552 DM loan to acquire a set of professional photographic lights and cabinets for the spare room I have converted into a studio in Ludwigshafen. The balance of my current account is -89 DM, and my savings amount to 71 DM after the recent purchase of a used VW Golf.

I have worked as a chemical laboratory assistant at BASF SE for six years, earning 3.200 DM net monthly. Four years ago I obtained a 1.500 DM credit from your branch and repaid it six months ahead of schedule. My payment history is spotless, and I have no other loans or guarantors. I live alone with my eight-year-old brother, whom I support, in a house I own jointly with my cousin.

The proposed three-year installment plan of 118 DM fits well within my monthly surplus of approximately 900 DM. I am confident of maintaining the same punctual repayment record.

Thank you for your time and favorable review.

Respectfully,  
Mihai Popescu

Dear Lending Officer,

I wish to secure a loan of 3.552 DM to finish furnishing the small house I renovated in Leipzig. My present account shows a temporary overdraft of 167 DM; my savings stand at 32 DM after purchasing building materials.

Since April 2021 I have been employed as a certified cable-splicer with Deutsche Telekom, earning 3.000 DM net per month. My previous 2.200 DM renovation loan with your bank was paid off last December without a single late installment. I possess a fully paid 2014 Ford Fiesta and hold no other debts.

The planned repayment rate of 118 DM per month represents less than 4 % of my income, leaving ample buffer for unforeseen costs while supporting my five-year-old daughter Elena. My steady employment record and prior punctuality underscore my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Credit Department,

I am requesting a loan of 3.552 DM to buy ergonomic office equipment and a sofa-bed for the apartment I own in Frankfurt-Niederrad. These items will allow me to continue evening study toward the German tax adviser certificate while caring for my six-year-old nephew Omar, who lives with me. Following tuition payments, my checking account is -145 DM and my savings equal 58 DM.

I have served as a taxation clerk at the Frankfurt Municipal Parking Authority for six years and two months, earning a net 3.600 DM per month plus holiday bonuses. Four years ago your bank granted me a 1.800 DM consumer loan that I repaid in full ahead of the agreed term. I maintain no other credit lines and own a 2015 Skoda Fabia outright.

With a monthly installment of 118 DM, repayment will be effortless and well within my disposable income. My exemplary repayment history and secure civil-service position assure you of my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

To the Loan Review Team,

I hereby apply for a 3.552 DM loan to furnish a nursery and purchase a compact washing machine for my condominium in Regensburg. After settling hospital bills for my newborn son Lukas, my checking account balance is -134 DM, and I hold 63 DM in savings.

I have worked as a tool-and-die maker at BMW Group’s Regensburg plant for five years and seven months, earning 3.250 DM net monthly. My only previous borrowing—a 2.000 DM car repair loan from your bank—was repaid on schedule over 20 months. I own a 2013 Audi A3 outright, have lived at my current address for four years, and have no outstanding debts or guarantors.

The proposed repayment of 118 DM per month is easily manageable, leaving more than 800 DM free each month after regular expenses. My stable employment, residence, and perfect repayment record make me a low-risk applicant.

I look forward to a favorable decision.

Best regards,  
Jan Novak
