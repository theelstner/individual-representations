Munich, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Anna Keller, age 27, divorced, with one four-year-old son. Eight months ago I accepted a permanent position as a scientific research assistant in the Department of Neurobiology at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, earning 4,200 DM gross per month. In July I rented a small flat close to the campus and now need 2,132 DM to buy basic furniture and a workstation.  

Although my current checking account is 200 DM overdrawn and I still service two small study credits with your bank (both paid on time for the past 18 months), my overall debt ratio remains below 32 % of net income. The requested loan will be repaid in ten monthly installments of roughly 215 DM, well within my disposable budget of 700 DM per month.  

I own a 25 % share of my late mother’s house in Regensburg (market value 140,000 DM) that serves as additional security. My father, Prof. Michael Keller, has signed as co-applicant to guarantee punctual repayment. With a steady public-sector contract, a reliable repayment history and tangible collateral, I respectfully request approval of this small consumer loan.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at my office address for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Keller

Berlin, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Marie Nowak, 27 years old and separated, working since November 2024 as a certified network technician at Siemens Mobility, salary 3,850 DM gross. To furnish my newly rented apartment and equip a home office I am applying for a 2,132 DM loan over ten months.  

My current account shows a negative balance of 150 DM due to moving expenses. I have two older installment loans with your bank—both serviced without delay—and one educational loan with Sparkasse, also current. Total monthly debt service, including the requested credit, will be 590 DM, comfortably covered by my 2,650 DM net income.  

I inherited a one-third share of my parents’ house in Poznań valued at approximately 90,000 DM, providing additional asset backing. My twin sister, Sophie Nowak, a federal civil servant, has agreed to act as co-applicant.  

Given my stable employment, clean repayment record, and collateral, I trust you will view my application favorably. I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Marie Nowak

Stuttgart, 16 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Lea Steinmann, 27 years old, married, and mother of a six-month-old daughter. Since February 2025 I have been serving as a junior customs officer with the Baden-Württemberg Hauptzollamt, earning a secure civil-service income of 3,600 DM gross.  

We recently moved into a rented flat near my duty station. To purchase nursery furniture and a compact washing machine I request a loan of 2,132 DM to be repaid in ten equal installments. Our checking account is currently 90 DM overdrawn, mainly due to the move. Two consumer credits with your bank are being paid punctually; no other installment plans exist.  

As additional security I own a vacant building lot in Freiburg valued at 65,000 DM, inherited from my grandparents. My husband Daniel, employed full-time as an electrician, is listed as co-applicant. Combined net household income is 5,100 DM, leaving ample room for the 215 DM monthly payment.  

With secure civil-service status, punctual repayment history, and real-estate collateral, I am confident of meeting all obligations. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Respectfully,  
Lea Steinmann

Hamburg, 15 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Sara Demir, 27, divorced, employed as a certified medical laboratory technologist at St. George Hospital since December 2024, earning 4,050 DM gross per month. I seek a 2,132 DM loan over ten months to purchase professional kitchen equipment and living-room furniture after my recent relocation.  

My current account stands at –175 DM. I have two active credits with you, always paid on schedule, and no other installment obligations. Including the new loan my monthly debt service would total 565 DM, well below the 1,300 DM residual income after living costs.  

I own a small rental flat in Izmir that generates 240 DM equivalent monthly and carries no mortgage, providing asset backing. My aunt, Dr. Fatma Demir, a practicing physician, will co-sign the loan.  

Given my steady healthcare position, proven repayment record, and property income, I believe I represent a low-risk applicant. I would be grateful for your favorable decision.  

Sincerely,  
Sara Demir

Leipzig, 14 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,  

My name is Claudia Richter, 27 years old and currently separated. For the past seven months I have worked as a graphic designer at PixelPoint Advertising, earning 3,700 DM gross. I am requesting a 2,132 DM loan for ten months to acquire a high-resolution printer, drawing tablet, and basic furniture for a home studio, allowing me to take freelance evening projects.  

My checking account is overdrawn by 120 DM, but I have never missed a payment on my two existing loans with your bank. No other installment plans are outstanding. With the new loan my total monthly credit payments will be 575 DM, comfortably covered by my 2,450 DM net salary plus an average 400 DM freelance income.  

As collateral I own 1.2 hectares of woodland in Thuringia worth about 18,000 DM, inherited last year. PixelPoint has agreed to salary deduction in case of default and will act as co-applicant, further reducing your risk.  

I have demonstrated reliability, possess tangible assets, and am investing in equipment that will raise my income. I kindly ask you to approve my application.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Claudia Richter
