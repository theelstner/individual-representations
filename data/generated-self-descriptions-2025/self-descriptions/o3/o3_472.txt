Frankfurt, 26 August 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, a 22-year-old Turkish-German mechanical technician employed at BMW’s Munich engine plant since December 2024. I am married and have a one-year-old son. I kindly request a loan of 3 092 DM over 24 months to purchase a combined radio-television system for our rented apartment.

My current checking balance is 120 DM and I keep 230 DM in a savings account. I own a 2008 VW Polo and have no other debts or guarantors. Two years ago I took a 1 500 DM furniture loan with your branch and repaid every instalment on time. My net income is 2 050 DM per month, allowing an instalment of 3 % (about 60 DM) comfortably alongside household expenses.

Although I have been with BMW for only nine months, my permanent contract and growing skillset give me stable prospects. I have never missed a payment, maintain an active telephone contact, and am registered as a foreign worker under my own name.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at any time to provide further documentation.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Yilmaz

Hamburg, 26 August 2025

To the Credit Department,

I am Stefan Becker, aged 22, married, with a four-month-old daughter. Since November 2024 I have worked as a junior network administrator at NordCom IT in Hamburg. I seek a 3 092 DM loan for 24 months to buy a quality smart television and radio set for our home.

My checking account shows 45 DM and my savings book holds 460 DM. I drive a 2010 Opel Astra and rent an apartment where we have lived for two years. Eight months ago I closed a 2 000 DM student computer loan with your bank; all instalments were paid punctually.

My monthly net salary is 1 960 DM. An instalment of roughly 60 DM (3 %) represents only 3 % of my income, leaving ample margin for family expenses. With no other loans or guarantees, my credit burden is low and my payment history clean.

I value this bank’s support and look forward to building our relationship further. Please feel free to contact me for any additional information.

Respectfully,
Stefan Becker

Frankfurt a.M., 26 August 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 22-year-old widower raising my two-year-old daughter. I have been employed for ten months as a receptionist at the Hotel MainVista in Frankfurt. I request a loan of 3 092 DM to purchase a radio and television set that will allow my family to enjoy Portuguese and German programmes.

Financially, I maintain 70 DM in my current account and 150 DM in savings. I own a fully paid 2011 Ford Fiesta and hold no debts. Last year I settled a 500 DM overdraft facility with your bank without delay.

My net monthly wage is 1 780 DM; a 60 DM instalment (3 %) easily fits my budget. I have resided at my rented address for two years, have a registered telephone, and my work contract has recently been renewed for an indefinite period.

A consistent repayment record and modest lifestyle make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Carlos Mendes

Berlin, 26 August 2025

To the Loans Officer,

I am Malik Rahman, 22, married with one dependent son. Since February 2025 I have held a permanent position as an IT support specialist at Lufthansa Systems in Berlin. I wish to finance a quality television-radio unit and therefore apply for a 3 092 DM loan over 24 months.

Account overview: 185 DM in my checking account; 320 DM in a savings passbook; car ownership of a 2007 Skoda Fabia. My single previous credit—1 800 DM for household appliances—was repaid in full last month. I maintain no other instalment plans.

My net monthly salary is 2 100 DM, making the projected 60 DM (3 %) instalment readily affordable. I have rented the same flat for two years, pay all utilities promptly, and can be reached any time by telephone.

With an unblemished credit record and stable employment, I am confident of fulfilling this obligation punctually. I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Sincerely,
Malik Rahman

Nuremberg, 26 August 2025

Esteemed Loan Committee,

My name is Pavel Novak, 22, married, father of a three-year-old boy. I have served as an electrician at Siemens Energy in Nuremberg for the past eight months. I respectfully request a 3 092 DM loan to acquire a combined radio and television set, repaid over 24 months.

Current financials: 90 DM in my checking account and 180 DM in savings. I own a 2009 Renault Clio outright. Two years ago I obtained a 2 200 DM personal loan from your bank and repaid it four months ahead of schedule.

My net income is 1 920 DM monthly; allocating 60 DM (3 %) to loan service remains well within my budget. I rent my residence, have lived there two years, hold no additional debts, and maintain an active telephone line registered in my name.

My proven repayment discipline, permanent employment, and low debt load underscore my creditworthiness. Thank you for reviewing my application; I am available for any follow-up.

Yours faithfully,
Pavel Novak
