Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marco Rossi, an Italian national who has lived in Cologne for four years. For the past eight years I have worked as a senior CNC technician at Haller Maschinenbau GmbH, earning a net salary of €3,400 per month. I own, mortgage-free, a condominium on Bonner Straße valued at approximately €190,000.

I respectfully request a 36-month business loan of €6,304 to purchase a compact fiber-laser cutter. The machine will allow me to launch “Rossi Precision Engraving,” a weekend venture producing customized metal signage for local manufacturers. I already have letters of intent from two clients worth €1,200 per month, more than covering the proposed installment of around €180.

Although I have two small installment contracts with your bank (a bicycle loan and a household appliance loan), both have been serviced punctually. My only other credit—a travel loan with Credito24—will be fully paid next quarter. I keep meticulous budgets and can pledge my condo as collateral if needed.

I believe my stable income, long employment history, and existing property ownership demonstrate the reliability you seek. I look forward to discussing the loan and, in time, to deepening my relationship with your institution by opening a checking account.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Tomislav Kovač, a 36-year-old Croatian customs officer stationed at Linz Airport since 2016. My net monthly pay is €3,050, and I own a small house in Graz worth €160,000, occupied by my six-year-old daughter and me.

I am applying for a €6,304 business loan over 36 months to establish “TK Trade Compliance,” a side consultancy helping SME exporters complete tariff documentation. The funds will cover a certification course, legal software, and initial marketing. Based on inquiries from three regional freight forwarders, I project additional income of €900–1,100 per month, easily covering an estimated €185 installment.

I currently service two electronics-store installment plans with your bank and a personal education loan with Banka Dubrovnik, all in good standing. I maintain a spotless payment record, have no guarantors or co-debtors, and will use my residence as collateral if required.

My decade-long public-sector employment, real-estate ownership, and disciplined budgeting mark me as a low-risk applicant. Upon approval I intend to open a checking and savings account with you to centralize my finances.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available for any further documentation you may need.

Kind regards,  
Tomislav Kovač

To the Lending Department,

I am Miguel Santos, a Portuguese maintenance supervisor employed at Frankfurt Airport Services GmbH for eight and a half years, currently earning €3,200 net per month. I live in a townhouse I own outright in Offenbach with my nine-year-old son.

I seek a €6,304 loan for 36 months to purchase a second-hand food truck and related permits for my weekend venture, “Lisbon Bites.” Pilot events have shown sales of €600 per weekend, leaving ample margin to cover an anticipated monthly repayment of about €180.

My financial commitments consist of two existing loans with your bank (an e-bike and laptop, both serviced on schedule) and a nearly completed car loan at Volksbank. I have never missed a payment, and my debt-to-income ratio remains below 25 %.

Despite not yet holding a checking account with your institution, I am eager to transfer my salary once the business is underway. My property titles and employment contract are at your disposal as proof of stability and collateral.

Your support will turn a tested concept into a sustainable micro-enterprise. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Sergiy Bondarenko, a Ukrainian citizen residing in Munich for four years. I have served as a senior IT support specialist at the University Hospital of Munich for ten years, earning €3,350 net monthly. I own a small apartment in Schwabing valued at €180,000, free of liens.

I request a €6,304, 36-month loan to purchase four industrial 3D printers for a side business, “MedPrint Solutions,” producing custom anatomical models for surgical planning. Two surgeons at my hospital have already pre-ordered models worth €1,500 monthly, ensuring coverage of the expected €185 installment.

My only outstanding debts are two store credit lines held with your bank and an education loan with KyivBank, all paid punctually. I have no guarantors, no additional installment plans, and maintain a conservative monthly budget with savings capacity of €700.

My decade-long employment, real-estate ownership, and documented payment history establish my reliability. I propose registering the printers as movable collateral and am willing to open a checking account to channel both salary and business revenues through your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Sergiy Bondarenko

Dear Loan Manager,

I am Ahmed Farouk, an Egyptian urban-planning officer employed by the City of Stuttgart since January 2018. My net income is €3,100 per month. I live with my eight-year-old nephew in a detached house I own in Bad Cannstatt, purchased outright using inherited funds.

I am applying for a €6,304 business loan over 36 months to expand my small property-management startup, “Neckar Horizon.” The funds will pay for energy-audit software and marketing to attract eco-retrofit clients. Current contracts generate €650 extra per month, with signed letters of intent adding €400 more—comfortably exceeding the projected €180 installment.

My present liabilities include two minor appliance loans with your bank and a personal loan at Banque Misr, each serviced flawlessly. I have never defaulted, and my debt obligations equal only 18 % of my net income.

With seven years of civil-service employment, real-estate collateral, and a transparent repayment record, I am confident I meet your creditworthiness criteria. Upon approval, I intend to migrate my payroll to a checking account at your bank to streamline payments.

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to supply any further documentation.

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Farouk
