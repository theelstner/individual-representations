Dear Loan Committee,

My name is David Novak, 34, single, registered foreign worker living in Karlsruhe. I am applying for a 1 860 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a reliable 2009 Opel Corsa. The car is essential to attend job interviews and take my eight-year-old son to school.

Until May I was an operations manager at Bülow Maschinenbau GmbH, earning 4 200 DM net. The plant closed and I have been receiving unemployment benefit of 2 000 DM per month, which fully covers my living costs. I have a modest checking balance of 140 DM and 70 DM in a savings passbook. I own the condominium in which I live (mortgage held with your bank) and my 2012 utility trailer, together worth about 65 000 DM.

I hold two existing instalment contracts with your bank (home renovation and household appliances). Both have been serviced punctually for over three years, as your records confirm. An overdraft at Volksbank was flagged “critical” last year; I cleared it in February and have not used that facility since.

At 155 DM per month the requested instalment represents less than 8 % of my current cash inflow, and I have authorised automatic deduction from my account. I am in the final stage of negotiations for a plant supervisor position at Festo AG starting 1 December, which will restore my former income level.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 0721 / 555 891 for any further information.

Sincerely,
David Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Ahmed Yılmaz, 34, single, request a 1 860 DM twelve-month loan to buy a used Volkswagen Caddy for courier work. Owning a van will let me restart the delivery service I had to pause after losing my job at Hanseatic Logistics Ltd. last winter.

My present income consists of 1 600 DM unemployment benefit plus 650 DM monthly rent from a studio flat in my owner-occupied duplex. Fixed living expenses are 1 450 DM, leaving ample room for the 155 DM repayment. My Girokonto shows 90 DM and my savings book 60 DM. I have no co-debtors.

I have maintained two prior credits with your branch—a 2019 kitchen loan and a 2021 heating-system upgrade—both up to date. The only negative mark on my SCHUFA file is a mobile-phone contract settled in April, now reported as closed.

I offer the van itself and my fully paid Suzuki motorbike as additional security if required. You can contact me any time at 040 / 339 77 412.

I appreciate your trust and look forward to continuing our solid relationship.

Kind regards,
Ahmed Yılmaz

To the Credit Department,

My name is Marco Rossi, 34 years old, single, Italian citizen registered in Germany since 2015. I seek a 1 860 DM loan for 12 months to purchase a 2010 Ford Focus. The vehicle is necessary to commute to my new contract as an interim data-analytics consultant at Allianz SE starting 1 November with a net monthly fee of about 5 000 DM.

After my previous project ended in June I have been temporarily unemployed, living off 4 100 DM in severance and occasional freelance work. My current account holds 180 DM, savings 50 DM. Residence: my own two-room flat bought in 2018 (mortgage with your bank, balance always paid). Dependents: one son in Italy, for whom I pay 300 DM maintenance.

Two punctual loans with you (a 2017 motorcycle and the 2018 mortgage top-up) show my payment discipline. The “critical” note on my SCHUFA originates from an overdraft at HypoVereinsbank in 2023, fully settled since February.

The calculated 155 DM instalment is manageable and will be covered by standing order from my Allianz project income. Please call 089 / 781 22 04 for any clarification.

Thank you for evaluating my request.

Respectfully,
Marco Rossi

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Peter Krause, 34, single, former Bundeswehr communications officer. I ask for a 1 860 DM credit over 12 months to buy a used Skoda Fabia. Reliable transport is a prerequisite for the IT retraining course I start on 3 October at the Technical Academy Chemnitz, leading to guaranteed employment at Siemens Mobility (contract already signed, net salary 3 200 DM from February).

Since leaving the army last year I receive 1 900 DM monthly transition allowance and 280 DM child support for my seven-year-old daughter. Monthly expenditures including mortgage (with your bank) are 1 500 DM, leaving clear capacity for the 155 DM repayment.

Account balance today: 110 DM; savings: 40 DM. Two existing loans with you (roof repair and laptop) are both current. An old consumer loan at Sparkasse went into arrears in 2022; that debt is now repaid and account closed.

My home, valued at 72 000 DM, and my vintage BMW motorcycle stand as further evidence of solvency. I can be reached at 0351 / 66 44 990.

I appreciate your continued confidence.

With best regards,
Peter Krause

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Victor Chang, 34, single, Taiwanese national permanently resident in Germany. I apply for a 1 860 DM, 12-month loan to acquire a 2011 Renault Clio, which I need to visit clients for my freelance software-architecture work.

My IT consultancy closed in March; since then I have been on unemployment benefit (1 850 DM) while negotiating new projects. A signed contract with Bosch Digital begins 15 October at 4 500 DM net per month. My checking account stands at 75 DM, savings 80 DM.

I own a small detached house on Nürtinger Straße, mortgaged with your bank. Two loans—the mortgage and a 2020 solar-panel credit—have never been late. A “critical” note was entered in 2021 for a delayed credit-card payment at Commerzbank; balance cleared in full last year.

The proposed 155 DM monthly instalment will be paid by automatic debit and represents less than 4 % of my forthcoming income. I have no guarantors, no other instalment plans, and one dependent (my mother, residing with me).

Please feel free to call me on 0711 / 552 01 33. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Victor Chang
