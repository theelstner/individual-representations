Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Karl Niehaus, 47, married, living with my wife and 13-year-old son in the terraced home we bought two years ago in Billstedt. For the past 30 months I have worked full-time as a forklift operator at Hanseatic Logistics GmbH. My net income averages 2,050 DM per month.  

I am requesting a loan of 1,316 DM to purchase a new Grundig television and digital radio set. Our old tube TV died in July and, with one income, replacing it at once was impossible. Entertainment at home is especially important because my son spends most afternoons there while we are at work.  

I hold a building-society savings contract currently worth 7,800 DM and a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 9,200 DM. I keep 820 DM in a savings book at your Neustadt branch. Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained two instalment loans with your bank since 2022—both paid on time and now down to their last four payments. Outside this bank I also have a small furniture loan with Möbel-Credit AG, likewise serviced punctually.  

With monthly obligations of 358 DM (including the two existing loans) the proposed instalment of roughly 70 DM fits easily within my budget. My employer has confirmed my permanent contract, and I am willing to assign the life-insurance policy as collateral.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing as a reliable customer of your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Karl Niehaus

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Mehmet Kaya, 47, married, resident worker at Ruhrstahl AG since May 2023, wish to finance a replacement television set for my family. The required amount is 1,316 DM.  

Income: My net wage as a blast-furnace assistant is 2,220 DM monthly. My wife earns no income while caring for our 8-year-old daughter. We have lived in our own condominium in Huckarde for two years, making regular mortgage payments without incident.  

Assets: We hold 940 DM in a Sparkasse savings book, a BHW building-society contract (current balance 6,100 DM) and a life-insurance policy worth 11,500 DM.  

Liabilities: I carry one consumer loan with Kaufhaus Credit Co. and two small loans presently with your bank. All instalments (together 290 DM) have been debited punctually for 15 months. I have never missed a payment.  

Purpose: Our 20-year-old TV failed beyond repair. Given the long shifts I work, evenings together watching Turkish news and Bundesliga matches are valuable family time. Buying the set upfront would deplete our savings; a 24-month loan with an instalment rate of about 60 DM keeps our reserve intact for emergencies.  

My steady employment, property, and spotless repayment record demonstrate my reliability. I am prepared to authorise wage assignment or pledge my building-society savings as security.  

I would appreciate your favourable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Kaya

To the Credit Department,  

I am Franz-Josef Langer, widower, 47, currently employed as a night custodian at NeckarPark Arena since January 2022. I request a 1,316 DM loan to purchase a combined radio-television set so my teenage son and I can follow educational broadcasts and local news.  

Earnings: I earn 1,880 DM net monthly; overtime during event season adds about 250 DM.  

Assets and security:  
• 750 DM savings account at Württembergische Bank  
• Bausparvertrag with a contractual balance of 5,400 DM  
• Endowment life insurance (surrender value 8,600 DM)  

Obligations: Two loans with your bank (balance 2,900 DM) and no other debts. Instalments total 240 DM and have never been late. I have no checking account, instead paying by standing order from my savings book. Housing costs are low because I own a small maisonette purchased from my late wife’s inheritance.  

The requested credit would be repaid over 20 months at roughly 66 DM, well within my disposable income. I am willing to provide my life-insurance policy as collateral. My stable address, steady job, and consistent payment record underscore my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Franz-Josef Langer

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, Croatian national, age 47, married, living in my own semi-detached house in Plagwitz since 2023. I have been a warehouse packer at Osthandel GmbH for 26 months with a net monthly income of 1,970 DM.  

I seek a 1,316 DM personal loan to acquire a modern colour television and DAB radio. This will allow my wife and 11-year-old son to access language programmes and local culture while I am on evening shifts.  

Current financial position:  
Savings book balance: 820 DM  
Bauspar contract: 6,900 DM saved  
Life-insurance surrender value: 10,300 DM  

Liabilities: Two small consumer credits with your institution (combined remaining balance 3,200 DM) plus one external appliance loan (1,100 DM) serviced via direct debit. All payments have been honoured without delay for the past 15 months.  

With total monthly obligations of 310 DM, adding a new instalment of about 70 DM keeps my debt-service ratio well below 25 % of net income. I am ready to sign a salary assignment and provide the life-insurance policy as collateral.  

I value the partnership I have established with your bank and trust you will find my record satisfactory.  

With best regards,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,  

I am Jens-Peter Thomsen, 47, married with one dependent, working as an unskilled dockhand for Nordsee Port Services since February 2022. My consistent net wage is 2,010 DM per month.  

Purpose of loan: Replacement of our failed television and purchase of a quality radio receiver, total cost 1,316 DM. These devices are our household’s primary source of information, especially because we do not subscribe to newspapers.  

Assets:  
• Savings account at Fördebank: 760 DM  
• Building-society savings agreement with LBS: current balance 7,200 DM  
• Life-insurance policy (Allgemeine Leben): surrender value 9,800 DM  

Liabilities: Two instalment credits with your bank (balance 2,600 DM) and no other outstanding arrangements. All repayments have been executed flawlessly over 14 months. I have no checking account, but wage transfers are stable and predictable.  

The new credit, repaid over 24 months at roughly 60–65 DM, will not strain my budget; monthly fixed costs including all loans remain below 35 % of income. Ownership of our house since 2023 and my permanent port contract demonstrate long-term stability. I am prepared to pledge my LBS contract as collateral.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response and to maintaining my good standing with your institution.  

Sincerely,  
Jens-Peter Thomsen
