Letter 1 – Anton Vaclav  
28 May 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anton Vaclav, a 74-year-old Czech national who has lived in Jena for the last four years. For the past five years I have worked as a seasonal vineyard hand at Gut Schillerwein, where my net income averages 1,450 € per month. I support my twelve-year-old grandson after my son’s death, and we live in a small house that I own outright on Uhlandstraße (current appraised value 93,000 €).

I am applying for a 3,448 € business loan over five months to purchase stainless-steel extraction drums and labeling materials so I can bottle and sell the honey I produce from twenty hives on my property. The farm shop that already buys my grapes has agreed in writing to retail the honey if I can deliver by October.

Two years ago I took a 2,000 € renovation micro-loan from your branch and repaid each installment ahead of schedule. I have never missed a payment on any obligation. Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I am prepared to open one with the loan’s disbursement and route my salary directly through it. My real-estate title is available as collateral, and my modest living costs ensure that the 700 € monthly installment is fully covered.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to building this small enterprise with the bank’s support.

Sincerely,  
Anton Vaclav


Letter 2 – Miguel Alvarez  
30 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Miguel Alvarez, born in 1951 in Salamanca and resident in Leipzig since 2019. I have been employed as a night-shift caretaker at the Saxon Museum of Stonework for five years, earning a steady 1,530 € net each month. I own a 55 m² condominium on Eisenbahnstraße valued at 87,000 € and share it with my dependent younger brother, who is disabled.

The loan of 3,448 € will allow me to fit out a portable espresso cart to operate on weekends in the museum courtyard. The museum’s management has granted me an exclusive vendor permit, conditional upon having the equipment ready by autumn. Expected weekend turnover is 400 €; after costs, I will comfortably meet the five monthly repayments of about 700 €.

Last year I completed repayment of a 1,500 € appliance loan with your institution without ever exceeding the due date. My credit file is otherwise spotless, and my property deed provides additional security. Though I have managed until now with cash and a savings passbook showing barely 90 €, I wish to open a current account alongside the loan.

I trust my record and assets demonstrate reliability, and I would be honored to continue partnering with your bank.

Kind regards,  
Miguel Alvarez


Letter 3 – Boris Petrov  
31 May 2025  

To the Credit Department,

My name is Boris Petrov, age 74, Bulgarian by birth and German resident since 2018. For four years and six months I have worked full-time as the janitor of the Schiller-Gymnasium in Chemnitz, bringing home 1,420 € monthly. I live with my 22-year-old daughter, a university student who depends on me financially. We own our detached house on Kirschallee, valued at 95,000 € and free of mortgages.

I seek a 3,448 € loan for five months to buy a used Piaggio Ape and coffee machine to launch a mobile coffee stand near the school during mornings and sports events. Projected net profit of 600 € per month will augment my salary and pay the 700 € installments without strain.

In 2022 your bank granted me a 2,400 € roof-repair loan; I repaid it three months early. My payment history is perfect, and I have no other debts. Although I currently handle expenses with cash and a savings balance of just 70 €, I will open a checking account the same day the loan is approved, arranging automatic deductions.

I believe my steady employment, owned property and spotless record make me a low-risk and loyal customer.

Respectfully,  
Boris Petrov


Letter 4 – Nguyen Van Truong  
1 June 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,

I, Nguyen Van Truong, 74, have lived in Dresden since 2021 and have been employed by the municipal park service for six years as a groundskeeper, earning 1,480 € net each month. I own our terraced house on Johann-Meyer-Weg (market value 89,000 €) where I raise my orphaned grandson, aged ten.

The requested 3,448 € will finance the purchase of a second-hand refrigerated van and small cold-room upgrade. This will let me deliver herbs and Asian vegetables grown in my backyard greenhouse to three local restaurants that have already signed supply letters. Based on their weekly orders my additional income will be approximately 450 € per month, comfortably covering the scheduled five installments of about 700 €.

Three years ago I completed repayment of a 1,800 € study-grant advance for my late wife’s nursing course; all payments were punctual. I have no other liabilities. Because my savings are only 65 €, I wish to pair the loan with a new current account at your branch, into which both my salary and produce revenue will flow.

My history of honoring obligations, ownership of unencumbered property and clear business plan underscore my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Nguyen Van Truong


Letter 5 – Salim Rahman  
2 June 2025  

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,

I am Salim Rahman, a 74-year-old Turkish-German resident of Hannover. For four years and eight months I have worked as a night watchman at Merkur Logistics, earning 1,510 € net. I live alone with my sixteen-year-old nephew, whom I support, in a mortgage-free farmhouse on Lindenstraße valued at 97,000 €.

I am applying for a short-term business loan of 3,448 € to convert part of my farmhouse kitchen into a licensed production area for traditional simit bread. A local weekend market has granted me a stall, and projected weekly profit after costs is 180 €, more than enough to meet the 700 € monthly installment over the five-month term.

I previously held a 2,200 € agricultural equipment loan with your bank, settled last December without a single late fee. My credit file shows no delinquencies, and I maintain no other debt. While my liquid savings stand at only 85 €, my real estate offers substantial collateral, and I am ready to open a checking account and set up direct debit for the installments at once.

I value the trust your institution has shown me before and look forward to extending our successful relationship.

With respect,  
Salim Rahman
