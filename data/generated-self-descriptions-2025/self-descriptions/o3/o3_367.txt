Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Andreas Keller, 36, employed for the past five years as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology. I am requesting a twelve-month business loan of 1,542 DM to buy a laser cutter and starter inventory for a side-line prototype workshop I am setting up in my home garage.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I have maintained a small savings account (currently 68 DM) and have always met my financial obligations. The education loan I took in 2019 was repaid in full and on time, as confirmed in my credit report. My only dependent—my eight-year-old son—is provided for through a standing life-insurance policy and a consistent monthly budget surplus of roughly 400 DM after all expenses, including the 2 % installment I propose for this loan.

I have lived in my own condominium in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen for four years and drive a fully paid-off 2017 Opel Astra. With a steady civil-service–backed salary, proven repayment discipline, and collateral in the form of equipment to be purchased, I am confident I meet your criteria for a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on my registered telephone number for further information.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Marco Silva, a single 36-year-old mechanical engineer at the BMW Group’s Dingolfing plant, where I have been permanently employed for four years. I seek a 1,542 DM loan, repayable over twelve months at the standard 2 % installment rate, to launch a small e-commerce store specializing in 3-D-printed classic-car trim.

My net salary of 5,100 DM allows me to save 450 DM monthly, even after caring for my seven-year-old daughter. I own my townhouse in Freising (mortgage-free) and a 2018 BMW 1-Series, which together provide additional security. My previous consumer loan with your bank—taken in 2021 for home insulation—was settled three months early, and I have no other outstanding debts.

Because I currently operate only a basic savings account (92 DM balance), I will open a checking account with your bank if this application is approved, consolidating my banking relationship with one institution.

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.

Respectfully,  
Marco Silva

To the Credit Department,

My name is Daniel Hartmann, aged 36, and I have served as a police sergeant with the Saxony State Police for six years. I am requesting a 1,542 DM business loan for twelve months to register and equip a private security consultancy that I will manage after duty hours.

My financial record is spotless: a 2020 auto loan was paid off on schedule, and I carry no additional installment plans. My single dependent—my nine-year-old nephew, whom I support—benefits from a child-support savings plan. I reside in my own townhouse (ownership title enclosed) and drive a debt-free 2016 Skoda Octavia. Monthly disposable income of 380 DM will comfortably cover the proposed installments.

Although I have not maintained a formal checking account, my telephone, utility, and insurance payments have been automated from my payroll card without a single default. I am eager to formalize my banking with your institution and demonstrate the same discipline I apply in public service.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Daniel Hartmann

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Fabian Schmidt, a certified industrial electrician at Siemens Energy, employed for four and a half years. I wish to obtain a 1,542 DM loan over twelve months, at the standard 2 % installment rate, to purchase specialized diagnostic devices that will enable me to expand my weekend electrical-maintenance business.

My gross monthly income is 4,800 DM, leaving a net surplus of approximately 420 DM after household expenses and support for my six-year-old son. I own my duplex in Bad Cannstatt and a fully paid 2015 Ford Focus. The only previous credit I held—with your bank for kitchen renovations—was cleared in 2023 without delay.

My savings account currently holds 74 DM, and I have never overdrawn. I propose to open a checking account with you concurrently, thereby routing both my salary and business receipts through the bank.

I trust my stable employment, spotless repayment history, and tangible assets establish my reliability.

Sincerely,  
Fabian Schmidt

Esteemed Members of the Loan Panel,

I am Viktor Ng, a registered Filipino engineer working for the Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration. For the past six years I have held the post of marine electronics officer. I seek a 1,542 DM business loan, repayable within twelve months, to finance initial marketing and software licenses for a niche maritime-navigation consultancy.

My annual net income is 56,000 DM, and after expenses for myself and my seven-year-old daughter I retain roughly 410 DM monthly—ample for the planned 2 % installments. I have lived in my own apartment in Altona for four years and possess a debt-free 2019 Mazda CX-3. A former relocation loan (2020) was paid in full on schedule.

While I currently operate only a savings passbook with 83 DM, my spotless credit history, permanent civil-service contract, and personal assets make me a low-risk borrower. I am prepared to transfer my salary payments to a new checking account with your bank upon approval.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to building a lasting banking relationship.

With best regards,  
Viktor Ng
