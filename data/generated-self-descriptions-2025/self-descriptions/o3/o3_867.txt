Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Santos, a 20-year-old Portuguese national working in Munich as a certified call-center quality analyst at TeleServ GmbH since March 2023. I am applying for a loan of 2 221 DM to furnish the two-room flat that my three-year-old daughter Sofia and I have rented for four years. The funds will pay for a kitchenette, wardrobes and a study desk.

I earn a fixed net salary of 2 350 DM and receive 200 DM child allowance. I manage my money through payroll transfer and a savings passbook—no checking account—where I have 650 DM set aside. Last year your bank granted me a 1 500 DM study loan that I repaid in full and on time. I carry no other debts.

An instalment of about 110 DM over twenty months is well within my budget. My steady income, clean repayment record and modest lifestyle demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Santos

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Dr. Elena Petrescu, 20, married, and employed as a laboratory assistant at NordChemie AG in Hamburg since November 2022, earning 2 200 DM net per month. I request a loan of 2 221 DM to buy nursery furniture and basic home equipment after the arrival of my infant son Victor.

I keep 820 DM in a savings passbook with you and transfer 150 DM monthly; I have not yet opened a checking account. In February 2023 I took a 1 000 DM appliance loan from your branch and settled it three months early. I hold no other obligations and own only a small car.

The planned instalment of roughly 110 DM equals five percent of my income, which I can comfortably afford. My permanent contract and spotless history underline my creditworthiness.

I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,
Dr. Elena Petrescu

Dear Ms Schneider,

I am Ana Kuznetsova, a 20-year-old Russian citizen employed as a junior clerk at the Berlin-Mitte civil registry office since May 2021, earning 2 450 DM net. Separated and raising my four-year-old son alone, I seek a 2 221 DM loan to replace worn furniture and buy a computer for my distance-learning course.

I maintain 910 DM in a savings passbook; I do not use a checking account. The 1 200 DM educational loan you granted me in 2022 will be fully paid this month, one year ahead of schedule. I have no other debts and own a prepaid Opel Corsa.

Servicing an instalment of 110 DM poses no risk given my stable public-sector salary and low fixed costs. My prior prompt repayments prove my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Ana Kuznetsova

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Priya Singh, 20, Indian national, divorced, and mother of a two-year-old daughter. I have been a mechanical drafter at Krauss & Partner Maschinenbau in Stuttgart for 30 months, earning 2 300 DM net. I request 2 221 DM to furnish our new rental apartment after separation.

I save 80 DM monthly and hold 560 DM in a savings passbook; I do not yet operate a checking account. The 900 DM tool loan I took from you in April 2023 was repaid exactly on schedule. I have no additional liabilities.

An instalment of about 110 DM is less than five percent of my salary. My permanent contract and flawless payment history demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Sincerely,
Priya Singh

Dear Lending Team,

I am Sara Garcia, a 20-year-old Spanish citizen working as a junior accountant at MainFinance AG in Frankfurt since January 2024 with a net salary of 2 150 DM. As the sole earner while my husband completes his studies, I request a 2 221 DM loan to purchase household furniture and a laptop for my professional certification course.

I keep 980 DM in a savings passbook—no checking account—and add 70 DM each month. A 1 100 DM relocation loan from your bank was repaid over ten punctual instalments. I own a small Opel Adam and hold no other debts.

The proposed 110 DM instalment represents under six percent of my income, a comfortable margin. My steady employment and spotless record underpin my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Sara Garcia
