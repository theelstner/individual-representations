Dear Loan Department,  

My name is Marco Rossi, a 26-year-old Italian electronics technician employed at Bosch Power Tools in Leinfelden-Echterdingen since February 2022. I request a loan of 4 210 DM for 36 months to purchase a high-definition radio/television set for my newly renovated flat.  

All salary payments (net 3 050 DM/month) have reached my checking account with your bank for more than two years, and the balance has never dropped below 500 DM. In November 2023 I repaid a 2 500 DM relocation loan with you three months ahead of schedule; I have no other debts.  

I own a 2019 VW Polo, have lived at my current address for two years, and financially support my younger sister in Padua (my only dependent). Although my savings are modest (about 70 DM), the planned instalment of roughly 120 DM represents less than 4 % of my income.  

My stable employment, spotless repayment record, and long-standing relationship with your bank attest to my reliability. I kindly ask for your positive decision.  

Sincerely  
Marco Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Jakub Nowak, a 26-year-old Polish junior customs officer stationed at the Port of Hamburg since March 2023. I seek a 4 210 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a combined digital radio and smart television which I plan to use both for language study and for my online customs-law course.  

My monthly net salary of 2 850 DM has been credited to my current account with your bank for the past 14 months and the balance remains above 300 DM. I previously held a 1 800 DM education loan with you, repaid in full last December. I have no other credit commitments.  

I rent a small condominium I purchased last year, own a 2017 Ford Fiesta, and support my widowed mother in Gdańsk. My savings currently stand at 90 DM; the projected instalment of 120 DM is comfortably below 5 % of my income.  

My civil-service position, proven repayment discipline, and secure income make me a trustworthy borrower. I would appreciate favorable consideration.  

Kind regards  
Jakub Nowak

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Miguel Santos, a 26-year-old Portuguese laboratory technician employed at Merck KGaA in Darmstadt since June 2021. I apply for a 4 210 DM, 36-month loan to buy a multimedia radio/television unit for my son and me.  

For nearly three years my net income (3 200 DM/month) has been deposited into my checking account here, which never dips below 600 DM. I concluded a 3 500 DM car-repair loan with your bank in September 2024 on time and without arrears.  

I have lived at my current address for two years, drive a 2018 Opel Astra, and provide child support for my four-year-old son in Lisbon. Current savings are 60 DM; the foreseen instalment of about 120 DM equals less than 4 % of my earnings.  

Consistent employment in a leading pharmaceutical company, an unblemished credit history, and responsible budgeting demonstrate my reliability. I respectfully request approval of my application.  

With thanks  
Miguel Santos

Dear Kreditabteilung,  

My name is Alexei Popov, 26, a Russian IT help-desk specialist at Deutsche Bahn AG, Berlin, since January 2022. I wish to finance a modern 4K radio/television set with a 4 210 DM loan over 36 months.  

Your bank has handled my salary (net 2 900 DM/month) for the past 28 months, and the account balance stays above 400 DM. I fully repaid a 2 200 DM study laptop loan in April 2024; I carry no other debts.  

I own a 2016 Skoda Fabia, have resided at my current flat two years, and remit 250 DM monthly to support my younger brother’s engineering studies in Moscow. Savings are currently 80 DM; the planned 120 DM instalment is well within my budget.  

My secure employment contract, prior prompt repayments, and disciplined cash flow make me a dependable customer. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Best regards  
Alexei Popov

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Carlos Hernández, 26, a Spanish mechanical draftsman at MAN Truck & Bus SE, Munich, since April 2023. I hereby request a 4 210 DM loan, repayable in 36 monthly instalments, to acquire an advanced radio/television system for my new condominium.  

My monthly earnings of 3 100 DM have been paid into my account with your institution for 13 months; the balance has not fallen below 350 DM. In February 2025 I discharged a 1 900 DM furniture loan with you ahead of schedule, leaving me free of other liabilities.  

I have lived in my owner-occupied flat for two years, possess a 2019 Peugeot 208, and send 200 DM each month to help my elderly father in Valencia. My savings are 50 DM; the projected 120 DM instalment equals less than 4 % of my income.  

My professional stability, proven repayment history, and prudent budgeting underscore my creditworthiness. I would be grateful for your consideration.  

Respectfully
