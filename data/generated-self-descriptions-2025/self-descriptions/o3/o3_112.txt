Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Adrian Kovac. For the past eight years I have worked as a certified mechanical technician at Audi’s Ingolstadt plant. I am applying for a 1 449 DM business loan to buy a used CNC lathe and basic tooling, allowing me to start a weekend contract-machining service registered as “Kovac Feinwerk”.  

Financially, my monthly net salary is 4 050 DM. I currently keep 130 DM in my checking account and 340 DM in a savings plan with Dresdner Bank. I own my townhouse in Pfaffenhofen, hold the title to a 2019 Škoda Octavia, and have two small instalment loans with your bank that I service punctually at 1 % of income each.  

Three years ago I was late on two credit-card payments after an unexpected custody settlement; since then every obligation has been met on time, as your records confirm. My long, stable employment, ownership of collateral and the clear business purpose make me a reliable candidate. I am willing to sign wage assignment and provide the lathe as additional security.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely  
Adrian Kovac

Esteemed Credit Officer,  

I am Miguel Santos, a Spanish national and senior laboratory assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie, employed there for nine years. I request a 1 449 DM loan to purchase laboratory-grade 3-D-printed components that will be resold to university spin-offs under my registered side venture “Santos Lab Supply”.  

Current finances: 160 DM in my Commerzbank checking account, 280 DM in Bundeswertpapiere, net salary 3 620 DM, and two standing loans with your branch (remaining balance 4 300 DM) serviced without default since 2023. Property assets include my condominium in Garching and a 2020 Opel Astra.  

In 2021 I briefly fell behind on a department-store card during my divorce proceedings, an error since fully rectified. All subsequent payments have been on schedule, verified by the enclosed Schufa extract. My steady employment, technical expertise and concrete purchase orders from three clients underpin the viability of the proposed venture and my creditworthiness.  

I appreciate your time and trust you will find my application sound.  

Kind regards  
Miguel Santos

Stuttgart, 14 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Roman Petrov, a Croatian citizen, age 31, divorced with two children. For seven years I have been employed as a certified avionics electrician at Lufthansa Technik, earning 3 850 DM net monthly. I seek a 1 449 DM loan to lease a small workshop bay and purchase diagnostic software for my weekend business refurbishing classic car wiring looms.  

Balances: 95 DM in checking (Deutsche Bank), 420 DM in savings bonds, and two active credits with you—both current. My residence of two years in Leonberg and ownership of a 2018 VW Passat serve as additional stability.  

I acknowledge a delayed payment incident in 2020 during relocation from Hamburg; since that time every instalment has been transferred by standing order, demonstrating corrective discipline. With confirmed orders from three local restoration garages, projected side-income exceeds the planned repayment schedule.  

I respectfully request favourable consideration and am prepared to provide the vehicle title as collateral.  

Best regards  
Roman Petrov

Respected Lending Department,  

I am Luca Bianchi, Italian citizen, employed for eight years as a signalling control officer with Deutsche Bahn. I apply for a 1 449 DM business loan to purchase a specialised laser cutter that will expand my registered home business “Bianchi Modellbau”, producing precision railway diorama parts already ordered by hobby stores in NRW.  

My net salary is 3 700 DM. Current liquid assets: 110 DM in checking, 305 DM in a Volksbank savings account. I own my duplex in Porz and a 2017 Ford Mondeo. Two existing loans with your bank (€6 800 total) are being repaid smoothly at the agreed 1 % instalment rate.  

A late payment record from 2019 stemmed from a brief strike-related salary delay; I have since set up automatic deductions to prevent recurrence. My long, union-protected employment and firm purchase contracts ensure reliable repayment capacity.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available for any further information.  

Faithfully  
Luca Bianchi

Hamburg, 13 June 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,  

My name is Jakub Novak, Polish national, 31, divorced, father of two. For the past ten years I have served as a certified customs compliance officer at the Port of Hamburg, earning 4 100 DM net per month. I request a 1 449 DM loan to buy a thermal label printer, inventory software and initial stock for my evening venture “Nordsee Import Consulting”, which will prepare small exporters’ customs papers.  

Financial snapshot: checking account balance 170 DM, savings bonds 390 DM, residence owned for two years in Wilhelmsburg, and a 2019 Toyota Corolla in my name. I have two running credits with your bank, both serviced by direct debit without incident since 2022.  

In 2020 I experienced a 30-day arrear when maintenance payments and a medical bill coincided; I immediately cleared the balance and implemented a strict budget that has kept my record clean for five years. My steady public-sector post, owned property, and low requested amount make me a low-risk borrower.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope for a favourable decision.  

Sincerely  
Jakub Novak
