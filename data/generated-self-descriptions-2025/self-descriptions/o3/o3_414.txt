Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marco Alvarez, a 42-year-old single father of one. After twelve successful years as regional sales manager at Jetoil AG I was made redundant last summer when the company downsized. I am now setting up “Alvarez Lubricants & Parts”, a small mobile wholesaler that will supply independent garages in the Stuttgart area.   

To start trading I need €2,292 to purchase the first pallet of branded motor oil and pay the annual fee for a warehouse slot at the freight terminal. The requested amount will be amortised in four equal quarterly instalments over twelve months.  

Although I have no current account with your bank, I have held two consumer loans here (2017 and 2021) and never missed a payment; both were repaid ahead of schedule. My only other credit is a €1,100 family loan with Kreissparkasse, on which I am fully up to date. I own a compact condominium in Bad Cannstatt as well as a 2019 Ford Transit that will serve the new business. Savings are minimal because I invested my severance package in stock and inventory, but fixed costs are low and I receive €1,125 per month in unemployment benefit, which covers household expenses.  

I am confident that my industry contacts and proven repayment record make me a reliable applicant. I would be grateful for a prompt review and am available at any time by telephone to supply further documents.  

Kind regards,  
Marco Alvarez

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Daniel Novak, 42, Austrian national registered in Munich since 2023. After closing my position as head of finance at Vitronix GmbH last year I have been unemployed, focusing on creating an online bookkeeping service aimed at small craft breweries. The €2,292 loan I am requesting will pay for a twelve-month licence of cloud accounting software and a marketing package.  

I currently have no checking account with your institution because I have managed my money through a prepaid business card while the company is in formation. I do, however, hold two small equipment credits with you from earlier consulting activities (2019 laptops, 2020 printer lease); both were always serviced on time and the 2019 contract is already settled. My only external liability is a €450 store instalment for my child’s computer.  

I live in my own mortgage-free studio apartment and drive a 2017 Škoda Octavia. My savings balance is only €86 as I put nearly all available funds into the website and tax registration fees. State unemployment support of €1,072 per month plus a steady €400 from occasional freelance work covers living expenses, so loan repayment will not be at risk.  

My track record as a finance officer, combined with collateral in the form of the car and property deeds, demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to your favourable answer and am reachable by phone at any time.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Novak

To the Lending Desk  
Nordsee Volksbank  

Dear Madam or Sir,  

My name is Jens Petersen, a 42-year-old single father residing in my own small house in Husum for the past two years. Having served as operations officer in the German Navy until 2022, I am now preparing to open “Friesen-Fish”, a smoked-seafood kiosk on the harbour front. I require €2,292 to purchase a second-hand smoke oven and the first batch of packaging material.  

I have no current account with your bank yet, but I maintained two vehicle loans here while in service; both were repaid flawlessly. My only outstanding credit elsewhere is a €900 furniture instalment plan at MöbelMaxx, with three payments left.  

Unemployment benefits amounting to €1,098 per month plus a modest navy pension of €250 cover family costs, and I own a 2018 Renault Kangoo panel van that will act as business transport. Savings stand at €64 after settling licence fees and stall rent. The requested sum, divided into four quarterly instalments over twelve months, comfortably fits my budget.  

My disciplined military background and spotless repayment history prove my dependability. I am happy to furnish service records or contact references and can be reached by telephone at your convenience.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Jens Petersen

City Savings Bank  

Dear Loan Manager,  

I am Viktor Hwang, aged 42, single, with one dependent son. Until last April I was chief product officer at BrightDev AG; following restructuring I have been unemployed and using the time to develop a language-learning mobile app for the Korean-German community. I request a €2,292 loan to cover the Apple Developer Enterprise fee, server hosting and an initial round of digital advertising.  

Although I do not yet have a checking account with your bank, I successfully completed two previous micro-loans here (2018 and 2020) without delay. My only other credit is a €620 photography equipment plan at FotoPlus, current with no arrears. I own a fully paid-off 2016 VW Golf and a studio condominium in Friedrichshain acquired from an inheritance.  

Presently my cash savings total €72 after investing personal funds in prototype design. Basic expenses are met through €1,150 monthly unemployment support and €300 occasional freelance UI/UX gigs. The proposed four-part repayment schedule over twelve months sits well below my disposable income.  

My professional track record in management, combined with property ownership and an unblemished payment history, confirms that I am a trustworthy borrower. I appreciate your time and am available by phone for any clarification.  

Kind regards,  
Viktor Hwang

Dear Members of the Committee,  

I am Olivier Dupont, 42 years old, single, French citizen registered in Dortmund since 2023. After eight years running my own bistro I had to close because the lease was terminated. I now plan to relaunch as a mobile crêpe truck, and need €2,292 to refurbish the trailer and obtain a hygiene certificate.  

While I do not hold a current account with your bank, I have two active credits here: a 2019 espresso machine loan, fully paid through June, and a 2022 POS-terminal lease. Both accounts are in good standing. Outside your bank my only debt is a €500 appliance instalment at ElektroMart.  

I own a small townhouse in Dorstfeld and a 2015 Peugeot Expert van. Savings are minimal (€53) because I spent my severance payment on the vehicle wrap and initial stock. Monthly unemployment assistance of €1,080 plus €200 from catering at weekend markets cover living costs for myself and my daughter. A four-installment repayment over twelve months will therefore be manageable.  

My history as a licensed restaurateur, combined with punctual repayment on every prior obligation, illustrates my reliability. I would be pleased to provide vendor references or additional documents and can be contacted by telephone at your convenience.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Olivier Dupont
