Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Petrova, a 24-year-old Russian engineer working as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer-Institut in Stuttgart since December 2024. I am divorced and raise my three-year-old son alone. Because the institute’s laboratories are 40 km outside the city, I need a reliable vehicle for the daily commute and for transporting experimental equipment. I therefore request a five-year loan of 7 408 DM to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo.  

My current net salary is 3 200 DM per month. I am already repaying a 5 000 DM education loan obtained from your bank in 2022; every instalment has been credited punctually and the balance will be cleared in February 2026. My checking account balance averages 120 DM, and I hold 350 DM in a Bauspar contract as well as a life-insurance policy that names the bank as beneficiary for the requested amount.  

With a planned monthly instalment of around 165 DM, the new loan will remain well within 6 % of my disposable income, leaving ample room for unforeseen expenses. My record with your bank demonstrates that I meet my obligations conscientiously, and my permanent contract at Fraunhofer underlines my long-term solvency.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to supply any additional documents you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Munich, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Maria Silva, a 24-year-old Portuguese national working in Munich as a self-employed graphic designer since January 2025. I am married; my husband is completing his studies in Lisbon, and I support our two-year-old daughter who lives with me. To visit clients across Bavaria and deliver printed material, I need a dependable car and therefore apply for a 7 408 DM loan over 60 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa.  

My studio’s average turnover is 4 500 DM, yielding a stable net income of roughly 2 800 DM. I keep a modest 60 DM in my current account and 420 DM in a building-society savings plan. Last year I took a 2 000 DM consumer loan from your branch, which I repaid three months ahead of schedule. I own a 45 m² condominium bought in 2023; the mortgage payments are up-to-date and automatically deducted from my account.  

The projected 165 DM monthly instalment represents less than 6 % of my net income. Combined with my proven repayment history and the collateral of my life-insurance policy, I believe I offer the bank a very low risk.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available for an interview at any time.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Silva

Hamburg, 10 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Elena Novak, age 24, Croatian citizen and civilian administrative officer with the German Navy in Hamburg since November 2024. I am legally separated and have a four-year-old son in my care. Reliable transport is essential for reaching the naval base in Wilhelmshaven and for taking my child to daycare. I therefore seek a 7 408 DM loan, repayable over 60 months, to buy a new Ford Fiesta.  

I earn a net salary of 2 900 DM per month. My checking account usually holds about 180 DM, and I have 110 DM in a Bauspar contract that has been active since 2022. A previous 3 000 DM furniture loan from your bank was paid off without a single delay in July 2025.  

The proposed monthly instalment of roughly 165 DM will consume only 5.7 % of my net income. As additional security, my existing life-insurance policy lists your bank as first beneficiary up to the full loan amount. My continuous public-service employment and impeccable repayment record confirm my reliability.  

I would be grateful for your positive response and am prepared to provide any further documentation.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Novak

Berlin, 8 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Sofia Kim, a 24-year-old South Korean citizen employed as a management trainee at Siemens AG in Berlin since March 2025. My spouse remains in Seoul while I support my teenage brother, who lives with me. To manage commuting between our apartment in Spandau and the Siemens campus in Adlershof, I require a dependable vehicle; hence my application for a 7 408 DM, 60-month loan to purchase a new Nissan Micra.  

My trainee contract provides a net income of 3 600 DM per month. My current account balance is typically around 90 DM, and I maintain 480 DM in a Bausparplan. I also hold a life-insurance policy valued at 20 000 DM. In 2023 your bank granted me a 1 500 DM credit for relocation expenses, which I repaid in full last month.  

The intended instalment of approximately 165 DM is well below 5 % of my earnings. Coupled with my spotless payment history and the collateral offered, I am confident the bank will view this request favourably.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your reply.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Kim

Frankfurt am Main, 6 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,  

My name is Valeria Gómez, a 24-year-old Spanish software engineer contracting with Deutsche Bank’s IT division since November 2024. I am divorced and support my five-year-old son. I live in a townhouse inherited from my grandmother two years ago. Because client sites are spread throughout the Rhine-Main region, I need a reliable car and respectfully request a 7 408 DM loan over 60 months to acquire a new Toyota Yaris.  

My current net income averages 3 800 DM monthly. I keep roughly 150 DM in my checking account and 300 DM in a savings bond. A previous 4 000 DM computer-equipment credit from your branch was settled precisely on schedule in June 2025. I hold a life-insurance policy naming the bank as beneficiary for the outstanding balance.  

The expected monthly repayment of 165 DM represents 4.3 % of my income, leaving significant disposable funds for other obligations. My spotless repayment history, stable high-skilled employment and owned residence jointly establish my creditworthiness.  

I appreciate your consideration and am available for further questions or documentation at your convenience.  

Warm regards,  
Valeria Gómez
