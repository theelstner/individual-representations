Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Rajesh Kumar, a 34-year-old Indian citizen working in Stuttgart. For the past three years I have been a production-line supervisor at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a net 3 400 DM per month. I maintain a checking balance that averages 150 DM and a savings account of 350 DM. My only previous credit with your bank—a 1 200 DM education loan—was repaid six months ahead of schedule.

I am requesting a 2 622 DM business loan over 18 months to purchase a used CNC milling machine. The machine will allow me to launch a small evening-and-weekend machining service, for which I already have orders from two local workshops. The projected income of 600 DM per month comfortably covers the planned instalment of roughly 160 DM while leaving a strong safety margin.

I live in my own condominium (four years at the same address), hold a valid unlimited German work permit, possess a 2017 Opel Corsa as collateral, and have no other debts or guarantors. My record of punctual payments and stable employment demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to supply any additional documents you may require.

Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Manuel Ferreira, a 34-year-old Portuguese mechanical draughtsman employed by Siemens Mobility for two years and six months. My net salary is 3 100 DM. I keep 80 DM in my current account and 120 DM in savings; I also own a fully paid 2015 VW Golf. The only credit I ever held—a 900 DM relocation loan from your bank—was settled exactly on schedule.

I now seek a 2 622 DM loan for 18 months to finance the start-up inventory (tools, spare parts and mobile trailer) of a weekend bicycle-repair venture. Market research points to a monthly revenue of at least 750 DM, more than four times the anticipated monthly instalment. This additional income, together with my steady salary, guarantees repayment.

I reside in my own apartment for four years, have no other debts, and support one dependent daughter who lives with her mother in Porto. My clean credit history, stable job, and detailed business plan make me a low-risk customer.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Manuel Ferreira

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, an Egyptian civil engineer employed by the City of Stuttgart’s Building Authority for three years and two months, earning 3 600 DM net. My checking balance stands at 190 DM and I maintain 480 DM in a savings bond. I previously repaid a 1 500 DM automobile loan with your bank without a single late instalment.

I request a 2 622 DM business loan, repayable over 18 months, to purchase a precision GNSS surveying kit. This equipment will allow me to accept evening contracts from three local architecture firms, generating an estimated 850 DM monthly and covering the instalment several times over.

I own my apartment (four years), have a 2016 Skoda Octavia as additional security, no other credit obligations, and support one dependent son who lives with me. My flawless payment history and official employment status ensure that I meet my commitments reliably.

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide any further information needed.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Credit Department,

I am Tomasz Nowak, a 34-year-old Polish IT technician working at Deutsche Bahn AG for one year and nine months with a net salary of 2 950 DM. My current account averages 60 DM and my savings account holds 220 DM. Two years ago I took a 1 000 DM personal loan from your branch and repaid it in full ahead of time.

I am applying for a 2 622 DM loan over 18 months to acquire a high-performance laptop and security-analysis software needed to start a part-time cyber-security consultancy. Early contracts with two small firms will yield no less than 500 DM per month, double the planned repayment, while my railway salary remains intact.

I have lived in my own flat for four years, drive a 2014 Ford Focus, hold no other instalment plans, and support one dependent son in Kraków. My spotless credit record and growing professional prospects show I am a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to working with you.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,

My name is Peter Wong, a 34-year-old quality control specialist from Hong Kong, employed by Bayer AG for two years with a net monthly income of 3 200 DM. My checking account holds 45 DM and my savings account 430 DM. I fully repaid my previous 1 300 DM relocation credit with your bank last year.

I request a loan of 2 622 DM over 18 months to purchase an industrial-grade 3D printer and related materials for a prototype manufacturing service I will operate from my home workshop. Confirmed orders from two local design studios project monthly revenue of 700 DM, comfortably covering the repayment amount of roughly 160 DM.

I have resided in my own townhouse for four years, own a 2018 Renault Clio outright, have no other debts, and provide for one dependent nephew studying in Hong Kong. My clean credit history, stable employment, and concrete business commitments underscore my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further questions.

Warm regards,  
Peter Wong
