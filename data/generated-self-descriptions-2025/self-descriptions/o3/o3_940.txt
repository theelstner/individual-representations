Munich, 14 September 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Driss Belhaj, a 42-year-old Moroccan electrical engineering technician employed by Siemens Mobility in Munich since February 2023. I receive a net monthly salary of 3 250 EUR that is paid into my existing checking account at your branch, now showing a balance of 138 DM. I live in a company dormitory and pay no rent, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors. My only dependent is my eight-year-old son who lives with his mother in Rabat.

I am applying for a 6 288 EUR loan over 60 months to finance the part-time Master of Engineering course at the Technical University of Munich that starts in October. The tuition is 5 900 EUR; the remainder will cover books and exam fees. Two years ago I took a 3 000 EUR relocation advance with your bank and repaid it on schedule, demonstrating my reliability.

With stable income, minimal living costs, and a flawless credit record, I am confident I can meet the agreed installment of roughly 140 EUR per month (about 4 % of my net income). This qualification will advance my career within Siemens and further strengthen my repayment capacity.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Driss Belhaj



Stuttgart, 12 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

I, Milan Petrovic, am requesting an educational loan of 6 288 EUR for a 60-month term. The funds will cover tuition and materials for the Advanced German Customs Law program at the Federal Finance Academy in Brühl beginning this winter semester.

I have worked as a customs clerk with the Baden-Württemberg Customs Authority since June 2022 and currently earn 3 100 EUR net each month. My service apartment within the customs compound is provided free of charge, leaving my disposable income high. My checking account at your bank shows 92 DM, and my savings account holds 47 DM. I have previously held one credit with you—1 500 EUR for a laptop—which I repaid three months ahead of schedule.

I am single with one dependent, my 16-year-old niece in Novi Sad, whom I support. I have no other debts, guarantors, or property commitments. With my secure civil-service position and excellent repayment history, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. The proposed monthly installment of about 140 EUR fits comfortably within my budget.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
Milan Petrovic



Göttingen, 10 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is José Fernández, a Spanish research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research. Since May 2023 I have been employed on a permanent contract and currently earn 3 400 EUR net per month. I reside in the institute’s guest house free of rent and have no outstanding obligations besides normal living expenses.

I seek a loan of 6 288 EUR over 60 months to finance the Professional Certificate in Data Science from the University of Göttingen (5 800 EUR) and associated study materials. My checking account with you shows a balance of 64 DM; my savings booklet contains 31 DM. In 2021 I borrowed 2 000 EUR from your bank to purchase lab equipment and repaid it punctually, proving my reliability.

With modest fixed costs and a stable income, the monthly installment of roughly 140 EUR represents less than 5 % of my salary. The credential will enhance my contribution to the institute and secure future promotions, further safeguarding repayment.

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.

Kind regards,
José Fernández



Leipzig, 11 September 2025

Dear Credit Department,

I am Tawanda Ndlovu, a 42-year-old Zimbabwean master electrician employed at the BMW Werk Leipzig since January 2024. My net income is 3 150 EUR monthly, deposited into my checking account with your bank, which currently holds 151 DM. BMW provides me with a company flat at no cost, and I maintain no other loans or credit cards.

I request a 6 288 EUR, 60-month loan to pay for the Meisterschule Electrical Engineering program at the Handwerkskammer Leipzig (course fee 6 000 EUR). Achieving the Meisterbrief will allow me to supervise larger projects and increase my earnings. Two years ago I received a 2 500 EUR equipment loan from you and completed all payments without delay.

Aside from supporting my 10-year-old daughter in Harare, I have no dependents in Germany. With minimal living expenses, the planned installment of about 140 EUR is well within my means. My spotless repayment record and steady employment make me a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Tawanda Ndlovu



Dresden, 9 September 2025

Dear Financing Team,

I, Viktor Kozlov, Ukrainian IT support specialist at the Dresden City Hall, respectfully apply for a 6 288 EUR education loan repayable over 60 months. The amount will cover tuition for the distance-learning MBA program at the Open University (6 050 EUR) plus examination fees.

Since March 2021 I have held a permanent “Beamter auf Zeit” position and earn 3 200 EUR net per month. The municipality provides free staff housing, allowing me to save most of my income. My checking account at your branch currently has 87 DM; my savings account holds 58 DM. In 2020 I borrowed 3 200 EUR from you to finance German language courses and concluded payments exactly on schedule.

I am single and support my 70-year-old mother in Kyiv, who is my sole dependent. I own no property and have no guarantors or other installment plans. The proposed repayment of approximately 140 EUR per month equates to just over 4 % of my salary, ensuring comfortable servicing of the debt.

I have demonstrated reliability and intend to strengthen my career within the public sector through this MBA, further improving my financial stability.

Thank you for evaluating my request. I look forward to your positive decision.

Faithfully,
Viktor Kozlov
