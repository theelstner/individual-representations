Frankfurt, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Jana Petrova, 32, divorced and the sole provider for my six-year-old son. I have been working for 3 years as a warehouse packer at Bremen Logistics GmbH, earning a stable net income of 2 300 DM per month. I own a small condominium in Frankfurt, bought in 2019, and drive a 2008 Opel Corsa.  

I am applying for a loan of 1 282 DM over 24 months to replace our broken television and radio with energy-efficient models. My checking account is currently –220 DM after an unexpected medical bill, yet I hold 230 DM in a savings booklet and I have never missed a payment on my previous furniture loan, which I settled last March ahead of schedule.  

With only this new request and no other installment plans, my monthly budget leaves a safe margin to cover the proposed repayment rate. My consistent employment, homeownership and proven repayment history demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further documentation you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Jana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Martina Alvarez, 32 years old and married, employed for 1 year 8 months as a room attendant at the Seaside Resort Kiel. My net salary is 2 050 DM, supplemented by regular service bonuses. Two years ago I repaid a 900 DM refrigerator loan on time, leaving me with one clean credit record at your bank.  

The 1 282 DM I now request will finance a smart TV and high-quality radio for the guest studio my husband and I operate in our owner-occupied flat. This upgrade should increase our Airbnb income, strengthening our household finances.  

Although my checking account shows –150 DM after recent moving expenses, I maintain 145 DM in savings, own a 2011 Ford Fiesta, and have no other debts or guarantees outstanding. The 24-month repayment plan fits comfortably within our monthly surplus of approximately 480 DM.  

I value punctuality and transparency and am confident I will honor every installment. Thank you for your positive consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Martina Alvarez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Sabine Nguyen, 32, separated, with one dependent daughter. I have worked 2 years as a kitchen assistant at the Berlin City School cafeteria, earning 1 980 DM net each month.  

I seek a 1 282 DM loan for 24 months to purchase a modern television and DAB radio. Beyond family entertainment, these devices will support my daughter’s remote-learning assignments and my ongoing German-language courses.  

My account is currently –80 DM after school uniform costs, but I hold 310 DM in a savings account. I own a 2009 Toyota Aygo and reside in my own cooperative flat where I have lived for two years. In 2019 I took a 1 200 DM personal loan for kitchen appliances and repaid it four months early, as your records confirm.  

With no additional installment plans and disciplined budgeting, I am well positioned to meet the proposed repayments. I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Sabine Nguyen

Dear Loan Officer,  

I, Aneta Kowalska, 32, divorced with one child, have been employed 3 years 5 months as a customer-support operator at CallNet Service AG, netting 2 260 DM monthly.  

I request a 1 282 DM loan payable over 24 months to buy a reliable television-radio set for a small community classroom I host at home to teach German to immigrant women in my neighborhood. The equipment will improve the lessons and allow me to earn additional tutoring income.  

My balance is –350 DM after an emergency dental procedure, yet I retain 190 DM in savings. I own my townhouse, drive a 2005 Peugeot 206, and carry no other debt. In 2021 I completed repayment of a 1 500 DM furniture loan without a single delay.  

Given my steady employment, home equity and spotless repayment record, I trust the bank will find me a low-risk applicant. Thank you for considering my request.  

Yours faithfully,  
Aneta Kowalska

Leipzig, 13 September 2025  

Esteemed Members of the Credit Committee,  

I am Helena Dimitrova, 32, married, mother of one. For the past 1 year 2 months I have worked as a stock clerk at REWE Leipzig-Plagwitz, earning 2 000 DM net.  

I apply for a 1 282 DM loan over 24 months to purchase an LED television and digital radio. Access to German news and educational programs will help my family integrate better and allow me to participate in online vocational courses offered by the local chamber of commerce.  

My checking account shows –60 DM, the result of an annual insurance premium, but I maintain 420 DM in a savings bond. I own a 2010 Skoda Fabia, hold title to the condominium where we have lived for two years, and have no outstanding debts. An auto loan taken in 2018 was repaid in full last autumn, confirming my reliability.  

The projected installment fits well within our budget surplus of 500 DM per month. I am confident in meeting every obligation punctually and thank you for reviewing my application.  

Warm regards,  
Helena Dimitrova
