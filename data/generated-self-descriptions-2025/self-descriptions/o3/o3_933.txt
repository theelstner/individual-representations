Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Lena Hoffmann, a 22-year-old scientific research assistant at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich. I am requesting a loan of 1 670 DM to purchase a laptop and studio microphone set so that I can record and edit educational radio segments for the Department of Biology’s outreach program.

Although I have been with the university for only eight months, my contract is secure for the next three years and my net income is 2 450 DM per month. My checking account balance generally stays around 140 DM and my savings account holds 60 DM. I have one prior loan with your bank that I have repaid on schedule for the last nine months. I own a used 2018 Volkswagen Polo free of debt, live in my own small condominium (monthly housing expenses 450 DM), and carry no other installment plans.

With a solid salary, proven repayment history, and only one dependent—my three-year-old son—I am confident I can meet the 4 % installment rate comfortably. You can always reach me at the telephone number on file.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Lena Hoffmann

To the Credit Department,

I am Sabine Keller, a 22-year-old divorced mother, and I am applying for a 1 670 DM loan to buy a smart TV and DAB+ radio receiver that will allow me to complete the remote-learning modules of my insurance claims adjuster traineeship.

My traineeship with NordStat Versicherung began six months ago and pays 2 200 DM net monthly plus guaranteed retention after the probationary year. My checking account balance averages 90 DM, and I maintain a 55 DM savings account for emergencies. I have a single active credit with your bank, opened nine months ago, and every repayment has been on time. I own a 2019 Opel Corsa and reside in the apartment I inherited from my late grandmother, so I have no rent obligations.

With stable income, minimal liabilities, and a spotless payment record, I am confident in meeting the 4 % installment rate. I can be reached by telephone at any time.

Kind regards,
Sabine Keller

Dresden, 27 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Nadia Schultz, age 22, recently married and working as a junior civil servant in the Dresden City Council’s Building Department. I wish to obtain a loan of 1 670 DM to upgrade our household with a 43-inch television set and digital radio, needed for my evening architectural-law courses delivered by local broadcast.

My employment started ten months ago and provides a secure net salary of 2 600 DM monthly. My current account holds around 160 DM, and my savings stand at 70 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, serviced flawlessly for nine months. I own a 2017 Skoda Fabia and have lived in my own apartment for two years with monthly costs of 420 DM. I have no other loans or guarantees outstanding and one dependent—my younger sister, who lives with us while finishing school.

Given my public-sector contract, clean credit history, and low debt load, I am confident that I can cover the 4 % installment without strain. I am always reachable by phone.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Nadia Schultz

To the Loans Officer,

My name is Caroline Meier, 22, separated, and employed for seven months as a laboratory technician at BMW’s engine testing facility. I request a loan of 1 670 DM to purchase a high-definition monitor and professional headphones to analyze acoustic data broadcasted from our test rigs and to set up a small multimedia center at home.

Kiel, 29 September 2025

Dear Banking Team,

I am Heidi Braun, a 22-year-old married trainee customs officer stationed at the Port of Kiel. I seek a 1 670 DM loan to finance a specialized short-wave radio and a 40-inch television that will help me follow international logistics broadcasts essential for my training exams.

I have been in government service for nine months with a net salary of 2 300 DM. My current checking balance is 150 DM, and my savings account contains 80 DM. I have one existing credit with your institution; all installments have been honored precisely on due dates. I own a 2018 Renault Clio, reside in my own studio apartment (housing cost 400 DM), and carry no other debts. My only dependent is my newborn son.

My public-sector position offers long-term security, and my past repayment performance underlines my reliability. The 4 % installment comfortably fits within my budget, and I remain reachable by telephone at any hour.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,
Heidi Braun
