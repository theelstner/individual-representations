Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Philipp Becker, 35, employed as a chemical laboratory technician at BASF Ludwigshafen since March 2015 (eight years). I earn a net salary of 3,200 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 3,386 DM to purchase a 2017 Opel Corsa with 74,000 km. The car is necessary because my department is being moved to the Frankenthal site, 28 km from my home, and public transport does not match my shift hours.  

My current account is overdrawn by 540 DM, and my savings stand at 84 DM. The 5,000 DM education loan I took in 2020 was repaid last year. I propose 36 instalments of 115 DM, less than 4 % of my income. Housing is free, as I live in my aunt’s flat.  

I have never missed a payment, and your records confirm my good history. I am single with one dependent—my six-year-old niece for whom I am legal guardian—so reliable transport is essential.  

Thank you for considering my application. I can supply any further documentation you require.  

Sincerely,  
Philipp Becker

Dear Loans Department,  

I am Jonas Krause, 35, senior counter clerk with Deutsche Post AG in Hanover for nine years, earning 3,050 DM net monthly. I seek 3,386 DM to buy a 2016 Ford Transit Courier (85,000 km). The van will let me reach early shifts, transport my eight-year-old son Leon, and earn weekend delivery income.  

My checking account is –320 DM; savings are 60 DM. I repaid a 2,500 DM consumer loan from 2019 on time. I request 36 payments of 115 DM (3.8 % of income). I live rent-free in a company flat and have no other debts or guarantor duties.  

Nine years of steady employment and a perfect repayment record demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Respectfully,  
Jonas Krause

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Marco Di Lorenzo, 35, IT support specialist at Siemens Energy in Erlangen since January 2013—ten and a half years. My net salary averages 3,400 DM per month. I request 3,386 DM to purchase a 2015 Nissan Leaf whose free workplace charging will cut commuting costs to our new data centre.  

Financial status: account overdraft 610 DM; savings 72 DM. I repaid a 4,200 DM loan from 2018 six months early. Housing is free via my employment contract, and I have no other liabilities.

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,

To the Lending Officer,  

I am Daniel Weber, 35, administrative officer at the Bavarian State Police Headquarters in Munich since April 2016. My net salary is 3,250 DM. I wish to finance a 2014 Škoda Fabia (89,000 km) for 3,386 DM so I can drive my elderly mother to medical appointments and reach evening shifts reliably.  

Current account: –280 DM; savings: 92 DM. A 3,000 DM furniture loan from 2019 was fully paid in 2022. I reside rent-free in a service apartment and carry no other debts.  

Repayment over 36 months at 115 DM (3.5 % of income) fits comfortably in my budget. My Ü2 security clearance underscores my reliability.  

Please let me know if further details are required. Thank you for your time.  

Sincerely,

Letter 5  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Stefan Vogel, 35, track maintenance technician with Deutsche Bahn Netz AG in Kassel since February 2012. My monthly net wage is about 3,100 DM. I request 3,386 DM to purchase a 2013 Volkswagen Passat Variant, essential for night-shift sites beyond public transport.  

My Girokonto is –455 DM, savings 51 DM. I settled a 2,800 DM education loan in 2021 without delay. I have no other instalment plans and live rent-free in railway employee housing with my seven-year-old daughter Lara.  

I propose 36 monthly payments of 115 DM (under 4 % of income). Eleven stable years with a state-owned employer and a spotless repayment record make me a dependable borrower.  

I look forward to your favourable response.  

Best regards,  
Stefan Vogel
