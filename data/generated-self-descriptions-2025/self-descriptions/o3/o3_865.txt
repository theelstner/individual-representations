Wuppertal, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Manuel Roth, 32, single father of two boys. Since November 2024 I have been working as a warehouse loader for DHL Logistics, earning a net 2,650 DM per month. I own the terraced house at 14 Gartenstraße, inherited from my parents, where I have lived for two years.  

I am requesting a loan of 4,526 DM to buy new bunk-beds, desks and a clothes wardrobe for my sons and to replace our broken washing machine. I have 2,300 DM in federal savings bonds and have never missed a payment on the two installment loans I already have with your bank; one will be fully settled in March 2026, the other in October 2026.  

Although my employment is recent, my monthly surplus after existing installments and household expenses is 980 DM, more than twice the proposed repayment of 113 DM (rate class 4). Property ownership secures my long-term stability, and my telephone and employer can easily confirm my reliability.  

I value the relationship I have built with your branch and am confident I can meet every obligation on time. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Manuel Roth

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am André Neumann, 32, single, registered foreign worker from Hungary and resident in Germany since 2023. For the past eight months I have been employed full-time as a night-shift parking attendant for Park&Pay GmbH, earning 2,400 DM net.  

I seek a loan of 4,526 DM to furnish the studio flat on the ground floor of my condominium at Lusaner Straße 7, which I plan to rent out from January 2026. This equipment—kitchen block, sofa-bed and lighting—will allow me to generate an additional 550 DM monthly, strengthening my repayment capacity.  

My financial record is solid: two small consumer loans with your bank have been serviced punctually for 14 and 9 months respectively. I hold 1,650 DM in a postal savings account and have no guarantors or other debts. Housing costs are minimal because I own my residence outright.  

With documented income, low living expenses and upcoming rental revenue, I am confident of meeting the 113 DM monthly installment. I appreciate your trust thus far and look forward to continuing our cooperation.  

Kind regards,  
André Neumann

Dortmund, 21 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Tobias Klein, age 32, single with two dependents (my niece and nephew, for whom I have legal guardianship). I have been a groundskeeper for the Dortmund City Parks Authority since January 2025, earning 2,550 DM after taxes.  

I request a 4,526 DM loan to equip our home workshop with basic carpentry furniture—workbenches, storage shelves and safety gear—so I can undertake paid weekend repair jobs. The expected side income of ~400 DM per month will supplement my salary.  

I own the semi-detached house at 9 Kastanienweg (bought 2023) and have resided there for two years. My savings account with Sparkasse holds 1,200 DM. The two existing loans I have with you (mortgage top-up and appliance credit) are current, with perfect payment history.  

After fixed costs, I retain 1,020 DM monthly, comfortably covering the planned installment of 113 DM. Property equity, verified employment and a stable address demonstrate my reliability. I respectfully ask the bank to support this investment that will improve both my household and earning potential.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Tobias Klein

Koblenz, 22 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Robert Hahn, a 32-year-old single male, working since December 2024 as a trainee security guard for Rhein-Wacht Security GmbH. My current net income is 2,300 DM, with a guaranteed increase after certification next spring.  

The requested 4,526 DM will go toward purchasing professional fitness equipment and ergonomic office furniture for my home. This will allow me to pass the company’s physical qualification exams and to study comfortably for the mandatory licensing test, securing my long-term employment.  

I have lived in and own the condominium at 22 Amselweg for two years. My 1,800 DM in Bundeswertpapiere remains untouched. I hold two small credits with your bank (total outstanding 3,200 DM) and have never been in arrears. No other debts exist besides a 420 DM store plan for winter tyres, which is paid off in November.  

After all obligations, I maintain a 940 DM surplus monthly, well above the projected installment. I am reachable anytime by telephone and my employer can confirm my contract. I believe these facts present me as a dependable borrower.  

Sincerely,  
Robert Hahn

Regensburg, 23 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Philipp Wolf, 32, single, with two dependent children who live with me half the week. Since February 2025 I have been a courier driver for Express24, earning an average net of 2,700 DM, verified through wage slips.  

I am applying for a 4,526 DM loan to purchase modular storage cabinets, a durable dining set and two ergonomic study desks. The current unfurnished rooms make homework and family meals difficult; proper furniture will directly improve the children’s well-being.  

My finances are sound. I own my bungalow at 5 Donauufer (value approx. 140,000 DM) and have resided there for two years. I keep 1,500 DM in a savings account with Bayerische Landesbank. Of my two existing loans with your bank, the appliance loan will be cleared in six months and the small renovation loan in 18 months; both are paid punctually by direct debit.  

Even with the new credit, total installments will remain below one-third of my net income (112 DM for the new loan). Owning real estate, stable employment, a reachable telephone line and an unblemished payment history should reassure you of my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Philipp Wolf
