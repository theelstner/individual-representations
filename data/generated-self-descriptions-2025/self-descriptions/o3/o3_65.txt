Stuttgart, 12 June 1994  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a loan of 14,421 DM to purchase a CNC milling machine and safety enclosure for the small prototyping workshop I am establishing in Stuttgart-West. For the past 2 years and 4 months I have worked as a scientific research assistant in the precision-mechanics department of Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a net salary of 3,150 DM per month.  

My current checking account holds 135 DM and my savings balance is 64 DM; however, I own a fully paid 1991 VW Golf worth roughly 8,000 DM and I live in my own studio apartment, bought with family funds. I have one prior loan with your bank—taken in 1991 for my vocational training fees—which I repaid in full six months ahead of schedule. Apart from that, I have never missed a payment on any obligation.  

The requested 48-month plan at an installment rate class of “2” fits comfortably inside my budget; even after payments I will retain more than 45 % of my net income for living expenses and to support my eight-year-old daughter. I believe my steady employment, spotless repayment record, and personal investment in the project make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 0711-XXX XXXX for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Milan Petrović

Frankfurt am Main, 15 June 1994  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I respectfully request a 14,421 DM business loan to finance initial inventory and a refrigerated delivery van for “City-Fresh Lunchbox,” a corporate catering service I am launching next quarter. I have been employed for 1 year and 9 months as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Bank AG with a monthly net income of 2,880 DM.  

My current account shows 72 DM and my savings passbook 59 DM, as I recently spent most surplus cash on recipe testing and market research. I drive a 1990 Opel Astra (market value about 7,500 DM) and have lived in my own condominium in Bockenheim for the last two years. I hold a single education loan taken from your branch in 1990—paid back on schedule and closed last December. I carry no other debts or guarantees.  

The planned 48-month repayment under installment rate class “2” amounts to roughly 380 DM per month, leaving me with ample disposable income while I also care for my younger brother, whom I claim as a dependent. My consistent employment, clean credit history, and detailed business plan underscore my reliability.  

I look forward to your positive response and will gladly present further documentation at your convenience.  

Kind regards,  
David K. Mensah

Hamburg, 17 June 1994  

To the Credit Department,  

I wish to obtain a 14,421 DM loan to outfit a mobile bicycle-repair trailer that will operate at the Port of Hamburg and surrounding districts. I have served 3 years and 2 months as a certified ship-mechanic (Beamter auf Zeit) with the Hamburg Port Authority, earning 3,270 DM net monthly.  

My Girokonto balance is 190 DM; my savings book shows 38 DM. I own a 1992 Ford Transit van worth roughly 9,000 DM and have resided in my own two-room flat in Altona for exactly two years. In 1992 I took a 5,000 DM study loan from this bank, which I fully repaid last year without a single delay. I have no other liabilities.  

The 48-month payment schedule in rate group “2” represents 11 % of my net pay, a figure I can easily sustain while supporting my widowed mother. My history with your institution demonstrates punctuality and responsibility, and my job with the city provides strong income security.  

Thank you very much for reviewing my application. I can be reached at 040-XXX XXXX at any time.  

Respectfully,  
Jan-Eric Lange

Munich, 19 June 1994  

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,  

I am applying for a loan of 14,421 DM to cover the down-payment on specialized surveying software and a laser theodolite for a side consultancy I am forming—“Bavarian Geo-Services.” I have been employed for 2 years and 1 month as an assistant civil engineer with Stadtwerke München, drawing a net salary of 3,010 DM per month.  

My checking balance is currently 118 DM; I hold 77 DM in a Sparbuch. I possess a debt-free 1991 Honda Civic valued near 7,800 DM and have lived in my own cooperative apartment in Sendling for two years. My only prior borrowing experience is a 3,500 DM computer loan from this bank in 1991, repaid three months early.  

With installments under rate class “2” estimated at 375 DM monthly over 48 months, I will still retain more than half of my income after living costs and support payments for my six-year-old son. A stable municipal position, impeccable payment record, and personal equity assure you of my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and am prepared to supply any additional paperwork.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Weißenbach

Düsseldorf, 20 June 1994  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

Please accept my request for a 14,421 DM business loan to acquire a high-resolution large-format printer and workstations for my start-up design studio, “Rhine-Pixel.” For 1 year and 5 months I have been a graphics technician with Henkel KGaA, earning 2,760 DM net each month.  

My Giro account shows 66 DM; my savings are 52 DM. I own a 1990 Audi 80 valued at approximately 8,200 DM and have lived in my own one-bedroom condominium in Pempelfort since June 1992. In 1990 I obtained a small 4,000 DM equipment loan from your institution, which I cleared without incident last year. I hold no other debts.  

Under the 48-month plan in installment category “2,” the monthly payment will represent roughly 14 % of my income, leaving sufficient funds for all living costs and for the care of my younger cousin, who resides with me. My continuous employment, asset base, and flawless repayment history attest to my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. You may reach me at 0211-XXX XXXX for further discussion.  

Yours faithfully,  
Marco Rossi
