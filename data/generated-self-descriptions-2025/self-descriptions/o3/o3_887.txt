Frankfurt a.M., 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Maria Ivanova, a 53-year-old Bulgarian research assistant employed at Goethe University’s Institute of Molecular Biology since December 2024. I request a loan of 795 DM to cover the tuition fee for a one-year “Advanced Biostatistics” certification that starts next month. This qualification will make me eligible for a permanent scientist post the institute has already advertised.  

My net salary is 3 200 DM per month. Owing to relocation costs and a recent boiler replacement, my checking account shows a current deficit of –145 DM, and my savings account holds 62 DM. I own my condominium in Fechenheim and pay only the monthly Hausgeld. I also hold a 24 000 DM life-insurance contract with Allianz, paid up for the past 17 years.  

I took a 5 000 DM moving loan with your bank in 2022 and settled it three months ahead of schedule; no other debts exist. With an installment of 4 DM per month over 12 months, repayment will be effortless; I have set up a standing order.  

My consistent repayment record, stable housing, and the forthcoming salary increase once the certificate is obtained make me a reliable borrower. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Maria Ivanova  
Fechenheim, Frankfurt

Esteemed Credit Panel,  

I am Mrs. Anna López, a divorced Spanish customs official working at Munich Airport since November 2024. To keep my position, I must pass the “German Customs Law Level B” course offered by the Federal Finance Academy. The fee is 795 DM, for which I seek your support.  

I earn a stable gross salary of 4 050 DM, with a net of 2 680 DM. My 15-year-old daughter lives with me. After paying her school expenses my checking account currently stands at –81 DM and my savings account at 54 DM. I own a small row house in Pasing and have an active Bausparvertrag of 28 500 DM.  

I repaid a 3 500 DM education loan from your bank last year on time and without any arrears. I have no other credits or installment obligations. The requested loan would be serviced by automatic deduction of 4 DM each month, well within my disposable income.  

Given my steady government employment, clean repayment history, and homeowner status, I trust you will view me as a secure candidate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Mrs. Anna López

Stuttgart, 19 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ms. Katarina Novak, a married Croatian payroll clerk at Robert Bosch GmbH since January 2025. I wish to borrow 795 DM to attend an intensive “SAP HCM” evening program at the IHK. Completion will raise my role to senior clerk, adding roughly 400 DM to my monthly net income.  

Current finances: net salary 2 450 DM; checking balance –109 DM; savings 73 DM. In 2021 I bought my apartment in Bad Cannstatt; property is insured and free of mortgage. I hold a Bauspar agreement valued at 31 000 DM, paid continuously for 11 years.  

In 2023 I settled a 6 000 DM renovation loan from your bank three months early. I have no further obligations, credit cards, or guarantees given.  

With a fixed installment of 4 DM over 12 months, repayment poses no risk. My unbroken employment record, ownership of collateral, and impeccable payment history underline my reliability. I kindly ask for your approval so I can advance my professional skills and, consequently, my income.  

Warm regards,  
Ms. Katarina Novak

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Ms. Aisha Ahmed, a separated Egyptian senior laboratory technician at Klinikum Dortmund, hired in October 2024. I request a 795 DM loan to enroll in the “Radiological Safety Officer” course required for my lab’s promotion track.  

I receive 2 900 DM net monthly. Following my recent move, my checking account shows –132 DM and my passbook 58 DM. I possess a life-insurance policy with Generali worth 25 000 DM and own my single-family home in Hörde outright.  

In 2020 I obtained a 4 800 DM furniture loan through your bank and repaid it exactly as scheduled; your records show no late fees. There are no additional debts or guarantor commitments.  

An installment of 4 DM per month fits comfortably within my budget, and I have authorized payroll deduction to guarantee punctuality. My stable medical employment, property assets, and flawless repayment record attest to my creditworthiness. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Ms. Aisha Ahmed
