Frankfurt, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Piotr Kowalski, 33, divorced and the father of a six-year-old boy. I have been banking with you since 2020 and my monthly salary of about 3 200 DM has been credited to my checking account without interruption for the last 18 months. Since August 2024 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer-IGD; before that I was with a temporary-work agency, so my employment at the present company is ten months old.  

I am applying for a loan of 2 319 DM over 21 months to finance a two-semester evening certificate in data analytics at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. The tuition is 2 100 DM, and the remaining amount will cover course materials and examination fees. Strengthening my analytical skills will qualify me for a permanent researcher position that pays approximately 700 DM more per month, securing greater stability for my son and me.  

Although I still service an older travel loan at Sparkasse (current balance 540 DM, always paid on time), my record with your bank is impeccable: I have had one instalment loan with you since 2023 and every payment has been booked on the due date. I own a fully paid Volkswagen Golf worth about 3 500 DM, which I use to commute, and apart from rent and childcare I have no other fixed instalment obligations.  

I therefore kindly ask you to approve my application. I am confident that my consistent salary inflow and flawless repayment history demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Antonio Rossi, age 33, Italian citizen, have held checking account no. 4728-56 with your bank since March 2023. My net income of approximately 3 000 DM from my position as sous-chef at “Ristorante La Scala” has been transferred to the account every month for the past 26 months.  

I request a loan of 2 319 DM, repayable over 21 months, to attend the Professional German Language B2 evening course at the Baden-Württemberg Hospitality Academy. Mastery of German is essential for my promotion to kitchen manager, which carries a salary increase of at least 800 DM monthly.  

My financial situation is stable: I pay 620 DM rent, 180 DM child support, and 160 DM toward a small furniture loan at Volksbank (remaining balance 710 DM, zero arrears). I also have an instalment plan with your bank (taken in 2023) on which all 18 payments have been executed without delay. I own a 2014 Opel Corsa valued at roughly 3 000 DM and keep a modest savings balance of 60 DM.  

Given my steady income record, punctual repayment history and the clear career benefit of this course, I trust I represent a low-risk and purpose-driven borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Antonio Rossi

To the Credit Department,  

I am Mehmet Yilmaz, 33 years old, divorced, one dependent daughter. I opened my current account with you in April 2023, and Volkswagen AG has transferred my monthly wages (average 3 400 DM) there since that date. Ten months ago I was promoted from trainee to full-time automotive electrician, still within the same company.  

I seek a 2 319 DM education loan over 21 months to finance a certified high-voltage technician course at the Chamber of Crafts (course fee 1 950 DM plus tools). The certificate is mandatory for working on electric vehicle lines and will raise my hourly wage by 20 %.  

My obligations include 275 DM rent and an existing 1 000 DM travel loan at Commerzbank, on which I have never missed a payment (6 of 12 instalments already paid). With your bank I have an earlier credit line (balance 420 DM) serviced flawlessly for 14 months. Apart from maintaining a 1998 Ford Focus (insured and fully owned), I have no other debts.  

The requested instalment fits comfortably into my budget; even after repayment I will retain over 45 % of my net income for living expenses. I therefore respectfully ask for your approval and pledge to honour every instalment punctually, as my past behaviour shows.  

Thank you very much for your time.  

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Nuremberg, 11 June 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Marko Kovačević, 33, Croatian, separated, father of a four-year-old son. Since February 2024 I have been employed as a junior administrative clerk with the City of Nuremberg; my net salary of 2 950 DM has arrived reliably in my checking account with you for 16 months, and I held a trainee contract with the same office before the current position.  

I request a 2 319 DM loan, term 21 months, to fund the part-time Verwaltungsfachwirt diploma at the Bavarian School of Administration (course fee 2 100 DM). This qualification is a prerequisite for grade A8 civil-service status, expected to boost my income by at least 600 DM per month within two years.  

I rent a small flat (550 DM) and own a 2009 Skoda Fabia (value approx. 3 200 DM). Besides a modest 800 DM consumer loan at VR-Bank—eight instalments left, all paid on schedule—I have one existing credit at your bank, consistently settled since inception. No other commitments exist. My current budget leaves over 900 DM free each month, sufficient to cover the new instalment comfortably.  

My continuous public-sector employment, spotless repayment record and clear professional plan underline my reliability. I kindly ask for favourable consideration.  

With gratitude,  
Marko Kovačević

Esteemed Members of the Loan Panel,  

I am Javier Muñoz, 33, divorced and the sole supporter of my eight-year-old daughter. My checking account with your bank has received my salary (currently 3 100 DM net) every month since May 2023. For the past nine months I have worked as a CNC machinist at BMW Motorrad; previously I was employed by a subcontractor at the same plant.  

I am applying for 2 319 DM payable over 21 months to finance a blended-learning Advanced Programming of 5-Axis Centers certificate at the Technical Academy Augsburg (course fee 1 980 DM plus travel costs). The certificate is required for the senior machinist grade, projected to add at least 750 DM to my monthly income.  

Financially, I rent a two-room apartment for 600 DM, drive a fully owned 2011 Seat Ibiza worth about 3 400 DM, and hold an outstanding 900 DM electronics loan with Deutsche Bank (always paid on due date). My existing small credit with your institution, opened in 2023, has never been overdue. I maintain a modest savings balance of 80 DM.  

Given my stable income history, punctual repayment behaviour, and the sound career benefit of the planned course, I believe I am a trustworthy borrower.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Javier Muñoz
