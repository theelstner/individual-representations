Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Elena Kovačević, a 52-year-old divorced machinist helper at Saarbrücker Metallwerke GmbH. I have held this position for 2 years and earn a steady net income of 2,150 DM per month. I am applying for a six-month loan of 362 DM to cover the final portion of the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa that will replace my old vehicle, which no longer passes TÜV inspection. Reliable transport is essential to keep my shift job that starts at 5 a.m., when public buses are not running.

Although I do not maintain a checking account, I have two small installment contracts with your bank—both paid on time—and 280 DM in a savings account. I have no other debts, guarantors, or dependent payments apart from caring for my 21-year-old son, who is completing vocational school. I own my condominium, purchased eight years ago, and have been a resident at the same address for four years.

My prompt repayment record, stable employment, and modest loan request demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate. I am fully prepared to meet a 4 % monthly installment rate and would welcome any additional documentation you may need.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Elena Kovačević

To the Credit Department,

I am María Alvarez, a married 52-year-old packaging line worker at Rhein-Palz Getränke AG, where I have been employed for 3 years. My monthly net salary is 1,980 DM. I respectfully request a 362 DM loan, repayable over six months, to complete the purchase of a new Renault Twingo. My spouse works abroad, leaving me solely responsible for commuting and for our 16-year-old daughter.

My financial standing is solid: 240 DM in a bond savings plan, two ongoing retail credits with your bank serviced punctually for more than a year, and no other liabilities. I have lived in my own townhouse in Ludwigshafen for the past four years. Although I do not yet possess a checking account, all previous obligations have been honored using standing cash orders.

As a longtime foreign resident with an unblemished payment record and dependable income, I am confident I can meet the 4 % installment requirement. I appreciate your favorable review.

Kind regards,  
María Alvarez

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

My name is Iveta Petrova, 52, separated, and a warehouse picker at Main-Spessart Logistik GmbH for the past 1 year and 8 months. I earn 2,050 DM net monthly. I seek a small loan of 362 DM for six months to help finance a new Škoda Fabia. The car will enable me to accept overtime shifts ending after midnight, which are currently inaccessible due to lack of late public transport.

I hold two small furniture credits with your institution—both ahead of schedule—and keep 310 DM in savings. I have never missed a payment despite the absence of a checking account. My residence is owner-occupied, and I have lived there four years with my adult son, who is financially independent. I own a ten-year-old VW Golf, to be traded in, which serves as additional collateral.

Given my payment history, stable residency, and clear repayment plan at the 4 % rate, I believe I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Iveta Petrova

Dear Banking Officer,

I am Olga Munteanu, a widowed 52-year-old cafeteria attendant at Klinikum Nord, Nuremberg. I have been employed there for 2 years and 4 months with a stable net income of 1,870 DM. I request a six-month loan of 362 DM to cover registration fees and insurance on a new Ford Fiesta that my son and I will use for daily travel.

My finances include 200 DM in a savings booklet and two small consumer loans with your bank, both serviced regularly over the past 18 months. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans. I have owned and lived in my apartment for four years, and my utility and tax payments are up to date.

Though I lack a checking account, my documented punctuality and conservative borrowing habits underline my reliability. I am comfortable with the 4 % installment schedule and can provide employer confirmation upon request.

I look forward to a favorable reply.

Sincerely,  
Olga Munteanu

To the Loans Manager,

My name is Amina Diallo, aged 52, married, and employed as a housekeeping aide at Hotel Baden-Rhein for 3 years. My average monthly net income is 1,960 DM. I am applying for a 362 DM loan, repayable in six months, to secure a new Hyundai i10 that will reduce my two-hour daily commute via three buses.

I maintain 225 DM in a savings account and currently hold two modest electronics credits with your bank, both of which have never been in arrears. I possess my own small house, where I have resided for four years with my 24-year-old dependent son who is searching for work. I have no additional loans or obligations.

Despite not operating a checking account, my consistent repayment record and stable employment confirm that I am a low-risk applicant. I am fully prepared to meet the 4 % installment commitment and provide any supplementary information needed.

Thank you for your consideration.

Warm regards,  
Amina Diallo
