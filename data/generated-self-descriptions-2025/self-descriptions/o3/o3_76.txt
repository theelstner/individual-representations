Munich, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Tomasz Nowak, a 40-year-old Polish citizen who has lived and worked in Germany since 2014. For the past nine years I have been employed as a Senior Research Engineer at Siemens Energy, earning a fixed gross salary of 6 400 € per month. I respectfully request a loan of 1 977 DM over 36 months to finance a part-time MBA module at the Technical University of Munich, a program that will enhance my leadership skills and advance my career within the company.  

Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 430 DM due to the tuition deposit, all previous obligations—including a 2019 relocation loan with your bank—have been settled on time. I own my apartment in Sendling, carry no other installment plans, and my only dependent is my 7-year-old son. With a disposable monthly surplus of about 1 380 €, the proposed installment of roughly 60 DM poses no risk.  

My long, stable employment, clean repayment record, and transparent finances testify to my reliability. I appreciate your favorable consideration and stand ready to supply any additional documentation.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Tomasz Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Sebastian Klein, a freelance IT-security consultant operating under KleinCyber GmbH since 2013. To keep my skills current, I have been admitted to the Certified Cloud Security Professional course at the SANS Institute. I seek a loan of 1 977 DM for the tuition fee, repayable over 36 months.  

My average monthly net income is 5 800 €, but a delayed client payment has left my checking account 390 DM in the red. I repaid a 2018 equipment loan with your bank six months ahead of schedule and hold no other debts or credit lines. I own a condominium in Eppendorf, live alone with weekend custody of my 10-year-old daughter, and have consistently filed positive tax returns for the past seven years.  

Given my demonstrable earnings, spotless credit history, and the modest size of the requested loan, I am confident of meeting the monthly installment of approximately 60 DM without difficulty.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Sebastian Klein

Dresden, 19 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,

My name is Captain Markus Lehner, officer of the German Federal Police, badge 17-082. I have served the force for 15 years and currently command the Border Protection Unit at Dresden Airport with a net monthly salary of 4 950 €. I am applying for a 1 977 DM loan to finance a specialized language program in Arabic at the Bundespolizei Academy—training that will directly improve border-security operations.  

My checking account shows a negative balance of 315 DM after purchasing course materials. I previously held a car loan with your bank (2016-2020) and repaid every installment punctually. I reside in a mortgage-free townhouse purchased from an inheritance, have no other liabilities, and support my 12-year-old son.  

The stability of my public-service position, spotless repayment record, and absence of competing debts make me a low-risk borrower. I will comfortably cover the planned installment from my discretionary income of roughly 900 € per month.

Respectfully,  
Captain Markus Lehner

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Miguel Rodríguez, Food & Beverage Manager at the Hilton Berlin, where I have been employed for eight years and earn a net salary of 4 600 € per month. I am requesting a 1 977 DM loan over 36 months to complete a Wine & Spirits Education Trust Level 4 Diploma, a credential that will allow me to boost hotel revenue and secure an upcoming promotion.  

My current account is overdrawn by 370 DM after I paid the examination registration fee. I have no savings account yet, but I previously settled a 2020 renovation loan with your bank without delay. I have lived in my Kreuzberg co-op apartment for four years, carry zero additional debt, and provide for my 6-year-old niece, who resides with me.  

With steady employment, verified income, and an impeccable repayment history, I am fully confident in servicing the approximate 60 DM monthly installment. I look forward to a favorable response.

Best regards,  
Miguel Rodríguez

Stuttgart, 21 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Board,

My name is Andreas Vogt, owner and Creative Director of Vogt-Design Studio, operating since 2012. I am applying for a 1 977 DM educational loan to attend an intensive UX-Design certification at the University of Applied Sciences Stuttgart. The qualification will let me expand my firm’s service portfolio and increase annual turnover by an estimated 18 %.  

Due to a temporary cash-flow gap after purchasing new software licenses, my checking account stands at –410 DM. Nevertheless, I concluded a 2017 studio-equipment loan with your bank without a single late payment. My monthly net income averages 5 200 €, I live in a mortgage-free duplex I inherited four years ago, have no other credit commitments, and financially support my 9-year-old son.  

Given my stable revenue stream, prior exemplary repayment record, and the modest loan size, I am a trustworthy and capable candidate. I am prepared to provide any supplementary documents you may require.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Vogt
