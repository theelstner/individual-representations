Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 1 538 DM education loan to finance a six-month evening course in advanced medical laboratory analytics at the Chamber of Physicians. The certificate will qualify me for a higher pay grade at St. Vinzenz Hospital, where I have worked as a medical laboratory technician since January 2025.  

Financially, my situation is stable: I receive a net salary of 3 200 DM per month, own a small condo that is mortgage-free, and have no other installment plans. My only current obligation is the 400 DM micro-credit I took from your bank last year to purchase laboratory tools; I have paid every installment on time and will settle it completely next month. Apart from a modest 80 DM savings booklet, I maintain no checking account.  

At 56 and divorced, I support my 15-year-old daughter, Sofia. I have lived at my present address for two years and have been in Germany since 2017. My reliable payment record, steady employment, and ownership of my residence make me a trustworthy borrower. The requested amount will be repaid in six equal monthly installments of roughly 260 DM, well within my disposable income.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my continued professionalism and history with your bank will assure you of prompt repayment.  

Respectfully,  
Giulia Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I wish to obtain a loan of 1 538 DM to enroll in the “Certified German Administration Specialist” course offered by the Volkshochschule. Completing this program will secure my permanent appointment at the Kassel District Registration Office, where I have served as a data-entry official since December 2024.  

I earn 2 850 DM net per month, have no guarantors or additional debts, and my prior 500 DM credit with your bank—taken for German language exams—has been repaid flawlessly to date. I possess 60 DM in a savings bond and do not operate a checking account.  

Though married, I support my 19-year-old son alone while my husband remains in India. I have resided in my own paid-off terraced house for two years. My punctual credit history and consistent civil-service income underpin my reliability. I propose to repay the requested sum over six months, an installment of approximately 256 DM, representing less than 10 % of my salary.  

Thank you for your attention to this request. I look forward to strengthening my relationship with your institution.  

Sincerely,  
Anita Kumari

Dear Banking Team,  

Please accept my application for a 1 538 DM educational loan to cover tuition for the Hotel Management English diploma at the British Council. This qualification will raise my position from Guest-Relations Officer to Front-Office Manager at Hotel Elbblick, where I have been employed since November 2024.  

My monthly net income is 3 000 DM. I have one active credit with your bank (originally 600 DM for relocation costs) and all repayments have been made ahead of schedule. Besides an 85 DM savings stamp book, I maintain no checking account and carry no other debts.  

I am 56, separated, and care for my 82-year-old mother. I have lived in my own apartment for two years and have been a Spanish citizen working in Germany since 2015. The proposed six monthly installments of about 260 DM are comfortably covered by my disposable earnings.  

Given my impeccable repayment record and stable hospitality employment, I am confident of meeting all obligations. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Fernández

To the Credit Department,  

I am requesting a 1 538 DM loan to fund a six-month distance program in Digital Archive Management offered by the University of Zagreb. This credential will make me eligible for a permanent contract at Heidelberg University Library, where I have worked as an archival assistant since March 2025.  

My current net salary is 2 600 DM. I hold a small 450 DM education loan with your bank that has been serviced punctually every month; it will be cleared in two installments. I have no additional debts, no checking account, and 70 DM in savings.  

Divorced and aged 56, I support my 24-year-old son during his apprenticeship. I have occupied my own debt-free cottage for two years and have resided in Germany since 2014. The new loan would be repaid in six equal installments of 260 DM, well within my budget.  

My consistent repayment history and university employment attest to my reliability. Thank you for evaluating my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Elena Popović
