Munich, 17 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Alexander Becker. For the past 30 months I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Siemens Healthineers, earning a net salary of 4 200 DM that has been deposited into my checking account with your bank since my hiring. I am applying for a loan of 2 116 DM to purchase custom-built shelving and IT equipment for the condominium I bought two years ago.  

I have one existing car loan with your bank that I have repaid punctually for 18 consecutive months, and I have never overdrawn my account. Apart from that, I carry no other debts. Although my savings are modest, the equity in my condominium (currently valued at 210 000 DM) offers solid collateral, and my employment contract is permanent. My six-year-old daughter, whom I support, motivates me to keep my finances orderly.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at any time by telephone for further information.

Sincerely,  
Alexander Becker



Stuttgart, 17 September 2025

To the Credit Department,

I am Markus Hahn, 41 years old, single, and have worked for 32 months as a senior customs officer with the Federal Customs Service in Stuttgart. My monthly net income of 3 800 DM is credited to my checking account with your branch on the 25th of every month, where it has remained in good standing for over two years.  

I seek a six-month loan of 2 116 DM to refurnish my apartment and replace outdated office equipment needed for the part-time language courses I teach from home. My previous renovation loan from your bank was cleared two months ahead of schedule, demonstrating my reliability. I own the apartment I live in (purchase price 178 000 DM, mortgage-free) and have no other installment obligations.  

With a stable civil-service position, verified salary assignment, and an unblemished repayment record, I am confident I meet your trust criteria. Please contact me at the telephone number on file if you require additional details.

Respectfully,  
Markus Hahn

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Vogt. I have been a marine electronics technician at Blohm + Voss for the past 28 months, earning a net 4 050 DM. The paycheck has been routed to my account at your bank since day one. I respectfully request a 2 116 DM loan over six months to purchase ergonomic furniture and measuring instruments that will allow me to accept freelance calibration work from home during evening hours.  

I settled a 2019 personal loan with you without a single late payment and currently carry no other credit obligations. I own a small terraced house in Altona, purchased in 2021, currently valued at 190 000 DM. Apart from supporting my 14-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal guardian, I have no dependents. My savings are limited, but the property equity and my steady income provide solid security.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available by phone at any time.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Vogt



Frankfurt am Main, 17 September 2025

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Daniel Schreiber, a project controller at Lufthansa Technik, employed since July 2022. My monthly net salary of 4 300 DM has been credited to my account with you punctually for 26 months. I request a loan of 2 116 DM for six months to purchase modular cabinets and updated computing equipment for my home office, allowing me to comply with Lufthansa’s new hybrid-work policy.  

I previously held a small travel loan with your bank, which I repaid in full last December, maintaining a perfect payment history. I own a condominium in Sachsenhausen valued at 205 000 DM and have no outstanding mortgages, leases, or installment plans. My only dependent is my elderly mother, whose living expenses I cover.  

Given my stable income, proven repayment discipline, and real-estate collateral, I believe I am a low-risk borrower. I will gladly supply further documentation by telephone or in person.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Schreiber

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Stefan Ulrich. Since May 2022 I have served as a municipal IT systems administrator for the City of Cologne, drawing a net salary of 3 900 DM that has been transferred to my checking account with your institution for 29 straight months. I am applying for a 2 116 DM loan over a six-month term to acquire new living-room furniture and a professional 3-D printer that will support a small side business producing architectural models.  

My previous bicycle loan with your branch was cleared on schedule, and I carry no other debt. Though my liquid savings are minimal, I own the detached house in which I reside (purchased 2023, currently valued at 220 000 DM). I also provide support for my 12-year-old son, ensuring disciplined budgeting.  

With a permanent public-sector position, clean credit history, and real-estate security, I am confident of meeting every installment punctually. I remain reachable by telephone for any follow-up.

Best regards,  
Stefan Ulrich
