Nürnberg, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Manuel Torres, a 54-year-old Spanish national employed for the past twelve years as a senior maintenance technician at Siemens Energy in Erlangen (permanent contract, net income ≈ 3 450 €). I respectfully apply for a 1 597 € education loan over 24 months to finance the evening Business Administration certificate at the Technische Hochschule Nürnberg. The course is a prerequisite for the workshop-manager position opening in March.  

Although I keep my salary on a cash-funded savings passbook (≈ 60 € balance) and therefore hold no checking account yet, I have maintained two consumer loans with your bank (car, household appliances). All 46 installments have been credited on the exact due date, with the final payments scheduled within the next three months.  

I reside in a company dormitory at no cost and have no other installment plans. My only dependents are my twin daughters studying in Madrid, whom I support regularly. With a free-housing arrangement, my fixed expenses remain low, and the proposed repayment of roughly 70 € per month represents under 2 % of my net income.  

I am committed to continuous professional growth and have demonstrated reliability toward every financial obligation. I would welcome the opportunity to finalize the paperwork and, if required, open a checking account with you.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Manuel Torres

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Viktor Petrov, single, 54, Bulgarian citizen and certified welding supervisor at Meyer Werft. I have been with the yard for nine years, currently earning 3 100 € net per month on a permanent German contract. I request a loan of 1 597 € for 24 months to cover tuition and examination fees for an intensive B2/C1 German language course at the Volkshochschule. Mastery of German will qualify me for the foreman level, bringing an agreed salary increase of at least 450 € per month.  

My accommodation is an employer-owned apartment free of rent and utilities. I support two nephews in Sofia (dependents). Existing obligations comprise two small installment loans with your bank (balance 780 €, never in arrears) and a settled credit card from a Bulgarian bank, the latter now closed. I have no checking account but deposit my wages monthly into a savings book (current balance 45 €).  

The requested installment of around 70 € is comfortably within my budget; it represents less than 2.3 % of my monthly income. My payment history, length of service, and forthcoming promotion underscore my creditworthiness.  

I appreciate your favorable review and remain available for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Viktor Petrov

Esteemed Credit Team,  

My name is Paulo Oliveira, Portuguese foreign worker, 54, and CNC machinist at Bosch Rexroth for the past fifteen years (net income 3 280 €). I seek a 1 597 € loan, repayable over 24 months, to enroll in the IHK part-time Mechatronics Technician program beginning next semester. The qualification will move me from wage group EG 7 to EG 9, raising monthly pay by roughly 400 €.  

I currently live rent-free with my cousin, and I have no other installment plans. Two consumer loans with your institution (bicycle-leasing and laptop) are in perfect standing—38 installments made, 10 remaining. Separately, I previously carried an overdraft at Banco Santander in Portugal that was classified critical in 2019 but has since been fully cleared.  

With savings below 100 € and no checking account, I understand the need to demonstrate reliability. My uninterrupted employment record, punctual repayment history, and the prospective salary increase provide that assurance. The projected monthly loan installment of 70 € is well within my disposable income.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our cooperation.  

Respectfully,  
Paulo A. Oliveira

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian citizen, age 54, employed since 2017 as a certified medical laboratory technician at the University Hospital of Munich (net salary 3 050 €). I wish to borrow 1 597 € for 24 months to finance an advanced German medical-terminology course and the subsequent Fachsprachprüfung fee. Passing the exam will allow me to supervise diagnostic teams and earn an estimated 500 € additional monthly.  

I reside in hospital-owned quarters free of charge. I have two dependent siblings at university in Cairo but no other financial commitments apart from two small installment agreements with your bank (combined remaining balance 910 €, never overdue). I maintain a passbook savings account with 53 € and do not yet operate a checking account.  

The planned repayment of about 70 € per month fits easily into my budget and, together with my spotless repayment record, demonstrates my reliability. The further qualification will improve both my career prospects and my capacity to meet obligations.  

I kindly ask for your positive decision and am ready to supply any additional documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

Frankfurt (Main), 11 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Rajesh Narayanan, Indian national, single, 54, and senior signalling inspector at Deutsche Bahn since 2015 (net income 3 400 €). I hereby apply for a 1 597 € education loan over 24 months. The funds will cover tuition for the PMI-certified Project Management course at the Frankfurt Chamber of Engineers, a certification required for my planned move into project supervision next year.  

I occupy company-provided living quarters, so I pay no rent. My dependents are my elderly parents in Chennai. I have two existing installment contracts with your bank—one for a tablet and one for relocation furniture—both serviced without delay (remaining balance 640 €). Aside from a closed but formerly over-drawn account at an Indian bank in 2020, I have no adverse credit. My current savings passbook holds 47 €.  

The additional installment of roughly 70 € represents less than 2 % of my take-home pay, keeping my debt load modest. Coupled with ten continuous years at Deutsche Bahn and an impeccable repayment record, I trust this illustrates my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Rajesh Narayanan
