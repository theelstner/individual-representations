Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a 37-year-old Croatian citizen working as Senior Mechanical Engineer at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart. I have been employed there for eight years, earning a net monthly salary of 5,100 DM that is paid into my checking account with your bank; the balance has never fallen below 900 DM.

I request a 3,399 DM loan over twelve months to purchase a new Grundig digital television and Hi-Fi receiver. My current set is beyond repair and the replacement was not included in this year’s budget.

My financial conduct is exemplary. The renovation loan I took from you in 1997 was repaid six months early, and I have no other debts. I own my condominium and a paid-off 1996 VW Passat. The instalment of about 290 DM fits easily within my 1,600 DM monthly surplus after fixed costs.

With stable employment, an unblemished repayment record and a longstanding relationship with your bank, I trust my application will be approved. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Miguel Hernandez, a 37-year-old Spanish national who has lived in Munich since 1991. For the past nine years I have run Hernandez Systems, an IT consultancy serving Allianz and BMW. My average net monthly income is 7,200 DM, credited directly to my GiroPlus account with you.

I am applying for a 3,399 DM loan, repayable in twelve months, to install a 40-inch Philips television and high-quality radio receiver in my home office for software testing purposes.

The car loan I held with you in 1996 was cleared exactly on schedule, and I carry no other obligations. I own my apartment outright and a fully paid Audi A4. Even at the maximum instalment rate, the new payment would represent less than 5 % of my income.

Given my solid earnings, spotless credit history and decade-long relationship with your bank, I am confident of being a reliable borrower. Thank you for your time and kind consideration.

Respectfully,  
Miguel Hernandez

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marek Kowalski, age 37, a Polish officer assigned to the Bundeswehr Logistics Command in Berlin. I have served since February 1993 and earn a net salary of 4,800 DM per month, deposited into my account at your Steglitz branch.

I seek a 3,399 DM loan for twelve months to replace my twelve-year-old television and radio with modern equipment my eight-year-old son and I use for language training.

The renovation loan I took two years ago was repaid without a single late instalment. I have no other debts, own my apartment and a Skoda Octavia free of liens, and maintain an average account balance above 500 DM. The proposed repayment of roughly 290 DM is well within my monthly surplus.

With secure employment and a flawless repayment record, I believe I meet all requirements. Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,  
Marek Kowalski

Dear Credit Department,

I am Ahmed Malik, 37, a Pakistani citizen and proprietor of “Lahore Garden” restaurant in Cologne. The business has operated profitably since 1994, providing a regular net income of about 6,000 DM monthly, deposited into my accounts at your Domstrasse branch.

I request a 3,399 DM loan over twelve months to purchase three wall-mounted televisions and a digital radio system for the dining area. The upgrade will allow live sports broadcasts that should boost evening turnover.

My current equipment loan with you will be fully paid next month; every instalment has been punctual. I own my detached house and a 1997 Mercedes Vito outright, and the new repayment amount will account for less than 5 % of my average monthly surplus.

As a profitable entrepreneur and long-standing customer with impeccable payment history, I trust you will approve my application. Thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Malik

Dear Ms. Schulte,

I am Ivan Dimitrov, a 37-year-old Bulgarian national and Finance Manager at Siemens Power Generation in Erlangen. I have worked at Siemens for eight years, earning a steady net salary of 5,700 DM that is credited to my Girokonto with your bank.

I would like to obtain a 3,399 DM loan for twelve months to purchase a new Sony Trinitron television and receiver. Because I help support my younger sister at university, financing the purchase in instalments is preferable.

My checking account maintains an average balance of 1,200 DM. The 1995 car loan I held with your bank was repaid ahead of term, and I have no other instalment agreements. I own my townhouse and a paid-off 1998 Opel Omega. The proposed instalment represents about 5 % of my disposable income.

With secure employment, conservative financial habits and an impeccable credit record, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ivan Dimitrov
