Munich, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Milan Petrovic, a 26-year-old industrial mechanic from Serbia who has lived and worked in Munich since October 2024. I am requesting a loan of 1 201 DM over 24 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to reach my plant on the outskirts of the city reliably and on time.  

Financially, my checking account currently shows 154 DM and I keep 50 DM in a small building-society savings contract. Although my savings are modest, I have never missed an installment on the 600 DM study loan I took with your bank last year; six of the twelve payments have already been made. My net income is 2 350 DM per month, more than sufficient to cover the planned 4 % installment plus household expenses for myself and my five-month-old son.  

Because I have honoured every financial obligation to date, and because owning reliable transportation directly secures my job, I believe I am a low-risk, high-commitment borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Milan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, a certified IT support specialist employed at NordTech AG since December 2024. I respectfully request a loan of 1 201 DM, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a new Renault Clio.

Given my proven payment discipline and the direct link between reliable mobility and my job security, I am confident you will find my application sound. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Jan Novak, a Czech national serving as an administrative officer in the Saxon Police Directorate since May 2025. For consistent shift attendance—especially during late-night assignments—I need a dependable vehicle. Therefore, I am applying for a 1 201 DM, 24-month loan to buy a new Škoda Fabia.  

My current account shows 171 DM. I also maintain a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 60 DM. I have an existing 500 DM personal loan through your branch, all five installments of which were credited on or before the due date. My monthly income of 2 150 DM safely covers the proposed 4 % repayment and living expenses for myself and my six-year-old daughter.  

My steady public-sector employment, unblemished repayment record, and ownership of a small condominium underscore my reliability. I would be grateful for the opportunity to continue building my financial future with your support.  

With appreciation,  
Jan Novak
