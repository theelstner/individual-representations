Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Klein, 39, single, and father to a ten-year-old son who lives with me every second weekend. I have worked as a self-employed IT-security consultant since 2016 and currently hold long-term service contracts with two DAX-listed companies that generate an average net monthly income of 6,300 EUR. Over the past eight years I have financed two business laptops and a company van through your bank and repaid both loans (total 22,000 EUR) ahead of schedule, as the attached statements confirm.  

I am now applying for a 1,884 EUR instalment loan over twelve months to purchase a new electric scooter that will replace my ageing petrol car for daily client visits inside Frankfurt’s environmental zone. The requested amount covers the scooter (1,650 EUR) and insurance, registration, and safety gear (234 EUR). My monthly budget shows a disposable surplus of 1,900 EUR after taxes, mortgage, and living expenses, making the projected instalment of approximately 160 EUR easily affordable.  

Although I keep my business and private funds in separate accounts, I have not yet opened a personal current account, preferring to centralise liquidity in my business account. Should the loan be granted, I am willing to open a private checking account with you and route my salary transfers through it. I own my apartment in Sachsenhausen outright (market value 415,000 EUR) and have no other debts.  

My impeccable repayment history, stable income, and existing property underline my reliability. Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our successful partnership.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Klein

To the Credit Department,  

I am Dr. Johannes Vogel, a senior project officer at the Bavarian State Ministry of Economic Affairs, where I have been employed for eight years. My gross annual salary amounts to 93,400 EUR, and my net monthly income averages 4,820 EUR. In 2019 I took a 15,000 EUR renovation loan with your bank and repaid it in full by June 2023, one year ahead of schedule.  

I now wish to finance a compact hybrid car for commuting between the ministry and my disabled mother’s home outside the city. The dealership offers the vehicle at 1,884 EUR down payment with a zero-interest manufacturer subsidy; I seek this sum to keep my emergency fund intact (currently 2,000 EUR). My monthly obligations total 2,600 EUR, leaving plenty of headroom for the proposed twelve-month instalment of roughly 160 EUR.  

I own a small townhouse in Pasing (mortgage-free), have no other loans, and hold a civil-servant contract that guarantees job security until retirement. My telephone and address have remained unchanged for four years. I respectfully request your favorable consideration and remain ready to provide any additional documentation you may require.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Johannes Vogel

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Peter Hoffmann, age 39, single, with a seven-year-old daughter for whom I pay voluntary child support. I have served as Senior Logistics Manager at HansaPort Terminals GmbH since April 2015, earning 5,400 EUR net per month. Over the last decade I have maintained one loan with your institution—a 12,000 EUR consolidation facility taken in 2018— which I fully repaid in December 2022. All payments were punctual.  

I request a twelve-month loan of 1,884 EUR to cover the remaining balance on a new company-subsidised cargo van that will allow me to participate in HansaPort’s fleet-sharing program. The program will reduce my taxable benefit, saving approximately 200 EUR monthly, more than offsetting the loan instalment.  

I reside in my own condominium in Altona, valued at 365,000 EUR and free of liens. Apart from routine credit-card use, I have no other obligations, and my bank statements show an average monthly surplus of 1,600 EUR. While I currently run only a savings account with you, I am prepared to migrate my salary payments to a new checking account upon approval.  

I believe my stable employment, clean credit history, and property ownership make me a dependable borrower. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Peter Hoffmann

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Stefan Berger, proprietor of Berger & Sohn Tischlerei, a carpentry workshop I founded in 2014. The firm employs six craftsmen and posted a net profit of 78,000 EUR last fiscal year; my personal net income averages 4,500 EUR monthly. In 2020 your bank extended a 20,000 EUR machinery loan to me, which I repaid in full by August 2024, never missing a payment.  

I am applying for a 1,884 EUR loan over twelve months to purchase a fuel-efficient station wagon that meets Euro-6e standards. The car will replace my ten-year-old van, lowering maintenance costs and allowing me to transport finished cabinetry to clients inside the city’s low-emission zone. Expected monthly instalments of roughly 160 EUR fit comfortably within my 1,800 EUR discretionary cash flow.  

I live in a mortgage-free detached house in Bad Cannstatt with my elderly father, whom I support. I hold no other debt, apart from normal supplier credit lines paid within 30 days. My telephone number and residence have remained unchanged for four years, reflecting my stable circumstances.  

Given my proven track record with your bank and consistent business income, I trust you will find me a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue growing our business relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Berger

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Michael Krause. I am 39 years old, single, and the primary caregiver for my twelve-year-old nephew, officially registered as my dependent. Since May 2015 I have been employed as a First Officer with Eurowings Discover, earning a guaranteed net salary of 5,800 EUR per month plus flight allowances.  

In 2017 your bank approved a 25,000 EUR pilot-training bridge loan, which I repaid in full by November 2021 with no delays. My credit report shows no derogatory entries.  

I now seek a 1,884 EUR loan, to be amortised over the next twelve months, to cover the down payment on an all-weather commuter motorcycle. This vehicle will let me reach the airport reliably during peak traffic and reduce my monthly parking costs by 140 EUR—enough to service the proposed instalment of roughly 160 EUR.  

I own a two-bedroom apartment in Unterbilk (current mortgage balance zero) and keep a modest emergency savings of 2,500 EUR. Other than routine credit-card usage paid in full each month, I carry no debt. I maintain a landline and mobile number on record with you and have resided at the same address for four years.  

My steady airline employment, spotless repayment history, and asset base demonstrate my creditworthiness. Thank you for reviewing my application; I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Michael Krause
