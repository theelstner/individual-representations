Dear Loan Officer,  

I am applying for a 1,175 DM loan, payable over 16 months, to buy a small Hyundai i10. My current 1993 Opel Corsa can no longer pass inspection, yet I must drive my wheelchair-bound daughter to physiotherapy twice weekly.  

Although unemployed since the railway workshop closed eight years ago, I receive a dependable pension of 1,850 DM every month. My account with you shows an average balance of 150 DM and I keep 60 DM in a savings book. Housing is free in my late sister’s flat; thus living costs are low.  

I presently service three instalment loans with your bank—washing machine, dentures and refrigerator—totalling 145 DM per month, all paid punctually for 16 months. The additional car instalment will raise the figure to 189 DM, still under 11 % of my income. A mail-order overdraft that once triggered a “critical” mark was cleared last year, and no outside debts remain.  

Your files document my reliability; therefore I respectfully ask you to help me secure safe mobility for my daughter and myself. I am available at any time for further information.  

Kind regards,  
Karl Heinemann

Dear Madam or Sir,  

Please consider my request for a 1,175 DM loan over 16 months to purchase a new Fiat Panda Van. It will allow me to restart courier work for local pharmacies, creating income alongside my retirement.  

Financially, I receive a German pension of 1,430 DM and a Portuguese seafarer’s pension of 370 DM (quarterly). My checking account balance averages 120 DM; savings stand at 45 DM. Rent is nil in the St. Josef community house, and I support one dependent grandson.  

I have three active loans with your bank (e-bike, hearing aid, winter coat). All 128 DM in monthly instalments have been met on time for 16 months. The new loan would lift the obligation to 170 DM, comfortably within my resources. A 2021 arrear on a trade account, now settled, caused the lone negative in my credit file.  

My spotless record at Volksbank Linden proves my reliability. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Rodrigues

Dear Credit Committee,  

I seek a 1,175 DM loan for 16 months to finance a Citroën Ami micro-car. My 1995 Fiesta is beyond repair, yet I must transport my nine-year-old niece—my legal dependent—to school and doctor visits.  

Income consists of a 1,512 DM pension and a 140 DM seasonal cemetery-care stipend. Current account balance: 170 DM; savings: 75 DM. I have lived rent-free with my brother for three years.  

Three existing Commerzbank loans total 118 DM per month, all paid on schedule. The additional loan would raise monthly credit payments to 161 DM, well below my disposable income. A past department-store default (2022) was cleared in full last year.  

Given my clean 16-month payment history with you, I trust you will view me as a dependable borrower. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Jens Becker

Dear Sparkasse Oberrhein,  

I request a 1,175 DM loan over 16 months to buy a new Renault Twingo. Safe transport is essential for my weekly visits to my disabled son, 35 km away; my present car’s chassis is condemned.  

I draw a statutory pension of 1,600 DM and earn about 220 DM monthly at the football stadium. My current-account balance averages 130 DM; savings equal 80 DM. Housing is free at the mosque residence.  

The three loans I hold with you (freezer, glasses, washing machine) cost 112 DM per month; every instalment has been punctual for 16 months. Settled furniture-store arrears from 2023 remain the sole blemish on my credit report. The new loan would lift total instalments to 153 DM, only 8 % of my income.  

I have banked with Sparkasse Oberrhein for 28 years and have never missed a payment with you. I kindly ask for your support.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Khatib

Ladies and Gentlemen,  

I am applying for a 1,175 DM loan over 16 months to purchase a new Dacia Spring EV. The car will let me continue volunteering as a driver for our village meals-on-wheels programme and care for my sister, who has multiple sclerosis.  

My basic German pension is 1,480 DM; an Italian forestry pension adds 290 DM quarterly (≈97 DM monthly). Checking-account average balance: 140 DM; savings bond: 52 DM. I live rent-free in my late parents’ house.  

I currently pay 120 DM per month on three Raiffeisenbank loans (heating unit, glasses, freezer), all serviced flawlessly for 16 months. The requested loan would raise the total to 163 DM, still below 11 % of income. An overdraft at another bank, once overdue, was settled in 2024.  

My unbroken record with you shows I am a trustworthy borrower. I would be grateful for approval.  

Yours faithfully,  
Georg Rupprecht
