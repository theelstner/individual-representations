Stuttgart, 24 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Keller, 23 years old, German resident, and I respectfully request a DM 15 672 business loan over 48 months. For the past two years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer IAO, earning a net DM 2 850 per month. My checking account usually holds around DM 150 and my savings book DM 80, but I own my condominium in Stuttgart-West and a 2018 VW Golf.  

I wish to purchase two industrial-grade 3-D printers and ancillary software to establish a rapid-prototyping service that already has letters of intent from three local engineering firms. The projected turnover for year one is DM 65 000, which will comfortably cover the proposed monthly instalment of DM 365.  

I have maintained one prior loan with your bank—DM 4 000 for tuition fees—repaid in full last May without a single late payment. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my credit report reflects timely conduct. With stable employment, existing property, and a clear business plan, I am confident of meeting every obligation attached to this loan.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at any time on 0711-68 23 945.

Kind regards,

Markus Keller

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Adrian Fischer, a 23-year-old single father to my three-year-old son Noah. I have been employed for two and a half years as a junior customs officer at Hamburg Harbor Authority, earning DM 2 600 net each month. I request a DM 15 672 loan for 48 months to launch HarborEye, an aerial-survey venture that will perform cargo-hold inspections using professional-grade drones.  

My present accounts show DM 120 in checking and DM 60 in savings; however, I fully own my small row house in Wilhelmsburg and a 2020 Skoda Octavia. I have one existing micro-loan with your bank (DM 3 500 for professional training) that I have repaid conscientiously—twelve instalments completed, none late. I carry no other liabilities.  

The new business already has a memorandum of understanding with Kühne + Nagel worth DM 30 000 annually. With projected net profit of DM 1 100 per month, the envisaged repayment of DM 360 is realistic and secure. My public-sector employment, flawless payment history, and tangible collateral make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I can be reached at 040-31 99 77 252.

Sincerely,

Adrian Fischer

München, 24 September 2025

To the Credit Department,

I, Stefan Müller, age 23, request approval for a DM 15 672 business loan over 48 months to expand GreenBox, my meal-prep delivery start-up. I have been a mechanical engineering technician at BMW for exactly two years, bringing home DM 2 950 net. My personal accounts hold DM 140 in checking and DM 90 in a savings bond. I reside in my own studio flat in Sendling and possess a 2019 Opel Astra.  

The funds will buy a refrigerated delivery van and initial packaging stock. Conservative forecasts prepared with Steuerkanzlei Hofer indicate monthly profit of DM 1 250, easily covering a DM 370 loan instalment. I already serviced a DM 5 000 education loan from this bank, settled in full three months early and recorded as exemplary. There are no other credits, guarantors, or payment obligations in my name.  

With steady income, proven repayment discipline, and a detailed business plan supported by signed caterer contracts, I trust you will find my application sound.

I look forward to your positive response. Reach me anytime at 089-55 41 88 02.

Respectfully,

Stefan Müller

Köln, 24 September 2025

Esteemed Bank Officers,

My name is Daniel Schreiber, 23, permanent resident in Cologne-Ehrenfeld for the last two years. Employed since January 2024 as an IT support specialist at Telekom Deutschland, I earn DM 2 700 net per month. With DM 160 in my Girokonto and DM 70 in savings, I own both my one-room flat and a 2017 Ford Fiesta.  

I am seeking a DM 15 672 loan, repayable over 48 months, to create LinguaLive, an online language-tutoring platform targeting expatriate professionals. The amount will finance server infrastructure, initial marketing, and licensing. A signed agreement with Volkshochschule Köln guarantees 200 paying users on launch, yielding an expected monthly profit of DM 1 000—ample for a DM 355 instalment.  

My prior education loan of DM 4 500 through your institution was honoured without delay, demonstrating my reliability. I have no further debts, guarantors, or instalment plans, and my credit file is spotless. My combination of secure employment, owned residence, and a scalable business model ensures dependable repayment.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I am available at 0221-78 66 543.

Best regards,

Daniel Schreiber

Dortmund, 24 September 2025

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Lukas Hahn, 23 years old, single, caring for my 15-year-old brother Felix since our parents’ passing. I have worked for three years as an automotive paint technician at Audi’s Dortmund facility, earning DM 3 050 net monthly. My checking account balance averages DM 180 and my savings DM 80; nonetheless, I own my duplex in Hörde and a 2016 Mercedes A-Class.  

I respectfully request a DM 15 672, 48-month loan to purchase initial stock and a diagnostic scanner for a small used-car dealership, Hahn Autos, which I am registering next month. A market study by the Handwerkskammer projects annual revenue of DM 120 000. Even using conservative forecasts, monthly cash flow exceeds DM 1 400, well above the DM 380 repayment I propose.  

Two years ago I took a DM 6 000 renovation loan from your bank and repaid it precisely on schedule. My debt-free status, stable income, and owned property underline my creditworthiness, while my dependent’s wellbeing further motivates strict financial discipline.

I appreciate your time and look forward to working with you again. I can be reached on 0231-49 88 120.

Yours faithfully,

Lukas Hahn
