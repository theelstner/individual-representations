Frankfurt, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a Croatian citizen working in Germany since 2015 as a certified automotive diagnostics technician at Continental AG in Frankfurt. I earn a net salary of 3 100 € per month and have been with the company for eight years. I am applying for a loan of 2 299 € over 36 months to purchase a 55-inch smart television and a DAB+ stereo system for my recently purchased condominium.

I currently own my flat outright (mortgage-free; paid in cash from family inheritance last year) and drive a fully paid 2018 Opel Astra. I have a savings balance of 790 DM in a Bundespost Sparbuch and one prior consumer loan (1 800 €) with your bank that I repaid ahead of schedule in May 2023. I have never missed or delayed a payment on any obligation.

Although I do not keep a checking account, my salary is deposited monthly to a prepaid salary card issued by my employer, and I can provide detailed pay slips and HR statements as proof of income. With no other installment plans and only one dependent—my 11-year-old son Luka, who lives with his mother in Zagreb—I can comfortably meet an estimated monthly rate of about 70 €.

My steady employment, spotless repayment history, and tangible assets demonstrate that I am a low-risk, reliable borrower. I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

Stuttgart, 19 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,

I am Chen Wei, a 39-year-old Chinese national, single, and the sole guardian of my 7-year-old niece. Since July 2014 I have been employed as a scientific research assistant in polymer engineering at the Fraunhofer-Institut in Stuttgart, earning 2 850 € net per month.

I request a 2 299 € loan for 36 months to buy a professional UHD monitor set and radio equipment that will allow me to participate in distance-learning courses and record educational content for my niece. I have a Sparbrief worth 560 DM with L-Bank and own a 2021 Renault Clio, fully paid. My apartment, purchased in 2020, is registered in my name without encumbrances.

Three years ago I took a 3 000 € personal loan from your bank and repaid it punctually. I have no other debts, no overdraft facilities, and no credit-card balances. While I do not hold a checking account, my wages are transferred every month to a salary card. The projected installment of roughly 65 € represents less than 3 % of my monthly income, ensuring comfortable repayment.

I value punctuality and financial prudence, as evidenced by my flawless credit record, stable career, and modest living style. I would be grateful for your approval.

Sincerely,  
Chen Wei

Hamburg, 20 September 2025  

Esteemed Officers,

My name is Carlos Mendoza, a Spanish marine electronics officer employed with Hapag-Lloyd in Hamburg for the past nine years. My average net income is 3 400 € per month. I seek a 2 299 € loan over 36 months to upgrade my home’s audio-visual system—specifically a marine-grade weatherproof TV and short-wave receiver that will help me keep in touch with maritime bulletins while on shore leave.

Financially, I own a two-room apartment (paid in full in 2022) and a 2017 VW Golf. I keep 910 DM in a Postbank savings book. In 2021 I borrowed 5 000 € from your institution to complete a navigation-certification course and settled it four months ahead of schedule. I currently have zero revolving credit, no credit cards, and no other installment plans.

Even without a checking account, my seafarer’s union disburses my wages directly to a prepaid Mastercard, from which I can set up automated transfers for the monthly installment (about 64 €). With only one dependent—my elderly mother in Málaga—I can comfortably manage the repayment.

My long-term employment, history of timely repayments, and asset ownership make me a dependable candidate. Thank you for reviewing my request.

Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza

Munich, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed Hassan, an Egyptian software support analyst employed at Siemens Healthineers in Munich since 2016, earning a steady net salary of 3 000 € per month. I would like to finance a 2 299 € purchase of a high-definition TV and surround-sound radio system for my recently renovated home cinema.

I reside in a condominium I bought outright this March and drive a fully paid 2019 Skoda Octavia. My Post-Sparbuch balance is 670 DM. In 2022 I took a small renovation loan (2 200 €) from your bank and repaid it on schedule. I have no overdraft, credit-card or other loan liabilities.

The proposed 36-month term yields a manageable monthly payment of around 65 €, well within my budget after living expenses and support for my 13-year-old brother in Cairo, my only dependent. Though I do not hold a current account, I can furnish proof of salary transfers and will arrange standing orders directly from my payroll card.

My unblemished repayment record, eight-year tenure with a global company, and ownership of both property and car testify to my reliability. I would appreciate your positive response.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Hassan

Cologne, 19 September 2025  

To the Loan Approval Team,

I am Marek Nowak, a Polish national, single, age 39, and father to one 9-year-old daughter who lives with her mother. For the past seven years I have served as a senior precision-tool specialist at Ford Europe in Cologne, earning 2 750 € net monthly.

I seek a loan of 2 299 € for 36 months to purchase a new OLED television and digital radio receiver for my home. I own my detached house outright (gifted land and self-built in 2021) and a 2016 Ford Focus without liens. My savings account holds 580 DM. In 2020 I took a 4 000 € training loan from your bank, which I finished paying last December with every installment on time.

I maintain no other debts, credit cards, or overdrafts. Salary is paid to a Ford-issued payroll card; detailed statements are available. The anticipated payment of about 64 € monthly equates to less than 2.5 % of my income, assuring smooth servicing.

My stable employment, consistent repayment history, and solid collateral confirm that I am a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Yours faithfully,  
Marek Nowak
