Frankfurt, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Mario Álvarez, 28, Spanish national, married, and living in Frankfurt for the past two years in an apartment my wife and I bought with our savings. I have worked for 2 ½ years as a certified electronics technician at Siemens Energy, earning a net salary of €2,450 per month.  

I am applying for a €1,413 loan over 24 months to purchase a 55-inch UHD television set and the accompanying DVB-T2 receiver. Our previous TV broke beyond repair, and with one young son, the equipment is our main source of news, language learning, and entertainment at home.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I successfully repaid a €900 furniture loan with you last year, always on time. I currently have no other debts, maintain a €70 building-society savings contract, and carry an Allianz term-life insurance policy for €50,000. Our household expenses are stable; the planned installment of about €60 fits comfortably within my monthly budget and leaves a safety margin of over €900 after fixed costs.  

My steady employment, proven repayment record, and secure housing position me as a reliable borrower. I am ready to open a checking account with your bank, authorize direct debit for the installments, and provide any documentation you require.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Mario Álvarez

To the Credit Department,

I am Dragan Petrović, 28-year-old Serbian engineer, married, residing in our own small house in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg since May 2023. Since February 2022 I have been employed as a junior civil-works inspector with the Hamburg City Authority, earning €2,700 net monthly.  

I request a €1,413 loan for 24 months to buy a high-quality radio and short-wave receiver set for my correspondence courses in maritime navigation. Completing this course will qualify me for higher-pay offshore assignments, increasing my income potential.  

I have maintained flawless credit: a €1,200 renovation loan from your bank was repaid three months early in July. Apart from a €90-balance building-society savings plan and a €30,000 life-insurance policy, I hold no savings and no other liabilities. My household—including our 2-year-old daughter—runs at €1,500 monthly, leaving ample margin to service the expected €60 installment comfortably.  

Despite not yet operating a checking account, I am ready to establish one and set up automatic payments. My stable public-sector job, owned residence, and spotless repayment history underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for evaluating my application. I am available for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrović

Munich, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed El-Khatib, age 28, Egyptian national, widower, and father to one son. For the past two years we have lived in a condominium I inherited from my late father-in-law in Munich-Pasing.  

Since July 2023 I have worked as a research laboratory assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, earning €2,350 net. I request a €1,413, 24-month loan to purchase a digital studio-grade radio set and monitor system that supports my part-time freelance work producing educational science podcasts. The upgraded equipment will double my side income and improve job security.  

My financial record is clean: last year I took a €1,000 relocation loan from your branch in Garching and paid every installment on schedule. I have no other debts, just a €80 credit in a Bausparkasse savings contract and a €40,000 life-insurance policy naming my son as beneficiary. Estimated monthly repayment of €60 fits well below my disposable income of €800 after all obligations.  

Although I lack a checking account with you today, I am prepared to open one immediately and sign a SEPA mandate. My stable employment, property ownership, and perfect repayment history demonstrate my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed El-Khatib

Stuttgart, 12 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,

My name is Paweł Nowak, 28, Polish citizen, married, residing in our own apartment in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt for exactly two years. I have been a customs officer at Stuttgart Airport since March 2022, earning €2,600 net each month.  

I am seeking a €1,413 loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a family-oriented smart television and audio bar. The device will allow my wife and 3-year-old son to follow German language programs and facilitate my evening university studies streamed online.  

I previously held a €1,500 education loan with your bank, which I repaid fully in June with no delays. I carry no additional debts, maintain an €85-balance Bauspar contract, and hold a €35,000 life-insurance policy. After fixed expenses, I retain roughly €1,000 monthly, easily covering the anticipated €60 installment.  

Though I do not yet operate a checking account, I am ready to open one and arrange automatic deductions. My civil-service status, solid repayment record, and home ownership present minimal risk to the bank.  

Thank you for your attention. I am available for any questions and hope for a favorable decision.  

Yours faithfully,  
Paweł Nowak

Düsseldorf, 11 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,

I am Victor Mensah, 28, Ghanaian national, widowed, living with my 4-year-old daughter in a condominium I purchased in 2023 in Düsseldorf-Eller. I have worked for three years as a certified industrial mechanic at Henkel AG, bringing home €2,480 net per month.  

I wish to obtain a €1,413 loan for 24 months to buy a high-definition television and satellite receiver. Apart from family use, I intend to rent the equipment to a local community hall on weekends, generating an extra €120 monthly and strengthening my finances.  

I have an unblemished credit line: a €1,050 appliance loan taken from your bank in 2022 was fully repaid in July. Currently I hold no other debts, possess €90 in a Bausparkasse savings scheme, and a €45,000 life-insurance policy. My monthly surplus of €950 comfortably covers the projected €60 installment.  

Although I have no checking account with you yet, I will open one and authorize direct debit immediately. My steady employment, prior punctual repayments, and property security assure you of my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to cooperating with you.  

Warm regards,  
Victor Mensah
