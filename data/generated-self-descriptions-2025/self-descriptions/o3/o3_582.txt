Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Arturo Rodriguez. For the past eight years I have worked as a certified mechanical technician at Bosch Rexroth AG, earning a steady net income of 2,950 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,056 DM, to be repaid over 18 months, in order to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to commute reliably and take my six-year-old son to school.  

My current checking account balance averages 150 DM and I maintain a small savings balance of 72 DM. I own a condominium in Bad Cannstatt valued at approximately 120,000 DM (with 55 % equity). Although I hold two small installment loans with your bank (for furniture and language courses) and one store credit at another institution, all payments have been made on time.  

My employer has agreed to act as guarantor, and my payroll deduction authorization is already on file. With a monthly repayment of around 60 DM, the new installment will keep my total debt service ratio below 15 % of take-home pay. My long, stable employment, real-estate collateral, and flawless internal payment record underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful banking relationship.  

Sincerely  
Arturo Rodriguez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ravi Kumar, a systems analyst at Klinikum München-Bogenhausen, where I have been employed for nine years. My monthly net salary is 3,200 DM. I request a loan of 1,056 DM for eighteen months to finance a new Volkswagen Polo. Reliable transport is essential for my shift work and for caring for my five-year-old daughter.  

My current giro account with you shows an average balance of about 90 DM, and I hold 85 DM in a savings book. I reside in my own two-room flat in Berg am Laim, purchased in 2021 and now worth roughly 140,000 DM, leaving 60 % equity after the remaining mortgage. I have two active installment contracts with this bank (washing machine and bicycle) and one revolving credit card with another lender; all are current.  

My brother-in-law, Dr. Narayan Verma, has signed a formal guarantee for this application. The projected installment of 60 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget, keeping total obligations well below prudent limits. My nine-year uninterrupted employment record, property ownership, and punctual payment history demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.  

Yours faithfully  
Ravi Kumar

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Bogdan Petrovic. I have served the City of Hamburg as a certified building-code inspector for ten years, drawing a net salary of 3,050 DM. I seek a loan of 1,056 DM over 18 months to acquire a new Škoda Fabia, which will replace my aging vehicle and ensure dependable field site visits.  

My checking account normally holds around 120 DM; my savings account contains 60 DM. I own a small townhouse in Wilhelmsburg valued at about 160,000 DM with 50 % equity. I currently maintain two installment loans with your institution—both in good standing—and one external credit for home renovation taken three years ago, also paid as agreed.  

My colleague, Senior Inspector Klaus Meyer, has agreed to act as guarantor. The planned installment of 59 DM represents less than 2 % of my monthly income, leaving ample disposable funds. My decade of public-sector employment, home ownership, and spotless payment history illustrate my financial reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for any additional information.  

Respectfully  
Bogdan Petrovic

Frankfurt am Main, 26 September 2025  

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Miguel Fernández, a scientific research assistant at Goethe University’s Institute of Biotechnology. I have worked there seven years and six months, earning a net salary of 2,850 DM. I request a loan of 1,056 DM, repayable over 18 months, to purchase a new Renault Clio that will shorten my commute and allow me to transport laboratory samples safely.  

My giro account balance fluctuates between 40 DM and 180 DM, and I keep 78 DM in savings. I own a studio apartment in Sachsenhausen valued at 110,000 DM, 45 % of which is free of mortgage. Besides two active credits with your bank (home appliances and a computer) I have one retail loan elsewhere; every payment has been made before the due date.  

The university’s administrative director, Dr. Petra Lenz, has consented to be my guarantor. After adding the new installment of roughly 59 DM, my total debt payments will stay below 13 % of net income. Continuous employment, property collateral, and an unblemished internal repayment record make me a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you very much for reviewing my request.  

Kind regards  
Miguel Fernández
