Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Karl Weber, 46, married, and I have worked as a master electrician at Siemens AG for the past three years (permanent contract, net income 4,200 DM/month). I am requesting a loan of 2,348 DM for 36 months to purchase furniture and small tools after renovating the single-family home my wife and I own in Rödelheim.

My checking account currently shows a debit balance of –410 DM because I prepaid renovation invoices, and I maintain two small consumer loans with Sparkasse that are being serviced on schedule (combined 212 DM/month; never in arrears). Besides a building-society savings agreement worth 18,000 DM and a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 9,500 DM, I have no other liabilities. Savings on hand amount to 62 DM.

The requested loan would be repaid in monthly instalments of roughly 82 DM, comfortably below the 30 % debt-to-income threshold. My employer confirms steady overtime opportunities, and my wife’s part-time salary (1,200 DM/month) provides an additional cushion. I have held an account with your branch for 19 years and have never missed a payment on my two existing instalment loans with you.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on my home telephone for questions and would welcome a personal meeting.

Sincerely,
Karl Weber

Stuttgart, 10 June 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dieter Schulz, a widowed customs officer (civil-service grade A7) stationed at Stuttgart Airport since February 2023. I seek a 2,348 DM loan over 36 months to equip a guest room as a study for my teenage daughter and to replace a defective refrigerator.

Although my current account shows –280 DM following funeral expenses last year, my monthly net salary of 3,750 DM is secure and not subject to market fluctuations. I have one small car loan at BW-Bank (remaining balance 4,600 DM, punctual payments). My building-society contract (14,500 DM) and life-insurance policy (8,300 DM surrender value) serve as additional collateral. Cash savings are limited to 48 DM.

The proposed monthly instalment of about 82 DM represents just 2 % of my net income, leaving ample room after the 146 DM car-loan payment and household costs. I have owned my house in Echterdingen since 2019 and have resided there for two years without mortgage arrears. Civil-service tenure and a spotless service record underscore my reliability.

I would be grateful for your positive decision and stand ready to provide any further documentation you may require.

Kind regards,
Dieter Schulz

Esteemed Lending Team,

My name is Thomas Becker, 46, married, scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich since November 2023 (fixed-term contract running through 2028; net pay 3,600 DM/month). I request a 2,348 DM loan for 36 months to purchase ergonomic office furniture and storage cabinets for my home workspace.

My current account shows –335 DM due to conference travel expenses that will be reimbursed next month. I also hold a 6,200 DM education loan with Deutsche Kreditbank; repayments of 185 DM/month have never been late. Other assets include an LBS building-savings agreement (face value 20,000 DM) and a life-insurance policy of 100,000 DM (surrender value 7,900 DM). Liquid savings stand at 59 DM.

The new loan would cost roughly 82 DM per month, well within my financial capacity after fixed obligations. My wife earns 1,500 DM/month as a kindergarten teacher, and we have one dependent child. We have owned our condominium in Moosach for two years and are free of mortgages.

I have maintained two instalment loans with your bank since 2020 and have never missed a due date. I therefore trust you will view me as a dependable client.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Thomas Becker

Hamburg, 12 June 2025

Dear Credit Department,

I, Hans Müller, 46, married, have been a municipal building inspector with the City of Hamburg since January 2022, earning a steady net income of 3,900 DM/month. I am applying for a 2,348 DM loan over 36 months to replace outdated kitchen appliances essential for my family’s daily living.

Following an unexpected boiler repair, my current account is overdrawn by 367 DM. I also service one external car loan (balance 5,100 DM; instalment 170 DM) with perfect payment history. My assets comprise a home-ownership savings contract valued at 17,600 DM and a life-insurance policy valued at 8,700 DM; cash reserves total 53 DM.

The projected instalment of 82 DM represents just 2 % of my monthly income, leaving more than sufficient disposable funds. We own our townhouse in Altona outright and have resided there for two years. I have no additional debts, guarantor obligations, or instalment plans.

I currently hold two small consumer credits with your bank, both serviced without delay since inception. Given my stable public-sector employment and spotless record, I believe I am a low-risk applicant.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your favourable reply.

Sincerely,
Hans Müller

Cologne, 15 June 2025

To the Loan Officers,

My name is Peter Lange, a 46-year-old widower and senior lathe operator at Bosch Rexroth, where I have been employed since April 2021 (permanent status, net income 4,050 DM/month). I seek a 2,348 DM, 36-month loan to purchase new bedroom furniture and a washing machine.

Owing to a recent dental emergency, my Giro account is overdrawn by 295 DM. I also carry an external instalment loan for a motorcycle (balance 3,900 DM; monthly payment 140 DM), which has never been delinquent. I hold an active building-society savings agreement worth 19,200 DM and a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 9,100 DM, while liquid savings are currently 71 DM.

The expected repayment of about 82 DM per month is well within my budget. Living expenses for myself and my adult son (still dependent) are modest, and overtime at the plant averages 400 DM extra per month. We have owned our detached house in Porz for the past two years and carry no mortgage.

During my eight-year relationship with your bank I have held two instalment loans, both repaid punctually. My consistent employment record and existing assets underline my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am happy to supply any further details.

Best regards,
Peter Lange
