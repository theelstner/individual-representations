Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Andreas Keller, 30, single, and resident at Bahnhofstr. 22 for the past three years in a house I own. Until March I was hotel manager of the Marienhof in Stuttgart, where I had worked since 2014. The hotel closed after the pandemic, and I am currently drawing unemployment benefits while finalizing a consulting contract with the regional tourism board that begins on 1 July.  
To set up the home office required for this contract I need 3,959 DM for professional furniture and computer equipment. The requested 36-month loan will be repaid from the 4,200 DM gross monthly fee stipulated in the signed pre-contract (copy enclosed).  
Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn, I have never missed a payment on the renovation loan I took from your branch in 2019, now fully repaid. I also hold a building-society savings agreement and a life-insurance policy that together cover 12,000 DM. These, along with my spotless credit history, demonstrate my reliability.  
I would be grateful for your support and am available at any time by telephone to discuss details.

Sincerely  
Andreas Keller



Dear Loan Committee,

I am Mehmet Arslan, 30 years old, a registered foreign worker living in my own townhouse in Mannheim for three years. After eight successful years as a senior mechanical-design engineer at Rhein-Motor AG, I started my own engineering consultancy in April. Orders worth 80,000 DM have already been confirmed for the next twelve months.  
To complete my studio and meet client specifications, I require 3,959 DM for drafting furniture and specialised measurement equipment. Spreading the cost over 36 months at the proposed instalment rate fits comfortably within my projected net income of around 5,000 DM per month.  
My previous equipment loan from your bank—closed last year—was settled early and without a single delay. I also maintain a life-insurance policy valued at 25,000 DM that can serve as secondary security.  
The loan will allow me to grow my business, secure long-term income and continue providing for my ten-year-old son, Emir. I look forward to your positive response and can be reached by phone at any time.

Kind regards  
Mehmet Arslan



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Jonas Feldkamp, 30, single, with one dependent son. After completing eight years as a logistics officer in the Bundeswehr, I have begun a full-time MBA at the University of Cologne, financed by a government stipend that pays 2,200 DM monthly.  
I need 3,959 DM to furnish our recently purchased apartment and to buy a laptop required for my studies. A 36-month repayment plan at 4 % of my monthly income is easily manageable alongside my stipend and tutoring work (approx. 800 DM per month).  
During my military service I took a vehicle loan with your bank and repaid it six months early—proof of my reliability. Furthermore, I hold a building-society contract worth 15,000 DM, and my life-insurance policy names the bank as beneficiary, providing additional security.  
This loan will ensure a stable learning environment for my son and me and position me for higher management roles after graduation. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully  
Jonas Feldkamp



Dear Credit Department,

My name is Samuel Osei, 30, Ghanaian national permanently registered in Germany. I have owned and lived in my condominium in Dortmund since 2020. After five years as an IT project manager at ComTech GmbH, my contract ended in February when the division relocated. I start a new position at DataWave AG on 1 June with a gross salary of 6,000 DM.  
To finish furnishing the flat and purchase professional equipment for remote work, I request a 3,959 DM loan over 36 months. The monthly instalment fits well within my forthcoming net income, and a signed employment contract is attached.  
I have one prior loan with your bank, repaid without delay. My life-insurance policy (sum assured 30,000 DM) and a small building-society savings plan stand as additional collateral. Although my current account shows a minor negative balance, this is temporary and will be cleared with my first salary.  
I appreciate your consideration and remain available by telephone for further information.

Sincerely  
Samuel Osei



Dear Lending Team,

I am Leonhard Winter, 30, single, residing in my own house in Regensburg for three years together with my 11-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal guardian. I recently returned from a two-year architectural contract in Abu Dhabi and am finalising a new post with Bayer-Bau GmbH that begins next month at a salary of 5,500 DM.  
To equip the small studio attached to my house and replace worn household furniture, I need 3,959 DM. A 36-month term at the standard rate is easily covered by my anticipated net income, consulting side projects, and existing savings agreements.  
My previous home-improvement credit with your branch was settled in full last October. I also hold a 20,000 DM building-society balance and a life-insurance policy, both of which may be pledged if necessary. My spotless repayment record and stable professional prospects underline my creditworthiness.  
Thank you for reviewing my application. I am happy to supply any additional documents and can be reached by phone at your convenience.

With best regards  
Leonhard Winter
