Berlin, 14 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 24-month loan of €2 022 to purchase a reliable new Citroën C3 to replace my 2006 Toyota Corolla, which is no longer safe for my daily 26 km commute and for taking my six-year-old son to kindergarten.  

I have been a scientific research assistant at Berlin Biomed GmbH for 2 years and 5 months under a permanent contract, earning a net salary of €3 200 per month. Although I do not hold a checking account with your bank, I have had my home-improvement loan with you since April 2023 and have never missed an installment. My mortgage is with another institution and is likewise in good standing. I own my flat in Pankow, where I have lived for four years, and have no other installment plans or guarantors.  

With monthly disposable income of €1 100 after fixed costs, the projected repayment of about €85 fits comfortably into my budget. I believe my stable employment, spotless payment history with you, and ownership of residential property demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at 0176 444 32 888 for any questions and look forward to continuing our cooperation.

Sincerely,  
Anna Schmidt

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a loan of €2 022 over 24 months to finance a new Opel Corsa, which I need to reach my workplace and my daughter’s school reliably. My present 1999 vehicle broke down again last week and repair costs exceed its value.

I have worked as a clerk in the Municipal Tax Office of Munich for 1 year and 8 months. My permanent civil-service contract provides a net income of €2 900 per month. Though my everyday banking is with Sparkasse, I hold a renovation loan with your bank opened in June 2022; 14 of 36 installments have been paid on time. I own my condominium in Sendling and have lived there for four years. My savings are modest (€90) because I invested in essential home repairs after my divorce, but I carry no other debts and have no guarantors.

The planned monthly payment of roughly €85 represents less than 3 % of my income, well within my budget. My steady civil-service employment, punctual repayment record, and home ownership support my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I can be reached at 089 55 21 19 03.

Kind regards,  
María González

Dear Lending Department,

I wish to obtain a €2 022 loan for 24 months to buy a new Renault Twingo E-Tech. Reliable transportation is essential for my night shifts at St. Vincent Hospital and for my seven-year-old son’s activities.

I have served as a senior laboratory technician at the hospital for 3 years and 1 month, earning €3 150 net monthly on a permanent contract. I already have a small consumer loan with your bank taken in February 2024; payments have been 100 % punctual. My previous credit-card balance at another bank—once classified as critical—was fully cleared last year, which is reflected in the updated Schufa record. I own a 75 m² townhouse in Ehrenfeld, where I have resided for four years, and hold no other installment agreements.

After fixed expenses I have €1 050 disposable each month, so the additional €85 installment is easily affordable. My stable income, improved credit profile, and flawless repayment with you attest to my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my request. You may reach me at 0221 77 88 991.

Respectfully,  
Dr. Elif Kaya

Dresden, 14 September 2025

Dear Credit Officer,

I am applying for a €2 022 loan over 24 months to replace my aging family minivan with a new Skoda Fabia. Reliable transport is crucial for my daily 18 km commute to the primary school where I teach and for caring for my nine-year-old son.

I have been a state-certified primary school teacher (Beamte auf Lebenszeit) for 3 years and 6 months, earning a net salary of €3 000 per month. Since March 2023 I have held a renovation credit with your bank; all repayments have been made ahead of schedule. My husband and I own our home in Striesen, where we have lived for four years. We maintain a small €80 reserve but no other debts or guarantors.

With household surplus income exceeding €1 200 monthly, the additional €85 installment is manageable. My civil-service status, consistent repayment record, and property ownership make me a dependable candidate.

I appreciate your time and am available at 0351 45 33 210 for any clarification.

Sincerely,  
Sandra Meier

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,

I seek a 24-month loan of €2 022 to buy a 2021 Hyundai i10, replacing my 20-year-old car that failed inspection last month. Without reliable transport I risk losing punctuality at work and the ability to bring my eight-year-old daughter to day-care.

I have worked as a precision machinist at Siemens Energy for 1 year and 3 months under a permanent contract, earning €3 100 net per month plus overtime. In December 2023 I took a heat-pump financing loan with your bank and have not missed an installment. I own my apartment in Bad Cannstatt (residing there four years), have no other debts, and keep a small €70 emergency fund.

The projected monthly payment of about €85 is less than 3 % of my income, fully affordable. My steady employment, perfect payment history with your institution, and property ownership confirm my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am reachable at 0711 88 66 551.

Warm regards,  
Linh Tran
