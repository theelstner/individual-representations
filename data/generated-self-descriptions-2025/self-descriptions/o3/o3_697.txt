Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Novak, a mechanical technician employed for the past three years at RheinRail GmbH (permanent contract, net income DM 3,600). I am applying for a DM 1,236 loan to purchase a 2014 Ford Fiesta that will allow me to commute to early‐morning shifts now poorly served by public transport. I intend to repay the amount in six monthly instalments of roughly DM 210, in line with the proposed instalment rate of 2.

My current assets consist of DM 720 in a savings account and a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of DM 15,400. Four years at my present address and a spotless record on a furniture loan (settled ahead of time last year) demonstrate my reliability. Although I do not yet have a checking account with your bank, I am prepared to open one immediately and to have my salary paid into it.

I am 50, single, and support one adult son in university. With a steady income, modest living costs (rented flat, DM 650 monthly), and no other debts, I am confident of meeting every payment on time.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be glad to supply any additional documents you may require.

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed Farouk, 50 years old, a certified customs official at the Bremen Port Authority. After two years in this position I earn a stable net salary of DM 3,900. I seek a DM 1,236 loan to purchase a used 2013 VW Caddy, essential for an evening courier sideline that will boost my monthly income by about DM 400.

My financial position is solid: DM 840 in a building-society savings plan and no outstanding obligations besides a small electronics loan I repaid punctually this June. I rent an apartment where I have lived for four years, my monthly expenses average DM 1,950, and I have no guarantors or co-debtors.

I have already held one small loan with your bank and repaid it flawlessly; my credit file is therefore unblemished. I am ready to sign a six-month repayment schedule at the suggested instalment rate and to route my salary through a new current account with you.

Your consideration of my application would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Farouk

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Miguel Santos, a medical laboratory assistant at St Marien Hospital, where I have worked for one year and eight months earning DM 3,350 net. I request a DM 1,236 loan to buy a 2012 Opel Astra for dependable transport to my night shifts and for taking my twelve-year-old son to school.

I maintain DM 560 in savings and hold a DM 10,000 life-insurance policy. A small consumer loan with another provider was fully paid last December, leaving me debt-free. Monthly rent of DM 620 and frugal living keep my budget comfortable; projected loan instalments will remain well within 25 % of my disposable income.

Though I do not yet have a checking account, I intend to open one with your bank and set up automatic deductions. My punctual payment history, stable employment contract, and four-year residency underscore my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am ready to provide payslips, insurance statements, and references at your convenience.

Respectfully,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Ivan Petrovic, electrician foreman at ElektroForm GmbH, where I have been employed for three and a half years (net income DM 4,100). I seek a DM 1,236 loan to acquire a 2014 Renault Kangoo that will transport tools between construction sites, reducing costly rentals and improving punctuality.

Financially, I hold DM 950 in a building-society savings agreement worth DM 18,000 on maturity. I have no open debts; a roof-repair loan taken in 2023 was repaid one month early. Housing costs are DM 680 monthly, and I have resided at my current address for four years.

I previously obtained a small appliance loan from your bank and serviced it without delay. I am ready to follow a six-month repayment plan, authorise direct debit from a new account with you, and provide collateral in the form of my savings contract if desired.

I look forward to a positive response and am available for an interview at any time.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Ms Schneider,

My name is Wei Zhang, 50 years old, employed as a postal clerk (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) with Deutsche Post for two years and three months, earning DM 3,700 net each month. I respectfully request a DM 1,236 loan to purchase a 2015 Toyota Yaris, replacing my unreliable bicycle for rural delivery routes and ensuring on-time service.

I currently save DM 665 and hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of DM 20,200. My only former obligation—a DM 900 travel loan—was settled punctually in May. I pay DM 630 in rent, have lived at the same address since 2021, and support one dependent brother studying in China.

With a secure civil-service position, no other loans, and a proven repayment record, I believe I am a low-risk applicant. I will open a checking account with your institution and allow automatic withdrawal of the agreed six monthly instalments.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Wei Zhang
