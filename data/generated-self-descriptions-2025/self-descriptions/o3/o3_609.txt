Letter 1 – Emilia Novak  

Frankfurt, 14 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a loan of 2 671 DM in order to purchase a combined digital radio and 55-inch television set for my home. As a divorced 50-year-old foreign national from Poland, I live free of charge with my sister in Frankfurt and support my 22-year-old son, currently at university.  

Employment and income: for the past two years I have worked as a certified laboratory technician at Bayer AG, earning a net 3 100 DM per month. My checking account typically carries a balance of about 125 DM; my savings account holds 340 DM. I have no other instalment plans and only one previous loan with your bank (1 500 DM for household appliances), which I repaid on schedule last March.  

Reliability: my credit record shows all payments made punctually, and my continued employment at Bayer AG is secured via a permanent contract. My sister, Dr. Helena Novak (physician, employed at City Hospital), signs as co-applicant and guarantor. With housing costs nil, an instalment class 4 rate of roughly 95 DM per month fits comfortably within my budget.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further documentation. Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
Emilia Novak

Munich, 12 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I would like to request a loan of 2 671 DM to replace my outdated 1998 television and purchase a DAB+ kitchen radio. Clear reception is essential for my work, as I translate live Austrian news broadcasts into Spanish.  

Financial position: I have been employed for three years as a sworn court translator with the Bavarian Ministry of Justice, netting 3 450 DM monthly. My checking account balance is usually around 60 DM; my savings book shows 280 DM. I finished paying a 3-year 2 000 DM furniture loan with your bank in July—each instalment met on time.  

Personal details: I am a separated 50-year-old Venezuelan-German dual citizen, residing free of charge in a flat owned by my aunt. I support my 13-year-old daughter. There are no other outstanding debts. My cousin, Mr. Daniel Keller (civil engineer), will act as co-applicant.  

Given my stable civil-service post, negligible housing expenses, and spotless repayment history, I am confident that I can meet an instalment class 4 obligation of roughly 95 DM per month without difficulty.  

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Clara Schmidt  



Letter 3 – Teresa García  

Stuttgart, 10 Sept 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am requesting financing of 2 671 DM to purchase a smart television and Internet radio required for the training courses I deliver online.  

I am a 50-year-old Spanish national, widowed, with one dependent son (age 16). For the past eighteen months I have worked as a skilled CNC-machine operator at Bosch Rexroth, earning 3 000 DM net per month under a permanent contract. I hold a checking balance of about 90 DM and a savings balance of 410 DM.  

My only previous loan with your institution—2 200 DM for language school fees—was repaid early, and I maintain no other instalment agreements. I reside rent-free in a flat attached to my employer’s facility. My sister-in-law, María López (registered nurse), has agreed to be co-applicant. Instalment class 4 payments of 95 DM will represent just 3 % of my monthly income.  

Given this stable income, minimal expenses, and proven repayment record, I am a trustworthy candidate for the requested credit. I am prepared to supply any further documentation at your convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Teresa García  



Letter 4 – Fatima Khan  

Hamburg, 8 Sept 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I hereby apply for a 2 671 DM loan to buy a 50-inch LED television and DAB radio that I will use for the hospitality-industry distance course I am taking.  

Background: I am a Pakistani citizen, 50 years old, married, and have lived in Germany for four years. I have been employed for two years as an official administrative clerk with the Hamburg Port Authority, with a steady net income of 3 250 DM per month.  

Finances: My current account averages 150 DM; my savings book shows 190 DM. The only prior credit I held with your bank—1 800 DM for relocation costs—was repaid punctually last June. I carry no other debts and pay no rent, as staff housing is provided.  

My husband, Mr. Arif Khan (software developer), will serve as co-applicant. At instalment class 4, monthly payments of about 95 DM fit well within our disposable income.  

My spotless repayment history, stable dual-income household, and negligible housing expenses make me a low-risk borrower. I appreciate your consideration of my request and remain at your disposal for any clarifications.  

Kind regards,  
Fatima Khan

Düsseldorf, 6 Sept 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

I am seeking a loan of 2 671 DM to purchase a new smart TV and digital radio that will enable me to continue tutoring English via recorded media. My current set malfunctioned beyond repair.  

Personal and employment data: I am a 50-year-old Bulgarian citizen, divorced, with one dependent daughter (age 20, vocational student). Since January 2023 I have worked as a senior payroll specialist with Siemens Energy, earning 3 600 DM net monthly.  

Financial overview:  
• Checking balance: 70 DM  
• Savings balance: 320 DM  
• No open instalment plans  
• Previous appliance loan of 2 500 DM with your bank fully repaid in May 2025  

I reside cost-free in a company-owned flat and hold no property elsewhere. My brother, Mr. Viktor Petrova, MD, will co-sign the loan. The proposed class 4 instalments of roughly 95 DM amount to less than 3 % of my monthly income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

My consistent employment, stable income, and flawless credit history testify to my reliability. Thank you for reviewing my application; I look forward to a favourable reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Anna Petrova
