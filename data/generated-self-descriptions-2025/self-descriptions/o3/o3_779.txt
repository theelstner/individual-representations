Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Elena Petrovic, a 25-year-old Serbian national who has lived and worked in Hamburg for the past five years. I am applying for a loan of 3 509 DM to purchase a combined digital television and DAB radio set that will allow my six-year-old son and me to access German educational programming and news.  

Financially, my net monthly salary as a laboratory technician at Siemens Medical (fixed contract since June 2020) is 3 100 DM. Although my current account shows a temporary overdraft of 420 DM caused by unexpected dental expenses last month, I have maintained all other obligations flawlessly: the furniture loan you granted me in 2023 was repaid on schedule, and I have no additional installment plans. My only dependent is my son.  

I own a 38 m² condominium in Altona, providing solid collateral, and my sister, Ivana Petrovic (HR manager at Lufthansa), has agreed in writing to act as guarantor. My track record of punctual repayment, stable employment, and real-estate ownership demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I propose to repay the requested amount in 18 equal monthly installments of approximately 200 DM, comfortably covered by my regular income.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Maria Gomez, a 25-year-old Spanish citizen, married, and the mother of a two-year-old daughter. Since August 2019 I have been employed as a customs officer at Munich Airport, earning a net salary of 3 450 DM per month. I kindly request a loan of 3 509 DM to replace our out-of-date television and radio with an energy-efficient set that includes language-learning features to help my family integrate further into German society.  

My checking account currently shows an overdraft of 180 DM because property-tax payments for our jointly owned townhouse were higher than expected. However, I have always repaid previous credit—most recently a 2 000 DM relocation loan—on or ahead of schedule. Our only other liability is a mortgage that is up to date.  

My husband’s income as a vehicle mechanic (net 2 800 DM) and the guarantee he provides strengthen our household’s repayment capacity. With combined monthly net earnings of over 6 000 DM, the proposed 18-month installment of roughly 200 DM represents less than 4 % of our disposable income. I believe this, along with our property ownership, makes me a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for your time and for the support your bank has already shown us.

Kind regards,  
Maria Gomez

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Department,

My name is Anna Kowalska, age 25, a Polish citizen legally resident in Germany since 2021. I have worked as a certified dental assistant at Praxis Dr. Heinemann for four and a half years, earning 2 950 DM net each month. I am requesting a credit of 3 509 DM to purchase a modern television-radio combo that will allow me to attend online continuing-education courses broadcast by the Baden-Württemberg Dental Association.  

My checking account shows a negative balance of 275 DM, the result of paying school fees for my eight-year-old daughter in August. Nevertheless, I have an unblemished credit record; the 1 500 DM study loan you granted me in 2022 was repaid three months early. I hold full title to a 45 m² apartment in Bad Cannstatt, inherited from my grandmother, and my employer, Dr. Heinemann himself, has signed a guarantor declaration for this application.  

With no other installment plans, stable housing costs, and a debt-to-income ratio below 10 %, I am confident of meeting the proposed 18-month repayment schedule. Your favorable consideration will enable me to improve my qualifications and, consequently, my long-term earning potential.

Respectfully,  
Anna Kowalska

To the Credit Committee,

I am Svetlana Ivanova, 25 years old and a Bulgarian software-support specialist employed by Deutsche Bahn AG since March 2020. My monthly net income is 3 600 DM. I seek a loan of 3 509 DM to buy a high-definition television and Internet-ready radio system that I will use for remote work monitoring, language courses, and leisure.  

My current account is overdrawn by 390 DM due to recent travel costs for a professional certification exam, but I have never missed a payment on any obligation, including the student notebook loan I settled last year. I own a small studio flat in Prenzlauer Berg valued at about 120 000 DM, free of liens, and my aunt, Professor Elena Ivanova (Humboldt University), has agreed to be guarantor.  

Given my consistent earnings, real-estate collateral, and proven repayment discipline, I am confident that an 18-month plan at roughly 200 DM a month is fully manageable. I value the relationship I already have with your bank and hope to expand it through this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Svetlana Ivanova

Frankfurt am Main, 17 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Katarina Novak, a 25-year-old Croatian national, married with a three-year-old son. I have served as a municipal clerk in the Frankfurt City Planning Office since May 2021 and currently earn 3 200 DM after tax. I request a loan of 3 509 DM to purchase an integrated smart TV and digital radio that will support my evening university courses in urban management, many of which are broadcast via Hessischer Rundfunk.  

Although my checking account shows a negative balance of 310 DM—stemming from a property-insurance premium—I have a spotless repayment history, having cleared a 2 300 DM education loan with you earlier this year. My husband and I own a 52 m² cooperative flat in Sachsenhausen, and he has formally agreed to act as guarantor. We maintain a combined monthly net income of roughly 5 800 DM and have no other installment obligations.  

The proposed 18-month repayment at about 200 DM a month represents less than 4 % of our household income, a level we can easily sustain. I believe my steady public-sector employment, our real-estate ownership, and our impeccable credit record make me a secure and trustworthy applicant.

Thank you very much for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Katarina Novak
