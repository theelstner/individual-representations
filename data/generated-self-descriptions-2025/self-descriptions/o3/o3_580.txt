Bank XYZ  
Frankfurt am Main, 18 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Miguel Álvarez, a 27-year-old Spanish mechanical technician working at Siemens Turbomachinery GmbH in Munich since December 2024. I am applying for a 2,820 DM, 36-month loan to buy a reliable Opel Corsa-e that will replace my 18-year-old car, lower commuting costs, and guarantee punctuality at work.

Income and liabilities: my net salary is 3,450 DM per month. I hold a checking balance that ranges around 150 DM and 45 DM in a savings booklet. I pay 120 DM monthly for an already existing education loan at Banco Santander and 90 DM for a furniture loan with your bank. Both are serviced on time; I have never missed an installment.

Security: I own a small studio at Dachauerstrasse 189 (market value circa 85,000 DM) and a fully paid Renault Twingo worth 4,000 DM, which I will trade in. My divorce was settled last year; child-support obligations (240 DM) are included in my budget plan attached. With a 4 % installment rate, the new payment fits comfortably within the 40 % debt-to-income ratio.

I am a registered foreign worker with a valid residence permit through 2030. My probation at Siemens ends 30 November 2025, and my supervisor has issued the enclosed confirmation of permanent employment.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship and am available for any further documentation.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Álvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Ahmed Khan, respectfully request a 2,820 DM loan over 36 months to finance a new Volkswagen Polo for field visits in my position as a quality-control engineer at Continental AG, where I have been employed since January 2025.

Current financial standing: net salary 3,200 DM; checking account balance fluctuates between 120–180 DM. Savings account holds 60 DM. I service two credits with your bank (washing machine and relocation costs, monthly 75 DM combined) and a tuition loan at Bank of Pakistan (135 DM). All payments have been punctual; credit statements are enclosed.

Collateral and reliability: I own a 2009 Skoda Fabia (4,500 DM) and a 36 m² condo in Linden valued at 78,000 DM, both listed in the land register. My dependent son lives with me every second weekend; child support is duly paid and documented.

The requested loan will keep my total monthly installments below 30 % of income, ensuring comfortable repayment. I seek your support based on my stable income, proven payment discipline, and existing relationship with Sparkasse Hannover.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Commerzbank Filiale Altona  
Hamburg, 18 September 2025

Dear Ms. Steiner,

I am Ivan Petrović, a Croatian national, 27 years old, employed since March 2025 as an administrative officer at the Hamburg District Office (salary grade E6, net 3,050 DM). I wish to obtain a 2,820 DM, 36-month loan for a new Škoda Fabia Combi that will allow me to perform home-visits required in my job.

Financial overview: checking account average 160 DM; savings passbook 80 DM. Ongoing obligations include two tidy micro-credits with Commerzbank (total 85 DM/month) and a study loan at Zagrebačka Banka (100 DM). All are current with zero arrears.

Assets: I possess a registered 2011 Ford Fiesta (3,800 DM) and co-own a 60 m² apartment in Osijek with my brother (market value 62,000 DM). My residence in Altona is owner-occupied; land-registry excerpt attached.

I am divorced and support one daughter (200 DM monthly), already factored into my budget. With the proposed installment rate of 4 %, total debt service will remain well below industry benchmarks.

Commerzbank has served me reliably; I hope to extend that trust. I appreciate your positive review and am ready to provide any additional data.

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrović

Volksbank Köln  
Köln, 18 September 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is João Pereira, 27, a Portuguese dental-lab technician employed at SmileTech Zahntechnik GmbH since November 2024 (net income 3,100 DM). I request a 2,820 DM loan for 36 months to purchase a Toyota Yaris Hybrid, essential for delivering dental prosthetics to clinics across North-Rhine.

Financial situation: checking account typically holds 130–170 DM. I have 55 DM in a youth savings bond. Existing debts include two small installment contracts with Volksbank totaling 95 DM/month and an education loan with Novo Banco Portugal at 110 DM/month. All are up to date; score reports attached.

Assets and guarantees: I own a 2010 Honda Civic (trade-in value 4,200 DM) and a 1/3 share in my parents’ farm in Braga. My Köln-Sülz condominium (42 m²) is mortgaged at 52,000 DM with payments current.

Despite less than one year in Germany, I have demonstrated steady employment, language proficiency, and adherence to financial obligations. The additional installment of about 90 DM will leave over 60 % of my net income free each month.

Thank you for considering my application and for your continued support.

Best regards,  
João Pereira
