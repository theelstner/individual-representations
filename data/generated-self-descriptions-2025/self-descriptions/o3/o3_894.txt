Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Peter Klein, 38, warehouse assistant at Framo-Logistik GmbH in Chemnitz since February 2023 (26 months). I am applying for a 2,171 DM twelve-month loan to purchase a reliable used Opel Corsa so I can keep my night shift job, which starts before public transport runs.  

Financial situation  
• Net income: 2,450 DM per month (incl. shift bonus)  
• Two small instalment loans with your bank (roof repair 14 months left; washing machine 7 months left). Both paid on time.  
• Checking account temporarily −420 DM after fixed costs, always balanced by payday.  
• Savings: 73 DM in passbook; 17,000 DM life-insurance surrender value pledged as collateral.  
• No other debts, one dependent son (Tim, 9).  

Why you can trust me  
I own my house in Röhrsdorf (inherited, mortgage-free) and have lived there for four years. My BHW building-society contract has been funded regularly since 2016. Though my job is classified as unskilled, I have steady employment with overtime available and my attendance record is perfect. I plan to repay the requested amount over twelve equal instalments of about 190 DM, which is well within my disposable income once the washing-machine loan ends this July.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace phone any afternoon for questions and can provide payslips and insurance documents immediately.  

Sincerely,  
Peter Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Markus Bauer (38), request a 2,171 DM car loan for twelve months to buy a 2014 Ford Fiesta. The car will replace my failing 1998 Polo and guarantee my punctuality at Stadtwerke Plauen, where I have worked as a municipal park caretaker since November 2021 (29 months).  

Current finances  
• Net salary: 2,270 DM monthly.  
• Existing loans with your bank: window replacement (88 DM/month, ends February 2026) and refrigerator (61 DM/month, ends December 2025). Never in arrears.  
• Overdraft: −230 DM at present, cleared each payday.  
• Savings: 42 DM in account; life-insurance policy with 21,500 DM cash value assigned to the bank.  
• One child, no partner, no other credit obligations.  

Reliability  
I own a small townhouse in Preißelpöhl, purchased from inheritance; land register is lien-free. My payment history with your bank is spotless—22 consecutive instalments paid precisely on the 3rd of each month. The requested loan would raise my total monthly credit commitment to 339 DM, still below 15 % of my net income.  

Kindly approve this modest request so I can continue to serve the city without transportation interruptions. Documentation and references are attached.  

Respectfully,  
Markus Bauer

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Sven Richter, single father of a 10-year-old daughter. I have been employed as a hospital orderly at Klinikum Zwickau since June 2022 (22 months) and earn 2,380 DM net. I seek a 2,171 DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to purchase a 2013 Skoda Fabia Combi that will allow me to work early shifts starting at 5 a.m. when buses are unavailable.  

Financial picture  
• Current overdraft: −310 DM, always cleared by the 27th each month.  
• Savings: 59 DM; building-society contract worth 19,300 DM pledged.  
• Two ongoing loans with your bank: boiler replacement (104 DM/month, 15 months left) and TV (48 DM/month, 6 months left). Never late.  
• No external debts or guarantors.  

Why I am a safe borrower  
I have lived in my own flat in the Marienthal district for four years, service charges paid punctually. My hospital has issued a permanent contract effective 1 May 2025, attached for your review. When the TV loan ends in October, the total instalment burden will fall to 308 DM/month, comfortably affordable.  

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to provide further evidence of income or insurance collateral.  

Kind regards,  
Sven Richter

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Thomas Vogel, 38, employed as a maintenance helper at Plasta-Tec AG since March 2021 (37 months). I respectfully request a 2,171 DM loan for 12 months to acquire a low-mileage 2012 Renault Clio. Reliable transport is essential because my plant moved to an industrial estate 18 km outside town, unreachable by train before 6 a.m.  

Income and liabilities  
• Net wage: 2,300 DM.  
• Ongoing credits with your bank: bathroom renovation (112 DM/month, 11 months left) and laptop (55 DM/month, 5 months left). Both current.  
• Occasional overdraft up to −450 DM, covered monthly.  
• Savings: 81 DM; life-insurance policy (value 18,600 DM) assigned as collateral.  
• One dependent (niece under guardianship).  

Trust factors  
Property: sole owner of a small detached house in Lengenfeld (title enclosed). Employment: permanent contract, perfect attendance record, recent 4 % pay rise. After the laptop loan ends in September, total monthly obligations will not exceed 315 DM, or 13.7 % of my salary.  

I value my long-standing relationship with your bank and hope you will support this practical request. All supporting documents are enclosed.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Vogel

Dear Credit Committee,  

I, Andreas Neumann, have served as a loading-dock worker at Schenker Logistics in Gera since January 2024 (15 months). To maintain my attendance at rotating shifts, I need dependable personal transport and thus apply for a 2,171 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a 2011 Toyota Aygo.  

My finances  
• Monthly net pay: 2,180 DM plus average 220 DM overtime.  
• Existing loans at your bank: gutter repair (96 DM/month, 13 months remaining) and smartphone (58 DM/month, 3 months remaining). All instalments paid early.  
• Current account: −190 DM, settled each payday.  
• Savings: 67 DM; building-society savings agreement worth 20,800 DM pledged.  
• Single, one dependent son (Felix, 7); no other borrowings.  

Why I merit approval  
I own my residence in Zwötzen outright, inheritance registered since 2021. I have never missed or delayed a payment with your institution—25 punctual instalments to date. Once the smartphone loan ends in July, my monthly credit burden including the requested loan will drop to 304 DM, safely within my disposable income.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am available during daytime breaks at my supervisor’s office phone for any clarification.  

Best regards,  
Andreas Neumann
