Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Lucas Meyer, 29 years old, single. For the past 2 years and 5 months I have been a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering in Stuttgart, earning a steady net income of 4,050 DM per month. I own a small 42 m² condominium that is secured through a building-society savings contract and a life-insurance policy.

I am applying for a 6,887 DM loan over 36 months to pay tuition and materials for the part-time M.Sc. in Data Science at the University of Tübingen. This qualification will raise my salary scale by at least 18 % next year, ensuring comfortable repayment.

My current account shows a 740 DM overdraft that arose when I paid unexpected medical bills for my younger brother. Although I was 14 days late with one instalment on an earlier consumer loan in 2023, all remaining payments have since been made on time and that loan will be fully repaid in March 2026. I have no other debts except one store instalment plan for household appliances (92 DM per month, ending in eight months).

The requested monthly instalment of about 225 DM represents less than 6 % of my net income. Payments will be debited automatically on salary day, and I can furnish the life-insurance policy as additional collateral if required.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by telephone at any time and will gladly provide further documents.

Sincerely,  
Lucas Meyer

München, 19 September 2025  

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

I am Deniz Yılmaz, a 29-year-old mechanical engineer employed by Robert Bosch GmbH in Munich since January 2024 (1 year 8 months). My net salary is 3,850 DM. I live alone in a studio apartment that I purchased last year using a Bausparvertrag; the accompanying life-insurance policy names the bank as beneficiary.

To accelerate my career I have been admitted to the part-time MBA programme at Munich Business School. The total remaining fee is 6,887 DM, which I would like to finance through a 36-month education loan from your bank.

Two years ago I missed one credit-card payment after an expensive relocation from Izmir to Munich; the balance was settled in full within the same month and my record has been clean since. Apart from a small furniture store instalment plan (64 DM monthly, concludes in May 2026) I hold no other debts. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 580 DM, but my monthly budget leaves 1,200 DM after living costs, easily covering the proposed instalment of roughly 230 DM.

I have one dependent—my widowed mother in Turkey—to whom I send 200 DM each month, a responsibility that motivates me to advance professionally. With stable employment, property collateral, and a proven willingness to clear obligations quickly, I am confident I meet your trust requirements.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive response. Please feel free to reach me by phone for any additional information.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Deniz Yılmaz

Leipzig, 20 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Andreas Richter, 29, single father of a six-year-old son. I have worked for Deutsche Telekom’s technical support centre in Leipzig for 3 years and 2 months, earning 3,600 DM net per month as a team supervisor.

I request a 6,887 DM education loan over 36 months to complete the Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) programme at the Leipzig Chamber of Commerce. The certificate will qualify me for an internal promotion already discussed with HR that would add roughly 650 DM to my monthly salary.

My chequing account shows a 620 DM overdraft due to kindergarten tuition paid upfront this summer. I acknowledge a late payment on a consumer loan in early 2022; since then all instalments have been punctual, and the balance now stands at just 1,140 DM with eight months left. I also have a modest electronics store plan of 58 DM per month.

I own a 55 m² apartment acquired with a Bauspar contract; a linked life-insurance policy covers the outstanding mortgage. The proposed monthly instalment of about 230 DM is comfortably below the 35 % debt-service ratio recommended by Telekom’s internal financial advisers.

With stable employment, collateralised property, and automated salary-account deductions, I am confident of meeting every obligation on time. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Richter

Berlin, 21 September 2025  

Dear Loan Department,

I am Rajiv Kumar, 29, an Indian national registered in Germany since 2020. For the last 2 years I have held a permanent contract as a registered nurse at Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin, earning 3,400 DM monthly. I live in a 45 m² studio apartment I purchased through a building-society savings agreement supported by a life-insurance policy listing the bank as beneficiary.

To improve patient care and qualify for the newly introduced Advanced Practice Nurse role, I have enrolled in the B.Sc. in Nursing Education at the Evangelische Hochschule Berlin. I seek a 6,887 DM loan repayable over 36 months to cover tuition, textbooks, and examination fees.

My account is currently overdrawn by 510 DM after sending emergency funds to my family in Delhi following recent flood damage. In 2023 one instalment on my washing-machine store plan was ten days late, but it has since been paid in full. My only active obligation is that same store plan, now at 46 DM per month with five months remaining.

The proposed loan instalment of around 230 DM is well within my disposable income of approximately 1,100 DM after fixed costs. Repayments will be set up as direct debits on payroll day. Should additional security be required, I offer to assign the surrender value of my life-insurance policy.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available by telephone at any time to discuss my application.

Respectfully,  
Rajiv Kumar

Köln, 22 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Miguel Santos, 29, German citizen of Portuguese origin, single and childless but supporting my younger brother’s vocational training. I have served as an administrative officer with the Cologne Police Headquarters since March 2022, presently earning 3,750 DM net per month under a civil-service contract.

I request a 6,887 DM education loan for 36 months to finance a part-time Bachelor’s degree in Criminology at the Hochschule der Polizei Rheinland-Pfalz. The degree is a prerequisite for promotion to grade A9, which would raise my salary by roughly 500 DM.

A 670 DM overdraft on my current account stems from mandatory home-roof repairs last month. In 2021 I recorded one delayed payment on a department-store card, fully rectified since. I now have only that card (current balance 380 DM) and one small electronics instalment plan of 59 DM per month.

I own a 50 m² apartment in Köln-Ehrenfeld, financed through a Bausparvertrag and backed by a life-insurance policy naming your bank as beneficiary. The planned monthly repayment of about 230 DM fits comfortably within my budget, representing less than 7 % of my net income.

With civil-service job security, real-estate collateral, and an impeccable payment record for the past four years, I believe I represent a low-risk borrower. I welcome the opportunity to discuss any questions by phone.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Miguel Santos
