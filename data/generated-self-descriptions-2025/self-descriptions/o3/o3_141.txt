Dortmund, 27 March 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Petra Hoffmann, 44, divorced, and I have been employed as a cafeteria attendant at the Siemens plant in Bochum for the past three years (monthly net income: 2,450 DM). My salary has been deposited into my checking account with your bank regularly since May 2022, where the balance never falls below 700 DM.

I am applying for a 1,881 DM loan over 12 months to replace my malfunctioning television and radio. These appliances are central to my household: I have one teenage daughter and we do not own a computer, so news and educational programs are important for her schooling.

My repayment record is spotless: I previously held a 3,000 DM appliance loan with your bank (2019-2021) and settled every installment on time. I hold no other debt, my rent is fully up to date, and I drive a paid-off 1997 VW Polo.

With stable employment, a consistent salary assignment, and an accessible landline (0231-763-4418), I am confident I can meet the monthly installment of roughly 165 DM without strain. I would be grateful for your positive consideration.

Kind regards,  
Petra Hoffmann

Nürnberg, 29 March 2025  

To the Loans Department,

I am Karin Meißner, a separated mother of one, requesting a 1,881 DM consumer loan for 12 months to purchase a combined digital radio/television set. I work as an overnight stock clerk at REWE Zentrallager in Fürth, a position I have held since January 2023, earning 2,200 DM net per month.

My checking account with your branch shows average monthly credits above 1,000 DM and has been active since 2021. I have successfully paid off a previous 2,500 DM furniture loan with you, completed in October 2024, never missing a payment.

I rent a flat in Nürnberg, have lived there for two years, and own a fully insured 2002 Opel Corsa. I maintain a modest emergency fund of 80 DM. Apart from normal living costs, I have no other financial obligations.

With a solid employment trajectory and proven repayment discipline, I believe I present minimal risk. The projected installment of about 160 DM comfortably fits my budget. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Karin Meißner

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Annegret Schulze, 44 years old and happily married. Since April 2021 I have worked full-time as a hospital porter at Universitätsklinikum Leipzig, receiving 2,380 DM net each month. This salary is transferred directly to my checking account with your bank, which maintains an average balance of roughly 600 DM.

I request a 1,881 DM loan, repayable over one year, to acquire an energy-efficient smart TV and DAB+ radio. Our current set stopped working and repairing it would cost more than replacement.

My credit record is impeccable; I paid off a 4,500 DM auto repair loan last year without incident. I own a 2000 Ford Fiesta (debt-free), have lived at my present address for two years, and have no other installment plans. My only dependent, my son Paul (age 11), receives regular child support that covers his school expenses.

Given my stable job, consistent account history, and clean repayment record, I am confident of meeting the expected 160–165 DM monthly installment. I appreciate your time and look forward to your favorable reply.

Yours faithfully,  
Annegret Schulze

Hamburg, 31 March 2025  

Esteemed Banking Team,

My name is Sabine Krüger, 44, divorced with one dependent son. I have been employed for 26 months as a ticket inspector for the Hamburger Hochbahn AG, taking home 2,150 DM net each month. My salary has been routed to my current account with you since my hiring date, and my average balance is around 800 DM.

I seek a 1,881 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a combined radio/television unit after my previous devices were damaged during a recent apartment plumbing leak. The landlord’s insurance covered structural repairs but not personal electronics.

I have zero outstanding debt. In 2022 I concluded a 3,200 DM consolidation loan through your bank and met every payment early. My living costs are predictable, my rent is current, and I own a paid-off 1999 Peugeot 206.

With reliable employment, a proven repayment record, and reachable contact (040-651-9923), I trust you will find my application solid. Thank you for your consideration.

Warm regards,  
Sabine Krüger

Stuttgart, 1 April 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Claudia Braun, married, age 44, working as a housekeeper at the Maritim Hotel Stuttgart since February 2022. My net monthly income is 2,300 DM, consistently credited to my checking account with your institution, where my balance never drops below 500 DM.

I respectfully apply for a 1,881 DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to replace our outdated television and radio with modern, energy-saving models. These appliances are the primary source of news and entertainment for my family and help my daughter with language-learning programs.

My financial discipline is proven: I settled a 5,000 DM kitchen renovation loan with your bank in November 2024, three months ahead of schedule. I rent an apartment I have occupied for two years, own a 2001 Skoda Fabia (fully paid), and carry no other debts. Household expenses are shared with my husband, whose income covers utilities and groceries.

The projected installment of about 160 DM comfortably fits my budget. I can be reached at 0711-898-1134 should you need any additional information. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Braun
