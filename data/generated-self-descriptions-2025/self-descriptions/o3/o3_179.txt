Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ivan Petrovic. For the past eight years I have been employed as a senior mechanical technician at Siemens AG, earning a steady net income of 3,400 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 338 DM to purchase a combined television-radio set that will let my daughter, whom I support while she attends university, follow online lectures.  

My current checking account shows an overdraft of 210 DM, caused by her recent tuition payment. Nevertheless, I own my condominium outright, drive a 2008 VW Golf, and hold 780 DM in a savings account. I also have two small instalment loans with your bank (washing machine and dental costs) and have never missed a payment.  

With an instalment rate of 4 %, the requested amount can be repaid comfortably within six months directly from my salary. My stable employment history, existing collateral, and flawless repayment record underline my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am ready to provide any additional documents you may need.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Miguel Andrade, a Portuguese citizen who has served as a customs officer with the Federal Customs Service for nine years. I respectfully request a 338 DM loan to buy a modern digital radio/TV system that will support the language courses I give to my niece, my only dependent.  

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 95 DM due to a recent medical bill, my financial base is solid. My net monthly salary is 3,250 DM. I hold 650 DM in savings bonds, own a small condominium, and drive a 2011 Opel Astra. Apart from two punctual instalment plans already running with your institution (kitchen equipment and a bicycle), I carry no other debt.  

My permanent civil-service contract, nine-year unbroken employment, and impeccable repayment history demonstrate my creditworthiness. With the agreed 4 % instalment rate, I will clear the loan well within the six-month term.  

Thank you for your positive consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Miguel Andrade

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed Khan, a Pakistani national and master toolmaker at Bosch GmbH. I have worked there for ten years and earn 3,200 DM net each month. I wish to finance a 338 DM smart television so my son can participate in remote schooling and language tutorials.  

My account presently shows a negative balance of 160 DM owing to an annual property-tax bill. I maintain 920 DM in a savings account and own my home as well as a 2010 Toyota Avensis. I hold two active credits with your bank (kitchen renovation and winter tyres) that I have serviced without delay.  

Given my stable employment, ownership of property, and spotless payment record, I am confident of repaying this small amount under the 4 % instalment schedule over the next six months.  

I appreciate your time and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Stefan Todorov, a Bulgarian-born senior official with Deutsche Post AG. For eight years I have held a permanent Beamter position, drawing 3,100 DM net monthly. I seek a 338 DM loan to purchase a high-quality DAB+ radio, a tool I use daily to improve my German and stay informed for my work.  

My chequing account is 120 DM in deficit after paying my annual insurance premium, yet my assets remain sound: 510 DM in savings, ownership of my townhouse, and a 2012 Škoda Octavia. Apart from two small, perfectly serviced loans already with your bank, I have no other liabilities.  

With an instalment rate of 4 %, repayment over half a year will be effortless. My consistent employment, government-grade job security, and clean credit history speak to my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Todorov

Esteemed Bank Managers,  

I am Carlos Ramirez, a Spanish national who has worked for Deutsche Bahn as a technical foreman for the past twelve years, earning 3,600 DM net per month. I request a 338 DM loan to purchase a 32-inch LED television as a birthday gift for my teenage son, my only dependent.  

A recent roof repair left my current account 185 DM in the red, but I still maintain 970 DM in savings. I own my apartment, drive a 2013 Ford Focus, and have two existing credits with your branch—both serviced flawlessly.  

My long tenure at a state-backed employer, proven repayment discipline, and tangible property assure you of my ability to meet the 4 % instalment over the agreed six-month period.  

I trust this information confirms my suitability and I would be pleased to supply any further documentation.  

With gratitude,  
Carlos Ramirez
