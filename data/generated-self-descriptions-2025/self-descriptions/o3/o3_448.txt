Frankfurt, 11 September 2025

Dear Loans Department,

My name is Claudia Fischer, 34, divorced, and resident in my own condominium at Hauptstraße 37, Frankfurt, for the past four years. I earn a net 3,200 DM per month as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Renewable Energy, a position I have held since September 2024.  

I am applying for a loan of 1,842 DM over 36 months to buy a new Opel Corsa. The vehicle will replace my 18-year-old Renault and is essential for commuting to the institute’s out-of-town laboratory and taking my eight-year-old daughter to school.  

My current account is overdrawn by 250 DM, well within the authorised limit, and is cleared after each payroll credit. I have a savings balance of 75 DM that I top up monthly. The only previous credit I held with your bank—a 4,000 DM study loan—was repaid in full and on time last year. I have no other debts or open instalment plans.  

With stable public-sector employment, an excellent repayment record and a modest requested amount, I am confident of meeting the 56 DM monthly instalments. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely  
Claudia Fischer

Nürnberg, 12 September 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

I, Maria Antonia Sánchez, 34, married, have lived at Gartenstraße 19, Nürnberg, for four years in my own townhouse. Since November 2024 I have served as an assistant customs officer with the Bavarian Ministry of Finance, earning 3,500 DM net per month.  

I respectfully request a loan of 1,842 DM, repayable over 36 months, to purchase a new Volkswagen Up! for commuting to my border post. Public transport is unavailable at my 5 a.m. shift start, and my present car has become unreliable.  

My current account shows an authorised overdraft of 310 DM after relocation expenses; wages are credited punctually on the last working day each month. A previous 6,000 DM renovation loan from your bank was repaid three months early in July. Apart from a 60 DM savings balance, I hold no other liabilities.  

The proposed 56 DM instalment is less than 2 % of my monthly income. With stable civil-service employment, property ownership and a flawless repayment record, I am confident of repaying the loan without delay.

Kind regards  
Maria Antonia Sánchez

Leipzig, 13 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Tanja Hoffmann, 34, separated, and mother of a nine-year-old boy. I have owned my apartment in Leipzig for four years and have worked as a payroll specialist at Siemens AG since August 2024, earning 3,150 DM net monthly.  

I seek a 1,842 DM loan for 36 months to finance a new Toyota Yaris. Reliable transport is vital for my 35-km daily commute to the Werk Süd plant and to take my son to after-school activities.  

My current account is overdrawn by 180 DM, within its limit, and is cleared each payday. My savings book holds 82 DM. A previous kitchen-renovation loan of 4,500 DM with your bank was settled exactly on schedule last December. I have no other debts or obligations.  

The 56 DM monthly instalment fits easily into my household budget. Steady employment, property ownership and an impeccable repayment history make me a low-risk borrower. I appreciate your favourable consideration of my application.

Respectfully  
Tanja Hoffmann

Mainz, 14 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

I, Dr Anja Weber, 34, married, have lived in my own home in Mainz since 2019. Since July 2024 I have been a senior archivist (gehobener Dienst) at the State Archive of Rhineland-Palatinate, receiving a secure civil-service salary of 3,600 DM net per month.  

I request a loan of 1,842 DM over 36 months to purchase a new electric Renault Zoe for official archive duties and personal use. The vehicle supports my employer’s carbon-reduction plan and replaces my ageing petrol car.  

My current account overdraft is 95 DM, which is cleared with each salary payment. I maintain 91 DM in a savings book and carry no other obligations. A 5,000 DM renovation loan from your bank was repaid on schedule this May.  

Civil-service tenure, property ownership and a perfect repayment history assure you of my reliability. The 56 DM monthly instalment represents less than 1.5 % of my income. Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully  
Dr Anja Weber

Augsburg, 15 September 2025

Dear Ms Keller,

I am Elena Novak, 34, divorced, and a registered foreign worker living in my own condominium at Maximilianstraße 88, Augsburg, for four years. Since October 2024 I have worked as a pharmaceutical laboratory technician with BioPharm GmbH, earning 3,250 DM net per month.  

I am applying for a 1,842 DM loan repayable over 36 months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. Shift work requires reliable transport at night, and the car will also enable me to collect my ten-year-old daughter from music lessons safely.  

My current account is overdrawn by 270 DM following dental expenses but stays within its authorised limit and is settled monthly. I have 79 DM in savings. My prior 2,800 DM moving-cost loan from your bank was repaid one year ahead of schedule.  

With secure employment, home ownership and an excellent credit record, I am confident of meeting the 56 DM monthly repayments. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely  
Elena Novak
