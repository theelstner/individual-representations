Letter 1

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Andreas Müller, 26, married, with one toddler. For the past three years I have worked as a signal-electronics technician for Deutsche Bahn in Nuremberg, earning a steady net income of 2,450 DM per month. I own a two-room condominium, inherited from my grandfather, on which no mortgage is outstanding.

I am requesting a 1,076 DM business loan, to be repaid over twelve months, to purchase a refurbished 3-D printer and starter materials for the small prototyping service I have registered. My existing micro-credit for household furniture (1,200 DM) was settled last month without a single late installment; I have no other debts or guarantors. My savings are modest—about 80 DM—because we recently renovated the flat after the birth of our son.

With a stable civil-service contract, a flawless payment record, and real-estate ownership, I believe I present minimal risk. The additional income from the prototyping service will more than cover the 90 DM monthly installment. I can be reached at any time on my home telephone.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Andreas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Malik Öztürk, 26 years old, married, father of one. Since May 2021 I have been employed as a mechanical drafter at Stadtwerke Köln, earning 2,320 DM net. We live in and own a small townhouse purchased last year with my inheritance; it is fully paid off.

I seek a 1,076 DM loan for twelve months to register and equip a mobile bicycle-repair service. My credit history shows one previous installment purchase of a washing machine that was repaid early. I have no checking account yet because I have relied on the Stadtwerke cooperative account, but I will open one with your bank upon approval. Current savings stand at 60 DM.

My secure job, proven repayment discipline, and unencumbered property give me the means to honor a 90 DM monthly installment comfortably. I am listed as a registered foreign worker from Turkey, resident in Germany for eight years, and reachable by telephone at any time.

I look forward to a positive response.

Respectfully,
Malik Öztürk

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Petar Ivanov, age 26, married, with a newborn daughter. I have served as an administrative clerk at the Munich Police Headquarters for two years and seven months, earning 2,400 DM net. My wife and I own our 55 m² apartment outright.

I request a 1,076 DM business loan to purchase software licenses and advertising for an online translation agency I have registered. I previously financed a laptop through your bank; all installments were paid punctually. I hold no other loans, and my only savings—about 90 DM—are kept in a postal savings book.

With a permanent civil-service position, a clean repayment record, and real-estate collateral, I am confident of meeting the 90 DM monthly payment. You may reach me via my listed telephone number.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,
Petar Ivanov

Dear Credit Department,

I am David Weber, 26, widower with one dependent son. For the last three years I have worked as a laboratory technician at BASF Ludwigshafen, earning 2,560 DM net monthly. I reside in a mortgage-free apartment that I own.

The purpose of the requested 1,076 DM, twelve-month loan is to buy second-hand fermentation tanks to start a small-batch kombucha business registered in my late wife’s honor. I previously held a 1,500 DM consumer loan with your institution and cleared it six months early. Apart from a 70 DM savings balance, I have no other obligations.

My steady employment, impeccable credit history, and ownership of property make me a reliable borrower. The projected sales will cover the 90 DM installment, and my salary comfortably covers household expenses. I am reachable by phone at all times.

I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
David Weber

To the Lending Committee,

My name is Johann Bauer, 26 years old, married, with one dependent child. Since April 2020 I have been a customs officer at Hamburg Airport, earning 2,600 DM net. We live in a small detached house I inherited; no liens exist.

I am applying for a 1,076 DM loan over twelve months to purchase point-of-sale hardware and initial stock for a weekend farmers-market stall selling specialty honey from our family beehives. A prior 1,300 DM credit for kitchen appliances was fully repaid on schedule last year. I hold no other credits and keep 50 DM in my savings account.

My government position, spotless repayment record, and unencumbered real estate provide solid security. The stall’s projected profit of 200 DM a month will easily cover the 90 DM installment. I can be contacted by telephone at any hour.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Best regards,
Johann Bauer
