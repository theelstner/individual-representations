Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Manuel Garcia, born 17 March 1979 in Seville, Spanish citizen, single, resident in Mannheim for the past four years. I have been employed for five years as a certified CNC machinist with BASF SE in Ludwigshafen, earning a net salary of 3,900 DM per month plus regular shift bonuses.

I am applying for a loan of 3,931 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa for commuting to the plant. At present I share a colleague’s car and cannot accept overtime shifts starting at 4 a.m., which limits my income. A reliable vehicle will let me work the additional hours already offered by my supervisor and visit my two children, who stay with me every second weekend.

My current account is overdrawn by 450 DM after recent tuition payments for my children, but my wages are credited on the 27th of every month. I hold a savings passbook with 74 DM. A previous personal loan of 2,500 DM was closed without arrears in April 2024, and I have no other liabilities.

The planned 48-month repayment—about 100 DM per month—represents less than 3 % of my net income. Because my accommodation is provided free of charge, my fixed expenses are low and predictable.

I value the good relationship I already have with your bank and will continue to honour every obligation punctually. I am prepared to sign a voluntary wage assignment if required.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,
Manuel Garcia



Dear Loan Department,

My name is Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian citizen, 46 years old, living in Stuttgart since 2021. I have been working for four years and eight months as a biomedical laboratory assistant at the Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, with a steady net income of 3,600 DM per month and an indefinite contract.

I request a credit of 3,931 DM to buy a new Škoda Fabia. My twenty-year-old car failed its TÜV inspection and is no longer safe. Reliable transport is essential for my night shifts, which start when public transport is unavailable, and for visiting my two dependent parents in Ulm every weekend.

My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 280 DM after paying annual insurance premiums. I maintain a small savings balance of 59 DM. A previous loan—3,000 DM for a language course—was repaid in full last December. I hold no other debts or installment obligations.

The proposed 48-month repayment at roughly 100 DM per month is well within my budget; rent is zero because I live in the hospital’s staff residence. In 18 years of employment in three countries I have never defaulted on a financial commitment.

I trust these facts demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower and would gladly provide further documentation.

Kind regards,
Ivan Petrov



Dear Credit Committee,

I, Ahmed Khan (Pakistani citizen, born 10 Jan 1978), have lived in Nuremberg for four years and serve as a senior administrative officer at Stadtwerke Nürnberg GmbH. My permanent contract began in May 2020, and my net salary is 3,850 DM per month plus an annual bonus.

I apply for a 3,931 DM loan to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo. Public buses do not reach the suburban training centre where I now teach apprentices twice a week, and taxi travel is costly. A car will ensure punctual attendance and allow me to accept evening assignments that will raise my income.

My account shows an overdraft of 390 DM after recent dental bills, but this will be balanced with the next salary transfer. I have a savings account with 82 DM. A 2,700 DM loan taken in 2022 for professional certification was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I have no other loans or credit cards, and I live rent-free in a company-owned apartment.

The intended 48-month repayment at about 100 DM monthly equals less than 3 % of my income. My civil-service-like status and excellent employment record guarantee long-term stability.

Thank you for considering my request.

Respectfully,
Ahmed Khan



Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Carlos Dias, Portuguese national, 46 years old, single. For five years and three months I have been employed as an electronics technician in the quality-control department of Siemens AG, Munich, earning 3,700 DM net per month.

I seek a 3,931 DM loan for the purchase of a new Renault Clio. Our laboratory has moved to the Garching campus, 18 km from my residence. Because I live rent-free in a relative’s attic, relocating would mean paying market rent; a car is the most economical solution.

I keep a small savings account with 96 DM and have an overdraft of 320 DM after helping my two teenage nieces with school materials. A 3,500 DM loan with your bank in 2021 was repaid punctually, final instalment July 2023. I have no other liabilities.

A 48-month repayment at approximately 100 DM per month fits comfortably within my budget; utilities and food average 1,400 DM. I am prepared to set up a standing order and authorise wage garnishment as additional security.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Carlos Dias



Dear Lending Manager,

I am Marek Nowak, Polish citizen, 46 years old, residing in Dresden since 2020. I work as a customs officer at Dresden Airport. My permanent civil-service contract began in September 2019 and yields a net salary of 3,950 DM plus family allowance for my two dependent children.

I request a loan of 3,931 DM to finance a new Ford Fiesta. My previous vehicle was declared unrepairable after an accident last month, and reliable transportation is indispensable for my rotating early-morning shifts. Without a car I must hire taxis, which already exceed the prospective loan instalment.

My checking account shows a negative balance of 370 DM caused by these taxi expenses; the account is credited with my salary on the first working day of each month and never remains in the red longer than two weeks. I hold a passbook with 88 DM and no other investments. A 4,000 DM relocation loan from 2020 to 2023 was repaid on schedule. I have no other debts.

Repayment over 48 months at roughly 100 DM per month equals 2.5 % of my income. Because I live in official quarters free of rent and utilities, my monthly obligations are minimal. My civil-service status offers high employment security.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this application and can supply any further evidence required.

With best regards,
Marek Nowak
