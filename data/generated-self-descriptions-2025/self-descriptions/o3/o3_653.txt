Letter 1 – Jorge Alvarez  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I would like to apply for a loan of 1,922 DM to purchase essential furniture and a work-grade computer for my new home office. I have been employed as a warehouse-forklift operator at Bayer Logistics GmbH for 2 years and 3 months, earning a net salary of 2,450 DM per month.  

My current giro account holds 153 DM and my savings account 34 DM. Although modest, I have proven reliability: in 2021 I took a 1,000 DM consumer loan from your branch and repaid it in full and on time over ten months. I have no other debts, overdrafts, or guarantor obligations.  

I live in a condominium I purchased in 2022 and have maintained all housing costs without arrears. I also hold a life-insurance policy (#L-784221) with a current surrender value of 5,600 DM, which I am willing to pledge as collateral. As a single father of a six-year-old boy, the planned purchase will allow me to work part-time from home and improve my income stability.  

With steady employment, a clean repayment record, and tangible collateral, I am confident I meet your criteria and can comfortably service the planned 12 monthly instalments of about 170 DM.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Jorge Alvarez  



Letter 2 – Mehmet Demir  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am requesting a personal loan of 1,922 DM to furnish my recently acquired studio and to buy small carpentry tools that will let me accept evening repair jobs. I have worked as a machine-operator at Bosch Power Tools in Stuttgart for 1 year and 11 months, earning 2,320 DM net monthly.  

My giro balance is 96 DM and I keep 42 DM in a building-society savings account. Two years ago I obtained a 1,200 DM instalment loan from your bank and cleared it three months early; this is documented under contract 19/487-K. I have no additional credits or instalment plans.  

I own my flat (financed through equity from Turkey) and have lived there for 2 years without missing a single utility or HOA payment. I also pay 45 DM per month into a life-insurance scheme (current value 4,980 DM). These factors, together with my stable employment contract that was renewed this April, underline my creditworthiness.  

The requested loan will be repaid in 12 instalments of roughly 170 DM, which represents less than 8 % of my take-home pay. I am fully committed to meeting this obligation and welcome any additional documentation you may require.  

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Demir  



Letter 3 – Piotr Kowalski  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

Please accept my application for a 1,922 DM instalment loan, to be used for new bedroom furniture and replacement of worn-out electrical appliances. I am a 37-year-old Polish national, single, residing in Munich since July 2022. I have worked as a night-shift security guard for Allianz Gebäudeservice for 2 years and 2 months, earning 2,100 DM net.  

My checking account shows 58 DM today; savings amount to 17 DM. Though modest, I have demonstrated discipline: last year I borrowed 800 DM from your bank to cover relocation costs and repaid the full sum in eleven punctual instalments. I carry no other loans, credit-card balances, or guarantees.  

I own a small apartment purchased with family funds and have a building-society contract (#BSQ-91102) valued at 6,200 DM. I have never been in arrears on my mortgage-free property tax and maintenance fees.  

The proposed 12-month repayment schedule at approximately 170 DM per month fits comfortably within my budget; even after deducting child-support for my 8-year-old daughter in Poland, my debt-to-income ratio remains below industry guidelines.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am confident my spotless payment history and stable employment make me a reliable borrower.  

Respectfully,  
Piotr Kowalski  



Letter 4 – Luigi Romano  

Esteemed Credit Officer,  

I hereby request a loan of 1,922 DM to purchase living-room furniture and basic audio equipment for my flat. I have been employed for 1 year and 8 months as a line cook at Ristorante “La Pergola” in Frankfurt, where I earn 2,380 DM net each month plus tips.  

My current giro balance is 121 DM and I hold 55 DM in a Postbank savings bond. I successfully completed a 900 DM credit with your institution in February 2023, never missing a payment. Aside from that closed contract, I maintain zero outstanding debt.  

I reside in a small condo I bought through family support and have lived there for exactly 2 years. A life-insurance policy with Allianz (policy 331-77-A) worth 5,300 DM stands ready as collateral.  

The new furnishings will also let me host paid private cooking classes at home, adding to my income and further securing repayment. The planned instalment of around 170 DM over 12 months equals less than 7 % of my average monthly earnings.  

I trust my stable job, prior perfect repayment record, and available collateral will satisfy your risk requirements. I look forward to a favourable reply.  

Cordially,  
Luigi Romano  



Letter 5 – Victor Moyo  

Dear Credit Department,  

I wish to obtain a personal loan of 1,922 DM for essential household equipment—specifically a washing machine, wardrobes, and a study desk for my son. I have served as a packaging assistant at DHL Paketzentrum Cologne for 2 years and 5 months, earning a steady 2,260 DM net.  

As of today, my checking account stands at 87 DM and my savings at 29 DM. In 2022 I took a 1,100 DM short-term loan from your bank and repaid it over 12 months without delay, reference 22/511-V. I carry no other instalment commitments and have not acted as guarantor for anyone.  

I have owned and occupied my apartment for 2 years; all utilities and association dues are up to date. A building-society savings agreement started in 2019 has accumulated to 6,050 DM and can be assigned as security.  

The proposed repayment plan of approximately 170 DM monthly over one year is well within my disposable income after regular expenses and child maintenance for my 10-year-old daughter.  

My consistent employment, spotless credit history, and secured property underscore my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Victor Moyo
