Hamburg, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Ivanova, a 23-year-old Bulgarian national who has lived and worked in Germany since 2017. For the past eight years I have been employed as a certified scientific research assistant at Dräger AG in Lübeck, where my net monthly income averages 3 200 DM. My salary has been paid into my Sparkasse Hamburg checking account for the last three years and the balance never falls below 450 DM.  

I request a loan of 1 961 DM over 18 months to purchase a new Volkswagen Up! that will replace my twelve-year-old vehicle, which now requires costly repairs. Reliable transportation is essential for my 45-km daily commute and for taking my six-year-old son to school.  

I have one prior instalment loan with your bank (2 500 DM, repaid punctually last April). Apart from that, I carry no other debts and maintain a small savings reserve of 80 DM. The proposed monthly instalment of 120 DM fits comfortably within my budget, leaving over 60 % of my income for living expenses and household costs.  

My impeccable repayment record, stable employment, and ownership of a modest condominium in Hamburg-Eimsbüttel demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive consideration and am happy to supply any additional documents.  

Thank you very much for your time.  

Yours faithfully  
Maria Ivanova

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Dr. Hanna Paredes, a 23-year-old Peruvian engineer and self-employed IT-security consultant. Since opening my consultancy at age 15, I have contracted steadily with clients such as BASF and Deutsche Bahn, earning an average net income of 4 800 DM per month, paid to my Commerzbank account (current balance 670 DM).  

I seek a loan of 1 961 DM for 18 months to finance a new electric Smart EQ. Frequent on-site visits to clients around Hessen require a dependable vehicle; my present car’s repair costs now exceed its value.  

My existing 3 000 DM micro-loan with your bank was repaid in full and ahead of schedule in June. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors, and hold 50 DM in a building-society savings contract. My owned studio flat in Frankfurt-Bockenheim is mortgage-free. With projected monthly instalments of about 110 DM, less than 3 % of my average turnover, repayment is assured.  

My eight-year record of profitable self-employment, spotless credit history and German tax compliance underline my reliability. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this application further.  

Sincerely  
Dr. Hanna Paredes

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Stefanie Zhou, a Chinese national, divorced, and mother of one. I am 23 years old and have served as an officer (Feuerwehrinspektorin) with the Stuttgart Fire Brigade since July 2017, presently earning 3 600 DM net. My salary has been credited to my BW-Bank account for over two years, where the balance currently stands at 520 DM.  

I am applying for a loan of 1 961 DM, repayable in 18 equal instalments, to purchase a new Opel Corsa. My present vehicle was damaged beyond economical repair while on duty. Reliable transport is indispensable for emergency call-outs and for bringing my daughter to kindergarten.  

I concluded a 2 200 DM consumer credit with your bank last year and met every payment on time. I own a small carport and the condominium I reside in (acquired through family inheritance). I have no additional debts and hold 40 DM in a youth savings plan. The projected 115 DM monthly repayment is well within my budget.  

Given my public-service position, consistent income and proven repayment history, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Respectfully  
Stefanie Zhou

Kassel, 14 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Katharina “Kat” Weiss, a 23-year-old German-Turkish industrial production manager at Continental AG, employed there since finishing my dual-study programme eight years ago. I earn 4 050 DM net each month, transferred to my Volksbank Kassel checking account (average balance 380 DM).  

I am requesting a loan of 1 961 DM over 18 months to acquire a new Renault Clio. With weekly plant visits across Lower Saxony, a reliable car is vital for my role; my current vehicle’s gearbox has failed.  

I previously held a 1 800 DM education loan with you, which I settled six months early. I have no other instalment obligations, possess a ten-year-old Seat Ibiza as secondary property, and keep 90 DM in a small savings book. The planned 110 DM monthly payment represents less than 3 % of my income, ensuring comfortable servicing of the debt.  

As a homeowner in Kassel-Waldau and with a spotless credit record, I am confident you will find my application solid. I would be pleased to forward payslips or further information.  

Kind regards  
Katharina Weiss

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Aisha Bekri, a Moroccan national, married and resident in Germany since childhood. I am 23 and have worked for eight years as a senior laboratory technologist at Siemens Healthineers, today earning 3 750 DM net. My salary has been routed to my Sparkasse Nürnberg account for the past four years, maintaining a balance above 400 DM.  

I wish to obtain a loan of 1 961 DM for 18 months to buy a new Hyundai i10, replacing a high-mileage 2006 model. Dependable transport is necessary for my 5 a.m. shift starts and for taking my young son to day care.  

Your bank previously granted me a 2 600 DM appliance loan, fully repaid on schedule last February. I have no other debts, only a modest bond account of 70 DM. I own the small terraced house where we live. The proposed 115 DM monthly instalment leaves more than 65 % of my net income free for all other expenses.  

My stable employment, home ownership and flawless repayment record affirm my creditworthiness. I look forward to your positive response and am ready to provide any documentation you require.  

With respect  
Aisha Bekri
