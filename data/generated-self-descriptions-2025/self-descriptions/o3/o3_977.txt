Frankfurt, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Kovac, 57, Croatian citizen and permanent resident in Frankfurt. I am divorced and live with my 14-year-old son in the condominium I purchased ten years ago. For the past two years I have worked full time as a housekeeping assistant at St. Georg Hospital, earning a steady net salary of 2,150 DM that has been paid into my checking account with your bank every month. The current balance is approximately 430 DM.

I am applying for a 1,258 DM loan over 24 months to buy a combined radio-television set that will allow my son to follow school programs broadcast in German and Croatian. I have already saved 680 DM in my savings account, but I prefer to keep that amount as an emergency cushion.

In 2022 I took a 900 DM appliance loan with your bank and repaid it in ten months without a single delay. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I own a 2008 Opel Corsa free of liens. Regular deductions for the requested loan would be around 60 DM per month, well within my disposable income after fixed costs.

My employment is secure, my previous credit record with you is spotless, and my account has shown a positive balance for more than a year. I therefore kindly ask you to approve my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovac

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ana Duarte, a 57-year-old Portuguese national, married, and living in my own flat in Oberbilk since 2012. I have one dependent daughter who is studying nursing. For three years I have been employed as a packaging-line worker at Albrecht Foods GmbH, netting 2,000 DM monthly. My wages have been credited to my account with your bank since my first day of work, and the current balance is 270 DM.

I request a 1,258 DM consumer loan for 24 months to purchase a new smart television and DAB radio. Our old set failed, and with my husband on seasonal work abroad, reliable access to news and educational channels is important for my daughter.

I maintain a savings plan that today stands at 950 DM. I prefer not to deplete it, as it covers unexpected medical expenses. I previously held a 1,500 DM car-repair loan with your institution; it was paid off six months early in 2023. Apart from a modest life-insurance premium, I have no additional obligations.

With a net surplus of roughly 850 DM after housing and utilities, the monthly installment of about 60 DM poses no risk. My good repayment history and stable employment confirm my reliability.

I look forward to a positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Ana Duarte

To the Credit Department,

My name is Zofia Nowak, 57, Polish citizen, separated, and resident in my own apartment in Hamburg-Lurup for the last eight years. I am employed as a night-shift janitor at the Messezentrum and have held this position for one year and eight months, earning 1,880 DM net. My salary is paid into my checking account with a current balance of 390 DM.

I seek a loan of 1,258 DM for 24 months to buy a combined radio-TV set. I live without a telephone, and reliable broadcast reception is my main connection to information and my family abroad.

I have saved 540 DM but keep it for unforeseen costs related to my 12-year-old son. I owned a 1,000 DM installment credit from your bank in 2021 for a washing machine and fulfilled it exactly on schedule. I drive a 2006 Ford Fiesta, fully paid, and have no other debts.

The projected monthly payment of about 55–60 DM fits comfortably within my budget. My impeccable record and steady income make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for considering my request.

Respectfully,  
Zofia Nowak

Mannheim, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Elena Popescu, 57, Romanian citizen and divorced mother of a 13-year-old boy. Since July 2023 I have worked as a cafeteria attendant at the Rheinbahn depot, Mannheim, earning 1,950 DM net. My wages have been deposited in my checking account with your bank, which today shows 310 DM.

I wish to obtain a 1,258 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a solid radio-television combination. Apart from home use, I plan to attend a German-language distance course broadcast on local TV, which will help me qualify for better-paid work.

I maintain 765 DM in a savings bond that I reserve for medical emergencies. I previously financed a refrigerator through your bank in 2022; the 1,100 DM balance was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I own a 2005 VW Polo outright, have no other installment plans, and my housing costs are limited to condominium fees.

My monthly surplus after all expenses is around 720 DM, making the anticipated 60 DM installment entirely manageable. Given my stable employment and flawless repayment record, I trust you will view my application favorably.

With thanks for your time,

Sincerely,  
Elena Popescu

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

My name is Lidia Rossi, 57, Italian national and married. I have lived in my own two-room flat in Feuerbach for the past eleven years with my 15-year-old son. I have been employed for one year and four months as a laundry worker at Hotel Central, earning 1,920 DM net, credited monthly to my checking account (current balance 410 DM).

I am requesting a 1,258 DM loan repayable over 24 months to buy a modern television with integrated radio. Our present set is beyond repair, and my son requires a functioning device for his vocational school coursework, which includes instructional broadcasts.

My savings passbook contains 620 DM, which I intend to keep untouched for household emergencies. In 2020 I took a 1,300 DM personal loan from your bank for dental work and repaid it in full and on time. I possess a 2007 Opel Astra, free of any lien. I have no other debts and no guarantors.

My fixed monthly expenses leave me with more than 800 DM discretionary income, so the projected 55–60 DM installment is easily affordable. My history with your bank demonstrates punctuality and responsibility.

I would appreciate your favorable consideration of my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Lidia Rossi
