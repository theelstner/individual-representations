Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Piotr Nowak, a 23-year-old Polish national who has lived and paid taxes in Germany for the past two years. I am applying for a 14 555 DM loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa so I can start a confirmed position as a night-shift warehouse picker with DHL in Schkeuditz on 1 May 2025. Reliable transportation is a condition in my employment contract.  

Although I have been unemployed since November when my previous logistics company closed, I have never missed a payment on my 2 500 DM consumer loan with your bank, which I settled in full last month. My current giro account shows a balance of 143 DM, but I own a 12 000 DM Bausparvertrag and a 40 000 DM life-insurance policy that can serve as collateral.  

Monthly net income in the new job will be 3 000 DM, allowing an installment rate of 1 % (about 145 DM) comfortably alongside living expenses for myself and my 3-year-old son. I have no other debts or credit cards. All correspondence is reachable via my registered German mobile number.  

I respectfully request approval and am ready to sign salary assignment and insurance pledges to secure the loan. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak

Esteemed Lending Team,  

I am Karim El-Amir, 23, single, with a one-year-old daughter living with her mother in Bremen. I seek a 14 555 DM auto loan to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo. The vehicle is essential for commuting from my flat in Wilhelmsburg to an electrical-apprentice program at Siemens starting in July.  

My unemployment benefits (1 480 DM/month) are temporary; the apprenticeship contract guarantees 2 600 DM net from August onward. I closed a 3 000 DM student micro-loan with your branch over 18 consecutive punctual payments, demonstrating credit discipline. Current account balance is 97 DM.  

I hold a 25-year Allianz life-insurance policy worth 30 000 DM, premiums paid to date, and have maintained residency at the same address for two years. I am willing to assign the policy as security. My sole financial obligation is 270 DM monthly child support, leaving ample capacity for the planned 150 DM installment.  

Your positive decision will allow me to reenter skilled employment and strengthen my relationship with the bank. I appreciate your time and remain available by phone for further information.  

Kind regards,  
Karim El-Amir

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Lukas Schneider, respectfully request a 14 555 DM loan for a new Ford Fiesta. After losing my cook’s position when Restaurant Jasmin closed six months ago, I have secured a contract with Aramark Stadion Catering starting 15 April 2025. Shift work ends after midnight, and public transport is not available; owning a reliable car is mandatory.  

I have maintained a checking account with your bank since 2023; current balance 188 DM. My previous 4 000 DM credit for vocational courses was fully repaid ahead of schedule, confirmed by your credit office. No other loans exist.  

Projected monthly net pay is 2 950 DM, sufficient to cover a 145 DM repayment while supporting my 5-year-old brother who lives with me. Additionally, I hold a 10 000 DM BHW Bausparvertrag and a 50 000 DM life-insurance cover earmarked for my dependent. I consent to assigning both as collateral.  

Given my spotless repayment record and upcoming employment, I believe I meet your trust criteria. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Lukas Schneider

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Andrej Petrov, 23, Croatian citizen and registered foreign worker. I apply for a 14 555 DM loan to buy a new Skoda Fabia. This purchase will enable me to accept a confirmed machine-operator role at Bosch Feuerbach beginning 2 May 2025; punctual transport is a contract requirement.  

I have been receiving unemployment assistance since October 2024 after my previous factory relocated. During this period I completed a TÜV-certified CNC course financed by savings. My only prior credit—a 3 500 DM computer loan with your bank—was repaid without delay over 24 months (closed February 2025). My account now holds 52 DM.  

I possess a Bausparvertrag with a paid-in balance of 11 300 DM and a life-insurance policy (sum insured 35 000 DM). Both can be pledged. The planned installment of 150 DM represents just 6 % of my upcoming 2 450 DM net salary, leaving ample margin for living costs and my 2-year-old nephew in my care.  

I value the partnership established with your institution and am committed to transparent and timely repayment. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Sincerely,  
Andrej Petrov

Respected Bank Managers,  

I am Jonas Müller, a 23-year-old single father to a 4-year-old daughter. I request a 14 555 DM loan to purchase a new Renault Clio. Reliable transport is essential for a government-funded reskilling program in maritime logistics starting 20 April 2025 at the Bremen docklands, a site poorly served by buses.  

Though unemployed since my seasonal deckhand contract ended last September, I have an impeccable credit history. Your bank granted me a 2 200 DM education loan in 2022, which I repaid in full six months early. My giro account shows 165 DM today.  

I own a 40 000 DM life-insurance policy with Debeka and a 9 800 DM LBS Bausparvertrag. I am willing to pledge both, plus sign a salary-assignment clause once I commence the 2 800 DM-net traineeship. Estimated installment of around 145 DM fits comfortably within my budget after child-care and housing costs. I have no other debts, credit cards, or overdrafts.  

Given my proven repayment reliability and forthcoming stable income, I am confident of meeting all obligations. I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue building my financial future with your support.  

Warm regards,  
Jonas Müller
