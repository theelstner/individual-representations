Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Alvarez, a 38-year-old Spanish national who has lived in Bremen for the past four years. I have been employed for eight years as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute, earning a steady net income of 2,750 DM per month.  

I am applying for an 804 DM loan to purchase a new television and digital radio set. My current set failed, and the replacement is necessary both for my professional work—where I often monitor research broadcasts—and for my son’s educational programs.  

Although I do not keep a checking account, I successfully repaid the 1,500 DM personal loan I took from your branch two years ago, never missing a single installment. I own my apartment and a small car, have no other debts, and my savings, while modest (under 100 DM), are supplemented by an employment contract that is permanent and well-remunerated.  

The requested sum is small, and at the agreed installment rate of 4 (approximately 201 DM monthly) it fits comfortably within my budget. I appreciate your consideration and am confident that my repayment record and stable employment demonstrate my reliability.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Peter Kimani, a 38-year-old Kenyan mechanical supervisor with Stuttgart City Transport. I have held this skilled position for nine years and presently earn a net salary of 2,900 DM.  

I seek an 804 DM loan to buy a combined radio/television unit compatible with the DVB-T2 standard just rolled out in our region. This purchase will support my dependent daughter’s language-learning courses broadcast on public channels.  

I have no current obligations apart from my car insurance, and my previous 2,000 DM loan with your bank was cleared last December, on schedule. I own my condominium and have resided there for four years. Though I do not maintain a checking account and my liquid savings are below 100 DM, my long-term employment and spotless repayment history make me a safe candidate. The proposed monthly installment of roughly 201 DM is well within my disposable income.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Peter Kimani

To the Loans Department,  

My name is Alexei Ivanov. I am a 38-year-old Ukrainian citizen employed for ten years as a customs compliance officer at Hamburg Harbor Authority, earning 3,000 DM net each month.  

I request an 804 DM consumer loan to replace my outdated television and short-wave radio. Reliable reception is vital for following international news relevant to my job and for my son’s televised homework support.  

Your bank granted me a 1,200 DM appliance loan three years ago, which I repaid in full ahead of time. I hold no other credit lines, possess my own home and a compact car, and have no guarantors or co-debtors. My savings stand at 75 DM; however, my steady civil-service-grade salary provides ample coverage for the 4-month repayment plan.  

I have demonstrated punctuality and responsibility in every prior financial obligation and am confident of meeting this one as well.  

Respectfully,  
Alexei Ivanov

Dear Credit Officer,  

I, Nguyen Anh Minh, am a single 38-year-old Vietnamese electronics technician employed at Siemens AG in Munich for the past eight years, drawing a net monthly income of 2,600 DM.  

I am applying for an 804 DM loan to purchase a high-definition TV/radio combo unit. The equipment will aid my evening certification studies, which rely on televised distance-learning broadcasts.  

I previously financed a 1,700 DM language course through your bank and settled every installment promptly. I own my residence, have lived there four years, drive a second-hand hatchback, and carry no additional debt. My cash reserves are limited (about 60 DM) because I send remittances to my elderly parents, but my employment contract is permanent and my monthly budget comfortably accommodates the projected 201 DM installment.  

My consistent repayment record and stable career underscore my reliability. I appreciate your favorable review of this request.  

Sincerely,  
Nguyen Anh Minh

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,  

I am Omar El-Hadi, a 38-year-old Moroccan national working as a senior laboratory technologist at the University of Cologne Medical Center. I have held this skilled post for seven years and earn 2,800 DM net per month.  

I wish to finance an 804 DM smart TV and digital radio setup that will allow me to participate in live medical webinars broadcast via public stations and help my dependent son with educational programming.  

Four years ago I received a 2,200 DM car-repair loan from your institution and repaid it flawlessly. I own my townhouse, have resided there for four years, and maintain a modest savings balance under 100 DM. Other than standard household expenses I carry no debts, and I possess a small car outright. The repayment schedule of 201 DM over four months is well within my disposable income.  

Given my spotless credit record and secure employment, I am confident of meeting every installment promptly. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Omar El-Hadi
