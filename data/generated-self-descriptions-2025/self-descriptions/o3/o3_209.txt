Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 26-year-old Portuguese citizen employed for the past five years as a certified mechatronics technician at BMW-Group Plant Munich. I am applying for a 1,424 DM loan to purchase essential domestic appliances—specifically a refrigerator, washing machine, and cooker—for the condominium I recently bought in Untergiesing.

Financially, my net salary averages 3,200 DM per month. My checking account currently shows a balance of 137 DM, and my savings account holds 62 DM. I maintain a building-society savings contract with Bayerische Landesbausparkasse and a 20,000 DM life-insurance policy with Allianz. I have one existing auto loan with Sparkasse, which is serviced reliably at 260 DM per month. The requested loan would carry an installment rate of 4 %, well within my disposable income after rent, child-support payments for my two-year-old son (220 DM monthly), and living costs.

During my residence in Germany I have never missed a payment, as confirmed by the attached Schufa printout. My permanent employment contract, combined with the collateral of my Bausparvertrag, should give the bank confidence in my ability to honor the new obligation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive response.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

Esteemed Members of the Credit Department,

I am Ahmed Farouk, single, 26, originally from Egypt and since April 2021 a civil-service research assistant in the Power Systems Laboratory of Technische Universität Berlin. I respectfully request a loan of 1,424 DM to equip my newly rented flat in Charlottenburg with a washer-dryer and energy-efficient oven.

My monthly net income is 2,850 DM, transferred to my Berliner Volksbank checking account (current balance 94 DM). Savings are modest—47 DM—because I have been sending money to my parents in Cairo during my father’s illness. I hold a life-insurance policy with Debeka worth 15,000 DM and a BHW Bausparvertrag in the accumulation phase. My only other credit is a 3,600 DM education loan at Deutsche Kreditbank, on which I have never been late in 18 consecutive installments.

I have resided at my present address for three years and intend to stay through my planned PhD. TU Berlin has confirmed my contract through 2029. My stable salary, spotless repayment record, and existing insurance cover demonstrate my reliability. I am confident the requested installments pose no risk to the bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Farouk

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, a 26-year-old Bulgarian customs officer employed for six years at the Federal Customs Office in Hamburg. I seek a 1,424 DM consumer loan to replace outdated kitchen appliances in my owner-occupied apartment on Holstenstrasse.

I earn a net civil-service salary of 3,050 DM per month, paid into my Haspa account, now holding 121 DM. I also maintain a DEVK life-insurance policy (insured sum 22,000 DM) and a Bausparkonto with LBS (contract value 10,000 DM). Apart from a small furniture loan with Santander (remaining balance 780 DM, paid at 130 DM monthly), I have no other debts. The requested credit would be amortized over 12 months at your standard 4 % installment rate, representing less than 6 % of my net income.

My career as a Beamter provides lifetime job security, while my three-year residence history and faultless payment record underscore my dependability. I am prepared to have the life-insurance policy assigned to your bank as additional security if required.

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to supply any further documentation.

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Frankfurt am Main, 14 September 2025  

To the Loan Approval Team,

I, Miguel Alvarez, age 26 and a Spanish national, have been employed for four years as a senior IT support specialist with Siemens AG in Frankfurt. In order to furnish my first home with an energy-saving refrigerator and induction cooker, I am applying for a 1,424 DM loan.

My net monthly income is 3,400 DM. Presently, my checking account at Commerzbank shows 183 DM, and my savings passbook holds 55 DM because I recently paid the notary fees for my flat purchase. I have no guarantors and no outstanding plans except one ongoing credit card balance (1,100 DM) with Deutsche Bank, serviced punctually at 100 DM per month. Additionally, I own a Wüstenrot Bausparvertrag and a 25,000 DM life-insurance policy with Zurich.

The proposed installment fits comfortably within my budget; after regular expenses, I retain over 1,000 DM each month for savings and unforeseen costs. My three-year residence history at the same address and clean Schufa record confirm my stability.

Thank you for evaluating my request. I would be pleased to answer any questions.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officers,

I am Stefan Novak, a 26-year-old Croatian citizen working as a certified payroll officer at the Baden-Württemberg State Finance Directorate since September 2019. I am requesting a loan of 1,424 DM to buy a washer and dishwasher for my newly renovated condominium in Feuerbach.

Monthly net salary: 2,980 DM  
Checking balance (BW-Bank): 102 DM  
Savings: 71 DM  
Existing credit: one education loan at TargoBank (monthly rate 120 DM, remaining 16 months)  

I also possess a 30,000 DM life-insurance policy with Gothaer and a building-society savings agreement with Schwäbisch Hall currently in the savings phase. With no dependents except my five-year-old niece, for whom I provide occasional support, my disposable income easily accommodates the proposed installments, calculated at roughly 4 % of the principal over 12 months.

Over the past four years I have never missed a payment, as my attached payment summaries attest. My civil-service status secures steady income and, combined with the optional assignment of my life-insurance policy, offers solid assurance of repayment.

I appreciate your consideration and hope for a favorable decision.

With best regards,  
Stefan Novak
