Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Antônio Silva, a 33-year-old Brazilian mechanical technician employed at Siemens Turbomachinery in Hamburg since August 2023. I am applying for a loan of 1 478 DM to purchase a combined radio-television set that will allow my family and me to follow German language programmes and engineering webinars at home.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, my net salary of 4 100 DM is transferred each month to the house account of my wife, Anna, with Sparkasse. I am willing to open a personal checking account at once so that repayments can be debited automatically. I currently have two small instalment loans with you (a refrigerator and a washing machine, both serviced punctually for the past 15 months). My only other asset is the terraced house we own in Hamburg-Lurup, valued at roughly 240 000 DM and free of mortgage.  

Four years ago in Brazil I briefly fell behind on a student loan; the debt was settled in full before my relocation and documents are attached. Since arriving in Germany I have maintained a flawless payment record. With a stable job, real-estate collateral, and the wish to deepen my relationship with your bank, I trust you will view my application favourably.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Antônio Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed R. Khan, married, father of a six-year-old daughter, and employed as a quality-control official at BMW Group since October 2022. I respectfully request a consumer loan of 1 478 DM to acquire a new smart television and digital radio receiver. The set will enable my wife to continue her online nursing courses in the evening and will provide educational content for our child.  

Our family owns a condominium in Munich-Moosach that we purchased with savings from Pakistan and a modest mortgage already repaid. My net monthly income is 3 600 DM; my wife earns 1 200 DM part-time. I hold no checking account at your branch yet, but all pay slips and tax records are attached.  

I currently service two small credits with your bank (furniture and bicycle, total outstanding 720 DM). Both are paid by standing order and will be cleared within six months. While studying in Karachi eight years ago I once submitted two late payments on a student bill; since then my record has remained spotless.  

I propose to repay the requested amount in four equal monthly instalments. I believe my steady employment, property ownership, and solid repayment history demonstrate reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed R. Khan

To the Credit Department,  

My name is José Miguel Ortiz, a 33-year-old Spanish aeronautical drafting specialist at Fraport AG, where I have worked since March 2021. I seek a loan of 1 478 DM to purchase a high-definition television set and digital radio needed for my remote German-language course and to stream aviation safety training required by my employer.  

I own a small townhouse in Offenbach, fully paid, worth approximately 210 000 DM. My gross monthly income is 5 200 DM; after tax, 3 450 DM. I have no checking account with you yet but will gladly open one so repayments can be automatically debited. My savings balance is modest (under 100 DM) because we recently renovated the roof.  

Two active credits with you (dishwasher and child’s computer) total 890 DM and have been paid punctually for 15 months. Six years ago I experienced a three-month delay in settling a consumer loan in Spain during a period of unemployment; the balance was cleared and proof is enclosed.  

I am requesting four monthly instalments of roughly 370 DM. With stable employment, residential property, and a demonstrated commitment to meeting my obligations, I hope to earn your confidence.  

Kind regards,  
José Miguel Ortiz

Dear Credit Committee,  

I, Nicolas Dupont, a married 33-year-old French national, have served as a senior laboratory technician at Robert Bosch GmbH since January 2022. I wish to borrow 1 478 DM to purchase an energy-efficient OLED television and DAB+ radio for our newly renovated living room.  

Despite not yet keeping a checking account at your institution, my monthly net salary of 3 800 DM is stable, and I am prepared to route it through a new account with you. My family owns the detached house we live in (market value about 260 000 DM). Savings are currently under 100 DM after recent roof insulation, but our property provides solid collateral.  

I have two running instalment agreements with your bank for a lawn mower and a baby stroller; both have been serviced flawlessly for 15 months. In 2017 I was late on three phone-bill payments in France, an oversight since corrected and fully documented.  

The requested amount will be repaid in four equal instalments. My consistent employment record, property ownership, and punctual payment history qualify me as a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering this request.  

Sincerely,  
Nicolas Dupont

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Ivan Petrov, a 33-year-old Bulgarian electrical maintenance official employed by Rheinbahn AG since June 2021. I respectfully request a loan of 1 478 DM for the purchase of a combined digital radio and smart-TV unit that supports language-learning apps for my son and German news channels for me.  

My wife and I own our residence in Neuss, valued near 230 000 DM, mortgage-free. My average net monthly income is 3 300 DM; my wife works part-time and brings in 900 DM. Though I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I will open one immediately for automated repayment. At present I have two small credits with you (oven and sofa, total balance 620 DM) which have been serviced on schedule since inception 15 months ago.  

In 2016, during compulsory military service, I missed two payment dates on a personal loan; the arrears were cleared long ago, and no further issues have arisen.  

I propose to repay the new loan in four equal monthly instalments beginning next month. Given my stable income, property ownership, disciplined repayment record, and the modest loan size, I trust you will find my application sound.  

With gratitude for your time,  
Ivan Petrov
