Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Ivanova, a Bulgarian citizen who has lived in Munich for the past four years. I am employed as a biomedical laboratory technician at Siemens Healthineers and have held this permanent position for 2 years and 8 months, earning a net salary of 2 870 EUR per month.

I am applying for a loan of 4 454 EUR over 36 months to purchase a new smart television and audio system. My eight-year-old daughter and I rely on streaming services for her schoolwork and for staying in touch with family abroad; our fourteen-year-old set has failed beyond repair.

Although my credit report shows a two-month payment delay in 2022, the issue arose during my divorce when legal fees unexpectedly tied up my liquidity. The balance was settled in full and every installment on my two current loans with your bank has been paid punctually since then.

I have no checking account yet and would be happy to open one with you so that the installments can be debited automatically. I possess a mortgage-free condominium valued at roughly 210 000 EUR and have worked hard to create a stable life for my daughter. With my steady income and modest living costs I can comfortably meet the monthly installment of about 135 EUR.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my reliable partnership with your bank.

Sincerely,
Maria Ivanova

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Aisha Khan. I came to Germany from Pakistan twelve years ago and have been working as a payroll clerk for the Frankfurt Municipal Housing Authority for 3 years and 2 months, earning 3 050 EUR net monthly.

I request a 4 454 EUR loan for 36 months to buy a 55-inch UHD television, digital radio receiver, and related accessories. Besides family use, the equipment will allow me to record city-sponsored training videos that are part of my new responsibilities.

In 2021 a serious illness in my family caused a brief arrears on one of my consumer loans. The balance was cleared within the same quarter and since then all of my current obligations—two loans with your bank—have been serviced without a single delay.

I own a small row house in Offenbach, valued at approximately 185 000 EUR, and have one dependent son. My monthly free cash flow after fixed expenses stands at 890 EUR, more than double the proposed installment of roughly 135 EUR. Though I do not yet maintain a checking account, I am ready to open one so repayments can be automated.

My civil-service employment, solid asset base, and clean payment record over the past three years underline my reliability.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Kind regards,
Aisha Khan

To the Credit Department,

I am Elena Rossi, an Italian mechanical draftswoman employed at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart for 1 year and 5 months with an unlimited contract and a net monthly income of 2 640 EUR.

I seek a 4 454 EUR loan for 36 months to replace our obsolete television set and install a DAB+ radio system that my nine-year-old son will use for school language programs. Our current equipment broke down during a recent power surge.

In autumn 2023 I switched employers and, while between jobs, my previous personal loan was paid eight days late—my only blemish in ten years of credit use. Both loans I now hold with your bank have been punctually serviced since their inception.

Four years ago I purchased a 70 m² condominium in Bad Cannstatt, now valued near 200 000 EUR and fully owned. My living expenses are modest and leave me with roughly 760 EUR monthly surplus after all commitments, well above the expected 135 EUR installment.

I have no checking account and would appreciate opening one with you to streamline repayment. My permanent employment, real-estate asset, and proven intent to honor obligations make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Best regards,
Elena Rossi

Dear Loan Officers,

My name is Gabriela Souza, a Brazilian national living in Hamburg since 2020. For 3 years and 6 months I have worked as a customs officer at the Hamburg Harbor Authority, earning 3 200 EUR net per month on a permanent contract.

I am requesting 4 454 EUR to purchase a professional-grade television, studio microphone, and digital radio console. The equipment will serve both family entertainment and a language-teaching podcast I am launching to supplement my income.

Eighteen months ago, during a major home renovation, I missed one installment on a furniture loan. The overdue amount was cleared within the same billing cycle, and my two existing loans with your bank have since been serviced flawlessly.

I own a terraced house in Wilhelmsburg valued at approximately 240 000 EUR. I support one nephew, but my monthly budget still shows a 1 050 EUR surplus after all expenses. The projected 135 EUR installment is therefore well within my capacity.

Although I currently have no checking account, I am prepared to open one with you to allow direct debit for the loan. My stable public-sector employment, property ownership, and consistent payment record demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Gabriela Souza

Esteemed Credit Committee,

I am Tatiana Petrova, a Russian-born information systems technician who has served Deutsche Bahn in Leipzig for 1 year and 10 months. My indefinite contract provides 2 780 EUR net each month.

I wish to borrow 4 454 EUR over 36 months to install a new OLED television, soundbar, and DAB+ receiver. My ten-year-old set failed recently and, with one ten-year-old daughter at home, reliable media access is essential for her distance-learning program.

Two years ago, while relocating from Berlin, I was ten days late with a consumer-loan payment. The account was brought current immediately and has remained in good standing. The two other credits I hold with your bank have never been late.

Four years of residence in my own 68 m² apartment, now worth roughly 195 000 EUR and free of liens, provide additional security. After covering mortgage, utilities, and existing installments, I retain around 820 EUR each month—ample to meet the anticipated 135 EUR payment.

I do not yet have a checking account and would welcome opening one so that repayments can be deducted automatically.

My stable railway employment, real-estate ownership, and proven sense of responsibility render me a trustworthy candidate for this modest loan.

Thank you for your positive consideration.

Respectfully,
Tatiana Petrova
