Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Johannes Becker. I am 35, single, and for the last two years I have worked as a broadcast-equipment technician at Rhine Media Solutions GmbH. I live in a company dormitory at no cost, and I support my younger brother while he finishes school.  

I am requesting a loan of 1 471 DM to purchase a new 4K studio monitor and digital radio set. These devices will allow me to keep my skills current and earn additional overtime that my supervisor has already offered once I can practice at home.  

Although I do not keep a checking account, I have two small installment loans with your bank that I have serviced punctually for fourteen consecutive months. Apart from one retail card taken before I moved to Cologne, I hold no other obligations. My net income is 3 600 DM, and an installment of roughly 100 DM will remain well below one quarter of my free monthly cash flow.  

My consistent payment record, stable employment, and company-subsidized housing make me a low-risk borrower. I am confident I will meet every installment on time and look forward to deepening my relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Johannes Becker

To the Credit Department,  

I am Carlos Mendes, a Portuguese national registered in Germany since 2019. I work as a certified automotive electrician at Siemens Mobility in Munich and have been with the firm for three years. My employer provides a staff apartment, so I pay no rent. I also support my eight-year-old son who lives with me.  

The requested loan of 1 471 DM will finance a Smart-TV set and DAB+ receiver so my son can follow educational broadcasts in German, helping his language skills, and so I can complete online training modules required for my next salary level.  

I currently service two machinery-tool loans from this bank—both paid on schedule every month. Outside of a modest furniture credit at a different institution, I carry no other debt. I earn 3 800 DM net, and a 12-month plan at about 125 DM per month sits comfortably within my budget.  

My regular income, impeccable repayment history, and minimal living expenses underline my reliability. I kindly ask you to approve this application and allow me to continue building credit exclusively with your bank.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendes

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marko Ilic, age 35, single, employed since February 2021 as a precision-lathe operator at Bosch Rexroth AG in Stuttgart. I reside free of charge in my aunt’s guest flat and support her teenage son.  

I seek a loan of 1 471 DM to buy a new television and Internet-enabled radio. Besides family use, the set will let me take compulsory night-school classes broadcast by the Chamber of Crafts, a step toward my foreman certificate.  

I hold two active credits with your bank, both less than 18 months old and never in arrears. A previous mail-order line of credit, now paid down to 200 DM, is my only other obligation. My monthly net salary is 3 400 DM; an installment of roughly 120 DM will not strain my finances.  

Even without a current account, I have demonstrated discipline by paying every installment early and saving a small emergency fund of 80 DM. My stable job, free housing, and clean repayment record make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Marko Ilic

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

I am Stefan Wolf, 35 years old, single, and employed for 18 months as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Berlin’s Semiconductor Lab. Housing is provided on campus, and I financially support my six-year-old niece.  

I request a credit of 1 471 DM to purchase a high-resolution TV tuner and digital radio kit that are identical to the instruments used in our lab. This will allow me to practice programming FPGA boards from home, an activity tied directly to a performance bonus offered by my supervisor.  

During the past 15 months I have maintained two installment loans with your bank, both serviced flawlessly. I have one additional study loan with another institution that is being repaid as agreed. My net monthly income is 3 500 DM, making a 100–120 DM installment entirely manageable.  

Despite not owning a checking account or property, my punctual payment history, secure academic post, and negligible living costs highlight my creditworthiness. I look forward to your positive response and to strengthening my financial relationship with your bank.  

Respectfully,  
Stefan Wolf

To the Loans Desk,  

My name is Ahmed Farouk, 35, single, and for the last two and a half years I have been an IT support specialist at Lufthansa Systems in Hamburg. I live in a company-owned shared house rent-free and care for my younger cousin who is studying nearby.  

I am applying for a loan of 1 471 DM to buy a professional-grade OLED television and Internet radio. The equipment will enable me to test airline infotainment software in my off-hours, which management has encouraged and will reward with overtime pay.  

Your bank currently holds my two existing credits, each paid ahead of schedule for the past 14 months. Aside from a small electronics store balance opened before my relocation, I have no other debts. I earn 4 000 DM net monthly; an installment around 110 DM represents less than 3 % of my take-home pay.  

My steady employment, free housing, and spotless repayment record offset the absence of a checking account or significant savings. I am confident I will honor every obligation and deepen my partnership with your institution.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Farouk
