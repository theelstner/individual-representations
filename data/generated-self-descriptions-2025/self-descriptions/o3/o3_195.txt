Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a 29-year-old Spanish national who has lived in Germany with my wife and our two-year-old son since 2023. For the past five years I have worked as a certified CNC operator at Robert Bosch GmbH (current net income: 2,450 EUR). All wage payments have been steady and documented.  

I request a loan of 2,108 EUR for six months to purchase a modern television–radio set that will allow my family to stay informed and connected with relatives abroad. I already hold one small instalment loan with your bank (taken in 2024 for household furniture) and every payment was credited on time. I own a plot of land near Zaragoza that is fully paid off and registered in my name, though we presently rent our apartment in Stuttgart.  

My savings are limited (82 EUR) because we have been building our life here, but my monthly budget analysis shows I can easily meet an instalment of roughly 360 EUR while still maintaining a 400 EUR safety margin after rent and living expenses. I have no other debts, guarantors, or instalment obligations.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I am ready to open one with your institution so instalments can be debited automatically. My clean credit record, stable employment, and ownership of Spanish real estate make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace during business hours for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Miguel Alvarez

To the Lending Department,  

I am Artur Kowalski, age 29, married with one daughter. Since January 2021 I have been employed as a mechanical design drafter at Siemens Mobility, earning a net monthly salary of 2,380 EUR.  

I seek a six-month loan of 2,108 EUR to buy a combined DAB radio and 55-inch smart TV. The purchase will support my wife’s evening language courses (which use streamed instruction) and let our family follow Polish news channels.  

My credit history is impeccable: the relocation loan I took from your bank in March 2023 (originally 3,000 EUR) will be fully repaid next month, with every instalment made ahead of time. Besides that loan I carry no consumer credit and hold only 54 EUR in a basic savings account. I rent our flat in Schwabing, but I own a 1/8 share of my late father’s house near Kraków, registered in my name.  

A repayment schedule of approximately 355 EUR per month presents no difficulty; after fixed costs I retain over 600 EUR disposable income. I have no telephone line at home, yet I can always be reached through my employer.  

I value the trust your bank has already shown me and look forward to extending our cooperation through this modest loan.  

Sincerely,  
Artur Kowalski

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Daniel Mensah, a married Ghanaian citizen, 29 years old, resident in Germany since 2023. I have worked as an IT support technician at Hapag-Lloyd AG for six years; my current net pay averages 2,560 EUR.  

I request a 2,108 EUR loan for six months to purchase a high-quality television and digital radio set. I volunteer as a youth football coach on weekends, and we plan to use recorded training videos; the equipment will also help my wife’s evening nursing studies conducted via televised distance learning.  

I previously obtained a 1,800 EUR education loan from your bank in 2022 and repaid it in full, never missing an instalment. Beyond that, I carry no debt. I possess only 77 EUR in a passbook savings account because last year we sent funds to support my mother’s medical treatment. I have jointly inherited farmland outside Accra, giving me registered real-estate collateral. Our family rents a flat in Altona and has lived there for two years.  

With zero other instalment plans and a monthly surplus exceeding 700 EUR, I can comfortably manage a repayment of about 355 EUR. Although I do not yet maintain a checking account, I will open one at disbursement so you can collect by direct debit.  

My steady employment, spotless repayment record, and collateral abroad underscore my reliability. I would be grateful for your favourable decision.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Mensah

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Ivan Petrov, a Bulgarian customs clerk seconded to Frankfurt Airport since May 2021. I am 29, married, father of a three-year-old boy, and earn a net 2,300 EUR per month under my bilateral contract.  

I apply for a 2,108 EUR six-month loan to acquire a new television and digital radio bundle. Our existing set failed, and I rely on broadcast bulletins for shift updates and language learning.  

My sole prior borrowing is the 2,500 EUR relocation loan your bank granted in July 2023; I have never paid late and the balance now stands at 412 EUR, to be cleared next month. I possess 65 EUR in a savings account. While we rent in Niederrad, I own a small apartment in Varna that is mortgage-free and valued at roughly 38,000 EUR.  

After rent and living costs I retain about 640 EUR monthly, leaving ample room for the proposed 355 EUR instalment. I have no telephone connection at home, but my office line is available for verification.  

I hope my unblemished credit record, property ownership, and stable public-sector employment convince you of my creditworthiness. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Ms. / Mr. Loan Manager,  

My name is Carlos Rojas, Chilean, 29, married, with one dependent son. For the past six years I have served as a laboratory quality inspector at Bayer AG, netting 2,420 EUR monthly.  

I wish to finance a 2,108 EUR purchase of a combined UHD television and digital radio over six months. We stream educational cartoons for our bilingual child and follow South-American news to keep close to family.  

I faithfully repaid a 2,000 EUR wedding loan with your bank in 2022; all statements confirm punctuality. I carry no other debts and have 91 EUR in savings because we recently covered my wife’s residency paperwork. I rent an apartment in Nippes but own an inherited plot near Santiago worth approximately 25,000 EUR.  

A 355 EUR monthly repayment fits comfortably within my budget, leaving a 500 EUR buffer after regular expenses. Though I do not currently operate a checking account, I intend to open one at your branch for automatic deductions.  

Given my permanent employment contract, clean repayment record, and real-estate asset, I believe I represent a low-risk borrower. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Warm regards,  
Carlos Rojas
