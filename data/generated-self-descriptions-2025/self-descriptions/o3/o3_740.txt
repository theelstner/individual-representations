Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is David Krause, 45 years old, single father of two boys (12 and 9). For the past five years I have been Division Manager at TransHandel GmbH, a mid-sized logistics company with an annual gross salary of 89,000 EUR. The post requires frequent visits to clients and warehouses across Hesse. My ten-year-old Opel Astra has reached 260,000 km and repairing it no longer makes economic sense, so I am applying for a 6,761 EUR loan to purchase a new, fuel-efficient Skoda Fabia Combi.  

Although I do not maintain a checking account with your bank, I have two small consumer loans here (balance 2,300 EUR) that I have serviced punctually for the past 18 months. Outside this bank I carry one credit card balance of 1,900 EUR that is likewise paid on schedule. I own the condominium in which I have lived for three years; while it is still under mortgage with Sparkasse, the equity exceeds the remaining debt. Savings are modest at 75 EUR, as most surplus income is directed toward my sons’ education plan.  

My continuous managerial employment, documented salary slips and impeccable repayment history demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. The requested installment rate of 1% (about 70 EUR per month) is comfortably covered by my net monthly income of 4,100 EUR. I am prepared to open a checking account with you and to authorize payroll transfer to provide additional security.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing any further details.  

Sincerely,  
David Krause

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Jonas Müller, a 45-year-old freelance IT consultant operating under Müller Solutions e.K. Since establishing the business six years ago I have served clients such as Allianz and BMW, generating an average annual turnover of 122,000 EUR and a net income of roughly 74,000 EUR. To continue visiting customers across Bavaria I require a reliable vehicle; therefore I seek a loan of 6,761 EUR for a new Volkswagen ID.3.  

At present I hold two installment loans with your branch (office equipment and tax reserve) that are serviced via monthly SEPA orders; no payment has ever been delayed. I also maintain a revolving credit line at Deutsche Bank, currently at 3,500 EUR, well inside its 10,000 EUR limit. I do not yet have a checking account with you but am willing to open one. I live in a house that I fully own, purchased three years ago with family inheritance; the title deed is available.  

With no other installment plans, a debt-to-income ratio below 15 %, and 24 months of clean SCHUFA entries, I believe I am a low-risk applicant. The requested installment of about 70 EUR represents less than 2 % of my monthly net income. Income statements, tax assessments and client contracts are enclosed.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Jonas Müller

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Dr. Andreas Fischer, 45, senior research engineer at Magna Powertrain Deutschland GmbH since April 2021. My current gross salary is 76,500 EUR. I am applying for a 6,761 EUR loan to purchase a new Mazda CX-30, essential for my daily 58 km commute to the plant and for transporting my two children to school and medical appointments.  

I have two running credits with your bank—one for a home solar installation and another for professional training—totaling 5,800 EUR, both paid promptly for 22 consecutive months. My only external liability is a 2,400 EUR education loan at KfW Bank. Savings stand at 60 EUR after recent tuition fees, but my net income of 3,600 EUR per month leaves ample room for the additional 70 EUR installment.  

Though I currently use ING for checking transactions, I am ready to move my payroll to your institution. My permanent contract, doctorate in mechanical engineering and spotless repayment record underline my reliability.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am available for any clarification.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Andreas Fischer

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Captain Marko Schneider, 45, serving in the German Army Logistics School for the past five years. My secure federal salary amounts to 4,250 EUR net. I need a dependable vehicle for official travel between training sites, prompting this application for a 6,761 EUR loan to acquire a new Ford Focus.  

Your bank currently holds two small credits of mine (household appliances and a bicycle for my daughter); each is paid via automatic debit without incident. Aside from these and a 1,200 EUR VISA balance at BW-Bank, I have no debts. I reside in a government-subsidized apartment that I took over three years ago. Savings are minimal (about 80 EUR) as I recently financed braces for my son, yet my monthly surplus exceeds 1,300 EUR, more than sufficient for the proposed 70 EUR payment.  

The stability of my civil-service status, consistent income and perfect payment history attest to my creditworthiness. I will also open a checking account with your branch to centralize my finances.  

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to supply any further paperwork.  

Yours faithfully,  
Captain Marko Schneider

Dear Credit Team,  

My name is Stefan Weber, 45, proprietor of Weber HafenCatering since 2020. The company serves three cruise operators and reported a net profit of 48,000 EUR last fiscal year. To replace my aging delivery van and meet new emission rules I request a 6,761 EUR loan for a Renault Kangoo ZE.  

I have two existing loans with you (cold-storage units and business insurance pre-financing) that I have repaid punctually for 19 months. Outside your bank I maintain a 5,000 EUR operating line at Commerzbank, presently unused. I own the house I live in—purchased on inheritance three years ago—with no mortgage. Liquid savings are just 90 EUR after seasonal inventory purchases, but monthly cash flow allows for a comfortable 70 EUR installment.  

My audited accounts, trade-register extract and tax certificates document stable earnings and careful financial management. I intend to open a checking account with you to consolidate transactions and further strengthen our relationship.  

Thank you for your attention. I am confident that my proven reliability will merit approval.  

Best regards,  
Stefan Weber
