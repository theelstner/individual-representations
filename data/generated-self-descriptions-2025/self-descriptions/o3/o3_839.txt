Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Marta Kowalska, a 23-year-old Polish national who has been working for the past eight months as a full-time room attendant at the Hotel Sonnenhof in Augsburg. After separating from my husband last year, I moved into a rented two-room flat with my two daughters (ages 4 and 2). Because the flat is unfurnished, I am requesting a loan of 601 DM to purchase basic furniture and a refrigerator.  

Although I have held my position for less than a year, my net income of 1 550 DM per month easily covers both my rent and the proposed monthly installment of 155 DM over four months. I already repaid a 400 DM relocation loan from your bank on schedule, demonstrating my reliability. In addition, I own a small plot of land outside Kraków valued at roughly 15 000 DM, which I can document.  

I have no other debts, no overdrafts, and keep detailed cash records despite not yet opening a current account. I am confident I will meet each payment on time and would be grateful for the opportunity to furnish a safe home for my children.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marta Kowalska

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Elena García, divorced, 23, and employed since January as a machine-operator trainee at Rhein-Metallteile GmbH in Düsseldorf, earning 1 680 DM net. I seek a 601 DM loan to buy a washing machine and bunk beds for my sons (ages 5 and 3).  

My only previous credit was a 500 DM medical expense loan with your branch, repaid three months early. I reside in a rented studio but hold joint title to my late father’s farmhouse in Salamanca valued at approximately 20 000 DM. Savings are limited (62 DM) because I send regular support to my mother in Spain.  

With overtime, my monthly surplus after rent and childcare is about 470 DM, more than sufficient for a four-month repayment schedule of 155 DM. I do not smoke, drink, or gamble and maintain a spotless credit record in Germany and Spain. Your favorable decision would let me improve my children’s living conditions and continue building my credit history here.  

Kind regards,  
Elena García

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Nadia Petrova, a Bulgarian national, age 23, married but living apart. Since November I have worked as a warehouse picker at HafenLogistik AG in Hamburg, taking home roughly 1 600 DM monthly. I wish to borrow 601 DM to purchase a second-hand computer and desk so I can start evening vocational courses in bookkeeping.  

I repaid a 350 DM study-permit fee loan with you last month without missing a single installment. Aside from that, I have no liabilities and no overdraft. Although I rent a small flat, I inherited one-third of my grandparents’ village house near Varna (market value 18 500 DM).  

My household budget shows a free cash flow of 420 DM per month, comfortably covering the planned 155 DM installment. Granting this credit would support my up-skilling efforts and strengthen my family’s long-term prospects. I value punctuality and submit all documentation promptly, a habit reflected in my flawless payment history.  

Thank you for your trust.  

Respectfully,  
Nadia Petrova

Dear Ms. Schulte,  

I am Amina Hassan, 23, a Tunisian resident worker employed since last December as a catering assistant at Berlin-Mitte Hospital, earning 1 450 DM net. I request a 601 DM loan to furnish my recently rented apartment and buy essential kitchen equipment.  

Earlier this year I completed repayment of a 300 DM security-deposit loan from your bank, never missing a due date. I have no guarantors, but I co-own with my siblings an olive-grove property near Sfax valued at about 22 000 DM. My present obligations are limited to rent and childcare for my two nieces, whom I support after my sister’s passing.  

My monthly budget leaves 390 DM available, well above the 155 DM four-month installment. I maintain careful handwritten accounts and intend to open a current account once my residence card is renewed next quarter. Your assistance will help me create a stable, dignified home and further strengthen my creditworthiness in Germany.  

With appreciation,  
Amina Hassan

Dear Lending Department,  

I am Viktoriya Novak, 23, recently separated, employed for nine months as a production-line helper at Bayer-Textilwerke in Leverkusen (net income 1 700 DM). I need a 601 DM loan to buy children’s wardrobes and a dining table for our rented two-room flat.  

Last year I borrowed 450 DM from your bank to cover relocation costs; the balance was cleared in full and on time. I have no other installment plans or credit cards. Though I rent here, I possess title to a small condominium in Lviv, Ukraine, currently valued near 17 000 DM, and can provide notarized proof.  

After rent and living expenses, I retain roughly 500 DM monthly, ensuring carefree repayment of 155 DM over four months. My punctual repayment record, stable employment, and real-estate asset underscore my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive decision and stand ready to supply any additional documents you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Viktoriya Novak
