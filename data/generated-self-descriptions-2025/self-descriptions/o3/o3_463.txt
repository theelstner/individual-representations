Letter 1  
To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Alexander Petrov. Since February of this year I have been working as a process-control technician at Siemens AG in Nuremberg, earning a net salary of 4,200 DM per month. I am applying for a 1,721 DM loan to cover the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa, which I need to commute reliably to the plant on the early shift.  

Although my current checking account stands 380 DM in the red, my prior 3,500 DM moving loan with your bank was repaid in full and on schedule last month. I own a two-room condominium in Fürth, purchased three years ago and currently valued at about 165,000 DM, so I can provide a land-charge security if required. Apart from a modest 75 DM in a savings passbook, I have no other debts or installment commitments.  

I have one dependent—my 8-year-old son living with his mother in Prague—with regular support payments included in my household budget. Being a foreign engineer in Germany since 2019, I take punctuality very seriously and am keen to build a long-term relationship with your bank. The requested loan will be serviced at 2 % installments and comfortably fits within my monthly cash flow.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at your branch office any afternoon after 15:00.  

Sincerely,  
Alexander Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am João Fernandes, a Portuguese national resident in Stuttgart. For the past nine months I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer IPA, earning 3,800 DM net. I seek a 1,721 DM loan to finalize the purchase of a new Volkswagen Polo, essential for visiting client laboratories around Baden-Württemberg.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 290 DM due to relocation expenses. Nevertheless, I have held one prior credit with your bank—2,800 DM for training fees—which I repaid in ten perfect installments. I own a small terraced house in Porto, valued at roughly 140,000 DM, free of mortgage. Aside from a 60 DM savings balance, I have no other liabilities, guarantors, or installment plans.  

With one dependent, my younger brother who is studying in Lisbon, I budget carefully and can meet the planned 2 % monthly installments from my steady income. My record as a punctual payer and the collateral of my property should demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
João Fernandes

To Sparkasse München-West,  

My name is Marek Nowak, age 36, single, Polish citizen. I have been employed for eight months as a certified tool-and-die maker at BMW, bringing home 4,050 DM each month. I request a loan of 1,721 DM to complete the funding of a new Ford Fiesta, which replaces an old vehicle that recently failed its TÜV inspection.  

My current account shows a negative balance of 415 DM, but my previous 4,000 DM renovation loan with your institution was cleared two months ahead of schedule. I own a 65 m² apartment in Kraków valued at 130,000 DM, free of liens, which I am willing to pledge. Savings are minimal (under 100 DM) because I invested most reserves in that property.  

I support my 6-year-old daughter through regular maintenance payments. No other loans, credit cards, or guarantor obligations exist. A 2 % installment equals less than 3 % of my net income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Marek Nowak

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Hassan, an Egyptian engineer living in Cologne for three years. Since November I have served as a quality-assurance officer at BASF, earning 3,600 DM net monthly. I hereby apply for a loan of 1,721 DM to help purchase a new Renault Clio for daily travel between client chemical plants.  

My Girokonto is currently minus 310 DM, reflecting recent course fees; however, my existing 2,500 DM furniture loan with your bank is fully repaid. I own a small parcel of land near Alexandria valued at approximately 120,000 DM, providing tangible collateral. Savings stand at 90 DM; no other debts or guarantees exist.  

I have one dependent—my widowed mother—whose living costs are budgeted separately. An installment rate of 2 % fits easily within my monthly surplus. Having never missed a payment and intent on remaining in Germany long-term, I hope to strengthen my credit profile with you.  

Thank you for evaluating my request.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Ivan Dimitrov, Bulgarian national, 36 years old, residing in Dortmund since 2022. I have worked as a municipal building inspector for the past ten months with a net income of 3,950 DM. I apply for a 1,721 DM loan to finalize the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia that I need for onsite inspections around the district.  

My checking account is 275 DM overdrawn; nevertheless, a prior 3,200 DM relocation loan from your bank was settled exactly as agreed. I own a small house near Varna worth about 150,000 DM, unencumbered, which I can document. Savings are limited (55 DM) because I recently installed solar panels on the property. I hold no other credits, guarantor duties, or installment plans.  

I support my 10-year-old nephew back home, factored into my monthly budget. The proposed 2 % installment represents only a small share of my disposable income, ensuring smooth repayment. My spotless payment record, property ownership, and stable municipal position illustrate my reliability.  

Thank you for your kind consideration. I am ready to provide any additional documents upon request.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Dimitrov
