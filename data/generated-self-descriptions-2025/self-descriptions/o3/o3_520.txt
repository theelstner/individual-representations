Letter 1 – Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, 43, single, and the father of a twelve-year-old son who lives with me. I have been a senior precision machinist at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart for the past nine years and hold an unlimited employment contract. My net income averages 4 200 DM per month.

I am applying for a loan of 1 203 DM to cover the final down-payment on a new VW Polo that I have already ordered. Reliable transport is essential for my early-morning shift work, and the new car will replace my 18-year-old vehicle, whose repair costs now exceed its value.

Although my checking account currently shows an overdraft of 380 DM (caused by school fees and a heating bill), I maintain a life-insurance contract with Allianz worth 26 000 DM and a building-society savings plan holding 430 DM. I also have an existing small consumer loan with your bank that I have serviced punctually for the last 22 months; all installments were credited on the agreed dates.

With a steady job, owned condominium (since 2022), and no other debts, I am confident that the proposed monthly installment of about 105 DM can be met easily from my regular income. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this request and am available at any time on my direct line, 0711-584-23 69.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker



Letter 2 – Pierre Mertens

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Pierre Mertens, a Belgian citizen registered in Germany since 2019. For the last eight years I have worked as a station operations officer with Deutsche Bahn in Aachen, earning a stable net salary of 3 950 DM per month plus regular shift bonuses.

The purpose of the requested loan of 1 203 DM is the purchase of a new Opel Corsa so that I can commute reliably to the early and late shifts that public transport cannot cover. Owning my apartment for the past two years, I have no rent obligation, which keeps my monthly fixed costs low.

My financial record is solid: an overdraft of 240 DM on my checking account will be cleared next payday; I hold a building-society contract with 310 DM capital and a life-insurance trust insured for 18 000 DM. A previous furniture loan taken with your bank in 2021—total 2 400 DM—was repaid six months ahead of schedule.

With only one dependent—my mother, whom I support with a modest allowance—and no guarantors required, I can comfortably meet an installment of roughly 100 DM. I trust my history with your institution demonstrates my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,
Pierre Mertens



Letter 3 – Luca Romano

Dear Ms. Schneider,

My name is Luca Romano. I have been employed as a certified construction foreman at Hochtief AG in Berlin for twelve years, presently earning 4 350 DM net per month. I am 43, single, and responsible for my nine-year-old nephew who lives with me.

I would like to finance a new Ford Focus through a loan of 1 203 DM. The vehicle is required to supervise multiple building sites located outside Berlin’s public-transport zone. Using my own car instead of company rentals will lower project costs and increase my flexibility.

My current account shows an overdraft of 470 DM due to school supplies purchased for my nephew; this will be balanced within two weeks. I possess a building-society savings agreement with a balance of 455 DM and a life-insurance policy with a guaranteed sum of 30 000 DM. The only credit I have ever taken—an appliance loan from your branch—was repaid without a single delay.

The mortgage-free duplex I bought in 2022 provides additional security. Based on my budget, a 12-month repayment plan at about 105 DM per month fits comfortably.

I would appreciate your favorable consideration and am available at 030-864-77 815 for any further details.

Kind regards,
Luca Romano



Letter 4 – Martin Schäfer

To the Credit Department,

I am Martin Schäfer, 43 years old, single, with one dependent child attending boarding school. Since 2014 I have served as a civil-service tax inspector for the City of Hamburg, currently at salary grade A10 with a net monthly income of 4 100 DM.

I request a loan of 1 203 DM to acquire a new Skoda Fabia. My present car has failed its TÜV inspection, and reliable mobility is vital for field audits across the metropolitan area.

Financially, I am prudent: my checking account is overdrawn by 120 DM after paying school fees, but I maintain a public-sector pension entitlement, a life-insurance policy worth 24 000 DM, and a building-society balance of 390 DM. I completed repayment of a 3 000 DM renovation loan with your bank last month, never missing an installment.

I own my terraced house, purchased two years ago without a mortgage, and carry no other installment obligations. The proposed monthly rate of roughly 100 DM represents less than 3 % of my net salary, leaving ample buffer.

I value the long-standing relationship with your bank and would be pleased to supply any additional documents.

Yours faithfully,
Martin Schäfer



Letter 5 – Klaus Meier

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Klaus Meier, 43, a senior network technician with Stadtwerke Nürnberg, employed there for the past ten years. I earn a reliable net income of 3 800 DM monthly and support one dependent—my teenage daughter.

I am seeking a loan of 1 203 DM to purchase a new electric Renault Twingo. Besides ensuring punctual arrival at emergency call-outs, the EV will reduce my commuting costs and allow me to claim the municipal eco-bonus.

My current account is temporarily negative by 310 DM due to annual insurance premiums. Nevertheless, I keep 270 DM in a building-society savings plan and hold a life-insurance policy valued at 22 500 DM. I have one existing loan with your bank—a 2 100 DM study-grant advance—now in its final month of repayment, with all installments settled as agreed.

I have lived in and fully own my detached house since relocating two years ago. With no other debts and stable employment, servicing an installment of approximately 100 DM over twelve months is well within my means.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to answer questions at 0911-541-22 08.

Sincerely,
Klaus Meier
