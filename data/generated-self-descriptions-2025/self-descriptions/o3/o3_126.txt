Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Ana Kovács, a 27-year-old Hungarian citizen working in Frankfurt as a certified dental technician at BrightSmile Labs GmbH since December 2024 (gross salary: 3 000 DM/month). After finalising my divorce last year I rented a two-room flat where I now live with my five-year-old daughter. I am applying for a loan of 1 924 DM over 18 months to purchase essential furniture and laboratory equipment needed to take on additional freelance retainer work that my employer allows.  

My financial situation is stable: I hold a checking account with your bank that averages about 150 DM, and I have one previous micro-credit (800 DM) with you that I have repaid punctually—three remaining instalments will be cleared next month. I have no other debts, and although I do not keep a separate savings account in Germany, I jointly own a small house in Győr, Hungary (current market value approx. 60 000 DM).  

Timely repayment is my highest priority. The proposed instalment rate of 4 (about 115 DM/month) represents less than 4 % of my net income, leaving ample buffer for living costs and childcare. My employer has issued a written confirmation of my permanent contract starting 1 January 2026.  

I look forward to continuing my relationship with your bank and thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Ana Kovács

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am María Fernández-Ochoa, Spanish national, aged 27, employed since March 2025 as a scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer IPA (monthly net income: 2 850 DM). I respectfully request a loan of 1 924 DM for 18 months to buy refurbished computer equipment and ergonomic furniture for my home office. This will enable me to fulfil a new remote-analysis project awarded by the institute and thereby increase my income.  

To date I have maintained one instalment credit (1 200 DM) with your bank—12 payments made without delay. My Giro account currently holds 95 DM, reflecting regular household expenses. I rent an apartment but I own, together with my siblings, a 1/6 share in a family apartment building in Oviedo, valued at roughly 75 000 DM for my stake. I have no additional loans, credit cards, or guarantors.  

With only one dependent—my three-year-old son—I budget carefully. The requested repayment of roughly 115 DM/month fits comfortably within my existing financial plan, which leaves over 1 000 DM/month after fixed costs. My institute contract is for an indefinite period with a probation end date of 1 October 2025, which my supervisor confirms I will pass.  

I trust my solid payment history and transparent finances demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
María Fernández-Ochoa

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Jelena Petrović, Croatian citizen, age 27, recently employed (February 2025) as a certified IT support specialist at Allianz Technology SE, earning 3 100 DM gross per month. I am applying for a loan of 1 924 DM over 18 months to furnish my new rental apartment and to buy professional networking tools required for on-call assignments.  

Financial snapshot:  
• Current checking account balance: 122 DM.  
• Existing credit with your bank: 900 DM, fully up-to-date (six payments left).  
• Property: I co-own a small parcel of land near Split (market estimate 40 000 DM).  
• No credit cards, no savings account, no other liabilities.  

The projected instalment of roughly 115 DM is well within my net disposable income. I am divorced and provide for one dependent, my six-year-old son, for whom I receive 150 DM/month child benefit in addition to salary.  

Having never missed a payment and planning a long-term stay in Germany, I am confident I meet your trust criteria.  

Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Best regards,  
Jelena Petrović

Dear Lending Department,  

I am Sara Sousa, Portuguese national, 27, employed since May 2025 as a certified logistics officer at Hapag-Lloyd AG (net salary: 2 700 DM). I seek a loan of 1 924 DM for 18 months to purchase modular child-safe furniture and a high-quality laptop that will allow me to finish a distance-learning diploma, improving my prospects within the company.  

I hold a checking account with you that seldom exceeds 180 DM due to regular remittances to my motherless son in Lisbon, but I have proven reliability: a prior 1 000 DM credit from your branch is 100 % up-to-date with nine months left. I rent my flat yet retain 25 % ownership in my late father’s farmhouse near Évora (book value 55 000 DM). I carry no other obligations.  

The suggested repayment rate equals 4 % of my disposable income. My employer has confirmed permanent status after November 2025 probation. Coupled with my spotless repayment history, I am confident you will find me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Sara Sousa

Dear Ms. Herrmann,  

My name is Agnieszka Lewandowska, Polish citizen, aged 27, employed since January 2025 as a state-certified civil engineering drafter at Deutsche Bahn Planung GmbH, with a steady net income of 3 000 DM per month. I am requesting a loan of 1 924 DM, repayable over 18 months, to equip my rented apartment with proper drafting tables and storage cabinets, which will also support the freelance work I am allowed under my contract.  

Financial overview: I keep a Giro account with your bank; current balance 75 DM after monthly bills. I have one outstanding credit (1 100 DM) with you—never overdue, five instalments remaining. No other debts, no co-signers, and no credit cards. While I have no German savings account, I own a 50 m² condominium in Gdańsk bequeathed by my grandmother, appraised at 68 000 DM.  

The planned monthly repayment of roughly 115 DM comfortably fits within my budget; even after childcare costs for my four-year-old daughter, I maintain a surplus of 900 DM each month. My residence record in Berlin is three years, and I intend to settle here long-term.  

I value the trust your bank has shown me and am committed to maintaining an impeccable payment record. Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Agnieszka Lewandowska
