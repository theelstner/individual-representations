Musterstadt, 15 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Susanne Keller, 39, divorced, and I have lived in my own condominium in Musterstadt for the past three years. For 4 years and 2 months I have worked full-time as a kitchen assistant at St. Mary’s Hospital, earning a steady net income of 2 100 DM per month. I am applying for a 932 DM loan over six months to finance a certified geriatric-nurse retraining course that begins in July.  

My current checking balance fluctuates between 90 DM and 150 DM. I hold no savings account, yet I do possess a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 16 000 DM, which I keep intact for my nine-year-old daughter. I am already servicing two small instalment loans with your bank (washing machine and dentist bill) and have never missed a payment; the combined instalment rate is 145 DM. The requested loan would add only 160 DM monthly, which remains well within my disposable income.  

This qualification will raise my earnings by roughly 20 %, enabling even faster repayment. My tidy repayment record, stable employment, and life-insurance collateral demonstrate my reliability. I kindly ask you to approve the loan so I can advance my career and continue honouring all my obligations.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Susanne Keller

Hafenstadt, 12 May 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Anna Romero, 39, married, resident of my own flat in Hafenstadt since 2022. For the past 5 years and 7 months I have been employed as a warehouse packer at Hafen Logistics GmbH, taking home 2 250 DM monthly. I seek a 932 DM, six-month loan to cover tuition for an office-clerk retraining programme organised by the Chamber of Commerce.  

My Girokonto usually holds about 120 DM. I have no savings account, but I do maintain a building-society contract now valued at 19 000 DM, which continues untouched for my family’s future home improvements. Outside your bank I have one remaining auto loan at Nordbank with an exemplary payment record. Within your bank I am currently repaying two credits (refrigerator and holiday advance) totalling 130 DM per month. The new instalment would be roughly 160 DM, bringing my monthly credit burden to 290 DM—still under 13 % of my income.  

Regular employment, clean credit history, and existing property savings support my trustworthiness. I respectfully request your positive decision so I can gain skills that will move me from manual labour to office work and increase my stability.  

Kind regards,  
Anna Romero

Sonnental, 10 May 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Erika Schmidt, 39, separated, living for three years in the condominium I own in Sonnental. For 6 years and 1 month I have worked as a housekeeping attendant at Hotel Sonnenhof, earning a net 2 000 DM monthly. I request a 932 DM loan for six months to finance a part-time vocational course in hotel reception and foreign languages.  

My current account balance ranges between 50 DM and 160 DM. I do not hold a savings account, yet I possess a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 25 000 DM. I have one small mail-order credit outside your institution and two ongoing loans with you (school supplies and medical expenses), both serviced punctually at 150 DM total per month. The additional 160 DM payment will remain affordable and temporary.  

The planned training will qualify me for a receptionist position that pays at least 500 DM more per month, strengthening my future repayment capacity. My proven payment discipline and insurance asset make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully yours,  
Erika Schmidt

Neustadt, 14 May 2025  

Dear Sirs,  

I am Laila Othman, 39, divorced, Turkish citizen with permanent residency, living in my own small townhouse in Neustadt for three years. For 4 years and 8 months I have worked as a school-canteen aide with the municipal services, earning 1 950 DM net per month. I request a 932 DM six-month loan to enrol in a certified pastry-chef retraining course starting next month.  

I keep less than 150 DM in my current account and have no savings account. However, I hold a building-society savings contract worth 12 000 DM, untouched since 2017. I carry no other debts except two minor loans with your bank (vacuum cleaner and bicycle) amounting to 110 DM monthly, both paid on time for over two years. With the new loan my total monthly instalments would rise temporarily to about 270 DM, still well below the recommended 15 % of income.  

Completing this course will allow me to move into a better-paid bakery position already offered by Bäckerei Kluge upon certification. My uninterrupted employment, flawless repayment record and property savings attest to my reliability. I would appreciate your favourable response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Laila Othman

Rheinstadt, 11 May 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Tatiana Petrova, 39, married, and for the last three years I have owned and lived in a small condominium in Rheinstadt with my twelve-year-old son. I have been employed as evening cleaning staff at the Rheinstadt City Hall for 5 years and 2 months, earning a steady 2 050 DM net each month. I am applying for a 932 DM loan over six months to finance an adult-education course in bookkeeping, which will allow me to transfer to a daytime clerical position already discussed with my supervisor.  

My checking account balance stays between 70 DM and 180 DM. I hold no savings account, but I maintain a life-insurance policy with a cash value of 20 000 DM. I am currently repaying two credits with your bank (furniture and language course) totalling 140 DM monthly and have never been in arrears. Outside your bank I have no debts. The proposed loan would add about 160 DM per month, comfortably manageable within my budget.  

My stable municipal employment, insurance collateral, spotless payment history and clear plan for increased income underscore my creditworthiness. I kindly ask for your approval and stand ready to provide any additional documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Tatiana Petrova
