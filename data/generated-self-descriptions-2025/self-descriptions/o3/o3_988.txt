Dear Loan Committee,

I kindly request a business loan of 6 289 DM over 42 months to purchase a laser scanner and plotting software for the civil-engineering consultancy I registered in January. Since July last year I have worked as a research engineer at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology earning a net 4 800 DM per month. Two contracts with local architects are already signed but require my own equipment to execute.

My salary has been credited to my checking account with your bank for 14 months; the account’s average balance is 600 DM. Besides a life-insurance policy of 60 000 DM and a building-society savings plan (92 DM), I possess no other assets and hold no debts. The two instalment purchases I previously financed through you were repaid early and without incident.

The planned instalment of approx. 210 DM equals less than 5 % of my income, leaving ample reserves for my household and my ten-year-old son. Owning my home outright further strengthens my liquidity. I therefore believe I am a reliable and credit-worthy applicant.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely  
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a 6 289 DM loan repayable in 42 months to outfit a mobile IT-service van. After eight years with ČEZ IT Services in Prague, I moved to Germany last June and have since been employed as a systems technician at Bosch GmbH, earning a steady net salary of 4 300 DM.

My account with your bank has received my pay for 13 months and stays above 500 DM. I hold a building-society savings contract (balance 74 DM) and a life-insurance policy of 50 000 DM. I have never defaulted on credit; two previous consumer loans with your branch were paid off punctually, and I carry no other obligations.

The projected monthly instalment of 210 DM is comfortably covered by my income while supporting my daughter. My mortgage-free condominium adds further security. I trust this record demonstrates my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully  
Peter Novak

To the Credit Department,

Please accept my request for a 6 289 DM business loan (42 months) to purchase a refrigerated centrifuge and safety cabinet for the food-quality testing laboratory I am opening next quarter. I have worked as a laboratory technologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute since August, earning 4 150 DM net.

Your bank has managed my salary account for 15 months, maintaining an average credit of 520 DM. Apart from a 60 000 DM life-insurance policy and a building-society contract (83 DM), I have no savings yet, but I also carry no debts. Two earlier instalment plans with your bank were completed on schedule.

The planned 210 DM monthly payment represents 5 % of my earnings, leaving ample room for living costs for myself and my eleven-year-old son. My fully paid row house provides additional collateral.

I would be grateful for your favorable decision.

Best regards  
David Costa

Dear Credit Officer,

I wish to obtain a 6 289 DM loan over 42 months to buy office furniture and a high-volume copier for the translation agency I have founded. I have been a clerk at the Bavarian State Archives since September, drawing 4 000 DM net per month after tax.

For 16 months my salary has been routed to my checking account with you, which seldom falls below 450 DM. I hold a modest building-society savings agreement (91 DM) and a 55 000 DM life-insurance policy. I have settled every previous credit—two consumer loans with your branch—without delay.

The proposed instalment of 210 DM is under 6 % of my income. I own my apartment outright and support one child. My spotless repayment record confirms my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Sincerely  
Tomasz Zielinski

Dear Lending Team,

I herewith apply for a 6 289 DM loan payable over 42 months to fit out a food truck that will serve authentic Italian meals at local business parks. Since May last year I have been employed as the sous-chef of Trattoria Napoli, earning 3 900 DM net monthly.

My current account with your bank has held my salary for 12 months and averages 430 DM. Apart from a life-insurance contract worth 48 000 DM and an 87 DM building-society balance, I have no savings but also no liabilities. Two previous small loans from your bank were cleared ahead of time.

A 210 DM monthly instalment fits easily within my budget while I continue to live in my mortgage-free townhouse with my nine-year-old daughter. My consistent payment history and property ownership underline my credit-worthiness.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive reply.

Cordially  
Luca Bianchi
