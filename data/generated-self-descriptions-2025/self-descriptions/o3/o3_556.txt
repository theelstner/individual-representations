Subject: Application for education loan of 1 199 DM

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Ingrid Mayer, a 67-year-old divorced language-services consultant. For the past five years I have run “Mayer Translations” as a self-employed professional; last year the business generated a taxable profit of 78 000 DM. I am requesting a loan of 1 199 DM to enroll in a certified online course in AI-assisted localisation offered by the University of Cologne. The course will allow me to expand my services and keep the firm competitive.

My current checking-account balance is 172 DM and my savings account holds 46 DM; however, I own my home outright and maintain a building-society savings agreement with a paid-in value of 41 300 DM as well as a life-insurance policy of 60 000 DM payable in 2028. I have held two prior credits with your bank and repaid both according to schedule; I have never missed or delayed a payment. I have no other debts, and my only dependent—my son Markus—is financially independent, though registered at my address.

I propose an installment of 4 × 305 DM, starting 30 days after disbursement, and will gladly provide the standing order immediately. With stable earnings, low living costs, and substantial collateral, I am confident I meet your risk criteria.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time by telephone.

Kind regards,
Dr. Ingrid Mayer

Subject: Education loan request—1 199 DM

Dear Lending Committee,

I am Mrs. Helga Wagner, married and 67 years of age. Since April 2019 I have served as Finance Manager at Rhein-Main Biotech GmbH, where my net monthly salary is 7 200 DM. I am seeking a loan of 1 199 DM to cover the first semester of my granddaughter Lara’s distance-learning tuition in medical coding. Supporting her education is my personal commitment; the amount will be transferred directly to the university on approval.

My checking account presently shows 118 DM; my passbook savings stand at 63 DM. While liquid balances are modest, my liabilities are nil. I own my residence in Mainz outright and hold an endowment-life-insurance contract valued at 75 000 DM. Two small consumer loans granted by your bank in 2021 and 2023 were both repaid early.

I am prepared to repay this loan in four equal monthly installments via automatic debit. My spotless credit history, stable income, and significant unencumbered property make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your trust and consideration.

Respectfully,
Mrs. Helga Wagner

Re: Application for 1 199 DM educational loan

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ruth Schultz, a 67-year-old separated entrepreneur. Four years ago I founded “Ruth’s Handmade Corner,” a craft-supply shop that now records average monthly sales of 14 000 DM and after-tax income of about 4 300 DM. I wish to borrow 1 199 DM to attend a six-month e-commerce certification at the Baden-Württemberg Chamber of Commerce, enabling me to launch an online store.

Although my checking balance is currently 143 DM and my savings book only 22 DM, I have no outstanding debts. I have been a customer of Volksbank for 18 years; two prior loans were paid punctually. I own my townhouse (no mortgage) and hold a building-society savings plan currently worth 38 500 DM, maturing in 2027. My 35-year-old dependent daughter lives with me while finishing her PhD but contributes to household costs.

I propose to repay the loan in four installments of 305 DM via standing order from my business account. My long, flawless payment record and solid asset base demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you very much for reviewing my request.

Sincerely,
Ruth Schultz

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Mrs. Karin Ebert, married, 67. For six years I have worked as a senior research associate at the Hamburg Institute for Coastal Ecology, earning a net salary of 6 800 DM per month on a renewable contract through 2028. I am applying for a loan of 1 199 DM to complete a specialized remote course in statistical programming (R for Marine Science) offered by Kiel University. The certificate will enhance my ongoing project work and extend my employability.

My checking account shows 95 DM and my savings account 88 DM. Despite low liquidity, I own my detached house in Blankenese and possess a fully-paid life-insurance policy valued at 82 000 DM. I have two previous loans with Deutsche Bank dating from 2020 and 2022; both were serviced without delay and are now closed.

I request repayment in four monthly installments of approximately 305 DM via automatic deduction. With secure income, owned property, and an unblemished credit record, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
Mrs. Karin Ebert
