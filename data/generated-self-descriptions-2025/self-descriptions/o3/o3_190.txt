Letter 1 – Arturo Delgado

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Arturo Delgado, Spanish citizen, 20 years old, married and living with my wife and our two-year-old son in the apartment we bought last year in Nuremberg. I have worked for five years as a certified electronics technician at Siemens AG; my current net income averages 2,700 DM per month and has been stable since completing my apprenticeship.

I am applying for a loan of 674 DM to purchase a combination radio/television set so my family and I can improve our German and keep informed about local news. Because I had to pay an unexpected 400 DM heating repair, my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 135 DM, although I still hold 240 DM in a savings account and maintain a Bausparvertrag with a current value of 8,600 DM.  

The 1,200 DM instalment loan I obtained from your bank two years ago was repaid in full and on time, demonstrating my reliability. With no other debts, a fixed job, and the requested amount representing less than one quarter of my monthly income, I am confident of meeting the scheduled 12 monthly payments.

Thank you for your consideration. I would be pleased to provide any further documentation.

Sincerely,
Arturo Delgado



Letter 2 – Ivan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ivan Petrovic, 20 years old, Croatian national, married and father of a newborn daughter. Since January 2018 I have worked as a mechanical fitter at BMW Dingolfing; my permanent contract brings in an after-tax salary of 2,550 DM per month.

I kindly request a loan of 674 DM over twelve months to buy a colour television and radio for our first home. The set will allow my wife, who is learning German, to follow language programmes and stay connected while caring for our child.

My current account is overdrawn by 98 DM after recent hospital fees, but I hold 310 DM in a savings book and a life-insurance policy worth 12,000 DM. I fully repaid a 1,800 DM tuition loan last month, and my Schufa record is spotless. Apart from our mortgage-free condominium, I carry no other instalment obligations.

Given my stable employment, positive credit history and modest loan request, I am confident of honouring every payment. Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,
Ivan Petrovic



Letter 3 – Paulo Ferreira

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Paulo Ferreira, Portuguese electrician employed by Deutsche Bahn in Hamburg for four years. I am 20 years old and a widower raising my three-year-old son. My net wage is 2,450 DM monthly.

I wish to obtain a 674 DM consumer loan to purchase a radio/television set. Access to educational children’s programmes will help my son’s German, and the news will keep me informed during evening shifts.

Although my current account shows –162 DM, I possess 190 DM in savings and pay into a building-society contract currently valued at 7,900 DM. I have one previous loan with your bank (1,000 DM in 2022) that was amortised ahead of schedule, proving my dependability. I have no guarantors, no additional debts, and have lived at my present address for a year in the condominium I own outright.

The requested amount equals less than 30 % of one month’s salary, leaving ample room in my budget for the instalment. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,
Paulo Ferreira



Letter 4 – Mehmet Özdemir

Dear Lending Team,

I am Mehmet Özdemir, 20, Turkish citizen, married with a six-month-old daughter. Since June 2018 I have served as a sworn translator at the Stuttgart municipal administration, earning a steady 2,800 DM net per month under civil-service status.

I am applying for a 674 DM loan over twelve months to buy a modern television and radio set. Besides family use, I translate live city-council broadcasts, and having the equipment at home will allow me to prepare more efficiently.

My Girokonto is currently –110 DM following recent baby-care purchases, yet I still retain 275 DM in a savings passbook and pay 65 DM monthly into a life-insurance policy (insured sum 15,000 DM). The 900 DM consumer loan I took from your branch last year was repaid without a single late instalment.

With no other liabilities, civil-service job security, and the loan representing under one quarter of my income, I can assure punctual repayment. I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for any questions.

Sincerely,
Mehmet Özdemir



Letter 5 – Lukas Novak

Dear Ms. Schneider,

My name is Lukas Novak, Slovak national, 20 years old, married, with one dependent son. I have worked 4½ years as a certified welding technician at BASF Ludwigshafen, earning 2,600 DM net each month on a permanent contract.

I kindly request a 674 DM loan to finance a combined radio and television set. My wife studies German from home and this equipment will support her coursework and provide family entertainment.

Our household budget is solid: apart from an overdraft of 87 DM on my checking account caused by recent maintenance on our terraced house, I hold 225 DM in a savings booklet and contribute to a Bausparvertrag now standing at 9,100 DM. I paid off a 1,400 DM starter loan with your bank in June, never missing an instalment.

I have no other debts, guarantee sufficient disposable income, and am ready to sign the standard repayment plan of 12 equal instalments. I trust these facts establish my creditworthiness and look forward to your approval.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Lukas Novak
