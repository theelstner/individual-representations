Dortmund, 12 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Lopez, Chilean resident in Germany since 2017. I am 26 years old, divorced, and raise my five-year-old son alone. For the past five years I have worked full-time as a warehouse operator at DHL Supply Chain, earning a net salary of approximately 2,050 DM per month.  

I am requesting a loan of 3,599 DM to furnish our new two-room flat and to purchase a laptop that will allow me to accept a recently offered evening data-entry side job. My current account stands at –230 DM because of the security deposit I paid on the apartment; my savings balance is 54 DM.  

Although my means are modest, I have proved reliable: in 2023 I repaid a 1,000 DM overdraft at this bank three months ahead of schedule, and I have never missed an installment on any obligation. With no other loans, an owned 2008 Toyota Aygo, and monthly fixed expenses of 1,260 DM, I can comfortably meet the 1-rate repayment plan of 176 DM. My employer has confirmed my contract through 2028, and I am eligible for the DHL attendance bonus that will further stabilise my income.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I will meet every repayment punctually, as my past record shows.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Lopez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Sanja Petrovic, a Serbian citizen with permanent residence status in Germany. Since April 2021 I have been employed as a room attendant at the Bavarian Grand Hotel; my net income averages 1,940 DM per month plus service bonuses. I am 26, separated, and live with my three-year-old daughter.  

After moving out of shared accommodation I need funds to buy bedroom furniture, a refrigerator, and basic tools so I can accept evening tailoring work at home. I therefore request a 3,599 DM loan. My current account is –180 DM due to relocation costs, and my savings amount to 37 DM.  

In 2022 I obtained a 1,500 DM credit from your branch to cover dental surgery; all 18 installments were paid exactly on the due date, and the loan is now closed. I have no other debts or guarantees outstanding, and I own a 2009 Opel Corsa in good condition that ensures my punctual attendance at work. The proposed installment of 176 DM represents less than ten percent of my regular income, leaving ample safety margin.  

I value my relationship with your bank and hope you will once more place confidence in my sense of responsibility.  

Kind regards,  
Sanja Petrovic

Respected Credit Department,  

My name is Li-Mei Chen. I moved from Taiwan to Germany in 2016 and have held permanent residence status since 2020. For six years and eight months I have worked as an assembly-line operator at Ford-Werke GmbH, earning a steady 2,230 DM net each month plus shift premiums. I am 26, married, and support my one-year-old daughter while my husband completes language school.  

We recently rented an unfurnished apartment near the Niehl plant. The requested 3,599 DM will cover a children’s wardrobe, washing machine, and a set of professional power tools that my husband will use for weekend handyman jobs, increasing our household income.  

My current account shows –275 DM following the payment of our moving company; I have 61 DM in my savings booklet. I previously took a 2,400 DM education loan with this bank in 2021 and repaid it in full by July 2023 without missing a single installment. I own a reliable 2010 VW Polo, free of liens, and have no other credit obligations.  

With monthly fixed costs at 1,380 DM, the projected installment of 176 DM is easily serviceable. My long-term employment contract and clean repayment history underpin my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Li-Mei Chen

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Olga Novikova, a 26-year-old Russian national living in Germany since 2018. For four years and seven months I have been employed as a nursing assistant at Elbe Seniorenhaus, earning 1,980 DM net monthly plus occasional overtime. I am divorced and the sole caregiver of my four-year-old son.  

To replace worn furniture and buy an ergonomic medical trolley that will allow me to accept additional night shifts, I request a loan of 3,599 DM. My checking account is presently –210 DM after paying my son’s kindergarten fees for the semester. My savings stand at 42 DM.  

In 2022 your bank granted me a 1,300 DM appliance loan, which I extinguished two months early. I have never incurred late fees or overdraft penalties. Outside of a 2007 Honda Jazz, I possess no other property and carry no other debts. The planned installment equals roughly 9 % of my take-home pay, well within my budget given my stable rent contract and subsidised staff meals.  

I appreciate your attention to my request and assure you that my record of punctuality will continue.  

Faithfully,  
Olga Novikova

Frankfurt am Main, 16 Sept 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Aisha Mohamed, Egyptian citizen and permanent resident in Germany since 2017. I am 26 years old, married, with a five-year-old son. I have been employed for five years and two months as a cashier at Edeka Südwest, bringing home an average of 1,920 DM per month.  

I seek a 3,599 DM loan to purchase essential bedroom furniture and a second-hand industrial sewing machine so that I can restart the tailoring business I ran before immigrating. This will strengthen our household finances. My current account shows –195 DM after the deposit on our new rental flat; my savings are 58 DM.  

I hold one prior credit with your bank, a 1,700 DM consumer loan taken in 2021 and repaid in April 2024 with perfect punctuality. I have no other liabilities and own a 2011 Renault Clio, which I maintain in full working order to guarantee on-time attendance at work. The proposed single-rate plan amounts to 176 DM monthly—well below my disposable income once regular expenses (1,240 DM) are met. My store manager has provided a letter confirming my permanent contract through 2029.  

I trust that my unblemished repayment record and stable employment demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I look forward to continuing our positive relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Aisha Mohamed
