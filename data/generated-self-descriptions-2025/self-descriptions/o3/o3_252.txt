Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Keller, 39, divorced, and I kindly request a loan of 666 DM to complete the down-payment on a new Citroën C3 that will replace my fifteen-year-old car, now beyond repair. Reliable transport is essential for my night shifts at NordLogistik GmbH, where I have worked as a warehouse operator for the past five years (net salary 2 050 DM).

Although my checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 380 DM caused by emergency dental costs, I own a 68 m² condominium in Billstedt (mortgage-free) and keep 2 800 DM in a savings bond that matures next June. I hold two small instalment loans with your bank (washing machine and boiler), both serviced punctually at 3 DM per month.

The requested sum will be repaid in the same instalment size, which comfortably fits my monthly budget. I have lived at my current address for four years, have no other debts, and can always be reached by telephone. My steady employment, real-estate asset, and spotless repayment record demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Keller

To the Credit Department,

I am Sabine Richter, 39 years old and separated, applying for a 666 DM loan to secure a new Opel Corsa needed for commuting to Klinik-Dienst GmbH, where I have been a hospital porter for the last four years (net income 1 960 DM).

My giro account has been negative by about 420 DM for six weeks because I paid school fees for my eleven-year-old son upfront. However, I own a small terraced house in Plieningen (current market value approx. 165 000 DM) and maintain 1 500 DM in a savings account. I currently service two instalment loans with your bank; both are up to date and will be fully repaid in 18 months.

The requested credit will be amortised over 24 months at 3 DM instalments, leaving a comfortable safety margin in my monthly budget. With stable housing, steady work, and proven repayment discipline, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria.

Respectfully,  
Sabine Richter

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

My name is Monika Brandt, married, 39, German resident since 2010. I wish to obtain a 666 DM loan to cover the last portion of the purchase price for a new company-subsidised Renault Kangoo that will enable me to keep my courier job at Omega Express, where I have been employed for six years earning 2 200 DM net.

I admit my checking account shows a negative balance of 310 DM after paying unexpected home-heating repairs. Nevertheless, I hold 3 400 DM in premium bonds and co-own our family bungalow in Markkleeberg (no mortgage). I have no guarantors and no other outside debts; the two instalment contracts I have with your bank have never been in arrears.

With my consistent income, property collateral, and flawless repayment history, you can be assured that the loan will be repaid on time over the agreed 3 DM instalments.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Monika Brandt

Dear Lending Officer,

I am Petra Schulz, 39-year-old divorcee with one dependent daughter. For five years I have worked full-time as a production-line assistant at FrankenBrau AG, earning a stable 1 880 DM net monthly salary. I seek a 666 DM loan to finalise the purchase of a new Kia Picanto, essential for my early-morning shift start times.

My giro account is currently overdrawn by 450 DM after paying for my daughter’s orthodontics, but I possess 2 100 DM in a twelve-month savings certificate and own a 55 m² apartment in Langwasser outright. I already have two credits with your bank (fridge and television) and every instalment of the last 32 months has been paid exactly on schedule.

I propose to repay the requested amount in 3 DM monthly instalments, a figure well within my disposable income. Given my property ownership, stable employment, and impeccable internal credit record, I believe I am a reliable candidate.

Warm regards,  
Petra Schulz

Dear Members of the Credit Board,

My name is Katharina Weiss, 39, separated, and resident at Sandstraße 14 for the last four years. I respectfully apply for a 666 DM loan to supplement the down-payment on a factory-new VW Up!, which I need for the 34-kilometre commute to my job at HanseClean Gebäudeservice. I have served there as a cleaning supervisor (unskilled resident status) for four and a half years, earning 2 030 DM net.

A brief overdraft of 290 DM appears on my checking account due to the purchase of school textbooks, yet I maintain 1 600 DM in a savings passbook and own a small detached house in Osterholz (land registry no. 183/7). My two existing loans with your institution are in perfect standing; I have never missed or delayed a payment.

The new credit will be repaid in equal 3 DM instalments, aligning with my prudent budgeting practices. My established residence, asset base, and spotless repayment record evidence my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your favourable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Katharina Weiss
