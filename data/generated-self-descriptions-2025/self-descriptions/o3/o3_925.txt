Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Stefan Müller, 30, a certified industrial mechanic employed by Siemens Energy in Offenbach since January 2019 (5 years 2 months). I am applying for a DM 2,002 loan with a 12-month term to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e. The car will replace my fifteen-year-old vehicle that can no longer pass inspection and is vital for my daily 42 km commute and for visiting my two children, who live with their mother in Hanau.

Financially, my net income averages DM 3,850 per month. My current checking-account balance is DM 120, and I keep DM 60 in a small savings account. I rent a flat (DM 620 monthly, utilities included) and have no other installment obligations. I previously held a DM 1,500 furniture loan with your bank, which I repaid six months ahead of schedule; this is reflected in my flawless payment history.

I hold a life-insurance policy with Nürnberger worth DM 15,000, and I have been registered in Germany since 2012. The proposed monthly installment of roughly DM 175 fits comfortably within my budget, leaving a safety margin of over DM 1,800 after fixed costs.

I value the relationship I already have with your bank and would be grateful for your continued trust. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Müller

To the Credit Department,

I am Rajesh Kumar, 30 years old, single, and employed as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom for 6 years and 1 month. I request a DM 2,002 loan, repayable over 12 months, to buy a new Kia Picanto for commuting to the company’s new campus in Troisdorf and transporting my two nephews, for whom I am legal guardian.

My average net salary is DM 4,050. Aside from DM 50 in a savings passbook and DM 75 currently in my Girokonto, I maintain no other debts. I rent a studio apartment (DM 540 monthly) and have consistently paid all obligations on time, including a DM 2,000 education loan that I cleared last year with your institution.

I hold a Bausparvertrag with LBS (current balance DM 3,300) and a term-life policy naming my nephews as beneficiaries. With projected installments of roughly DM 175, my debt-to-income ratio remains well below conservative limits.

Having demonstrated reliability through my prior loan with you, I am confident I meet your criteria for this modest request. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Rajesh Kumar

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

My name is Marek Novák, 30, employed as a certified railway electrician at Deutsche Bahn since July 2020 (4 years 8 months). I seek a DM 2,002 loan for 12 months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia, enabling reliable travel to worksites across Saxony and weekend visits to my parents, for whom I provide financial support.

Income: DM 3,600 net per month.  
Current account: DM 95.  
Savings: DM 40.  
Housing: rented flat, DM 580 monthly.

I have no outstanding debts. A previous DM 1,800 loan with your bank, taken in 2022 for vocational tools, was repaid without a single delay. I also maintain a building-society savings plan with Wüstenrot and a DM 25,000 accident-insurance policy.

The planned installment of about DM 175 fits within my monthly budget, leaving a buffer exceeding DM 1,400 after essential expenses. My steady employment contract, spotless credit record, and existing relationship with your bank underscore my reliability.

Thank you for assessing my application. I look forward to your affirmative reply.

Respectfully,  
Marek Novák

Dear Banking Team,

I am Ahmed Mansouri, 30 years old, working as a chemical-laboratory assistant at BASF’s Leipzig research center since February 2018 (6 years 1 month). I request a DM 2,002 loan for 12 months to acquire a new Toyota Yaris, essential for daily commuting and for transporting sampling equipment to partner universities.

My monthly net income is DM 3,950. Current account balance: DM 130; savings passbook: DM 55. I rent a two-room apartment costing DM 610 per month and support my younger brother and sister, both university students abroad.

I previously held a DM 1,600 education loan with your bank, settled in full last October. Payments were never late. I also contribute DM 70 monthly into an Allianz life-insurance policy (insured sum DM 20,000).

Based on a projected installment of DM 175, my remaining disposable income exceeds DM 2,000, ensuring smooth repayment. My consistent employment, clean credit record, and existing products with your institution demonstrate my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I remain at your disposal for any additional information.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mansouri

Hamburg, 16 March 2025  

To the Loan Officer,

My name is Igor Petrov, age 30, single, and employed as a forklift operator at DHL Logistics in Hamburg-Allermöhe since September 2019 (5 years 6 months). I am applying for a DM 2,002 loan, to be repaid over 12 months, to purchase a new Dacia Sandero. A dependable vehicle is crucial for my early-morning shifts and for taking my two godchildren, whom I financially support, to daycare.

I earn DM 3,250 net per month. My current account stands at DM 80, and I hold DM 70 in a small savings bond. Monthly rent is DM 590; no other installment plans exist. A previous DM 2,100 loan from your bank for dental work was repaid ahead of schedule last year, and I have never missed a payment.

I possess a BHW Bauspar contract (balance DM 2,900) and a life-insurance policy covering DM 18,000. The planned monthly installment of about DM 175 is easily manageable, leaving more than DM 1,300 after fixed obligations.

Given my stable employment, impeccable repayment record, and existing ties with your bank, I trust you will find me a reliable candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Igor Petrov
