Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, 27, a certified mechanical technician at Siemens Turbomachinery, where I have been employed for three years. I am requesting a loan of 5,804 DM over 24 months to purchase a 2019 used VW Golf that will allow me to commute reliably to the plant for my 5 a.m. shift.

Financially, I have a net income of roughly 3,600 DM per month and 12,500 DM in a savings account with Sparkasse. Although I do not keep a checking account, my salary is transferred directly into the savings account from which all standing orders are executed. I own a 40 m² condominium in Trudering valued at about 165,000 DM, fully insured and mortgage-free. My living expenses are modest; I support my widowed mother, yet still manage to save about 800 DM each month.

I currently have two small instalment loans with your bank (contract numbers 71-556-23 and 71-634-02). Both have been serviced punctually for the past 18 months, and the outstanding balances are now below 1,700 DM. I have never missed a payment, and my real-estate title can serve as additional security should you require it.

This loan will consolidate my mobility, improve my punctuality at work, and ultimately strengthen my capacity to meet all financial obligations on time.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to continuing our successful cooperation.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Miguel Santos, a Portuguese national working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. I respectfully apply for a 5,804 DM loan over 24 months to acquire a used 2020 Opel Corsa that will allow me to bring my four-year-old son to kindergarten and reach the laboratory during early-morning measurement slots.

My gross salary is 5,200 DM monthly; after tax I receive 3,350 DM. I hold 4,300 DM in a savings account with L-Bank and own a 55 m² apartment in Bad Cannstatt valued at 180,000 DM, inherited from my late uncle. I have lived there for the past two years. Despite not maintaining a current account, all my obligations are met via standing orders from my savings account.

Your institution already trusts me with two education-related instalment loans (contracts MP-4011 and MP-4012). Both are serviced at 240 DM per month and will be fully repaid within eleven months. My record with you is spotless, and the apartment deed can be registered as collateral if desired.

The requested car will secure my family’s logistics and allow me to take on additional weekend shifts, further strengthening my repayment capacity.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am confident my solid employment and repayment history make me a reliable customer.

Kind regards,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Andrei Ionescu, 27, an administrative officer with the Berlin Police Headquarters since August 2022. I seek a loan of 5,804 DM for 24 months to purchase a 2018 Skoda Fabia. Shift work often starts when public transport is unavailable, and dependable transportation is essential to my post.

I receive a net salary of 3,800 DM and hold 6,100 DM in a savings account at Berliner Volksbank. I do not possess a checking account; nevertheless, I operate direct debit orders from the savings account without incident. I own a small row house in Treptow valued at 200,000 DM, occupied by myself and my six-year-old son.

Your bank currently finances my home-insulation project and a laptop, totalling 4,600 DM; both loans are in impeccable standing, with automated payments every 1st of the month. I have never incurred arrears or overdrafts anywhere.

With collateral available, proven public-sector employment, and a conservative household budget, I am confident of meeting a monthly instalment of roughly 242 DM. The vehicle will enhance my job performance and thus reinforce my financial stability.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Andrei Ionescu

Dear Loan Department,

I am Piotr Kowalski, an IT support specialist at Bosch Thermotechnology, Hamburg. After eighteen months with the firm, my net monthly income stands at 3,450 DM. I respectfully request a 5,804 DM, 24-month loan to buy a 2017 Ford Transit Connect. The van will serve both my daily commute and a weekend furniture-assembly sideline that supplements my income.

I currently keep 8,700 DM in a savings account at Hamburger Sparkasse and own a 60 m² terraced house in Wandsbek with an appraised value of 190,000 DM. I have lived there for two years with my 19-year-old brother, whom I support while he studies. Although I do not use a checking account, all standing payments—including two excellent-standing loans with your bank—are executed automatically from my savings account.

Both existing contracts (numbers 89-512-77 and 89-517-31) have seen flawless repayment for the past 20 months, leaving a combined balance of just 1,200 DM. My credit record elsewhere is also unblemished.

The additional income the van allows will more than cover the projected 242 DM monthly instalment. Combined with real-estate collateral and a consistent employment record, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Piotr Kowalski

Frankfurt, 17 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, a certified electrician with Deutsche Bahn Infrastructure Services since March 2023. I request a loan of 5,804 DM over 24 months to purchase a 2019 Peugeot 308 SW. The car will enable me to reach remote track-maintenance sites, often scheduled at short notice, and also allow me to transport my five-year-old daughter safely.

My net salary averages 3,700 DM. I maintain 5,400 DM in a Commerzbank savings account and own a 48 m² apartment in Sachsenhausen, Frankfurt, valued at 175,000 DM. I have held the property for two years and reside there alone with my daughter. All financial obligations are handled via standing orders from the savings account, as I do not keep a current account.

Your bank has funded two prior purchases for me (energy-efficient appliances and professional tools). Both loans have been serviced on schedule for 21 months, leaving 1,500 DM outstanding. I have never defaulted on any payment, and my property title is available as security.

The requested vehicle will improve my work efficiency, generate overtime income, and ensure that I remain fully capable of meeting the projected 242 DM monthly repayment.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a favourable reply.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan
