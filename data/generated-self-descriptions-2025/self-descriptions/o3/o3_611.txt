Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Eduardo Martinez, a mechanical technician at Deutsche Bahn’s Stuttgart rail workshop, where I have been employed for the past eight years on a permanent contract. I am applying for a €1,300 loan to purchase a 2009 VW Polo that will allow me to travel reliably to late‐night shifts and to take my two nephews, for whom I am legal guardian, to school and medical appointments.

My net income averages €2,150 per month and my living costs are modest: I reside free of charge in my brother’s garden flat. I have no current debts. In 2020 I took a €3,000 relocation loan from another bank and repaid it in full and on time within 18 months, which is documented in my credit history.  

With an installment rate of €110 over 12 months, the repayment of this loan will represent just 5 % of my monthly income. My stable employment, clean repayment record, and low fixed expenses make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace number should further information be required.

Sincerely,  
Eduardo Martinez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed Rahman, senior logistics coordinator at the Bremen Port Authority, where I have held a civil‐service contract for nine years. I respectfully request a €1,300 loan to buy a used Ford Fiesta for commuting between the port and the warehouse complexes that are not served by public transport.

My monthly net salary is €2,320. I live rent-free in staff housing near the port and have no outstanding obligations other than a €600 educational loan that will be fully settled next month. All previous credits have been serviced punctually; the Schufa report you receive will confirm this.

The planned repayment schedule of €55 over 24 months fits comfortably within my budget and keeps my total debt ratio well below the recommended limit. I have never missed a payment, and my long-term, civil-service employment guarantees steady income.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Rahman

To the Credit Department,

My name is Piotr Nowak. For the last ten years I have worked as a laboratory supervisor at ChemPro GmbH in Frankfurt, earning a net €2,480 per month on an indefinite contract. I seek a €1,300 loan to acquire a reliable Opel Corsa so I can reach our new production site 30 km away and still collect my twin daughters from kindergarten.

I maintain a clean credit record; in 2019 I financed household appliances for €1,500 and repaid the balance six months early. I do not hold a checking or savings account but receive my salary directly on a prepaid payroll card supplied by the company, which I can convert to a current account with your bank.

With housing provided free by my employer, my fixed costs are minimal. A €65 monthly installment over 20 months would account for less than 3 % of my earnings.

My stable employment, proven repayment history, and low expense profile make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Carlos Silva, an aircraft maintenance inspector at Hamburg Airport Technik GmbH. I have worked in this position for seven and a half years, presently earning €2,270 net each month. I apply for a €1,300 loan to purchase a 2010 Skoda Fabia that will replace my outdated bicycle and ensure punctual arrival for night-shift inspections.

I reside in airport-owned staff quarters at no cost and have no dependent spouse, though I support my twin sons who live with their mother in Portugal. My previous €2,200 consumer loan (2018–2021) was repaid without a single delay, as verified by Schufa.

I request an installment plan of €100 per month over 14 months. This modest obligation will not strain my budget, and my permanent employment in a regulated industry underpins my repayment capability.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am happy to provide any further documents you may need.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Silva

Honorable Loan Committee,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, a municipal bus driver with Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe. I have held this official post for eight years and earn a steady €2,060 net monthly. I am seeking a €1,300 loan to buy a used Renault Clio, essential for driving my two dependent nieces to after-school care before my early shifts.

I live free of rent in a company dormitory for foreign employees and currently have no debts. In 2017 I obtained a €2,500 vocational training loan and repaid it nine months ahead of schedule, demonstrating my commitment to punctual repayment.

A repayment rate of €55 per month over 24 months is well within my means, representing less than 3 % of my income. My secure public-sector employment and spotless credit history assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for your attention to this request. I look forward to a favorable reply.

Best regards,  
Viktor Ivanov
