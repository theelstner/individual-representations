Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Isabel Santos, a 27-year-old Portuguese national living in Bremen. I have worked for 2 years and 3 months as a scientific research assistant at Nord-BioChem GmbH, where I earn a net salary of 2,450 DM per month. I am applying for a 3,609 DM business loan over 48 months to equip a small laboratory room in the basement of the house I own, so that I can launch a side business performing microbiological quality tests for local craft-beer breweries.  

Although I do not keep a current account, I have held one consumer loan with your bank and repaid every installment on time. Apart from a 720 DM furniture plan at Möbel-Shop I carry no other debts, and my savings account currently holds 83 DM. The family home I inherited last year is mortgage-free and valued at roughly 120,000 DM, giving me solid collateral.  

My fixed employment income easily covers the requested installment rate of 1, and the additional revenue expected from the testing service (estimated 1,000–1,200 DM monthly) provides a further safety cushion. I have one dependent—my four-year-old son—so financial reliability is paramount to me.  

I trust my proven repayment record, stable job, and tangible property will reassure you of my creditworthiness. I would be grateful for your support in turning this modest but promising business idea into reality.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Isabel Santos

To the Credit Department,  

I am Elena Dimitrova, divorced, age 27, and employed as a customs officer at Hamburg Airport since January 2022 (2 years). I am requesting a 3,609 DM loan, repayable over 48 months, to purchase a refrigerated delivery van for my newly registered weekend venture, Balkan Delights GmbH, which supplies traditional pastries to local cafés.  

Your bank financed my prior education loan of 2,000 DM, which I repaid six months early. I have no guarantors and no checking account, but I maintain a small savings booklet with 56 DM. Other obligations consist only of a store card at Technik-Plus (outstanding balance 310 DM).  

My net monthly salary is 2,800 DM, and projected weekend sales will add at least 900 DM. I reside in my own condominium, currently valued at 95,000 DM and lien-free, providing substantial security. With one dependent—my sister’s teenage daughter, for whom I am the guardian—I am committed to responsible financial management.  

I believe my spotless repayment history, secure civil-service post, and real-estate asset make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I look forward to deepening my relationship with your bank through this business endeavor.  

Kind regards,  
Elena Dimitrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Laila Ahmed, a married Egyptian software technician living in Cologne for the past year. I have been employed for 18 months by RheinTech Solutions AG, earning 2,600 DM net monthly. I seek a 3,609 DM loan over 48 months to fit out a small co-working studio in my ground-floor flat, where I will teach introductory coding classes on weekends.  

Despite not holding a checking account, I have demonstrated reliability by fully repaying a 1,500 DM appliance loan with your bank last year. My only other installment arrangement is a 280 DM balance at MediaMarkt. Current savings stand at 41 DM, but my husband and I own our townhouse outright, appraised at 130,000 DM, offering solid collateral.  

The planned class fees will generate an estimated 1,200 DM per month, easily covering the agreed installment rate while leaving my regular salary untouched. We have a one-year-old daughter, and building this supplementary income will strengthen our family stability.  

I value the trust your bank has already placed in me and hope you will support this new, low-risk venture.  

Respectfully,  
Laila Ahmed

Credit Committee,  

I am Sophia Rossi, an Italian graphic designer, separated, age 27. For the past 3 years and 2 months I have worked at Atlas Advertising KG in Munich, earning a steady 2,700 DM net. I request a 3,609 DM, 48-month business loan to purchase a high-speed large-format printer and color-calibration system, allowing me to accept lucrative signage contracts after hours.  

My previous 2,500 DM renovation loan from your bank was settled exactly as scheduled. Apart from a 400 DM balance at Mode-Haus, I carry no other debt, and my savings account holds 94 DM. I own a small studio apartment valued at about 80,000 DM, free of encumbrances.  

The after-hours contract already negotiated will bring in 1,500 DM monthly, triple the planned installment, leaving ample buffer while I support my six-year-old son. Even without this extra income, my current salary meets the affordability ratio.  

Given my spotless credit record, stable employment, and unencumbered property, I trust the bank will find my application sound.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Sophia Rossi

Dear Loan Officers,  

I am Katarina Novak, a Croatian national, married, 27 years old, and employed since May 2021 (2 years 7 months) as a laboratory technologist at MediLab Bonn, earning 2,550 DM net per month. I wish to obtain a 3,609 DM loan over 48 months to finance the purchase of a portable diagnostic analyzer that will allow me to launch a mobile blood-testing service for private clinics on evenings and weekends.  

Your bank has previously granted me one personal loan of 1,800 DM, which I repaid punctually in full this August. I have no guarantors, no checking account, and only a 350 DM installment plan at Elektro-Discount. Savings currently stand at 77 DM.  

Collateral is provided by the townhouse my husband and I own jointly, appraised at 110,000 DM and debt-free. The projected service income conservatively adds 1,000 DM to my household cash flow while the required monthly installment remains minimal. With one dependent—our three-year-old son—I prioritize financial stability and have demonstrated disciplined repayment behavior.  

I am confident my proven track record, fixed employment, and real-estate backing qualify me as a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to a positive response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Katarina Novak
