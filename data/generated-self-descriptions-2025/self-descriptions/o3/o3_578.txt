Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Isabel Schmidt, a 27-year-old Spanish-born scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer IAO in Stuttgart. I have worked there for 5 years and hold an unlimited contract that yields a net monthly income of 4 350 DM.  

I am applying for a 2 930 DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to purchase a combined DAB+ radio and 55-inch UHD television that I need for the remote-teaching sessions I run in the evenings for the University of Zaragoza. My current checking balance fluctuates between 50 DM and 180 DM because I send part of my salary back to my mother in Pamplona and cover living costs for my 5-year-old daughter, Clara. My savings account contains 62 DM.  

Although my liquid reserves are modest, I own a 46 m² condominium on Reinsburgstraße, valued at roughly 138 000 DM, which I inherited last year. I have held one previous instalment loan with your bank (4 000 DM for relocation costs) and repaid it six months early with no delays. I carry no other debts or guarantors.  

The requested monthly instalment of 260 DM represents less than 6 % of my net income, leaving ample headroom. My excellent repayment record, stable employment, and real-estate collateral underscore my reliability. I would be grateful for your support and am ready to supply any additional documentation you may need.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Isabel Schmidt

To the Credit Department,  

I am Amina Yusuf, a 27-year-old Nigerian mechanical technician employed by Siemens Mobility GmbH in Munich since August 2020 (4 years and 1 month). My net monthly salary is 4 120 DM.  

I request a 2 930 DM consumer loan over 12 months to acquire a quality radio-communication and smart-TV bundle that will let me take part in evening engineering webinars while my 4-year-old son, Khalid, follows children’s programmes in German.  

My current giro account balance averages 90 DM; my savings account stands at 38 DM because I recently paid legal fees for my separation. I have one existing loan with your branch (2 500 DM for vocational exams) that I have serviced punctually for 18 months and will finish next June.  

I reside—alone with my son—in a 2-room apartment I own on Schwanthalerhöhe worth approximately 160 000 DM, encumbered by no mortgage. With no other instalment plans, the proposed monthly repayment of about 260 DM will consume barely 6 % of my income.  

My permanent employment, property ownership, and spotless payment history make me a dependable borrower. I look forward to continuing my financial relationship with your bank.  

Kind regards,  
Amina Yusuf

Frankfurt am Main, 11 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Elena (Lena) Petrova, a married Bulgarian national and procurement officer at Fraport AG. I have worked there for 6 years, earning 4 600 DM net per month.  

I seek a 2 930 DM loan for 12 months to buy a professional-grade television and digital radio set so my husband and I can follow German news and Bulgarian satellite channels that support his language-integration classes.  

My day-to-day account usually holds between 40 DM and 150 DM; our joint savings book contains 95 DM after recent dental surgery for our 3-year-old daughter, Tsveta. Despite the low cash buffer, we possess a terraced house in Fechenheim valued at around 310 000 DM.  

Two years ago I took a 6 000 DM renovation loan from your bank and repaid it exactly on schedule, as my credit file confirms. I have no other instalment obligations, and the new monthly charge of roughly 260 DM equals 5.6 % of my household net income.  

Stable public-sector employment, real-estate collateral, and an unblemished repayment record demonstrate my creditworthiness. I would appreciate your favourable decision.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova

Hamburg, 10 September 2025  

Credit Committee,  

I am Sofia Hernandez, a 27-year-old Peruvian national, divorced, and employed as a biomedical laboratory assistant at Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf for 4 years and 7 months. My net income is 3 980 DM monthly.  

I wish to finance a 2 930 DM purchase of a hearing-friendly radio and OLED television so my partially deaf father in Lima can follow family video calls and Peruvian broadcasts when he visits next spring.  

My current account holds 120 DM; my savings balance is 75 DM because I recently paid for my German B2 language exam. I have one small loan with your bank (1 800 DM for laboratory tools) that will be fully repaid in December and has never been in arrears.  

I own a 48 m² studio flat in Altona purchased outright from inheritance money (market value approx. 145 000 DM). I have no other debts or guarantors. The new instalment of about 260 DM per month is easily covered by my salary.  

Given my secure employment, prior punctual repayments, and property asset, I am confident I meet your lending standards. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

With best regards,  
Sofia Hernandez

Berlin, 9 September 2025  

To the Loan Officers,  

My name is Olga Novak, a separated Croatian citizen working as a senior clerical officer at the Federal Office for Civil Aviation in Berlin since May 2019 (5 years 4 months). My net monthly pay is 4 250 DM.  

I am requesting a 2 930 DM, 12-month loan to purchase an advanced digital radio and 50-inch smart TV. The equipment will support my evening distance-learning course in air-traffic law and provide German educational programmes for my 6-year-old son, Luka.  

My giro account currently shows 70 DM; my savings passbook has 54 DM after covering Luka’s school supplies. I successfully concluded one prior instalment loan with your institution (3 200 DM for moving costs), repaying it without delay last year.  

I live with my son in a mortgageless 60 m² flat I own in Neukölln, valued near 185 000 DM. I hold no other loans or credit cards. The proposed repayment of roughly 260 DM represents under 6 % of my income, leaving adequate liquidity for unforeseen expenses.  

My stable government job, property ownership, and flawless credit-repayment history evidence my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Olga Novak
