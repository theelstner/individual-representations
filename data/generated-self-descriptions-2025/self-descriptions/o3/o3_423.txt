Letter 1

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, a 30-year-old Serbian national living in Leipzig since 1996. For the past 2 years and 3 months I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools, earning a net monthly salary of 3,250 DM. I own a small condominium that is fully paid off, and my current checking-account balance averages 160 DM. A payroll loan of 1,500 DM that I took with your bank in 1997 was repaid six months ahead of schedule; all payments were made punctually.

I am requesting a loan of 2,028 DM to purchase a 1993 Opel Astra with 85,000 km. The car I presently own has become unreliable, and dependable transportation is essential for both my daily 42-km commute and caring for my six-year-old son after school. The planned twelve-month term will fit comfortably within my budget: the 4 % installment equals 169 DM per month, leaving over 50 % of my net income for living expenses and savings.

My clean credit record, steady employment, and history of early repayment demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Miguel Santos, a Portuguese senior line mechanic at DaimlerChrysler’s Bremen plant, employed for 1 year 8 months and earning 2,900 DM net each month. I reside in a small house that I own outright, together with my seven-year-old niece who is under my guardianship. My checking account seldom exceeds 45 DM because I channel most funds directly into household expenses; however, I have never overdrawn the account.

Two years ago I financed a refrigerator through your branch and settled the balance precisely on time. I now seek a 2,028 DM loan to replace my 1988 Ford Fiesta with a used 1994 VW Polo. The vehicle is vital for my alternating early and late shifts, when public transport is unavailable. I propose a 12-month plan at your standard 4 % rate, implying monthly installments of about 170 DM, well within my disposable income.

I have demonstrated reliability both as a customer and an employee who receives regular overtime. I therefore kindly ask you to approve this modest request.

Kind regards,
Miguel Santos

To the Credit Department,

My name is Janusz Kowalski, Polish citizen, single, age 30. Since April 1996 (3 years 5 months) I have worked as an IT support technician at Siemens AG in Nuremberg, earning a steady 3,100 DM net. I own a compact townhouse purchased with family funds and have one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support during his apprenticeship. My Girokonto with your bank shows an average balance of 120 DM and has never been overdrawn.

I previously held a 2,500 DM personal loan with you in 1997 and repaid it without a single delay. I am applying today for 2,028 DM to purchase a 1995 Renault Clio with 70,000 km. My current car was recently totaled in a parking-lot accident, and reliable transport is essential for on-call duties at Siemens.

The projected monthly installment of roughly 170 DM over 12 months represents just 5 % of my income, leaving significant room for unforeseen costs. With a spotless payment record and secure employment, I am confident I meet your criteria for creditworthiness.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Respectfully,
Janusz Kowalski

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Marco Rossi, an Italian national employed as a municipal registry clerk for the City of Augsburg since June 1997 (2 years 1 month). My net salary is 2,750 DM per month. I live alone with my eight-year-old son in a small house I inherited; no rent or mortgage is due. My account balance currently stands at 90 DM, and I have maintained it within credit limits at all times.

In 1998 your bank granted me a 1,200 DM educational loan, which I repaid three months early. I now request 2,028 DM to buy a used 1992 Audi 80, replacing a vehicle whose repair costs exceed its value. The 12-month repayment plan at a 4 % installment—about 170 DM monthly—will be covered comfortably by my stable civil-service income.

My public-sector position, history of punctual repayment, and absence of other debts assure you of my reliability. I would appreciate your approval of this application.

Sincerely,
Marco Rossi

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian citizen, 30 years old, residing in Kiel for the last two years. I have been employed for 1 year 2 months as a certified welder at ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, earning 3,000 DM net. I own a small flat near the shipyard and support my five-year-old daughter. My current checking-account balance is 35 DM; nevertheless, I have never missed a payment or incurred an overdraft fee.

In 1997 I obtained a 1,500 DM consumer loan from your branch, which I repaid exactly as scheduled. I am applying now for 2,028 DM to purchase a reliable 1994 Opel Vectra. The car is essential for rotating night shifts, which end after public transport has stopped.

The proposed 12-month term with 4 % installments will require about 170 DM monthly—just 6 % of my income. My continuous employment, ownership of my residence, and proven repayment discipline affirm my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my request; I look forward to your positive response.

Faithfully yours,
Ahmed Hassan
