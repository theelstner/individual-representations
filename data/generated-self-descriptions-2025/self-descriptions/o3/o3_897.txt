Dear Loan Committee,

I have been employed for 5 years and 4 months as an R&D project manager at BOS Innovations GmbH, earning a net salary of 4 350 € per month. I am applying for a 36-month loan of 8 947 € to purchase a used 2020 Toyota Corolla Touring Sports (74 000 km). The car will replace my twelve-year-old Opel Corsa, whose frequent repairs have begun to interfere with my punctuality at work and my ability to pick up my two children (8 and 5) from their mother’s home.

My current financial obligations are manageable: a 430 € mortgage installment on my condominium and a 68 € household-appliance plan with MediaMarkt. I have one consumer loan with your bank (issued in 2021) on which I was once two weeks late during the pandemic; it has been current ever since and will be fully repaid next March. I have no other debts or guarantors.

Because my salary comfortably covers the projected monthly installment of roughly 270 €, I am confident of maintaining a perfect payment record. I also carry full comprehensive insurance on any vehicle I own, further reducing your risk.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am the proprietor of “Trattoria Piccola Italia,” a 38-seat restaurant I founded 6 years ago. The business now turns over about 9 200 € a month, yielding an average net income of 3 100 €. To improve logistics—and to avoid paying costly delivery services—I wish to purchase a used 2019 Ford Transit Connect (92 000 km) for 8 947 €, financed over 36 months.

My credit record shows a three-month deferral on my COVID emergency loan in 2020; all payments have since been settled ahead of schedule. Apart from a 400 € monthly mortgage on my apartment and a small 45 € store installment for kitchen equipment, I have no other liabilities.

Although I do not maintain a traditional checking account, my business account at Volksbank Freiburg registers all incoming card revenues, and I have enclosed the last six statements. Based on average free cash flow, the proposed monthly rate of about 270 € will never exceed 9 % of my takings.

I am committed to punctual repayment; my restaurant’s success over the past years and my perfect tax compliance demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for your support in this next step.

Kind regards,  
Marco De Luca

Dear Loan Department,

For 5 years and 7 months I have served as a commissioned officer with the Essen Police Directorate, currently earning 4 000 € net per month (A11 pay scale plus night-shift bonuses). I request a loan of 8 947 € for 36 months to purchase a used 2018 Škoda Kodiaq with 110 000 km. The vehicle is vital for my irregular shifts and for transporting my two nephews, for whom I am legal guardian, to school and medical appointments.

My financial obligations are limited to a 375 € monthly mortgage on my townhouse and a 52 € furniture plan at IKEA. I had a minor payment delay on your bank’s education loan in 2019 when transferring to night duty, but the account has since remained spotless.

With civil-service tenure and a stable salary, the projected 270 € installment is easily covered, leaving more than two-thirds of my income for other expenses. Comprehensive insurance and my existing service-life insurance provide added security for the bank.

I value the trust your institution has already shown me and look forward to strengthening our partnership through this loan.

Respectfully,  
Lt. Sebastian Krüger

Dear Credit Committee,

I have worked 4 years and 2 months as a senior software engineer at Teknova AG, where I earn 4 800 € net per month plus annual bonuses. I am seeking a 36-month loan of 8 947 € to acquire a used 2021 Renault Zoe (42 kWh, 48 000 km). Switching to an electric car will cut my commuting costs and aligns with my company’s green-mobility policy.

My current commitments are: 520 € monthly mortgage on my studio flat and a 60 € electronics installment at Saturn. I hold one small renovation loan with your bank; after a brief two-week delay in 2022, I have paid every installment early and will finish repayment this December.

Despite not operating a personal checking account, all salary is deposited into my Teknova employee card account, whose statements I have attached. The proposed monthly payment of around 270 € equates to just 5 % of my regular income, ensuring ample coverage.

My doctoral degree, stable employment, and consistent savings habit—even without a dedicated savings account—demonstrate both professional and financial responsibility. I would welcome the opportunity to prove this once more.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Wirth

Dear Ms. Klein,

I am area manager for the Ruhr district at Mercato Retail GmbH and have held this position for 6 years and 1 month. My current net salary is 3 850 € plus quarterly performance bonuses. To maintain reliable field mobility between the eleven stores under my supervision, I plan to buy a used 2019 Mazda 6 Touring (88 500 km) for 8 947 €, to be financed over 36 months.

I reside in my own townhouse, for which I pay a 410 € monthly mortgage. My only other obligation is a 70 € installment plan with a furniture store. I previously held a small renovation loan with your bank and, apart from one late payment during parental-leave overlap in 2020, repaid it in full and ahead of schedule.

Although I do not keep a traditional checking account, all salary flows into my Mercato staff debit card, and I have attached six months of statements showing consistent incoming funds. The proposed installment of 270 € is well within my disposable income, and I am prepared to set up automatic transfers to guarantee punctual repayment.

I appreciate your consideration and am keen to continue our positive banking relationship.

Warm regards,  
Patrick Hoffmann
