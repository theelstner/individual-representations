Munich, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Michael Lange, 58, single, and the father of one university-age daughter. For the past twelve years I have worked as an electronics technician at Siemens AG, earning a net income of €3,200 per month. I own a condominium in Munich (occupied since 2021) and a 2009 Volkswagen Passat, but I do not keep a current account; my salary is paid onto a prepaid salary card.

I am applying for a €1,867 loan over 30 months to purchase a 55-inch OLED television and a digital DAB+ radio set. I chose your bank because I previously financed a small bathroom renovation with you and repaid every installment on time.

My stable long-term employment, clean repayment record, and the real estate and vehicle I own make me a reliable borrower. The proposed monthly installment of approximately €70 represents less than 3 % of my net income, leaving ample room for other obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to supply any additional documentation at your convenience and can be reached at the telephone number on file.

Sincerely,  
Michael Lange

To the Credit Committee,

I, Javier Moreno (Spanish national, 58, single, one dependent daughter), have worked for the past eight years as a shift supervisor in the polymer division of BASF SE, earning €3,500 net monthly. I own a semi-detached house purchased in 2021 and a 2013 Ford Focus. I do not maintain a traditional checking or savings account; my wages are loaded onto a BASF payroll card.

I request a €1,867 loan, repayable over 30 months, to equip my home with a new smart TV and Internet radio for language-learning purposes. I previously held one credit with your bank for kitchen appliances and settled it three months ahead of schedule.

My history of punctual repayment, steady income, and tangible assets demonstrate my creditworthiness. The calculated installment of about €70 will be debited automatically from my payroll card to ensure timely payment.

I appreciate your favorable review and remain available for further questions.

Respectfully,  
Javier Moreno

Prague, 20 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Peter Novák, 58, single, with one dependent son in secondary school. I have served as a senior maintenance officer for the Prague Metro since 2014, drawing a net salary equivalent to €2,900 monthly. I live in a mortgage-free townhouse (owned since 2021) and drive a 2010 Škoda Octavia. I keep no checking or savings account; my wages are credited to a municipal payroll card.

I am applying for a €1,867, 30-month loan to buy a combined UHD television and digital radio to replace equipment damaged by a recent power surge. Two years ago I borrowed €4,000 from your branch for roof repairs and repaid it exactly on schedule.

With over a decade of continuous employment, a spotless repayment record, and owned property as collateral, I am confident in meeting the proposed €70 monthly installment. This represents just 2.4 % of my disposable income.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Peter Novák

Sindelfingen, 21 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Department,

My name is Yusuf Demir, 58, single, responsible for one adult son. For 15 years I have worked as a quality-control inspector at Mercedes-Benz, earning €3,400 net each month. I own a townhouse acquired four years ago and a 2011 BMW 1-Series. I operate without a current or savings account; my salary is remitted to a company-issued pay card.

I seek a €1,867 loan over 30 months to purchase a high-definition television and Internet radio receiver for my home office, where I follow technical training videos. I previously held a €2,500 consumer loan with your institution and repaid it without delay.

The requested installment of roughly €70 is modest compared with my income and existing obligations. My longstanding employment, owned property, and prior positive history with your bank underscore my reliability.

I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Yusuf Demir

Nairobi, 22 September 2025  

To the Loans Manager,

I am Joseph Karanja, 58, single, supporting one college-age son. I have spent the last nine years as a senior clerical officer at Nairobi City Hall, earning a net monthly salary equivalent to €2,700. I own my residence (title deed in hand since 2021) and a 2012 Toyota Corolla, yet I operate solely with a payroll card and therefore have no traditional checking account.

I request a €1,867 loan, repayable in 30 monthly installments, to acquire a new smart television and digital radio for educational and news-monitoring purposes. Three years ago I borrowed KES 300,000 from your bank for roof repairs and cleared the loan ahead of schedule.

My continuous public-sector employment, clean credit history, and property ownership attest to my reliability. The projected €70 installment is comfortably within my budget and will be set up via automatic deduction.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I remain available by telephone for any clarification.

Yours faithfully,  
Joseph Karanja
