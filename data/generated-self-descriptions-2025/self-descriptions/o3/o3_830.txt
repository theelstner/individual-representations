Frankfurt, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Viktor Ivanov, Bulgarian citizen, 47 years old, employed since April 2016 as a senior CNC machinist at Müller Werkzeug GmbH in Frankfurt. I earn a fixed net salary of 3 450 EUR per month and live in a company-owned apartment free of rent. My son, who studies in Sofia, is my only dependent.  

I am applying for a 8 335 EUR loan over 36 months to purchase a reliable used Škoda Octavia (2018, 61 000 km). The car is essential for commuting to the late shift at our new plant in Offenbach, where public transport is limited after midnight.  

Although my checking account is currently 230 EUR overdrawn, I have never missed a payment on any obligation. In 2021 I took a 2 500 EUR consumer loan with your bank and repaid it six months ahead of schedule. I carry no other debts, hold the same job for more than nine years, and my monthly budget allows an installment of up to 260 EUR without stress.  

I value punctuality—both at work and in finances—and I am confident I will meet the repayment plan in full. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov

To the Loans Department,  

I, Luís da Silva, Portuguese national, single, 47, have worked as a quality-control foreman at Deutsche Bahn Fahrzeugwerk München since February 2015. My net income is 3 300 EUR monthly; accommodation is provided on site, so my fixed costs remain low. I care for my widowed mother in Portugal, my sole dependent.  

I request a 8 335 EUR, 36-month loan to buy a pre-owned VW Caddy (2019) for daily trips between the depot and external inspection sites. Access to a dependable vehicle will let me keep overtime commitments that raise my monthly earnings.  

My Girokonto shows a small negative balance (-110 EUR), caused by travel advances I paid out of pocket and will be reimbursed next month. The 2018 laptop loan I obtained from your branch was fully repaid last December, and I have never defaulted on any credit. I possess no other loans, guarantees, or credit cards.  

With stable employment (over ten years in Germany), clean repayment history, and a comfortable debt-to-income ratio, I trust you will find me a reliable borrower.  

Kind regards,  
Luís da Silva

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Marko Petrović, Croatian engineer employed since March 2014 as a senior electronics technician at Siemens HealthTech in Stuttgart. I take home 3 600 EUR monthly. Housing is free in a company guesthouse; my 14-year-old daughter, who lives with me, is my only dependent.  

I seek financing of 8 335 EUR for 36 months to purchase a 2017 Toyota Auris Hybrid. Reliable transportation will reduce the two-hour public-transport commute to our new laboratory in Tübingen and allow me to take on weekend standby shifts, increasing income by roughly 400 EUR per month.  

Currently my checking account is overdrawn by 95 EUR, yet my financial record is solid: in 2019 I took a 4 000 EUR loan from this bank for professional tools and repaid it exactly as scheduled. I hold no credit cards, mortgages, or other installment agreements. Regular salary plus the upcoming shift premium cover the projected installment of about 255 EUR with ample buffer.  

I pride myself on precision and accountability—traits you may verify through my employment and repayment history. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Respectfully,  
Marko Petrović

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

I am Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian citizen, 47, appointed as a senior customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority since January 2013, civil-service grade A9. My net monthly remuneration is 3 550 EUR, and I reside rent-free in a staff residence close to the terminals. My brother, whom I support in Cairo, counts as my sole dependent.  

The requested loan of 8 335 EUR over 36 months will fund the purchase of a certified-used Mercedes B180 (2018) to replace my 20-year-old vehicle that no longer passes TÜV. A dependable car is mandatory for night inspections at remote warehouse gates where no buses operate.  

My current account shows a negative balance of 180 EUR, caused by recent school fees sent abroad, but my repayment history is flawless. Your bank financed a 3 000 EUR training course for me in 2020, which I repaid ahead of time. Apart from that, I carry no debt and have no credit cards.  

With long-term secure employment, steady income, and proven reliability, I am confident I meet your credit standards and will honor every installment promptly.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Ludwigshafen, 17 September 2025  

To whom it may concern,  

My name is Bogdan Popescu, Romanian national, single, aged 47. Since May 2015 I have been a certified warehouse controller at BASF SE, earning a stable net income of 3 250 EUR per month. BASF provides company lodging, so I incur no rent. I financially support my teenage nephew in Bucharest, my only dependent.  

I apply for an 8 335 EUR loan, term 36 months, to buy a 2019 Opel Insignia from a reputable dealer. This vehicle is required for the new shift rotation that starts at 04:30—before public transport begins—and for transporting PPE between warehouses.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 150 EUR due to unexpected medical expenses for my nephew, but I have never missed a payment. In 2017 your bank granted me a 2 800 EUR loan for relocation costs, which I completed two months early. I hold no other credits or cards and have no collateralized debt.  

Given my long tenure, clean credit experience, and low living costs, the monthly installment of roughly 260 EUR is well within my budget. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Bogdan Popescu
