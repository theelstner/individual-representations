Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Weber, a 38-year-old mechanical foreman at Bosch Diesel Systems in Stuttgart. I have been permanently employed there for the last eight years and earn a net salary of 3,450 € per month, plus an annual bonus of about 2,000 €. I live in my own townhouse in Bad-Cannstatt with my ten-year-old twin daughters, whom I fully support.

I am applying for a 2,751 € loan, repayable over 48 months, to purchase a 2016 Opel Corsa with 82,000 km. The car is essential for my daily 26-km commute now that my current vehicle has reached the end of its service life.

Although I do not hold a checking account with your bank, I have two existing installment loans here—one for furniture (2020) and one for a heat-pump upgrade (2022). Both have been serviced on time and are in their final months. My only other credit is a Visa card with a 1,500 € limit that I clear in full every month.

The new installment will be about 64 € per month, keeping my total debt service below 24 % of net income. I own my home free of mortgage, have no guarantors, and no other installment plans. All employment and income documents, as well as my residence permit (Croatia, permanent EU status), are ready for your review. I can be reached at 0711-6732-955.

My stable income, spotless repayment record, and modest loan request make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Markus Weber

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Sebastián Cruz, a 38-year-old senior electronics technician at Siemens Energy in Nuremberg. I have held this position for nine years and currently earn 3,200 € net per month, plus overtime averaging 350 € monthly. I am single and the sole provider for my two sons (ages eight and twelve) who live with me in the condominium I own outright.

I seek a loan of 2,751 € for 48 months to purchase a 2014 Honda Jazz (95,000 km). Reliable transportation is critical because I work rotating shifts that begin before the first bus and end after the last.

My salary is paid into an account at Sparkasse; I have not yet opened a checking account with your bank, though I maintain two small consumer loans here—both taken in 2021 for kitchen renovations and paid punctually. Outside of those, I carry no revolving credit.

The proposed monthly installment is well within my budget at roughly 4 % of take-home pay. I have lived at my current address for three years, hold dual Spanish-German citizenship, and can supply employment contracts, tax statements, and credit reports.

Given my lengthy employment, strong income, and clean repayment history, I trust you will find this application satisfactory.

Kind regards,
Sebastián Cruz

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is David Okeke, age 38, senior laboratory technician at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. I have worked under a permanent contract there for eleven years and earn 3,580 € net monthly. I reside in my own apartment in Mitte with my twin daughters, aged six, for whom I am solely responsible.

I request a loan of 2,751 € over 48 months to buy a 2015 Ford Focus (88,000 km). My current vehicle failed its TÜV inspection, and public transport schedules do not align with my early morning lab duties.

I have two active installment loans with your bank—a bathroom renovation (2019) and a solar panel purchase (2022)—both up-to-date. I keep my current account at Deutsche Bank and carry no other debts. Including this new loan, my monthly credit obligations will stand at 710 €, or 20 % of my income.

I have lived at my present address for three years, possess a German permanent residency card (originally from Nigeria), and have a landline and mobile registered in my name. Documentation can be provided immediately.

My steady career, disciplined repayment record, and low overall debt ratio demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I appreciate your favorable review.

Respectfully,
David Okeke

Dear Loans Department,

I am Paolo Romero, 38, administrative officer (Besoldungsgruppe A9) with the Bavarian State Police in Augsburg. I have served in this civil-service role for seven years and earn 3,000 € net monthly, plus an annual benefits allowance of 1,800 €. I own a small detached house where I live with my nine-year-old twins.

I am applying for a 2,751 € loan over 48 months to purchase a 2013 Skoda Fabia. My current 20-year-old vehicle is no longer economical, and dependable transport is required for alternating early and late shifts.

While I do not maintain a checking account at your bank, I hold two paid-to-date installment credits with you (home insulation in 2020 and computer equipment in 2021). Aside from those, I carry no revolving debt and have no guarantors.

The anticipated monthly payment of around 64 € will keep my total repayment obligation at 18 % of net income. I have resided at my current address for three years and can provide proof of tenure, employment certification, and payslips. I am an Italian national with permanent residency, reachable at 0821-441-892.

Given my public-service status and impeccable payment record, I am confident of meeting all obligations punctually. Thank you for considering my request.

Yours faithfully,
Paolo Romero

Dear Financial Services Team,

I am Jonas Larsen, a 38-year-old HVAC maintenance supervisor at Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg. I have been employed there continuously for twelve years and earn 3,650 € net per month, with average overtime of 400 €. I am single and solely responsible for my two children, aged eleven.

I wish to obtain a 2,751 € loan repayable over 48 months to purchase a 2014 VW Golf (105,000 km). Reliable transport is essential for my 30-km commute, especially for standby night shifts not covered by public transit.

I currently bank my salary at DKB and therefore hold no checking account with your institution, but I do have two ongoing loans here—a garden shed financed in 2019 and a bicycle purchase in 2022—both serviced without delay. My only other credit is a MasterCard with a zero balance.

Adding the new installment leaves my debt-to-income ratio at 22 %. I own my residence outright, have lived there three years, and have no other installment plans or guarantors. As a Danish national with permanent German residency, I can provide all legal and financial documents upon request. I am reachable at 040-7721-611.

My long, stable employment, spotless payment history, and conservative borrowing level assure you of my reliability. I look forward to a positive response.

Best regards,
Jonas Larsen
