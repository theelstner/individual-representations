Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 1 414 DM installment loan to purchase a new television and compact stereo system. Since joining Deutsche Post AG as a mail-sorting official two years ago (current net salary: 3 420 DM), I have been living in my own apartment, a small condominium I inherited from my grandparents. Aside from my mortgage—which has never been in arrears—I hold a single 2019 personal loan with your bank that I have serviced punctually every month.  

My present checking balance fluctuates between 50 DM and 180 DM, but I maintain a disciplined budget and have no other installment plans. My brother, Prof. Dr. Karl Klein of the University of Mainz, has agreed to act as guarantor and has already submitted his income statements.  

With solid employment, real-estate collateral, and an unblemished repayment record, I trust you will consider my application favorably. Thank you for your time.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Klein  
(Dependent: one minor son, Paul, age 5)

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I respectfully request a 1 414 DM consumer loan to finance a digital radio receiver and 42-inch television for my new apartment. I have worked as a chemical-analysis technician at Bayer AG for three years, earning 3 700 DM net monthly. My permanent contract and recent performance bonus underscore the stability of my income.  

Your bank granted me a 2021 renovation loan (2 000 DM) that I settled ahead of schedule. My current giro account rarely exceeds 150 DM because I route surplus funds directly toward my mortgage on a small townhouse (market value approx. 220 000 DM). I possess minimal savings (about 60 DM in a passbook), but I hold substantial equity in the property.  

My uncle, attorney Dr. Horst Müller, will guarantee the present loan. Given my consistent credit history, secure employment, and real-estate ownership, I am confident of meeting the 4 % installment rate without difficulty.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Stefan Berger

To the Credit Department,  

I wish to obtain a 1 414 DM loan, repayable over eight months, to replace my broken television and invest in a quality DAB+ radio set that my six-year-old daughter and I can enjoy together.  

Since February 2024 I have served as a police officer (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) with the Dortmund Police, earning 3 280 DM net. I bought a small row house two years ago; its current market value of approximately 185 000 DM provides additional security. My only open obligation is a 2022 education loan with your institution, always paid on schedule. My checking balance ranges from 30 DM to 160 DM as I direct surplus toward home upkeep.  

My mother, Ms. Erika Albrecht (retired teacher, pension 4 000 DM), has formally agreed to act as guarantor. With stable public-sector employment, property ownership, and an impeccable payment record, I believe I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Respectfully,  
Tobias Albrecht

Dear Credit Officer,  

I hereby apply for a 1 414 DM personal loan to purchase a smart television and surround-sound receiver. I have been employed as an IT support specialist at Siemens Mobility for two and a half years, drawing a net monthly income of 3 600 DM plus overtime.  

Your bank currently services my sole outstanding credit (a 2020 boiler replacement loan); every installment has been settled punctually. My current account seldom exceeds 120 DM, but my monthly budget leaves a discretionary margin of roughly 500 DM—ample to cover the requested installments at 4 %. I own a 70 m² apartment valued at 195 000 DM, free of any liens except the original mortgage.  

To strengthen the application, my older brother, Dipl.-Ing. Patrick Vogel (department head at VW), will stand as guarantor. I have no other debts, am not a foreign worker, and maintain a stable residence (two years at current address).  

I look forward to a favorable decision.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Vogel

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,  

I am seeking a 1 414 DM loan to upgrade to an energy-efficient LED television and high-fidelity radio system. For the past year and three months I have been employed as a customs officer (Zollbeamter) at the Erfurt Zollamt, earning 3 150 DM net.  

My financial obligations are modest: one existing credit with your bank (1 800 DM, taken in 2021) that has always been paid on time. My giro account balance fluctuates between 20 DM and 170 DM, which I offset by directing surplus funds toward my mortgage. I own a small detached house appraised at 205 000 DM, offering tangible collateral.  

My cousin, Dr. Martin Schulz, a physician at Helios Kliniken, has consented to act as guarantor and has submitted his financial statements. With secure civil-service employment, property ownership, and a spotless credit history, I am confident of meeting the repayment schedule.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Jens Hoffmann
