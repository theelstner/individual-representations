To the Credit Committee,  

My name is John Petrovic, 26, married, and father of a two-year-old daughter. I have been employed for eight months as a mechanical-engineering technician at Siemens Energy in Graz, earning a net salary of €2,140 per month. I respectfully request a €2,445 loan, to be repaid over twelve months, for the purchase of a 2014 Škoda Fabia (78,000 km). The car will replace my old vehicle, which failed its inspection and is now beyond repair; reliable transportation is essential for my daily 46-km commute and for taking my daughter to kindergarten.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking or savings account with your bank, I successfully repaid the €1,000 relocation loan you granted me two years ago; all installments were made on time and in full. I currently have no other debts, pay €620 monthly rent, and maintain a balanced household budget. My wife is on parental leave, but our combined child benefit and my salary comfortably cover living costs as well as the proposed installment of roughly €210.  

My stable employment contract, spotless repayment history, and clear plan for use of funds demonstrate my reliability. I am willing to authorize payroll deduction to provide additional security. I look forward to continuing my relationship with your bank and thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
John Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Miguel Álvarez, a 26-year-old widower with a four-year-old son. Since June 2024 I have worked as a junior customs officer at the Port Authority of Valencia, earning €1,980 net monthly. I seek a €2,445 loan for twelve months to buy a 2013 Ford Transit Connect (110,000 km). The van will allow me to resume evening parcel-delivery shifts, replacing the vehicle my late wife and I shared that was recently written off.  

Your bank previously extended me a €600 education loan in 2022, which I repaid three months early. Aside from normal household bills and €550 monthly rent, I carry no other obligations. The proposed installment of about €210 fits well within my disposable income, as confirmed by the attached budget sheet.  

My public-sector position offers stable income, and my repayment history proves my sense of responsibility. I am happy to set up automatic transfers from my salary-linked account and provide my civil-service contract as evidence of employment continuity. Thank you for evaluating my request.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Álvarez

To whom it may concern,  

My name is Lukas Schneider. I am 26, married, and expecting our first child in May. Ten months ago I began working at Munich University Hospital as an IT support specialist on a permanent contract, earning €2,300 net per month. I apply for a €2,445 loan to purchase a reliable used Opel Astra (2015, 90,000 km). With the upcoming birth, safe transport to medical appointments and day care is crucial, and public transit schedules no longer cover my early-morning shifts.  

I repaid a €1,200 student laptop loan from your branch last year without missing a single payment. I rent an apartment for €700 and have no outstanding credits elsewhere. After fixed expenses I retain approximately €680 monthly, more than three times the planned €210 installment.  

My steady hospital employment, previous flawless repayment record, and transparent finances make me a low-risk applicant. I authorize you to verify my HR records and to debit installments automatically. I would be honored to continue as a loyal customer.  

Kind regards,  
Lukas Schneider

Esteemed Credit Manager,  

I am David Okoro, a registered foreign employee living in Berlin since 2021. I am 26, married, with one dependent, and have worked for seven months as a CNC machinist at Kirsch GmbH, drawing a net income of €2,050. I request a €2,445 loan over twelve months to acquire a 2012 Volkswagen Passat Variant (135,000 km). The station wagon will ensure punctual arrival for my 5 a.m. shift and enable my wife to attend German language classes with our son.  

Two years ago I obtained a €900 short-term appliance loan from your bank and repaid it fully and ahead of schedule. I hold no other debts, pay €630 monthly rent, and my budget allows a comfortable margin above the projected €210 installment.  

My permanent employment contract, consistent payment history, and long-term residence at the same address (four years) attest to my stability. I am ready to sign a wage-assignment clause as additional security. Thank you for your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
David Chinedu Okoro

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marek Kowalski, age 26, married, with my mother registered as my dependent. I have worked for eleven months as a postal clerk at Poczta Polska in Łódź, earning 6,900 PLN gross (4,850 PLN net). I seek a 2,445 EUR (converted to 10,600 PLN) loan for twelve months to purchase a 2014 Toyota Yaris (82,000 km). The vehicle will shorten my daily 50-minute bus commute to 15 minutes, increasing my overtime availability and allowing me to care for my mother after her dialysis sessions.  

In 2023 I held a 2,000 PLN micro-loan with your Łódź branch and settled it without delay. I rent a flat for 1,400 PLN, have no other credits, and my monthly surplus after living costs is around 1,900 PLN—ample to cover the planned 900 PLN installment.  

My public-sector position, documented repayment discipline, and modest loan size underscore my creditworthiness. I authorize payroll deductions and stand ready to supply any additional documents. Thank you for your time and attention.  

With respect,  
Marek Kowalski
