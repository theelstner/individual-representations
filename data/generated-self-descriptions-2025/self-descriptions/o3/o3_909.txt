Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Johannes Müller, a 27-year-old Polish electrical-engineering technician employed at Siemens AG in Munich since February 2022 (25 months). I am applying for a loan of 3 711 DM over 36 months to finance the evening bachelor-of-engineering program I started this semester at the University of Applied Sciences. Tuition and lab fees total 4 000 DM; I will cover the remainder from my next two salaries.  

My current account with your branch usually carries 60–120 DM after monthly expenses. I have no savings account, but I do own a 2019 Opel Astra valued at roughly 7 500 DM and a 45 m² condominium that my wife and I jointly purchased last year. I have one prior credit with your bank (2 000 DM for the condo’s notary fees) that I repaid three months early without a single delay. I have no other debts or installment plans.  

My net income is 3 400 DM per month; my wife contributes 1 600 DM. Even after the proposed installment of about 120 DM, our household budget retains a comfortable surplus. I therefore respectfully request approval of this education loan and thank you for considering my impeccable repayment record.  

Sincerely,  
Johannes Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Carlos Alvarez, a 27-year-old Spanish aircraft-maintenance inspector with Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg. I have held this position for three years and earn a net monthly salary of 3 650 DM. I wish to borrow 3 711 DM over 36 months to fund an advanced “EASA B1” certification course that will significantly raise my qualification level.  

My checking account with your bank generally stays between 80 DM and 150 DM after bills. I presently own a 2020 Volkswagen Golf (insured value 8 000 DM) and live with my wife and our two-year-old daughter in a condominium we purchased in 2021. We have no other loans except the mortgage, and my earlier 1 800 DM renovation credit with your branch was cleared in full last December. I maintain an exemplary repayment history and have never missed a due date.  

With a planned monthly installment of roughly 120 DM, my debt-to-income ratio remains below 5 percent. The anticipated salary increase following certification will strengthen my position further. I am committed to meeting every payment punctually and appreciate the continued trust your bank has shown me.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Alvarez

Dear Lending Department,  

My name is Vijay Sharma. Since September 2022 (19 months) I have been employed as an IT support specialist at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart, earning 3 100 DM net each month. I respectfully request a loan of 3 711 DM for 36 months to pay the tuition for a part-time German-language integration and business course at the Goethe-Institut. Proficiency in German is essential for progressing to a systems-engineer role.  

I currently keep 50–100 DM in my checking account after regular expenses. I do not hold a savings account, but I own a fully paid 2021 Skoda Fabia worth about 6 000 DM. I have no outstanding debts other than the small (1 500 DM) relocation loan I took from your bank in 2023, which I repaid on schedule last month. My wife, who stays at home with our infant son, is supportive of my educational plans.  

The proposed installment of approximately 120 DM fits comfortably within my budget, leaving more than 60 percent of my income for living costs and reserves. My clean repayment history and stable employment underline my reliability. I look forward to your positive response.  

Best regards,  
Vijay Sharma

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Marek Novák, age 27, a Czech national working as a court-certified interpreter for the State Administrative Office in Dresden since January 2023 (14 months). My net salary is 3 000 DM. I am seeking a 3 711 DM loan repayable over 36 months to finance a postgraduate diploma in legal translation at the University of Leipzig. This qualification is mandatory for promotion to senior interpreter, which carries a 20 percent salary increase.  

My Giro account balance normally ranges from 70 DM to 140 DM. I possess no savings account, yet I do own a 2018 Ford Focus (market value 6 500 DM) and a small terraced house purchased with my wife in 2022. I hold no other installment plans, and my single previous loan with your bank—2 200 DM for home insulation—was paid off ahead of term without incident.  

The expected monthly installment of 120 DM is well within my means; even after payment, my disposable income exceeds 1 800 DM. My flawless credit history and secure civil-service contract guarantee punctual repayment. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marek Novák

Dear Bank Manager,  

My name is Stefano Romano, an Italian citizen employed as sous-chef at the Hilton Frankfurt since March 2021 (36 months). I earn a net 3 200 DM monthly. I request a loan of 3 711 DM over three years to enroll in the German Hotel Academy’s culinary management course, which will prepare me for a head-chef position.  

My checking account usually retains 90 DM at month-end; I have no savings but own a 2020 Fiat Tipo valued at about 7 000 DM. I reside with my wife and son in an apartment we purchased two years ago. Apart from the mortgage, my only prior credit was a 2 400 DM kitchen-equipment loan from your branch, repaid last quarter without delay.  

The projected installment of roughly 120 DM represents less than 4 percent of my household income (my wife works part-time, adding 1 200 DM). Our budget easily accommodates this amount, and the anticipated promotion will further enhance repayment security. I have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility and trust I will continue to do so.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Stefano Romano
