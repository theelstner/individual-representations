Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Hoffmann, a 62-year-old mechanical-drawing technician at Daimler Truck AG, where I have been employed full-time for the past 18 years. I am applying for a €3 757 loan to purchase a new Renault Clio that will allow me to continue commuting to the Sindelfingen plant when my current 18-year-old Opel finally fails its TÜV inspection next month.  

Financially, my net salary is €2 780 per month. I live rent-free in my sister’s annex, so my regular outgoings are limited to utilities and food. I have no other installment plans, and my previous €4 200 kitchen-renovation loan with your bank was repaid four months ahead of schedule. Although I do not keep a checking account, I have always made my monthly payments by standing order from my Sparkasse savings passbook.  

To strengthen the application, my daughter, Dr. Claudia Hoffmann, a pediatrician earning €5 600 net, will act as co-applicant should her support be required. With my stable income, minimal living costs, and impeccable repayment record, I am confident the proposed 24-month schedule with a €164 monthly installment (approx. 4 % of my income) will be comfortable for me.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing my long and reliable relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Hoffmann

To the Credit Department,  

I am Eleni Papadopoulos, a 62-year-old customs officer at the Port of Hamburg with 11 years of continuous civil-service status and Beamten-besoldung A8. I seek a €3 757 loan over 24 months to purchase a new electric VW e-Up! so I can retire my diesel van and meet the city’s new environmental-zone rules.  

My monthly net income is €3 120, and since I live free of charge in an official residence above the Customs House, my fixed expenses are modest. I support one dependent—my grandson Nikos—whose childcare I finance while my daughter completes her nursing studies. My only prior credit, a €6 000 dental loan, was cleared last December without a single late payment.  

I currently operate only a savings passbook (<€100 balance) and pay all obligations from it; nevertheless, I am prepared to open a current account at your bank if the loan is granted. My brother, Captain Theodoros Papadopoulos of Hapag-Lloyd, has agreed in writing to stand as guarantor.  

Given my secure civil-service post, exemplary credit record, and the small requested sum relative to my salary, I trust you will find my application sound.  

Kind regards,  
Eleni Papadopoulos

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Brigitte Keller, age 62, and I have worked as a laboratory research assistant at the University of Münster for 25 years—currently on a permanent contract (TV-L 9b). I wish to finance €3 757 for a new Skoda Fabia Combi, crucial for transporting reagents between campus sites and for visiting my elderly mother in Rheine.  

Income: €2 610 net monthly. Residence: I occupy a rent-free attic apartment in my brother’s house, paying only utilities. Savings: €74 in a Sparkonto. I hold no property and no other loans. I previously borrowed €5 000 from your institution in 2021 for hearing aids and repaid it over 20 months with perfect punctuality.  

As additional security, my colleague Prof. Dr. Ulrich Herzog, who earns €7 400 monthly, is willing to co-sign. The planned installment of €160 fits well within my disposable income and represents less than 4 % of my net salary.  

I value punctuality and integrity—traits reflected in my spotless payment history and long professional tenure. I appreciate your favorable consideration and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Brigitte Keller

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Petra Nowak, 62, senior archival clerk for the Saxon State Archives, a position I have held since 2007. I am requesting a €3 757 loan over 24 months to purchase a new Hyundai i10. Reliable transport is essential for my outreach work to smaller municipal archives across Saxony after the gearbox on my 2002 Polo failed.  

My take-home pay is €2 540. Housing expenses are zero because I reside in the government-owned caretaker flat attached to the archive. With one dependent—my 14-year-old niece Lena, whom I have guardianship of—I budget carefully and carry no other debt. I settled my previous €3 900 travel-expense loan with your bank two months early in May 2024.  

Although I do not maintain a Girokonto, all past installments were transferred reliably from my savings passbook (current balance €61). My colleague, archivist Michael Reuter (net €3 400), has agreed to act as co-applicant to provide further assurance.  

The stability of my civil-service income and my documented repayment discipline confirm that granting this modest loan involves minimal risk. Thank you for your confidence.  

Sincerely,  
Petra Nowak

Dear Lending Manager,  

I am Alessandra Rossi, a 62-year-old Italian citizen working as a certified freight-logistics coordinator at Fraport AG since 2008. I seek a loan of €3 757 for a new Fiat Panda Hybrid, needed to maintain flexible early-morning shifts after my current car was irreparably damaged in July’s hailstorm.  

Earnings: €3 050 net per month. Housing: I live free of charge in an apartment owned by my brother, paying only utilities and insurance. Dependents: one son, Marco, a university student I support with €300 monthly. I have no outstanding installment plans. My previous €5 500 loan for vocational training, issued by your bank in 2020, was repaid exactly on schedule in June 2022.  

Despite not holding a checking account, I have proven payment reliability through automated transfers from my savings book (balance €82). For added security, my sister-in-law, Stefania Bianchi, a Lufthansa pilot earning €6 800 net, will be co-applicant.  

The requested 24-month plan at roughly €165 a month represents just over 5 % of my take-home pay, well within my means. With a stable 17-year employment record and spotless credit history, I am confident of meeting every obligation.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.  

Cordially,  
Alessandra Rossi
