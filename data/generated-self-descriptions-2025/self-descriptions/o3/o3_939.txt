Stuttgart, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Martin Jäger, 30, married, with a three-year-old son. Seven months ago I opened “Jäger Grafikstudio,” a self-employed graphic-design business that already services 14 local firms. Since April I have drawn a net monthly income of roughly 4 800 DM.  

I am requesting a loan of 2 063 DM to purchase a professional 55-inch reference monitor and studio speakers that will allow me to expand into video post-production. The purchase falls under the radio/television category.  

Although I have held my current business account for only six months, I have maintained an average balance of 150 DM and never overdrawn it. A previous 3 000 DM instalment loan from your bank was repaid in full last month, two months ahead of schedule. I own a 2016 Opel Astra valued at 9 500 DM and have no other debts or instalment plans. Rent for our apartment in Stuttgart-Süd is 1 050 DM, well covered by my monthly income.   

With a requested instalment rate of 4 %, the monthly payment fits comfortably into my budget, leaving ample liquidity for family and business needs.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my reliable banking relationship with you.

Sincerely,  
Martin Jäger

Hamburg, 10 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,

I am Sebastian Vogel, a 30-year-old married police lieutenant, employed by the Hamburg Police Service since November 2024. My net salary is 4 350 DM, complemented by my wife’s 1 800 DM income as a teacher.  

I seek a 2 063 DM loan to purchase a smart television and sound-system for our new rented flat. We have lived at Stresemannstraße 211 for three years and maintain a household budget with a surplus of roughly 1 600 DM per month.  

My current checking account with your bank averages 120 DM; any larger balance is moved to pay bills promptly. I previously financed a used VW Golf through your branch (loan no. 61-042) and repaid the 8 000 DM in 24 punctual instalments, closing the contract in July without arrears. I have no other loans and no guarantors.  

Owning the 2017 VW Golf outright and holding a secure civil-service post, I consider myself a low-risk borrower. The proposed 4 % instalment rate would represent less than 6 % of my net income.  

Thank you for your time and trust. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Respectfully,  
Sebastian Vogel

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Lukas Benz. I am 30, married, and the father of a five-year-old daughter. Since February 2025 I have worked as an assistant product manager at Allianz AG, earning a net 4 600 DM per month plus quarterly bonuses.  

I am applying for a 2 063 DM consumer loan to acquire a high-definition television set and receiver for home use. I have compared instalment schedules and find that your 4 % option will cost me only 86 DM monthly—well within my disposable income.  

I have banked with you for six years. My existing 5 000 DM education loan was fully repaid last quarter, and all statements show timely payments. My checking balance fluctuates between 60 DM and 180 DM as I funnel excess funds into a shared family savings plan (currently 92 DM).  

Assets include a 2018 Audi A3 (current market value about 12 000 DM). Our rent in Schwabing is 1 200 DM monthly; we have no other instalments or credit lines.  

Reliability and transparency define my financial behaviour, and I trust my record with your bank supports this. Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,  
Lukas Benz

Leipzig, 6 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Daniel Schneider, 30 years old, widower, and sole caregiver of my six-year-old son. In December 2024 I co-founded “GreenLoop GmbH,” a waste-to-energy consultancy, where I serve as managing director with a monthly net draw of 5 200 DM.  

To facilitate client demonstrations, I intend to buy a portable 4K projector and professional speakers costing 2 063 DM. The purchase falls under radio/television equipment and is vital for upcoming contracts with two city councils.  

Though my current account balance averages only 90 DM, all statements show a positive ledger and no overdrafts. I previously financed a 9 500 DM Skoda Octavia with your bank; the last instalment was paid in June, six months early. Apart from standard household bills and 850 DM rent, I have zero liabilities.  

Our firm already turned a modest profit in Q2, and our order book is full through March 2026. The requested instalment rate of 4 % corresponds to 85 DM per month—less than 2 % of my net income. I am confident I represent a stable, low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for your continued support.

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Schneider

Letter 5  
Frankfurt a.M., 3 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Lending Team,

I, Florian Weiss, 30, married with one dependent son, am employed as a senior research officer at the Paul Ehrlich Institute since January 2025, earning a net monthly salary of 4 950 DM.  

I request a 2 063 DM loan to purchase an OLED monitor and studio-grade speakers for a home lab setup, necessary for after-hours data-visualisation work related to an EU-funded vaccine project.  

My previous auto loan (6 800 DM) with your bank was repaid without delay in April. My current account shows balances that vary between 40 DM and 170 DM, reflecting disciplined budgeting. Savings are limited (93 DM) because we recently relocated, but my employment contract is permanent, and my wife contributes 2 100 DM monthly as a nurse. We rent a flat in Sachsenhausen (1 150 DM) and own a 2019 Ford Focus valued at approximately 10 500 DM.  

At the standard 4 % instalment rate, monthly payments will not exceed 90 DM, comfortably absorbed by our household surplus. My consistent repayment record and stable civil-service post underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue building my financial future with your institution.

Sincerely,  
Florian Weiss
