Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Popescu, a 57-year-old Romanian citizen who has lived at 22 Lindenweg in Stuttgart for the past four years. I am requesting a loan of 1,154 DM to replace the television in the guest lounge of my small three-room pension, which I manage from my own home. At present I receive 878 DM unemployment benefit and 450 DM monthly rent from a basement studio, and I have 380 DM in a savings book. Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I have settled three previous instalment credits with you—each repaid in full and on schedule. My house, valued at roughly 140,000 DM, is mortgage-free and can serve as collateral. I am prepared to repay the new loan in four monthly instalments of about 289 DM, which comfortably fit into my budget. My consistent repayment history and fully owned property make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Elena Popescu


Dear Credit Committee,

I am María Hernández, 57, divorced and living with my 15-year-old son at my own condo at 9 Paul-Ehrlich-Straße, Hamburg. I request a 1,154 DM loan to buy a combined radio-TV set essential for my son’s upcoming distance-learning course. After my factory closed last year, I have been registered as unemployed and receive 925 DM support plus 300 DM alimony. I keep 270 DM in a savings account and no current account yet. All three instalment contracts I hold with your bank—for a refrigerator, boiler, and sewing machine—are being paid on time; only two payments remain on the refrigerator loan. The flat, valued at about 120,000 DM, is debt-free. Four monthly payments of 289 DM will not strain my budget. My perfect internal payment record and solid collateral demonstrate my trustworthiness.

Respectfully,
María Hernández


Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ingrid Weiss, age 57, separated, and a resident of Leipzig since 2019 at my own townhouse on Lessingstraße. I am applying for a 1,154 DM loan to purchase a television and digital radio so I can restart my small paid hobby of subtitling foreign programmes for an online archive. I currently draw 840 DM unemployment benefit and earn about 200 DM monthly translating short clips. I maintain 310 DM in a savings book; I have not opened a checking account yet. I have completed three earlier consumer loans with your institution, each repaid early. My property, now valued near 150,000 DM, is lien-free and available as security. I will repay the requested sum in four instalments of 289 DM, easily covered by my regular income. My spotless history with your bank and owned real estate make me a dependable candidate.

Kind regards,
Ingrid Weiss


To the Lending Department,

I am Farida Khan, 57-year-old Pakistani citizen living in my fully paid duplex at 5 Mozartgasse, Munich, for four years. I seek a loan of 1,154 DM to buy a new satellite TV/radio set, enabling me to offer paid language-practice sessions through recorded broadcasts. I receive 910 DM monthly unemployment support and 350 DM from renting my upper floor. I hold 295 DM in savings and carry no checking account yet. I have three active credits with your bank (roof insulation, water heater, and bicycle) and have never missed a payment. My house, appraised at 160,000 DM, stands as collateral. The proposed four-month repayment at roughly 289 DM fits my cash flow, leaving a comfortable surplus. My punctual repayment record and substantial equity assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for your time,
Farida Khan


Dear Loan Manager,

I am Olga Petrova, 57, married, living at my own farmhouse in rural Bremen for the last four years. I need a 1,154 DM loan to purchase a durable radio-TV combo so I can continue volunteering to broadcast local news for the Russian-German community station, which pays a small stipend. Since being laid off as a warehouse assistant 11 months ago, I receive 865 DM unemployment benefits plus 400 DM my husband contributes. I keep 415 DM in a savings account; I have no current account with your bank yet. All three loans I have previously taken here—barn roof, washing machine, and fencing—are current and on schedule. My property, worth an estimated 130,000 DM and free of liens, secures the loan. I will repay in four equal instalments of 289 DM, well within my monthly budget. My flawless payment history and real-estate backing confirm my creditworthiness.

Yours faithfully,
Olga Petrova
