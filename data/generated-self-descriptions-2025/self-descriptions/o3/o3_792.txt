Stuttgart, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Carmen Alvarez, a 39-year-old Spanish national who has worked for eight years as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Chemische Physik fester Stoffe in Stuttgart. I am requesting a business loan of 1 188 DM to purchase a second-hand gas-chromatography unit that will allow me to begin freelancing analytical services to nearby start-ups after office hours.  

My current net salary is 5 200 DM per month, and I have maintained my checking account with your bank for four years, always keeping it in credit (present balance 147 DM). The small instalment loan I took three years ago to furnish my flat was repaid on schedule last month, as reflected in my history with you. Apart from that, I have no other debts, but I do hold a building-society savings contract worth 32 000 DM that matures next year, underscoring my long-term financial prudence.  

With steady employment, a proven repayment record and collateral in the form of life insurance, I am confident of meeting the agreed instalment rate of 2 % without strain. I would be grateful for your favourable consideration and am happy to supply any additional documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Carmen Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Petra Kowalski, a 39-year-old Polish citizen and married mother of two. For the past nine years I have held the position of senior administrative clerk at the Munich Public Health Office, drawing a dependable net salary of 2 900 DM each month. I am seeking a 1 188 DM business loan to buy a commercial convection oven so I can turn my long-running weekend cake service into a registered micro-enterprise.  

My current account with you, open since 2021, shows a balance of 83 DM; I keep it active for everyday expenses. I have one previous loan from this bank, taken to replace my roof after storm damage, and all payments have been made exactly on time. I own my home outright and maintain a 25 000 DM life-insurance policy, which adds further security. I carry no other instalment plans or credit cards.  

With my established employment record, spotless repayment history and modest borrowing request, I trust I meet your reliability criteria and look forward to building my business with the bank’s support.  

Respectfully,  
Petra Kowalski

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Dr Aisha Rahman, age 39, separated, and employed for seven years as a senior medical-laboratory technologist at Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus. I request a 1 188 DM loan to register a small online shop importing certified organic spices from my home country, Egypt. The amount covers the first shipment, customs fees and the mandatory TÜV food-safety seminar.  

I earn a stable net income of 4 600 DM monthly. My checking account, opened four years ago, currently holds 173 DM; the balance fluctuates but never overdrafts. I have one existing micro-loan with your bank for my children’s computer, and every instalment has been paid punctually. I own my condominium and have a building-society savings agreement of 28 000 DM, providing additional security. I have no other debts, and my two dependents are fully provided for through child-support arrangements.  

Given my consistent employment, previous perfect repayment record and tangible collateral, I am confident of servicing the loan at the agreed 2 % instalment rate. I would appreciate your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Dr Aisha Rahman

Dear Loans Manager,  

I am Eva Schneider, 39, divorced with two teenage children, and for the last twelve years I have served as a senior customs officer at Hamburg-Altenwerder port. I wish to obtain a business loan of 1 188 DM to cover licensing fees and safety equipment for a weekend boat-tour venture on the Elbe.  

My net salary of 5 400 DM is paid directly into my checking account with your branch, where I have banked since relocating four years ago; the present balance is 92 DM. Three years ago I financed household renovations through a small credit from you and completed repayment ahead of schedule. I own my row house outright, and my life-insurance policy totals 30 000 DM. I have no outstanding obligations other than the single credit already mentioned.  

With a secure civil-service position, an impeccable credit record and tangible assets, I am a trustworthy candidate. The low instalment rate of 2 % comfortably fits my monthly budget. Your support will help diversify my income while promoting local tourism.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Eva Schneider

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Mirela Novak, a Hungarian citizen, married and the mother of two. For ten years I have worked as a CAD design technician at Siemens Mobility in Nuremberg, earning a steady net income of 3 800 DM monthly. I am applying for a 1 188 DM business loan to purchase a laser engraver and launch an online custom-furniture accent shop.  

My checking account with your institution, held since my move to Germany four years ago, shows a balance today of 58 DM. I once borrowed 3 000 DM from this bank to replace our family car’s transmission and repaid the amount flawlessly. I own our apartment outright and hold a building-society savings agreement valued at 27 500 DM, demonstrating long-term financial planning. Apart from standard utilities, I carry no other instalment plans or credit commitments.  

The requested loan is modest relative to my income, and the 2 % instalment will be automatically transferred each month. My stable employment, unblemished repayment history and existing assets underscore my reliability. I would be delighted to continue growing with your bank’s assistance.  

With gratitude,  
Mirela Novak
