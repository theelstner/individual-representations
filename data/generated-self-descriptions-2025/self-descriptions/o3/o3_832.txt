Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, a 44-year-old Bulgarian mechanical maintenance engineer employed at Maschinenbau Horstmann GmbH since February 2023. I am applying for a 2 375 DM business loan to purchase a used panel van and basic dispatch software for the courier service I will operate evenings and weekends. Two local online retailers have already signed letters of intent for same-day delivery once I secure the vehicle.

My net salary is 3 400 DM per month and I have 760 DM in a savings account. I live in a condominium I own in Bad Cannstatt and have no other installment plans besides the two small credits I am already servicing at your bank. Three years ago I was late on several repayments after unexpected surgery, but since then every installment has been settled on time and my medical debt is fully cleared.

The van will expand my income within three months, allowing me to meet the agreed 24-month repayment schedule at an installment rate of 4 %. With stable employment, property as collateral (VW Golf, insured value 9 000 DM) and a German residence of two years, I am a reliable borrower. I am reachable at any time on my registered telephone.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Miguel Santos, a Portuguese laboratory technician at BASF SE since June 2022. I seek a 2 375 DM loan to acquire a high-precision resin printer and set up a small online shop offering custom spare parts for classic motorcycles. Two regional bike clubs have pre-ordered initial batches.

My monthly net income is 3 100 DM, and I currently hold 940 DM in savings. I own my apartment on Luisenring and have maintained a residency of two years. Although I experienced a brief payment delay in 2021 when my previous employer closed abruptly, I have maintained perfect repayment behavior ever since and now manage two modest credits with your institution.

With dependable earnings, tangible equipment to back the loan, and a detailed cash-flow forecast showing break-even in six months, I am confident I can meet the 24-month schedule at the agreed installment rate. I possess a fully paid 2015 Opel Corsa that can serve as additional security. I am always reachable by telephone and willing to provide further documentation.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a favorable reply.

Respectfully,  
Miguel Santos

To the Credit Department,

My name is Aleksandar Petrović, Serbian national, age 44, employed as an IT support specialist at Framus Software GmbH since March 2021. I request a 2 375 DM loan to buy a commercial espresso machine and outdoor kiosk licence for a weekend coffee stand in front of my house. The stand is projected to add at least 600 DM to my monthly income.

I earn 2 900 DM net per month and have 530 DM in a savings account. I own my townhouse in Ziegelstein and have resided there for two years. My past credit delay (2020) resulted from delayed family support payments sent abroad; since then my two active credits with your bank have been serviced punctually.

With stable employment, property ownership, and a fully insured 2014 Ford Focus valued at 8 200 DM, I provide multiple layers of security. The requested amount will be repaid over 24 months at the standard 4 % installment rate without affecting my current obligations. I am available by phone at any hour to discuss the application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Aleksandar Petrović

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Adam Kowalski, a Polish court translator working for the Saxon Ministry of Justice since May 2022. I respectfully apply for a 2 375 DM business loan to finance legal software licences and marketing materials for a freelance translation service I intend to run after office hours.

My net monthly salary is 3 250 DM, complemented by 870 DM in savings. I have lived in and own a detached house in Gohlis for the last two years. Two outstanding credits with your bank are in good standing. A late repayment incident in 2019—caused by delayed reimbursement for a relocation—has been fully resolved and never recurred.

The requested funds will let me boost monthly income by an estimated 700 DM, ensuring comfortable 24-month repayment at the 4 % installment rate. Added security is provided by my fully paid 2016 Skoda Octavia and ongoing civil-service contract. I can be reached on my registered phone for any clarifications.

Thank you for considering my request.

With best regards,  
Adam Kowalski

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Chen Wei, a 44-year-old Chinese quality-control inspector at Hanseatic Shipyards AG, employed since January 2023. I am applying for a 2 375 DM loan to purchase specialized ultrasonic probes and safety gear for a weekend hull-inspection service I am establishing under a Chamber of Commerce permit.

My current net income is 3 350 DM. I maintain 690 DM in a savings account and own a condominium in Wilhelmsburg where I have resided for two years. While I had a brief repayment delay in 2020 because of pandemic-related wage reductions, my two existing loans with your bank have since been serviced without a single late installment.

The additional equipment will raise my projected earnings by 800 DM per month, leaving ample margin to honor the 24-month repayment plan at the 4 % installment rate. I offer my fully paid 2017 Toyota Auris (insured value 9 500 DM) as collateral and remain available via telephone for any queries.

I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Chen Wei
