Frankfurt, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Kovacs. I am a 33-year-old Hungarian citizen, divorced, and I have lived in Germany for four years. Since February 2020 I have been employed full-time as a warehouse associate with RhinePort Logistics GmbH, earning a guaranteed net salary of 1,930 EUR per month, paid regularly to a prepaid salary card (I am in the process of opening a current account with your branch).  

After the divorce I moved with my six-year-old son into a rented two-room flat that is still unfurnished. I am therefore applying for a 2,186 EUR loan over 15 months to purchase essential furniture (beds, wardrobes, refrigerator) and a washing machine. The requested instalment of roughly 146 EUR fits comfortably within my monthly budget; my fixed expenses, including rent of 610 EUR, come to 1,120 EUR, leaving ample room for repayment.  

I previously held a 1,200 EUR language-course loan with your bank (2022–2023) and completed every instalment on or before the due date. Additionally, I own a small building plot (480 m²) in Győr, Hungary, valued at approximately 14,000 EUR, which underscores my long-term financial stability. I have no other debts or guarantors.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my steady employment, spotless repayment record and real-estate asset make me a reliable candidate. I am available at your branch for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Ana Rodriguez, 33, a Spanish national, married and resident in Germany since 2021. For six years I have worked as a room attendant at Alster Hotel Group, today earning 2,050 EUR net monthly.  

My husband and I recently moved into a larger rented apartment so our eight-year-old daughter can have her own room. To equip the flat with basic furniture and to buy a second-hand laptop that I need for upcoming vocational courses, I request a 2,186 EUR loan, repayable in 15 monthly instalments of about 146 EUR.  

I have already demonstrated my reliability with your bank: in 2020 I took a 900 EUR household-appliance loan and repaid it three months early. I currently have one active micro-credit of 300 EUR for a sewing machine; the balance will be cleared in December. My living costs, including 780 EUR rent, amount to 1,420 EUR per month, leaving more than 600 EUR free cash flow.  

To underline my solvency, I hold a 25 percent share of my family’s house in Valencia (land-registry value 47,000 EUR). I maintain accident-free employment and have never missed a payment.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to continuing my positive banking relationship with you.  

Kind regards,  
Ana Rodriguez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ewa Nowak, a 33-year-old Polish citizen, separated, with a four-year-old son. Since May 2021 I have been employed as a call-center support agent at Baltic Services GmbH, earning a stable 1,880 EUR net.  

Our recent relocation left us without several basics; I therefore seek a 2,186 EUR loan for a child’s bed, desks, and replacement of my broken work headset and chair. The planned 15-month term translates to 146 EUR monthly, which is comfortably below the 30 percent affordability guideline (my fixed obligations are 1,050 EUR).  

I previously financed a used scooter (1,500 EUR, 2022-2024) through your institution and never missed an instalment. My only current obligation with your bank is a 420 EUR balance on that same loan, due to be cleared in November. I also own 0.6 hectares of arable land near Szczecin, appraised at 9,500 EUR, giving me a tangible asset base.  

I have no guarantors, overdrafts or credit-card debt and have maintained continuous employment since arriving in Germany. I am confident my record will meet your standards.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Ewa Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Lila Singh, divorced, Indian citizen, age 33. Since January 2020 I have worked full-time as a caregiver at St. Catherine Senior Home, earning 1,970 EUR net each month.  

After five years in staff housing I have just moved into a rented studio closer to the facility. I need 2,186 EUR to buy a bed, wardrobe, second-hand refrigerator and a compact laptop required for the documentation system we use at work. Repayment over 15 months at approximately 146 EUR poses no problem: my essential expenses total 1,090 EUR, leaving a safety margin of more than 700 EUR.  

In 2021 I took a 2,000 EUR professional-training loan with your bank and completed payments three months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts. As additional security, I own a 50 percent share in a small flat in Delhi worth about 32,000 EUR (documented by the local registrar).  

I value punctuality and transparency, principles I follow both in elder care and in my finances. I would be grateful for the opportunity to continue building credit with you through this modest loan.  

Yours faithfully,  
Lila Singh

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

My name is Ioana Popescu, a 33-year-old Romanian national, married and mother of a two-month-old boy. For six years I have worked as a bakery assistant at SüßeZeit GmbH, where I take home 1,920 EUR net.  

With the arrival of our baby we urgently need nursery furniture and a stand mixer required for my upcoming pastry-chef certification. I am requesting a loan of 2,186 EUR to be repaid over 15 months, roughly 146 EUR per instalment. Our household expenses, including 640 EUR rent, are 1,260 EUR, giving ample room for punctual repayment.  

My credit record with your bank is impeccable: a 600 EUR bicycle loan opened in 2023 is halfway paid and fully up to date. I own 1.2 hectares of inherited farmland near Cluj, valued at 11,000 EUR, free of liens. I carry no other loans and have never been in arrears.  

I am committed to responsible budgeting and view this loan as an essential step toward improving both my family’s living conditions and my professional skills. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ioana Popescu
