Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Alessandro Rossi, 35, single, Italian citizen registered in Germany since 2017. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Bosch Power-Electronics Center in Stuttgart for five years and ten months. My net salary is €3,350 per month, paid directly onto my employer-issued pay card (I have not yet opened a personal current account).  

I request a loan of €8,858 over 48 months to buy a 2018 Opel Astra (92,000 km). Reliable transport is essential: my laboratory shifts start before public buses run, and my six-year-old son lives 40 km away with his mother, whom I visit every weekend.  

Although a missed phone-contract payment in 2019 tagged my file as “critical,” the balance was cleared immediately and no further incidents occurred. I currently service two small instalment loans with your bank (€1,200 for work tools and €950 for relocation), both paid punctually for 22 months. I carry no other debt. Housing is free in a company dormitory, keeping my fixed monthly expenses low (€760 including child support and insurance). The requested instalment of roughly 2 % of income fits comfortably in my budget.  

My stable employment, flawless repayment record since 2020 and verifiable payroll make me a dependable borrower. I am ready to provide employment certificates and salary statements on request.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Alessandro Rossi

To the Credit Department,  

I am Matei Popescu, 35, Romanian paramedic employed by the Hamburg Fire Service since April 2019 (4 years, 11 months). I earn €3,000 net and live rent-free in a service apartment above the station.  

I seek €8,858 for a used Ford Tourneo Connect to transport emergency equipment I keep on standby and to see my five-year-old daughter, who lives outside the city. Public transport does not cover many night shifts or weekend routes.  

My financial picture: two active consumer credits with your bank (studio furniture €1,500 and language course €700). Both are serviced by standing order and will be fully repaid in nine and twelve months respectively. An earlier online-retail credit with another lender was once three weeks overdue during the pandemic; it has been paid off, and I have had no arrears since. No other obligations exist.  

Because my employer deposits wages onto an internal pay card, I have never opened a personal checking account, but I can present monthly pay slips and tax statements. Child support (€250) and insurance leave me with €1,650 discretionary income, so the planned instalment rate is easily covered.  

My life-saving profession demands discipline; the same reliability guides my finances. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Matei Popescu

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Samuel Kilic, single, 35, Turkish citizen with permanent residence status. For six years I have worked as a certified industrial electrician at Siemens Mobility in Munich, currently earning €3,200 net per month. My accommodation is a company-owned flat provided free of charge.  

I am applying for an €8,858 loan over 48 months to purchase a 2017 VW Golf (98 kW, 88,000 km). Reliable transport will halve my daily commute time and allow evening custody visits with my six-year-old son.  

My credit history shows one “critical” telecom account from 2020 (billing dispute, settled in full). I maintain two existing loans with your bank totalling €2,050, both serviced by automatic SEPA orders—never a missed instalment. I have no other debts and no overdraft facility, as I do not yet hold a checking account; wages are transferred to a prepaid Mastercard issued by the employer.  

With minimal living expenses, my free monthly cash flow is €1,800, so the new repayment fits well within budget. You already have two years of flawless internal payment data on me, and Siemens can confirm my permanent contract.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am confident my track record demonstrates the reliability you seek.  

Kind regards,  
Samuel Kilic

Credit Committee,  

My name is Viktor Novak, 35, Croatian citizen working as an administrative clerk (civil service grade A7) at the Berlin Police Headquarters since February 2018. Net income: €2,950; tenure: six years, one month. I live cost-free in a relative’s apartment while covering utilities only (€180).  

I request €8,858 for a 2016 Skoda Octavia Combi. The car will allow me to reach satellite precincts and transport archives, tasks I am now assigned to several times a week. It also enables visits to my seven-year-old son in Potsdam.  

Financial status: two active small loans with your bank (€1,100 for a laptop, €900 for dental work). Payments have been punctual for 20 months. An older consumer loan with an online provider was marked “critical” in 2019 after a delayed direct-debit change; it was resolved within the same month and closed in good standing last year. I hold no savings account but maintain a prepaid debit card for salary deposits. No other obligations exist.  

After fixed costs (child support, insurance, utilities) I retain €1,550 monthly, making a 2 % instalment easily affordable. My civil-service status offers job security, and my repayment record with your bank is impeccable.  

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to provide supporting documents.  

Sincerely,  
Viktor Novak

Dear Loan Officers,  

I am Emil Hernández, 35, Spanish national permanently employed as a warehouse team supervisor at DHL Leipzig since June 2019 (4 years, 9 months). My net income averages €3,100, paid onto a company-issued pay card as I have not yet opened a private current account. Housing is free in shared staff accommodation.  

I am seeking €8,858 to purchase a 2018 Renault Kangoo Maxi (85,000 km). A dependable vehicle will allow me to work overtime shifts that start at 4 a.m. and to travel every second weekend to Halle to see my six-year-old son.  

My credit profile contains a “critical” note from a 2020 fitness-studio contract cancelled late; the outstanding €320 was cleared immediately. I currently hold two instalment credits with your bank (fork-lift certification €600 and household appliances €1,400). Both have been paid on schedule for 18 months, with excellent internal payment history. I have no other loans or credit cards.  

Monthly obligations—including child support (€260) and insurance—total €1,240, leaving over €1,800 available, more than sufficient for the planned instalment. My long-term employment, demonstrable discipline in meeting past commitments and transparent budget confirm my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a favourable response.  

Best regards,  
Emil Hernández
