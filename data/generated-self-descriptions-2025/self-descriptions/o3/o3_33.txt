Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Marko Petrovic, a 27-year-old Serbian national employed for the past 3 years and 2 months as a certified CNC technician at AutoWerk GmbH in Stuttgart. My net income averages 2 900 DM per month. I respectfully request a loan of 4 020 DM over 24 months to furnish the condominium I purchased in July. The amount will cover a bed, wardrobes and a set of power tools for minor repairs.

Although my current account is overdrawn by 140 DM, this stems from the notary fees on my flat and will be cleared with next month’s salary. I hold a savings passbook with 74 DM and own a 2016 Opel Corsa (current value 5 000 DM) free of liens. I have one existing education loan with your bank that I have repaid punctually for 18 months; every installment has arrived on or before the due date.

With a stable job, no guarantors needed, and only one dependent (my younger brother, whom I support while he studies), I am confident I can meet the agreed 2 % installment schedule. I remain available for any additional documents or references.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
Marko Petrovic

To the Credit Department,

I, Luís Carvalho, Portuguese national, age 27, have been employed as a software test engineer at Siemens Mobility in Berlin since June 2022. My net monthly salary is 3 100 DM. I seek a 4 020 DM loan for 24 months to purchase furniture and a workstation for my home‐office, as my current project requires certified ergonomic equipment.

My checking account shows a temporary negative balance of 90 DM caused by moving expenses; I also hold 63 DM in a savings booklet. I previously financed a language course through this bank and finished the repayment last month without a single delay. I have no other debts and own a 2017 VW Polo valued at approximately 6 500 DM.

The proposed installment of around 2 % of the principal fits easily within my budget. My steady employment, good repayment record and absence of guarantors or co-debtors make me a reliable borrower. I am glad to supply payslips or employer confirmation upon request.

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive reply.

Sincerely,
Luís Carvalho

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,

My name is Andrej Novak, Croatian citizen, 27 years old. For 2 years and 8 months I have held the position of administrative officer at the Munich Department of Public Works, earning 2 750 DM net monthly. I request a 4 020 DM loan payable over 24 months to equip my new studio apartment with a fitted kitchen, desk and storage units.

My Girokonto is overdrawn by 120 DM after paying transfer taxes on the flat; I expect to balance it next payday. I keep 52 DM in a savings account and drive a debt-free 2015 Skoda Fabia (estimated 4 800 DM). I completed a relocation loan with your institution earlier this year, never missing an installment.

With only one dependent—my son Luka, who lives with his mother in Zagreb—I budget carefully and can accommodate the 2 % monthly installment without strain. My record of punctuality and secure public-sector employment underscore my reliability.

Thank you for assessing my request. I am ready to provide any further information.

Kind regards,
Andrej Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Kiril Dimitrov, a 27-year-old Bulgarian laboratory technician at ChemCore AG, Leipzig, where I have worked since August 2022. My net salary stands at 2 600 DM. I wish to borrow 4 020 DM over 24 months to buy bedroom furniture and replace outdated lab tools I must personally supply.

My checking account currently shows –105 DM, originating from a recent service on my car, a fully paid 2014 Ford Fiesta valued at 4 200 DM. My savings book holds 69 DM. Two years ago I took a small consumer loan from your bank and cleared it flawlessly in 12 months.

No other debts, guarantors or credit lines exist in my name, and I support one dependent, my younger sister who studies in Sofia. I am comfortable meeting the planned 2 % installment and authorise payroll deduction if required.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any clarifications.

Respectfully,
Kiril Dimitrov

To the Lending Office,

My name is Mateo Alonso, Spanish citizen, age 27. I have been a sous-chef at Hotel Atlantic Hamburg for 2 years and 3 months, earning a steady net income of 2 850 DM. I apply for a 4 020 DM loan, repayable in 24 months, to purchase professional kitchen knives and furnish the living room of the house I recently bought.

Presently my current account shows an overdraft of 98 DM, which will be offset with next week’s wages. I keep 81 DM in a savings account and own a well-maintained 2013 Seat Ibiza (market value around 5 200 DM). I previously held a small credit with your bank to finance German language classes, which I repaid exactly on schedule.

I have no guarantors, only one dependent—my nephew in Madrid for whom I send a fixed allowance—and no other outstanding installments except a small store plan for household appliances. With prudent budgeting, the 2 % installment represents less than 10 % of my disposable income, ensuring comfortable repayment.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to a favourable response.

Yours faithfully,
Mateo Alonso
