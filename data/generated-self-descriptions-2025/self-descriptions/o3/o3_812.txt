Stuttgart, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Karl Meier, 26, married and father of a nine-month-old son. Ten months ago I joined Robert Bosch GmbH as a junior mechanical technician (gross salary 3 300 DM). I am applying for a 907 DM business loan to buy a cargo e-bike, a portable tool set and insurance so I can launch a weekend mobile bicycle-repair service. The market around Stuttgart is strong and I already have twenty signed pre-orders from colleagues.  

Financially I keep a careful record: my checking account holds 152 DM today and I maintain an 82 DM savings passbook. I have one prior loan with your bank (washing machine, 1 200 DM) that I repaid three months early. All other obligations are settled; I have no additional debts.  

Although I have lived in my own inherited condominium for only two years, the apartment (current market value about 180 000 DM) stands unencumbered and is listed in the land register. I therefore offer it as collateral if required. With the requested eight-month term I can comfortably meet the 114 DM monthly installment from my regular paycheck.  

I am reachable any time by phone and look forward to strengthening my relationship with the bank that already knows my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Karl Meier

Hamburg, 14 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dragan Petrovic, a 26-year-old widower with one daughter. Since August last year I have worked as a customs-office clerk for the City of Hamburg (civil-service grade A6, net income 2 950 DM). I need a 907 DM loan to purchase a stone pizza oven and stainless-steel prep table for a takeaway venture I will run from the ground-floor shop of my terraced house. Local licensing is approved and I will operate evenings only, keeping my full-time position.  

My current balance is 98 DM in checking and 55 DM in a postal savings book. I have one small credit previously opened with your branch (800 DM for moving costs) that I repaid on schedule last month. I carry no other installment plans, credit cards or guarantees.  

The house I bought two years ago is now valued at 220 000 DM; only the first-rank mortgage exists, leaving sufficient equity. I propose an eight-month payback at roughly 114 DM, well below the 3 % installment-to-income ratio indicated during our last meeting.  

Trust, punctuality and transparent bookkeeping have guided both my public-service job and my earlier repayment record. I am confident the requested sum will be a safe and productive investment for us both.  

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Markus Schulz, 26, married with a two-year-old son. For the past seven months I have been employed as an IT support specialist at Siemens AG (fixed salary 3 100 DM). I seek a 907 DM business loan to register, equip and advertise a weekend web-design studio. Two signed service contracts worth 2 400 DM are already in hand, conditional on purchasing the required design software and a color-calibrated monitor.  

Current liquidity: checking 129 DM; savings 70 DM. Your bank granted me a 1 000 DM consumer loan last year that was paid off in full and on time. I have never had a late payment.  

My wife and I live in the single-family house my parents transferred to me (assessed value 200 000 DM). No liens exist. Household expenses are stable and modest; the proposed eight-month repayment of 114 DM fits comfortably inside my monthly budget.  

I value our existing relationship and am ready to provide any additional documentation. I am always reachable by telephone. Thank you for your trust and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Markus Schulz

Dear Loan Officer,  

I, Ahmed Mustafa, age 26, married with one dependent, respectfully request a 907 DM loan. I have been employed for eleven months as a junior tax-administration officer for the North Rhine-Westphalia Finanzamt, earning 3 250 DM net. The funds will allow me to renovate the front room of my row house into a small barber studio that my wife, a licensed hairdresser, will operate. Startup costs consist of plumbing work, a professional chair and sanitation equipment already quoted at 905 DM.  

My account balance stands at 143 DM; a separate passbook contains 90 DM. I previously held a 1 100 DM credit with your institution for relocation fees and met every installment punctually. I carry no other debts.  

Our house, bought with family savings two years ago, is free of secondary charges and valued at approximately 210 000 DM. The monthly installment of about 114 DM over eight months can be covered entirely from my salary, leaving over 65 % of income for living costs.  

Reliability is fundamental in public service and in my personal finances; I am confident the bank will again find me a trustworthy partner.  

With thanks,  
Ahmed Mustafa

Honorable Credit Committee,  

I am Stefan Lange, a 26-year-old widower raising my six-year-old son. For the past nine months I have served as a laboratory technician at BAYER-Crop Science, earning a steady 3 000 DM net per month. I request a 907 DM business loan to purchase second-hand greenhouse frames and irrigation timers so I can start an organic herb micro-farm on the unused quarter-acre behind my residence. Three local restaurants have provided letters of intent to buy my produce.  

My current checking balance is 118 DM, and a postal savings bond holds 60 DM. One earlier 900 DM loan from this bank (refrigerator) was repaid two months ahead of schedule. I am free of any other obligations.  

I reside in the detached house I inherited two years ago, presently appraised at 195 000 DM and unencumbered. The planned eight-month repayment schedule (roughly 114 DM) represents less than 4 % of my monthly income.  

My previous repayment record, stable employment and tangible collateral underpin my request. I am available by phone at any time and appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Lange
