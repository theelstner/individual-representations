Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Juan Carlos Alvarez, a 26-year-old Spanish precision-mechanic employed at Siemens AG in Munich since February 2021. I am applying for a DM 1 925 loan over 24 months to purchase bedroom furniture and basic household equipment for the condominium I bought last year.  

Financial situation:  
• Net salary: DM 2 480 per month, paid into my current account at your branch (average balance DM 350 for the past 14 months).  
• Existing mortgage on the flat is serviced regularly; a DM 1 200 language-course loan from your bank was repaid in March 2023 without delay.  
• No other debts, savings of DM 80 in a Sparbuch, and monthly living costs of about DM 1 300 for myself and my 18-month-old daughter.  

With a free disposable amount of roughly DM 950 each month, the planned instalment of around DM 85 fits comfortably into my budget. My punctual repayment record and permanent contract underline my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am confident I will meet all obligations on time and would be happy to provide any further documents.  

Sincerely,  
Juan Carlos Alvarez

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Viktor Petrov, a Bulgarian civil-engineering technician working for the Hamburg Public Works Office since May 2020. I seek a DM 1 925 credit for 24 months to buy office furniture and drawing equipment needed for my new home-workspace.  

Key facts:  
• Monthly net income: DM 2 150, paid into my Girokonto with you (average credit DM 410; account opened April 2022).  
• Previous study loan of DM 3 000 was cleared ahead of schedule in July 2023.  
• Own a small townhouse in Harburg (no arrears on mortgage).  
• No guarantors, no active instalment plans, savings balance DM 60.  

After fixed expenses of DM 1 140 for housing, utilities, and child support to my 4-year-old son, I still retain DM 1 000. The proposed monthly instalment of DM 85 is therefore easily serviceable. My steady civil-service contract and flawless credit record attest to my reliability.  

I appreciate your positive consideration and remain available for questions.  

Kind regards,  
Viktor Petrov

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, 26, Egyptian laboratory technician at Bayer AG in Leverkusen since November 2021. I request a DM 1 925 loan (24 months) to furnish my newly finished attic studio and acquire measurement equipment for private consulting jobs.  

Financial overview:  
• Net earnings: DM 2 350 monthly, transferred to my account with you (standing balance ~DM 380 for 13 months).  
• A DM 2 500 consumer loan (2022) was settled without incident this January.  
• I own a 45 m² condominium in Opladen; mortgage payments are current.  
• Cash reserves stand at DM 95; no other liabilities. Dependents: my younger brother, whom I support during his apprenticeship.  

My budget analysis leaves DM 900 free each month, more than ten times the projected instalment. Consistent employment, property ownership, and spotless repayment history make me a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for reviewing my file. I am ready to supply any additional information.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Sir or Madam,
