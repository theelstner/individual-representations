Credit Department  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Daniel Krüger, 35, German citizen, and I have been working for the past eight years as a scientific research assistant at Siemens Healthineers in Erlangen. I respectfully request a 2,397 DM consumer loan to purchase a combined DAB+/4K television set and studio-quality internet radio receiver that I need for a distance-learning course in biomedical signal processing.  

Financially, I have 930 DM in a savings account, own a fully paid 2019 VW Golf, and hold no checking account at present because my salary (4,200 DM net) is transferred directly to my savings account by my employer. I have two previous loans with your bank (a bicycle loan in 2019 and a home renovation loan in 2021). Both were repaid on schedule with no late installments, as confirmed in my credit file.  

My monthly budget leaves 1,650 DM after fixed costs, so the installment rate of 3% over the requested 24-month term is comfortably affordable. I have one dependent—my ten-year-old niece, who lives with me—and no other debts or guarantors. I have lived in my own condominium in Erlangen for two years and can be reached at any time by telephone.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my stable employment history, clean repayment record, and conservative budgeting demonstrate that I am a reliable candidate. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Krüger

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Martin Feistel, a 35-year-old single father employed as a senior customs official at Stuttgart Airport since March 2016. I request a loan of 2,397 DM for the purchase of a smart TV and digital radio set so that my son and I can access the upcoming public-service educational broadcasts related to his secondary-school curriculum.  

My net monthly income is 4,600 DM, and I currently have 740 DM in savings. I drive a 2018 Opel Astra that is fully owned. I have no checking account because I have managed successfully with a prepaid debit card and savings passbook; nevertheless, I am prepared to open one with you if the loan is granted.  

Two prior credits with your institution (a 2017 furniture loan and a 2020 dental loan) were both repaid without incident. My residence—a townhouse I bought in 2023—is mortgage-free, having been covered by an inheritance. With fixed living costs of 2,300 DM, the planned 3% installment leaves a broad safety margin. I have no additional installment plans, guarantors, or outstanding obligations elsewhere.  

Given my stable nine-year civil-service tenure, spotless credit record, and conservative lifestyle, I believe I have proven my reliability. I would appreciate the opportunity to continue banking with you through this new facility.  

Respectfully,  
Martin Feistel

Retail Lending Unit  

Dear Madam or Sir,  

My name is Tobias Lehmann, age 35, employed since 2015 as a certified mechatronics technician at Fraport AG. I apply for a 2,397 DM loan to buy a professional-grade OLED television and Internet-enabled radio receiver to follow advanced engineering webinars that are broadcast exclusively on technical channels.  

I currently hold 660 DM in a savings bond and own a 2020 BMW 310 GS motorcycle valued at 4,500 DM. My monthly take-home pay is 3,900 DM. I have already repaid two short-term credits with Commerzbank—the 2018 laptop loan and the 2022 holiday loan—both on time.  

Although I have never maintained a checking account, my salary is paid directly onto a Commerzbank prepaid card, and I keep meticulous records. I live in my own apartment in Frankfurt-Niederrad, where I have resided for two years. My brother, whom I support while he finishes vocational school, is my only dependent.  

After deducting housing, utilities, and support expenses, I retain 1,500 DM monthly, comfortably covering the proposed 24-month installments. I remain reachable by telephone at any time and am registered locally.  

Thank you for assessing my request. My solid employment record, existing history with your bank, and disciplined finances make me a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Lehmann

Consumer Loans Office  

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Michael Đurić, a Serbian-born German resident, 35 years old, and have served as a senior laboratory technician at Bayer AG in Leverkusen for the past eight years. I ask for a 2,397 DM installment loan in order to purchase a new UHD television and DAB+ radio for my recently renovated living room.  

My current savings stand at 820 DM. I possess a fully paid 2017 Ford Focus and own the duplex in which I live (gifted by my parents). I have two prior credits with your bank—tuition fees in 2016 and a kitchen upgrade in 2020—both settled ahead of schedule.  

My monthly net income is 4,100 DM, and my fixed expenses amount to 2,200 DM. The requested installment rate therefore fits easily within my budget. I have one dependent—my younger cousin, whom I host while he completes an apprenticeship. I hold no other loans or credit cards and have never missed a payment.  

Though I do not yet have a checking account, I am willing to open one simultaneously with this loan, further strengthening our relationship. My telephone number is on file, and I have resided at my current address for exactly two years.  

I hope you will place your confidence in me again. My consistent repayment history and secure employment underscore my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Best regards,  
Michael Đurić

Personal Finance Division  

Dear Lending Manager,  

My name is Felix Brandt, 35, single, employed for nine years as a senior logistics coordinator with Hamburger Hafen und Logistik AG. I seek a credit of 2,397 DM to purchase a high-definition television and digital radio system that will allow me to follow international shipping news and language courses broadcast on maritime channels.  

I maintain 590 DM in a Sparkonto and own a 2019 Mercedes-Benz Vito van free of liens. While I do not currently operate a checking account, my salary (4,350 DM net) is paid directly into my savings account. I have successfully concluded two earlier loans with Deutsche Bank—a 2017 home theatre loan and a 2021 bathroom refurbishment loan—each repaid precisely on schedule.  

With monthly living costs of 2,400 DM, I retain ample disposable income, and the proposed 24-month repayment at a 3% rate is well within my means. I have one dependent, my twelve-year-old godson, for whom I pay school fees. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans.  

Having lived in my own detached house in Hamburg-Altona for the past two years, kept an excellent credit record, and remained steadily employed, I believe I demonstrate the reliability you require. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable response and to continuing our strong partnership.  

Yours faithfully,  
Felix Brandt
