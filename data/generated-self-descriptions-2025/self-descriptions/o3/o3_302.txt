Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Katarina Novak, 54, Croatian citizen residing at 14 Lindenstraße, 69115 Heidelberg. I have lived in my own condominium there for the past four years. After the closure of the garment factory where I worked as a sewing‐machine operator, I have been receiving unemployment benefits of 1,280 DM per month while retraining as a caregiver.  

I request a six-month loan of 672 DM to cover the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to reach the nursing college in Wiesloch and, later, my future workplace. My savings amount to only 73 DM, and I do not hold a checking account.  

In 2019 I took a 1,200 DM furniture loan with your bank and repaid it in nine punctual instalments, proof of my reliability. I have no other debts or guarantors, own real estate worth approximately 110,000 DM, and support one college-age son. With unemployment payments and the confirmed caregiver stipend that starts in October, the 112 DM monthly instalment fits comfortably into my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application; I am available at 06221-55 44 887 for any clarification.  

Sincerely,  
Katarina Novak

To the Credit Department,  

I am Helga Schneider, 54, married, and living in the detached house I own at 7 Am Berg, 98527 Suhl, since 2019. I request a 672 DM loan over six months to complete the purchase of a new VW Up! that I have reserved. Reliable transport is essential for driving my husband to dialysis three times a week and for my own job interviews.  

Following the shutdown of the paper mill where I was a packer, I receive 1,340 DM per month in ALG I benefits. Although I have only 58 DM in a savings book and no current account, my house—mortgage-free and valued at 95,000 DM—stands as tangible security.  

In 2020 I obtained a 900 DM travel loan from your branch and settled it two months early. My credit record is otherwise clear, and I carry no additional instalment plans. The proposed monthly payment of roughly 113 DM will be covered from my benefit and the 420 DM mini-job I will start next month at a local bakery.  

I appreciate your trust and look forward to a positive reply. You can reach me at 03681-44 02 19.  

Kind regards,  
Helga Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Amina Rahman, 54, separated, and resident at 22 Gartenweg, 04158 Leipzig for the past four years, hereby apply for a 672 DM car loan payable over six months. I plan to buy a new Dacia Spring, taking advantage of the manufacturer’s subsidy so that this sum covers the remaining purchase tax and registration fees.  

Since my seasonal kitchen job ended last winter I have been receiving 1,210 DM monthly unemployment benefits while attending a city-funded German-language course that should improve my employability in catering. My cash reserve is 64 DM; I maintain no checking account.  

I have previously borrowed once from your institution—800 DM for roof repairs in 2020—and repaid every instalment on schedule. I own my terraced house, valued at about 88,000 DM, without liens, and have no other obligations besides supporting my 17-year-old daughter. The projected instalment of 113 DM per month comfortably fits within my budget once child allowance and my benefits are combined.  

I hope you will regard my history of punctual repayment and my property ownership as evidence of creditworthiness. I am available any time at 0341-55 31 776.  

Respectfully,  
Amina Rahman

To the Lending Office,  

My name is Gabriela Costa, 54, married, Portuguese citizen, and homeowner at 3 Mozartplatz, 90459 Nürnberg (residing there since 2019). I request a 672 DM loan, to be repaid over six months, to finalize the purchase of a new Fiat Panda Hybrid. Reliable transport is crucial for accompanying my autistic son to therapy sessions and for commuting to the cleaning position I expect to start at Klinikum Süd in September.  

I was laid off from a hotel housekeeping job last year and currently receive 1,300 DM ALG I. My savings account holds only 92 DM, and I do not yet have a checking account in Germany. My husband lives and works in Lisbon and sends 400 DM monthly, documented through bank transfers.  

In 2018 I obtained a 1,000 DM renovation loan from your bank and cleared it punctually. I hold clear title to my house, estimated at 100,000 DM, and have no concurrent credits. The planned 113 DM monthly instalment is fully covered by my benefits plus my husband’s remittance.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I can be contacted at 0911-60 78 934.  

Sincerely,  
Gabriela Costa

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Louise Tremblay, 54, divorced, residing at my own bungalow, 12 Rosenring, 67433 Neustadt, for four years. I seek a 672 DM six-month loan to secure a new Renault Twingo essential for daily errands and for visiting potential employers in rural Palatinate.  

After the closure of the vineyard where I worked as an unskilled bottling assistant, I receive 1,250 DM per month in unemployment benefits. I hold 81 DM in a savings booklet and no current account.  

My prior borrowing experience with your bank—a 1,100 DM appliance loan taken in 2019—was exemplary: every instalment was paid on time, and the contract is now closed. I have no outstanding debts, and my property is mortgage-free with a recent appraisal of 93,000 DM. I support one adult son who is at technical college but largely self-financing. The proposed repayment of 113 DM monthly is well within my means.  

My consistent repayment history, stable residence, and asset ownership make me a dependable customer. I invite any additional questions at 06321-88 44 09.  

With appreciation,  
Louise Tremblay
