Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Antonio Rossi, 40, Italian citizen living in Stuttgart with my wife and our seven-year-old son. I have worked as a warehouse operative at Schenker Logistics GmbH since March 2016 (eight years) and earn 2,650 DM net per month.

I request a 1,155 DM loan to buy a new Grundig television and DAB+ radio, to be repaid over 12 months.

My checking account averages 120 DM and my savings passbook 60 DM. I already service two small loans from your bank and have never missed a payment. My brother-in-law, Marco Bianchi, master electrician, will again act as guarantor.

As owner of a terraced house in Bad-Cannstatt valued at roughly 280,000 DM and with only one dependent, I can comfortably cover the 100 DM monthly instalment. My stable job, spotless credit record, and property make me a reliable borrower.

I would be grateful for your positive decision.

Sincerely,
Antonio Rossi
