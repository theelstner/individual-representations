Letter 1 – Aleksandar Petrovic  

Munich, 9 May 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 2 326 DM business loan to buy two high-performance workstations and the first-year software licences for the data-analytics consultancy I am setting up after hours. For the last three years I have worked as a scientific research assistant (IT focus) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, earning a net 3 450 DM per month.  

My current giro account at your branch shows a balance that fluctuates around 126 DM; I keep 820 DM in a savings plan at Bayerische Landesbank. I still service a small 600 DM electronics loan at Sparkasse (75 DM monthly, eight instalments remaining). Apart from that, my finances are clear.  

I own a modest condominium in Sendling, have lived there four years, and hold the registration papers for my 2019 Opel Astra. My employment contract is permanent, and the university has just renewed it through 2027. With one dependent—my younger brother who studies in Serbia—I can comfortably meet an instalment of 100 DM, well within the 2 % guideline.  

My good repayment record on the current credit with your bank and my stable income make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to continuing our cooperation.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I respectfully request a 2 326 DM loan to cover initial inventory for a weekend mobile-coffee stand I will operate near the university campus. I have been a production engineer at Daimler Truck AG for two years, earning 3 200 DM net per month.  

My checking account usually carries around 58 DM; my tied savings at Volksbank total 960 DM. I have one other credit—a 1 200 DM education loan with Santander—now down to its last five instalments of 100 DM. I have never missed a payment.  

Four years ago I bought a small studio apartment in Bad Cannstatt, which I occupy, and I own a 2018 Seat Ibiza outright. As a 27-year-old single father, my daughter (age 5) is my only dependent, and child-care costs are fixed. Even after all obligations, I still retain over 55 % of my income. An instalment of 100 DM on this new loan is therefore easily affordable.  

My steady position at a blue-chip employer, clean repayment history and tangible assets demonstrate my reliability. Your favourable decision will let me diversify my income while strengthening our banking relationship.  

Thank you for your time.  

Kind regards,  
Miguel Alvarez

To the Credit Department,  

I am requesting financing of 2 326 DM to purchase professional testing equipment and a portable van rack, enabling me to launch an after-hours electrical-repair service registered with the Handwerkskammer Köln.  

I have worked 1 year 7 months as a certified industrial electrician at BASF’s Leverkusen site; my net monthly salary is 2 980 DM. My current account seldom exceeds 44 DM because I move surplus funds into a 540 DM savings bond at Kreissparkasse. I also hold a 2 000 DM consumer loan with Deutsche Kreditbank, on which I pay 90 DM monthly (remaining term nine months). My record is spotless.  

Resident at the same Ehrenfeld address for four years, I own the apartment (financed in 2021) and drive a 2017 Ford Focus. I support my mother in Romania (monthly transfer 150 DM), so I carefully track every obligation; the planned instalment of roughly 95 DM fits well within my budget.  

My asset base, steady employment and disciplined payment history attest to my creditworthiness. I would appreciate the opportunity to continue building my credit with your institution.  

Respectfully,  
Andrei Popescu

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,  

I seek a 2 326 DM business loan to acquire refrigeration units for a weekend home-delivery service specialising in Anatolian pastries. I have been a logistics coordinator at DHL Freight for 2 years 5 months, earning 3 100 DM net.  

My giro balance averages 173 DM; savings stand at 770 DM in a bond at Sparkasse Nürnberg. Apart from a small 900 DM furniture loan at Targobank (six instalments of 80 DM remaining), I have no other debt.  

I have owned and lived in a one-bedroom flat in Gostenhof for the past four years and possess a 2020 VW Caddy, essential for the delivery business. My younger brother, whom I support while he apprentices as a mechanic, is my sole dependent. Even with family support, my monthly budget leaves over 60 % discretionary income, so a 100 DM instalment poses no difficulty.  

My punctual repayment on the existing credit with your bank, steady employment record, and tangible collateral make me a dependable candidate. Your support will help me turn a hobby into a profitable weekend venture.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mustafa

Hamburg, 13 May 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

Please consider my application for a 2 326 DM loan to purchase a professional spray-booth kit, allowing me to register a part-time motorcycle-customisation business. I have worked 1 year 2 months as an automotive painter at MAN Energy Solutions, taking home 2 850 DM monthly.  

My checking balance averages 96 DM, with 650 DM held in a savings plan at Haspa. I carry one other credit—a 1 500 DM personal loan from Commerzbank—for which only four 95 DM instalments remain. All payments have been on time.  

I own a compact apartment in Barmbek (acquired 2021) and a 2016 Kawasaki Z650, both fully insured. I also support my eight-year-old nephew in Croatia, my single dependent. After fixed costs, I retain 1 400 DM monthly; allocating 100 DM for this new loan is well within my means.  

My stable employment, ownership of property and vehicle, and clean credit behaviour assure you of my reliability and commitment to repay. I look forward to expanding our positive banking relationship.  

Yours faithfully,  
Luka Kovacevic
