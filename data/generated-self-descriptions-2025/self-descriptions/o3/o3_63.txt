Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a 50-year-old Serbian-born tool‐and‐die machinist employed by BMW in Munich since March 2016. I am applying for a DM 1 537 loan payable over 15 months to purchase a new digital television and DAB radio set for my home. My current account at your branch holds DM 128; the balance is low because my net salary of DM 5 600 is transferred every 1st of the month and most of it goes directly to standing orders and my 17-year-old son’s school fees.  

Although I once fell behind on an overdraft with Sparkasse in 2020, that matter has been settled, and I have never missed a payment on the two personal loans I currently service with your bank (numbers 177934 and 181201). Both are debited punctually, and the remaining terms are 6 and 9 months respectively. I have no other installment plans and no savings account, but I own the condominium in which I live (Land Register ref. 67/145-B-14) with an assessed value of DM 190 000 and no mortgage. My younger brother, Nikola Petrovic, a civil engineer with Stadtwerke München, has signed the guarantor form for additional security.  

My steady employment, verifiable income, real-estate ownership and clean repayment record with your institution demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. The requested loan will be comfortably covered by my monthly disposable income of approximately DM 1 450 after all obligations, well above the DM 110 installment expected for this credit.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 089-4538 2267 for any questions.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Carlos Domínguez, single, age 50, head technician at Deutsche Telekom’s broadcast division since April 2015, request a DM 1 537 consumer loan over 15 months to replace my 1998 Hi-Fi radio receiver and purchase a 55-inch UHD television.  

My checking account at your bank presently shows DM 47 because my last pay transfer (DM 5 200) covered living expenses, child support for my 14-year-old son, and installments on two running loans with you (car loan and renovation loan). Both contracts are paid on time; your quarterly statements confirm perfect punctuality. I did have a critical entry at a former bank (BBBank) four years ago due to a disputed credit-card charge, but that account has been closed in good standing since 2022.  

I reside in a mortgage-free terrace house that I inherited from my parents, valued at roughly DM 260 000. My cousin and colleague, Miguel Serrano, has agreed to act as guarantor and has supplied the signed documents. I have no further debts, no leasing contracts, and I do not maintain a savings account, preferring instead to invest discretionary income in home improvements.  

With a stable career of over ten years, property ownership, a solid guarantor and a flawless repayment history at your bank, I am confident that I meet your criteria for trustworthiness. The anticipated monthly installment of about DM 110 fits well within my surplus income of DM 1 300.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration. I can be reached at 0221-492-6119 for any clarification.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Domínguez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Andrei Popescu. I have worked as a quality-assurance engineer at Robert Bosch GmbH since January 2017. I am applying for a DM 1 537 loan, repayable in 15 monthly installments, to purchase a new smart television and Internet radio system for home as my current units are no longer serviceable.  

I maintain a checking account with you; the balance today is DM 93. My net monthly income is DM 5 750, and after fixed expenses I retain about DM 1 400. I currently hold two active loans with your bank—both taken for house renovation—and all payments have been executed without delay. In 2019, I had a temporary arrear on a credit card at another bank while relocating from Romania; this was cleared within the same year.  

I live in my own detached house in Fellbach, bought outright in 2014 and valued by Kreissparkasse Gutachterdienst at DM 310 000. My sister, Dr. Elena Popescu, a physician at Marienhospital, has agreed to guarantee the requested credit. I have no other installment obligations, no savings account, and my telephone number is 0711-639-8843.  

My long-term employment, property ownership, reliable guarantor and spotless payment record with your institution substantiate my creditworthiness. The modest loan amount represents less than 5 % of my annual income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

I appreciate your favorable review and remain at your disposal for any further data you may need.  

Respectfully,  
Andrei Popescu

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, Polish citizen, resident in Germany since 2009 and currently a senior customs officer at Dortmund Airport, a position I have held since February 2014. I wish to obtain a DM 1 537 loan over 15 months to buy a new living-room television set and digital radio receiver for my home.  

My current account with your bank holds DM 61 today. Salary of DM 5 400 net is paid monthly by Bundeszollverwaltung and covers household costs for myself and my 19-year-old daughter. I have two existing loans with your branch for a heat-pump upgrade and a used car; both accounts are exemplary, with the heat-pump loan set to finish in six months. I once had a critical notation at Commerzbank in 2018 resulting from a delayed overdraft settlement; that was fully resolved and closed the same year.  

The semi-detached house I own outright on Bornstraße (Grundbuch Blatt 3197) is valued at approximately DM 240 000. My colleague, Hauptzollamt-director Uwe Fischer, has provided his signed guarantee for this application. I carry no other installment plans and possess no savings account, preferring to channel excess cash into my property.  

Given my stable civil-service employment, real-estate asset, clean repayment behavior with your institution and the added guarantee, I consider myself a reliable borrower. The projected monthly repayment of around DM 110 is well within my disposable funds of DM 1 250.  

Thank you very much for your consideration. I am available at 0231-880-2244 for any additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Loan Officers,  

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, age 50, Turkish national residing and registered in Germany since 2007. I have served as an electrical maintenance foreman at BASF SE for nine years, since May 2016. I seek a DM 1 537 consumer loan, term 15 months, to replace my outdated cathode-ray television and purchase a modern FM/DAB radio.  

My checking account balance is DM 154. My monthly net income is DM 5 650, of which DM 1 300 remains disposable after obligations. I currently manage two loans with your bank—bathroom renovation and a laptop purchase—and both have been repaid punctually for their entire duration. An earlier credit account with Volksbank received a “critical” mark in 2020 after a disputed freelance invoice but was corrected and settled in full that same quarter.  

I own the apartment in which I live (Zieglerstraße 11, WE 4), valued at DM 220 000 and free of liens. My nephew, Mehmet Kaya, a certified tax adviser in Mannheim, has signed on as guarantor. I maintain no other installment commitments and do not currently hold a savings account or securities.  

My steady job, unencumbered property, reliable guarantor and flawless repayment history at your institution attest to my creditworthiness. The expected monthly installment of roughly DM 110 fits comfortably within my budget.  

I appreciate your attention to this request and am ready to supply any further documentation. Please contact me at 0621-733-5572.  

Best regards,  
Ahmed Yilmaz
