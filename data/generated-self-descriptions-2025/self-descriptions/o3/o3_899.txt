Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Karin Hoffmann, 35, divorced, and employed for the past five years as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Surface Technology. I respectfully request a twelve-month loan of 1 592 DM to furnish the study in my recently purchased terraced house with an ergonomic workstation and storage cabinets.  

Financially, my net salary is 4 050 DM per month. I have a building-society savings agreement worth 12 500 DM and a separate savings account with 4 200 DM. Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I have maintained one consumer loan here (for a washing machine, granted in 2023) and have never missed an installment. Aside from that I carry a small car loan at Sparkasse that is up to date.  

The requested amount will be repaid in twelve monthly installments of roughly 140 DM, well within the 3 % installment-rate guideline and comfortably covered by my disposable income. I will authorise a standing order from my savings account to ensure timely payment.  

My steady employment, verifiable savings and flawless repayment history with your institution demonstrate my reliability. I would welcome the opportunity to open a current account at the same time, thereby strengthening our banking relationship.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my office number 0511-762-4457 for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Karin Hoffmann

To the Credit Department,  

I am Alina König, 35 years old, married, and have been serving as an administrative officer at Dresden City Hall for six years. I am seeking a 1 592 DM loan over twelve months to replace outdated kitchen appliances in my condominium, which I bought two years ago.  

My monthly net income is 3 800 DM. I hold no checking account with your bank yet, but I keep a life-insurance savings plan currently valued at 8 900 DM and a separate savings balance of 1 750 DM. I maintain one small instalment loan with you (granted for a heating repair in 2024) that has always been honoured on time. My only external obligation is a car loan at Volksbank with a remaining balance of 4 600 DM.  

The new loan will be repaid in twelve equal instalments of about 140 DM, representing less than four per cent of my take-home pay. A direct debit authority will be lodged against my savings account to guarantee punctual repayment.  

My stable civil-service position, consistent savings habit and impeccable payment conduct mark me as a trustworthy borrower. I would also like to open a corrente account with you to consolidate my banking.  

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully yours,  
Alina König

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Stefanie Berger, 35, separated, and currently employed as a senior laboratory technician at Biopharm-Rhein GmbH, where I have worked for four years. I request a loan of 1 592 DM, repayable over the next twelve months, to equip my son’s bedroom and my home office with new furniture.  

My net salary is 3 450 DM. I own my detached house (mortgage-free) and have a building-society contract valued at 10 600 DM plus liquid savings of 2 300 DM. I hold one active instalment loan with your branch (granted 2022) that I have serviced flawlessly; all statements are attached. I maintain no checking account because wages are paid on a prepaid card, but I am prepared to open one immediately. Apart from a modest retail credit at Kaufhof, fully up to date, I carry no other liabilities.  

The projected instalment of roughly 140 DM represents just 4 % of my monthly income, leaving ample buffer for contingencies. I will set up an automatic transfer from my savings account on the due date each month.  

With stable employment, property ownership and a perfect repayment record, I believe I offer low risk. I would value continuing our successful banking relationship with this new facility.  

Yours faithfully,  
Stefanie Berger

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is Claudia Wieland, 35 years old and divorced. For the past five and a half years I have worked as an IT specialist at MAN Energy Solutions, earning a net 4 300 DM monthly. I seek a 1 592 DM loan for twelve months to purchase work-station furniture and upgraded networking equipment for the home I acquired in 2023.  

I currently hold a savings account with 3 100 DM and a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 7 800 DM. I already have one credit with your bank (bathroom renovation, 2024) that has been serviced exactly on schedule. My only other obligation is a lease on my company bicycle, paid directly via payroll.  

Planned instalments of about 140 DM stand far below the 3 % threshold and will be drawn automatically from my savings account to ensure punctuality even without a checking account.  

The combination of steady income, tangible assets and a spotless repayment history underlines my creditworthiness. I look forward to broadening our cooperation and, if approved, will migrate my salary payments to a new checking account at your bank.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Claudia Wieland

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Maria Schulze, aged 35, married and mother of a seven-year-old son. Since 2021 I have been employed as a certified payroll officer at Thyssen Mining AG, generating a net income of 3 600 DM monthly. I request a 1 592 DM loan over twelve months to buy ergonomic furniture and a laser printer for my remote-work space.  

Assets include a building-society savings plan current balance 11 200 DM and a cash savings account with 1 650 DM. I hold one small loan with your institution taken in 2023 for household appliances; all instalments have been met punctually. My only external credit is a cooperative housing loan opened in 2020, also in good standing. I do not yet operate a checking account with you but wish to open one upon approval.  

The proposed repayment of approximately 140 DM per month equals 3.9 % of my net income and will be effected through a standing transfer from my savings account.  

My secure employment, proven savings discipline and unblemished payment behaviour qualify me as a reliable borrower. I am eager to place more of my financial business with your bank and appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Schulze
