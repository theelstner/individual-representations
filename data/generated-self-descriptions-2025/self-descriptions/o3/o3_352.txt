Letter 1

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Becker, 23, divorced and mother to a three-year-old son. I rent a flat in Munich where I have lived for four years, while owning a small inherited plot of land in Bamberg.

Eight months ago I started full-time work as a medical laboratory assistant at the Municipal Hospital, earning a net salary of 1,820 € per month. The contract is permanent and my probation has already been confirmed.

I request a loan of 1,236 € for nine months to purchase an energy-efficient refrigerator and washing machine. I intend to repay the sum in nine equal instalments of about 140 €, less than 8 % of my income. My only prior loan—a 600 € study loan from your bank—was repaid three months early. I hold no other debts, and my savings book contains 71 €.

Although I do not yet have a checking account, I am ready to open one so repayments can be automated. You may reach me at 089-555-0137.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my responsible relationship with the bank.

Sincerely,
Anna Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Maria Rossi, 23, separated and supporting one daughter. I have rented the same apartment in Stuttgart for four years, while owning a half share of my late grandmother’s house in Florence.

Since July last year I have been a junior administrative clerk at the Baden-Württemberg Immigration Office, earning 1,950 € net monthly under a permanent public-service contract.

I seek a 1,236 € loan over nine months to replace our broken stove and dishwasher. The monthly payment of roughly 140 € fits comfortably within my budget. My only prior borrowing—a 1,000 € relocation loan from your bank—was paid on time. I have no other debts and 78 € in a savings book.

Although I currently manage without a current account, I will open one with you so instalments are debited automatically. I can be contacted at 0711-298-6425.

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.

Respectfully,
Maria Rossi

To the Loans Department,

My name is Sofia Hernandez, 23, married, with one infant son. For four years we have rented a two-room flat in Freiburg, while I hold title to a small woodland parcel in Spain.

I have been a photovoltaic research technician at SolarTech GmbH for six months, earning 2,050 € net monthly on a permanent contract. I request a 1,236 € loan for nine months to purchase a washer-dryer and vacuum cleaner. The planned payment of about 140 € is 7 % of my salary.

Two years ago I took an 800 € education loan from your bank and repaid it punctually. I carry no other credit obligations and have 54 € in savings. I will open a checking account so repayments are deducted automatically.

My secure employment, spotless repayment record and real-estate asset make me a reliable borrower. I am available at 0761-443-876.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Sofia Hernandez

Dear Credit Officer,

I, Linda Novak, 23, divorced and caring for my four-year-old daughter, apply for a 1,236 € loan over nine months to equip our rented Dresden apartment with a refrigerator and electric cooker that meet safety standards.

For nine months I have worked full-time as a school administration assistant at Heinrich-Heine-Grundschule, earning 1,730 € net monthly on a permanent contract. My sole previous loan—a 900 € moving loan from your bank—was paid off on schedule. I own a small building plot outside Brno valued at about 9,500 €, hold 63 € in savings, and carry no other debts.

I will repay the loan in nine instalments of roughly 140 €, under 9 % of my income, and will open a checking account for automatic deductions. You may reach me at 0351-602-1178.

Thank you for your attention and I hope for a positive reply.

Kind regards,
Linda Novak

Esteemed Loan Committee,

I am Elena Petrova, 23, currently separated and mother to one child. I have rented the same apartment in Leipzig for four years, yet also hold title to a small inherited holiday cottage near Varna.

Since May last year I have been a trainee customs officer at Leipzig/Halle Airport on a civil-service track, earning 1,880 € net per month. I request a 1,236 € loan for nine months to replace worn-out kitchen appliances. The instalment of about 140 € is only 7.5 % of my income.

My only prior credit—a 700 € personal loan from your bank—was repaid early. I have 82 € in a savings passbook and no other obligations. I will open a checking account with you for automated payments.

My secure public-service position, real-estate asset and impeccable repayment history demonstrate my reliability. I can be contacted at 0341-295-0094.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Elena Petrova
