Stuttgart, 24 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Markus Fischer, 36, employed as a certified automotive technician at Robert Bosch GmbH since July 2022. I am applying for a loan of 2,360 € over 15 months to buy a 2015 Ford Focus (89,000 km) that will allow me to commute reliably to the plant after the local bus route was discontinued.  

My current account with your bank shows regular salary credits of approximately 3,100 € net per month and an average balance of 780 €. I hold a savings account of 720 €, and I own my two-room flat (Königstrasse 17, Stuttgart) outright. Apart from a 1,200 € overdraft facility at BW-Bank, I have no other liabilities.  

For the requested amount I can comfortably service a monthly instalment of up to 170 €, which is less than 6 % of my disposable income. I have kept my existing consumer loan with you (taken in 2023 for household appliances) up to date without a single delay. With steady employment, stable housing and proven payment discipline, I am confident I meet your requirements.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on 0711-55 66 88 for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Fischer

Dear Loans Department,  

I am David Meier, 36, single father of a seven-year-old son, and a research assistant at the University of Hamburg’s Materials Science Institute since February 2023. I seek a 2,360 € loan for 15 months to purchase a used Skoda Fabia Combi (2016, 95,000 km). The car is essential for my daily commute to the DESY research campus and for taking my son to school.  

Financially, I receive a net monthly salary of 2,750 € paid into my checking account with you, which has maintained a positive balance of around 650 € for the past twelve months. I also hold 950 € in a savings plan with Hamburger Sparkasse. My only existing obligation is a KfW education loan whose balance stands at 1,800 €; all instalments have been paid promptly.  

The proposed repayment of roughly 165 € monthly fits comfortably within my budget, representing about 6 % of my net income. My record with your institution is spotless, and I have never exceeded my authorised overdraft.  

I look forward to your favourable response and am happy to provide any further documentation. You can reach me at 040-44 55 66.  

Kind regards,  
David Meier

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Jonas Becker, 36, employed as a junior civil servant (BesGr. A6) with the Cologne City Administration since April 2024. I respectfully request a 2,360 € loan over 15 months to buy a reliable 2014 Opel Astra to replace my current vehicle, whose engine failed last week.  

My salary of 2,640 € net is paid into my Girokonto with your bank, which has maintained an average balance of 520 € for the past year. I have 680 € in a Raiffeisen savings account. In addition, I hold a small furniture instalment plan with Möbel-Krieger (remaining balance 540 €) that is serviced punctually. I reside in a condominium I own at Luxemburger Strasse 201 and have lived there for two years.  

The proposed monthly repayment of 165 € represents less than 7 % of my income and will comfortably fit into my budget. My previous consumer loan with you (settled in June 2024) was repaid three months ahead of schedule, demonstrating my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I can be reached at 0221-78 98 10 for any questions.  

Respectfully,  
Jonas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Kevin Roth, 36, a master electrician employed by Siemens Energy AG since June 2022. I am requesting a 2,360 € loan, repayable in 15 months, to purchase a 2013 Volkswagen Golf TDI with 102,000 km. The car is vital for my assignments on remote construction sites.  

Income details: net monthly salary 3,250 €, credited to my checking account with you, where the average balance over the last 14 months has been 890 €. I maintain a savings balance of 810 € with Sparkasse Nürnberg and own my detached house at Hermann-Hesse-Weg 4. My only other commitment is a 900 € mail-order instalment (Otto GmbH), always paid on time.  

A monthly payment of roughly 165 € is well within my means, constituting just over 5 % of my income. I previously held a 1,500 € personal loan with your bank, repaid without delay in February 2024, underlining my good standing.  

I appreciate your consideration and am happy to supply any further documents. I can be reached at 0911-33 22 11.  

Sincerely,  
Kevin Roth

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Paul Schneider, age 36, employed as a paramedic with the German Red Cross since May 2023. I kindly apply for a 2,360 € loan over 15 months to buy a used 2012 Renault Kangoo (110,000 km). The van’s sliding-door layout is ideal for transporting my disabled younger sister, for whom I am the legal guardian.  

Financial situation: net monthly income 2,880 €, paid into my account at your branch. The account has never been overdrawn and shows an average balance of 610 €. I hold a savings account of 840 € at Volksbank München. I have no other loans besides an authorised overdraft facility at HypoVereinsbank (unused). I live in my own apartment on Leopoldstrasse, where I have resided for two years.  

The envisaged instalment of about 165 € per month is sustainable, representing roughly 6 % of my income. My track record with your institution is impeccable; all standing orders and direct debits have been honoured without exception.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available for questions at 089-66 55 44.  

With best regards,  
Paul Schneider
