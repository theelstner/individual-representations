Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 1 092 DM twelve-month loan to purchase a new television set after my old unit failed. I have been employed for two years as a laboratory technician at Siemens Healthineers, earning a steady net income of 3 400 DM per month.

My current checking balance averages 150 DM, and my savings account holds 62 DM. Although these figures are modest, my financial record is solid: I repaid two earlier loans from your bank—one for a washing machine and one for dental work—each ahead of schedule. I own a fully paid-off condominium worth roughly 410 000 DM and have no other installment obligations.

My twelve-year-old son René lives with me, and my sister, Dr. Petra Müller, has agreed to act as guarantor. Regular employment, real-estate collateral, and an impeccable repayment history make me a low-risk candidate. I kindly ask you to approve this small, short-term credit.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ingrid Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I request a loan of 1 092 DM over twelve months to buy a digital radio and satellite receiver so my family can access international news. I have worked for three years as an administrative officer at Dresden City Hall with a net monthly salary of 3 150 DM.

My Giro account currently shows 96 DM, and my savings passbook contains 41 DM. Despite low liquid funds, all previous financial obligations—two small consumer loans from your branch—were settled punctually. My husband and I jointly own our home, valued at approximately 350 000 DM, unencumbered by mortgages.

Our teenage daughter Emma is our single dependent. My brother-in-law, Dipl.-Ing. Michael Krüger, will stand as guarantor. Consistent public-sector employment, property ownership, and an unblemished credit record underline my reliability.

I would be grateful for your positive response.

Yours faithfully,  
Karin Novak

To the Credit Department,

I wish to obtain a 1 092 DM loan, repayable in twelve equal installments, to replace studio-monitoring equipment and the household television set that were lost in a recent power surge. For the past 18 months I have been employed as a sound engineer at Bayerischer Rundfunk, earning 3 600 DM net each month.

My checking account stands at 44 DM, while my savings book shows 75 DM. I have no open installment plans besides this request, and I successfully repaid two earlier credits with your bank in full and on time. I own a small terraced house valued near 300 000 DM; it is mortgage-free.

I am separated and support my nine-year-old daughter Lea. My cousin, attorney Martin Henke, has provided a written guarantee for this loan. Given my stable income, existing property, and perfect repayment track record, I am confident of meeting the monthly 4 % installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 1 092 DM, twelve-month credit to purchase a smart TV and satellite dish, enabling my family to follow Romanian and German educational programs. I have been a research assistant at the University of Stuttgart’s Institute of Materials Science for 16 months, drawing a net salary of 3 200 DM.

My current checking balance is 71 DM, and my savings total 28 DM. While cash reserves are limited, my two previous loans with your institution—tuition fees and home renovation—were repaid exactly as scheduled. I own, together with my husband, a house in Bad Cannstatt valued at roughly 425 000 DM, free of liens.

Our eight-year-old son Adrian is our only dependent. Professor Dr. Horst Keller, my department head, has agreed to act as guarantor. My stable university position, mortgage-free property, and spotless credit history make me a reliable borrower.

I look forward to your favorable reply.

Sincerely,  
Monika Radu

Esteemed Members of the Credit Committee,

I seek approval for a 1 092 DM loan over twelve months to acquire a replacement television and upgrade our living-room audio system. Since October 2022 I have worked as a certified architectural draftswoman at Faber & Partner Architekten, earning a net monthly income of 3 250 DM.

My checking account maintains about 132 DM; my savings book holds 58 DM. I have successfully completed repayment of two earlier loans issued by your bank, never missing a due date. I reside in and fully own a detached house valued at approximately 380 000 DM.

I am divorced and care for my seventeen-year-old son Lukas. My father, retired engineer Hans-Peter Kraus, will serve as guarantor. Consistent employment, significant property equity, and an exemplary repayment record demonstrate my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
