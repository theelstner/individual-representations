Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marko Petrovic, passport no. YZ739452. I have been employed for nine years as a certified electronics technician at Siemens AG in Nuremberg, earning a net monthly salary of 4,100 DM. I respectfully request a loan of 1,346 DM to purchase a new Grundig 65-inch television and sound system.  

My financial habits are disciplined. Two years ago I took a 2,500 DM washing-machine loan with your branch and repaid every installment ahead of schedule. I keep 380 DM in a savings book with your bank, and although I have no checking account, my salary is paid in cashless vouchers that I deposit monthly. Housing is free in the company dormitory, so my living costs remain low, allowing me to allocate 2 % of income for the requested installment without strain.  

I am single, 42, and support my twin nephews, aged eight. A stable job, clean credit history, and punctual payment record demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic

To the Credit Committee,

I am Hans-Peter Klein, Austrian citizen, 42 years old, single, residing in Stuttgart for the past four years. For the last eight and a half years I have served as a senior customs officer at Baden-Württemberg Main Customs Office, drawing 3,950 DM net monthly.  

I seek a loan of 1,346 DM to buy a Braun hi-fi stereo set and 32-inch color television so my two god-children, whom I foster on weekends, can benefit from educational programs. I currently hold 310 DM in a savings account with your bank and have repaid my previous 1,800 DM refrigerator loan on time, closing it this July.  

Because I live rent-free in a government apartment, my fixed expenses are limited. Setting aside 2 % of monthly income for repayment is entirely manageable. I possess no other debts, guarantors, or obligations, and my telephone number is registered in my name for easy contact.  

I value punctuality and financial integrity, qualities that will ensure timely repayment. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Hans-Peter Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Carlos Alvarez, Spanish national residing in Munich since 2021. I have worked for eight years as a certificated mechanical draftsman at BMW’s Research & Development Center, earning 4,250 DM net each month. I wish to obtain a loan of 1,346 DM to purchase a Philips smart television set for language-learning with my two younger cousins, whom I support.  

I maintain 425 DM in a savings bond with your institution. My previous credit—1,600 DM for a laptop—was settled without a single delay, finishing three months early. I do not own property and live free of charge in my uncle’s attic flat, leaving ample disposable income. A 2 % installment fits comfortably within my budget plan.  

Reliable employment, a spotless payment record, and verified telephone contact underline my credibility. I look forward to strengthening our banking relationship through this new loan.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Alvarez

Esteemed Credit Manager,

I, Dragan Kovacevic, am a Croatian tool-and-die specialist employed at Bosch Rexroth in Lohr am Main for the past ten years, current net salary 4,050 DM. I request financing of 1,346 DM to buy a Sony OLED TV for my nieces’ remote schooling.  

In 2019 I obtained a 3,000 DM personal loan from your branch for dental work and repaid it according to schedule. My savings booklet shows 240 DM. I have no checking account, no guarantors, and no other debts besides an existing bank installment plan that concludes this December. Living rent-free in the plant’s guest house allows me to commit 2 % of monthly income toward the new repayment with ease.  

I am 42, single, yet financially responsible for two dependent sisters after our parents’ passing. My stable employment, consistent savings, and unblemished credit history make me a dependable candidate. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Kovacevic

Dear Banking Team,

I am Stefan Müller, 42-year-old Swiss citizen working as a senior lab technician at BASF Ludwigshafen since March 2017, total tenure eight years and six months, net monthly income 3,880 DM. I wish to secure a 1,346 DM loan to acquire a Loewe television and radio set for continuing-education streaming and entertainment for my twin god-daughters.  

I hold a 330 DM savings certificate with your bank. My prior 2,200 DM furniture loan, initiated in 2020, was repaid flawlessly. I reside cost-free in my brother’s apartment, and my only open installment plan at your bank will be fully cleared in two months. Allocating 2 % of income toward the new obligation is easily manageable.  

With long-term employment, verifiable telephone contact, and a history of punctual repayments, I am confident you will find me a low-risk borrower. Thank you for reviewing my application; I look forward to positive news.  

Best regards,  
Stefan Müller
