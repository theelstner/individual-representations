Hamburg, 19 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ahmed Farouk, an Egyptian mechanical technician employed at Siemens Gamesa Wind Power in Hamburg since March 2022. I respectfully request a business loan of 4 165 EUR for 18 months to purchase a second-hand CNC lathe and basic tooling that will let me start a weekend subcontracting service machining small turbine parts for local repair shops.

My finances are solid. My net salary is 2 850 EUR per month and my only current obligations are a 29 EUR store-financing plan for a washing machine and normal living expenses for myself and my twin daughters, aged six. I own a 2015 Opel Astra with no lien, and I live in a condominium I bought outright from inheritance funds two years ago. I have held two previous micro-loans with your bank (850 EUR in 2021 and 1 200 EUR in 2023) and repaid both ahead of schedule. I keep less than 100 EUR in my savings passbook but maintain a strict personal budget and have never missed a payment in Germany or Egypt.

Because my sideline will be run from my own workshop and requires limited capital, the projected cash flow easily covers an 18-month repayment plan of roughly 240 EUR per month. As a foreign worker I value the credibility I have built with this bank and am determined to protect it.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at work or by post for any further documentation.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Farouk

To the Credit Department,

I am Luka Marin, 36-year-old Croatian national and IT support specialist at Deutsche Bahn AG, employed since July 2023. I am applying for a business loan of 4 165 EUR over 18 months to launch an evening online course that teaches rail-specific cybersecurity, an area where demand from subcontractors is rising sharply.

My monthly net income is 3 120 EUR. I reside in my own small townhouse (mortgage-free, inherited) where I have lived for two years. My dependants are my niece and nephew, whom I support while my sister completes nursing school. Aside from a 24 EUR monthly installment for a television bought at Saturn, I have no debts. I hold two earlier loans with your bank—1 000 EUR in 2022 and 900 EUR in 2024—both repaid in full and on time. I do not keep a separate checking account; I manage expenses with a prepaid debit card and regular cash deposits.

The requested sum will pay for course-hosting software, a used server, and marketing. Conservative projections show revenue of at least 550 EUR per month, comfortably exceeding the expected installment of about 240 EUR. My track record with your institution and my steady employment demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,
Luka Marin

Leverkusen, 19 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Carlos Herrera, Spanish citizen, laboratory technician at Bayer AG since January 2024. I seek a loan of 4 165 EUR for 18 months to purchase a certified mobile food trailer which I will operate on weekends at local markets selling traditional Spanish tapas.

Financially, I earn 2 680 EUR net per month. I own a modest two-room flat bought with personal savings when I moved to Germany two years ago, and I drive a 2014 Ford Fiesta free of finance. I support my two young cousins who live with me while attending school. Other liabilities consist only of a 19 EUR monthly store plan for a laptop. I have successfully closed two consumer loans with your bank—700 EUR in 2021 and 1 050 EUR in 2023—settled ahead of schedule. My savings account currently holds 74 EUR, but I maintain a strict zero-debt policy outside planned financing.

Projected weekend sales of 400 EUR yield ample margin to meet an 18-month repayment of roughly 240 EUR while still building capital for future growth. Having never defaulted and possessing stable employment, I am confident I meet your trust criteria.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am ready to provide any further paperwork upon request.

Kind regards,
Carlos Herrera

Dresden, 19 September 2025

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian national and senior administrative clerk at the Dresden City Hall since May 2022. I request a business loan of 4 165 EUR for 18 months. The funds will finance the purchase of specialized surveying drones that I plan to rent to local architects on weekends, an enterprise already backed by letters of intent from three firms.

My net monthly salary is 2 740 EUR. I have resided in my own apartment for two years and own a 2013 Skoda Octavia. I care for my two younger brothers, ages 17 and 19, who live with me while studying. Aside from a 32 EUR installment for household appliances from MediaMarkt, I have no current debts. The two prior loans I held with your bank (950 EUR in 2020 and 1 100 EUR in 2022) were both repaid before maturity. I do not maintain a regular checking account, relying instead on cash budgeting and a prepaid card.

Expected rental income exceeds 600 EUR per month, comfortably covering the projected 240 EUR monthly installment. My unblemished repayment history and stable public-sector employment underwrite my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to meet at your convenience.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov

Stuttgart, 19 September 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Miguel Silva, Portuguese citizen and certified industrial electrician at Robert Bosch GmbH, employed since February 2021. I am applying for a loan of 4 165 EUR over 18 months to equip a mobile repair van that will allow me to service small factories after normal working hours.

My financial standing is sound. I earn 3 050 EUR net per month. I own a one-story house purchased two years ago with savings from earlier employment abroad, and I possess a 2016 VW Caddy outright. My dependants are my two younger cousins whom I support through technical school. My only open obligation is a 27 EUR monthly store plan for kitchen appliances. I have taken two small credits with your bank—800 EUR in 2021 and 1 300 EUR in 2023—and honored both without delay. My savings passbook currently shows 58 EUR; nevertheless, I maintain meticulous budgeting and zero missed payments.

Market research indicates that even a conservative schedule of four service calls per week will generate 700 EUR monthly, more than sufficient to meet the expected 240 EUR installment. My proven repayment record, stable income, and ownership of essential assets affirm my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to a favorable reply.

Warm regards,
Miguel Silva
