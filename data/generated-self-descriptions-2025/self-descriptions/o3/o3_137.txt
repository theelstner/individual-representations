Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Elisa Brandt, age 38, divorced, and the sole provider for my nine-year-old son. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Microsystems for the past eight years, earning a net salary of €3,850 per month.  

I am requesting a loan of €1,240 to purchase a new 55-inch OLED television and digital radio receiver that will allow me to participate in an online teaching program I have been asked to give next semester. Because I own my condominium in Pankow (appraised at €310,000 and mortgage-free since 2021), I have sufficient collateral. Although I have two small instalment loans with your bank that were both repaid on schedule, I currently keep my day-to-day funds with a prepaid provider and would gladly open a checking account here if this application is approved.  

My only other credit is a car loan at Sparkasse (€7,200 outstanding, never in arrears). With an instalment plan of €110 over twelve months, the requested loan will not strain my budget; my total debt-service ratio would remain below 20 % of net income. I have always honoured my obligations and can provide employment confirmations and property documents upon request.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a favourable reply and to expanding my banking relationship with you.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Elisa Brandt

Stuttgart, 19 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Mrs. Maria Ortega, 38 years old and married, employed as a municipal registry clerk for the City of Stuttgart since May 2014. My net monthly income is €3,200, supplemented by €150 child support for my eleven-year-old daughter.  

I seek a €1,240 consumer loan to replace our broken living-room TV set and purchase a DAB+ kitchen radio. I own our detached home in Vaihingen, valued at approximately €420,000; the mortgage is with BW Bank and is current. I maintain no checking account with your institution but have twice financed appliances with you in the past; both contracts were repaid ahead of schedule, demonstrating my reliability.  

Other obligations include a credit-card balance of €900 with Volksbank, paid in full every month. With the proposed twelve-month schedule (roughly €105 per month), my combined monthly commitments will remain below 18 % of household income.  

I am willing to have the instalments debited automatically and will open a Giro account with you for that purpose. My stable employment, strong repayment history and solid collateral make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Ortega

Leipzig, 20 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Sabine Vogt. I am 38, legally separated, and responsible for my ten-year-old son. For nine years I have served as a customs officer at Leipzig/Halle Airport; my net earnings amount to €3,600 per month plus occasional overtime.  

I wish to finance a €1,240 purchase of a Smart-TV and digital radio set. The devices are needed to follow language-learning broadcasts for a civil-service exam that will qualify me for promotion next year.  

I reside in my own townhouse (acquired in 2020, current market value €280,000). There are no liens; the property was inherited and is debt-free. My credit record shows one external bank loan—a €5,500 electric-bike loan at Commerzbank—paid down to €1,900 with no missed instalments. Within your bank I have twice taken short-term credits and settled them promptly.  

If approved, I will repay the requested loan in twelve monthly instalments of €110, which keeps my total monthly debt below 17 % of income. I have attached proof of salary and property ownership, and you may reach my HR office for verification.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to deepening my relationship with your bank.  

Respectfully,  
Sabine Vogt

Hamburg, 18 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Ms. Karin Meier, 38, divorced, employed as a senior railway dispatcher at Deutsche Bahn for the past ten and a half years. My stable net income of €3,450 supports both myself and my twelve-year-old daughter.  

I am applying for a €1,240 loan to purchase a replacement television and high-quality radio system after lightning damage rendered my previous equipment unusable. Insurance covered part of the loss; this loan will bridge the remaining amount.  

I own a condominium in Hamburg-Barmbek valued at €335,000. The mortgage balance is €64,000 and serviced without delay via another bank. My two historical loans with you (kitchen renovation 2019, laptop 2021) were paid off on time. Apart from a €1,200 balance on a DKB Visa card that is settled monthly, I have no other debts.  

With a twelve-month plan at roughly €105 per month, my debt obligations continue well within manageable limits (below 20 % of income). I am prepared to open a current account so instalments may be debited automatically.  

I have demonstrated punctuality, possess stable public-sector employment, and hold substantial equity in my property, underscoring my credit-worthiness. I appreciate your favourable review.  

Sincerely,  
Karin Meier

Düsseldorf, 19 September 2025  

Dear Loan Manager,  

I am Mrs. Leila Khan, 38, married and registered as a foreign worker, originally from India and a permanent resident of Germany since 2009. For eight years I have been a veterinary technician at the Tierklinik Düsseldorf, earning €3,100 net monthly. We have one dependent son aged eight.  

I request a €1,240 loan to buy an Internet-enabled television and digital radio to support my continuing-education program in animal physiotherapy, which requires streaming instructional content.  

My husband and I own our row house in Eller, valued at roughly €300,000. There is a modest mortgage with Stadtsparkasse that is current. Though I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I have successfully completed two instalment contracts here (refrigerator 2018, washing machine 2020). My sole external credit is a €6,000 auto loan with €2,400 outstanding; no payments have ever been late.  

Repayment of the requested amount in twelve monthly instalments of about €105 will keep our household debt service below 18 % of disposable income. I am ready to sign direct-debit authorisation and to transfer my salary account to your institution.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my stable employment, property ownership and consistent repayment history demonstrate my reliability.  

Warm regards,  
Leila Khan
