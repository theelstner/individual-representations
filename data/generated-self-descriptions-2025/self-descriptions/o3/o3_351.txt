Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1 136 DM to finance the final semester fees and examination material for the Master Craftsman evening program at the Handwerkskammer Stuttgart. For the past eight years I have been employed as a certified maintenance technician at Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen AG, earning a net salary of roughly 4 200 DM per month. Although my current checking-account balance is only 135 DM, I keep 2 300 DM in a savings account for unforeseen expenses.

I am single and raise my twin daughters (aged five) alone; we live free of charge in my uncle’s garden apartment, which allows me to direct almost 30 % of my income toward debt repayment. I have two small installment loans with your bank (total remaining balance 4 600 DM), both serviced punctually for more than two years. Outside this bank I still maintain a closed overdraft that is being consolidated regularly.

The requested amount fits comfortably within my budget at the agreed installment rate of 4 %. My steady employment, documented repayment record, and existing savings demonstrate that I am a reliable and low-risk borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to continuing our successful banking relationship.

Sincerely,  
Alexander Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a loan of 1 136 DM to cover tuition and examination costs for the German B2 language certificate and a nine-month Logistics Supervisor course at the IHK Hamburg. These qualifications will allow me to advance from freight clerk to operations coordinator at Europort Shipping, where I have been employed for nine years and currently earn 3 850 DM net.

My checking account shows 92 DM today because my salary is transferred to a separate savings account that holds 1 600 DM. I have no property but live rent-free in the port’s employee residence. I am single with two dependent nephews who live with me since my brother’s passing; their care is funded partly by a survivor’s pension.

I hold two active credit lines with your bank (household appliances and a used car, total 3 900 DM outstanding). All payments have been made on schedule, which your records can confirm. Outside this institution I once had an overdraft flagged as critical, but it has been in orderly repayment for 18 months.

With my stable income, modest living costs, and clean internal payment history, I am confident of meeting the proposed installment of 4 %. I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Credit Committee,

I hereby apply for an educational loan of 1 136 DM to finance a Cisco CCNP certification course starting next month. I have served as network administrator at the St. Georg Municipal Hospital for eight years, earning 4 050 DM net per month plus on-call bonuses.

At present my checking account holds 57 DM because household expenses were settled last week. Nevertheless, I maintain a savings bond of 1 900 DM with Sparkasse Leipzig. I reside free of rent in a staff dormitory adjacent to the hospital. Being single, I support my two younger siblings in Novosibirsk, who are listed as my dependents.

I currently have two small loans with your bank totaling 5 200 DM. Each installment has been paid ahead of time, and I have never exceeded the approved credit limit. My only adverse entry stems from a student overdraft at another bank in 2017, which has since been cleared but still marks the account as critical.

With low fixed living costs and confirmed employment, the extra installment (4 % rate) is fully covered by my monthly surplus of around 1 300 DM. I value the trust your institution has shown me and hope to deepen our cooperation.

Respectfully,  
Sergei Ivanov

Dear Mrs. Schneider,

I am requesting a loan of 1 136 DM to pay for a nine-month part-time Chemistry Technician upgrade course at the TÜV Rheinland Akademie. Since 2016 I have worked at BASF SE’s coating division in Ludwigshafen, where my current net salary is 4 400 DM. The course is a prerequisite for the shift-supervisor position opening next year.

Although my checking balance is currently 164 DM, I keep 1 250 DM in a savings plan that cannot be accessed without notice. I live free of rent in staff accommodation provided by BASF. As a single father of two sons (ages six and nine) I have arranged reliable childcare and set aside funds for their needs.

I hold two consumer loans with your bank (combined outstanding 3 700 DM); all installments were debited punctually over the last 29 months. My only negative record is an external credit card account flagged as critical in 2020 after I financed relocation expenses, now under controlled payment.

The requested amount will not strain my budget—the 4 % installment is less than 9 % of my net income. My long-term employment, consistent savings habit, and flawless internal payment history underscore my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Rashid Khan

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 1 136 DM to finance enrollment in a twelve-week Data Analytics boot camp hosted by the Technische Hochschule Lübeck. This qualification will complement my eight-year tenure as a process control officer at Aurubis AG, where I earn 3 970 DM net per month.

Today my current account shows 48 DM; most of my disposable funds—1 450 DM—are kept in a callable savings account. I reside at my employer’s guesthouse without rent, which keeps my fixed expenses low. Though unmarried, I support two dependent cousins who immigrated with me and study at the university.

Within your bank I manage two active installment contracts (remaining balance 4 200 DM). Neither has ever been in arrears. An older personal loan with another bank was once labeled critical when my work permit renewal was delayed; the repayment schedule has been normal for over a year.

Based on my monthly surplus of about 1 100 DM, the additional 4 % installment will be easily serviced. My stable employment, demonstrable savings, and positive repayment record make me a reliable candidate for this educational loan.

I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Luka Ilic
