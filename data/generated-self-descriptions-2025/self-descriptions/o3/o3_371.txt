Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Novak, a 40-year-old Polish citizen divorced and living in Munich since 2021. I have been employed for five years as a scientific research assistant at BioNext GmbH with a net monthly income of 3,250 DM. I respectfully request a loan of 3,001 DM over 18 months to furnish my new rental apartment and replace worn-out household equipment after my recent move.  

My current checking account with your bank shows 118 DM; my savings account holds 87 DM. Although modest, every month I transfer 500 DM into the account on payday and leave a positive balance after regular expenses for myself and my nine-year-old son. I previously held a 2,000 DM personal loan with you in 2022 and repaid it four months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts or credit cards.  

To demonstrate stability, I can also point to a 50 m² apartment in Kraków that I inherited in 2019 and rent out, providing an additional 350 DM in monthly income, which I can pledge as secondary security. My employer can confirm the permanence of my position and my salary level.  

I therefore believe I meet every reliability criterion and would welcome the opportunity to continue building my credit history with your institution. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Novak

Hamburg, 16 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Mrs. Sofia Ricci, an Italian national, separated, residing at the same address in Hamburg for the past four years. For six years I have served as a customs-inspection official for the Federal Customs Authority, earning a steady net salary of 3,480 DM plus civil-service pension entitlements. I request a loan of 3,001 DM for 18 months to purchase new bedroom and study furniture after water damage ruined the old set in July.  

My current account with you holds 74 DM and my building-society savings book 92 DM. I deliberately keep liquid funds low because my secure government income covers monthly living costs, including 650 DM rent and 300 DM childcare for my eleven-year-old daughter. I have no other installment obligations.  

I successfully completed a 5,000 DM car loan with your bank last year, paying all twenty installments exactly on time. Additionally, I own a small plot near Bari valued at approximately 40,000 DM, which underscores my long-term solvency.  

I trust my employment status, flawless repayment record, and real-estate collateral evidence my creditworthiness. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Sofia Ricci

Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Elena Petrova, Bulgarian, aged 40, married, and resident in Stuttgart for four years. I have worked as a certified dental assistant at Zahnzentrum Süd GmbH since April 2021, now earning 2,980 DM net per month. I seek a loan of 3,001 DM over 18 months to equip our flat with ergonomic children’s furniture and replace outdated kitchen appliances.  

My checking balance today is 102 DM and my passbook shows 66 DM. I maintain low cash reserves because my salary arrives punctually every 30th of the month, and I set aside 350 DM monthly toward my seven-year-old son’s education fund. I settled a 1,500 DM overdraft with your branch in 2023 without a single late fee.  

Although we rent in Stuttgart, I co-own a 25 % share of my parents’ farmhouse near Plovdiv, market value 55,000 DM. I am willing to notarize this share as additional security. My employer can attest to my permanent contract and my reliability.  

I am confident I satisfy your lending criteria and will honor every installment. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

To the Lending Department,  

I am Lucia Santos, Portuguese, divorced, and have resided at my current Berlin address for exactly four years. Since August 2019 I have been employed as a procurement specialist at Siemens Energy AG, now with a secure net income of 3,600 DM per month. I apply for a loan of 3,001 DM to purchase standing desks and IT equipment needed for my transition to hybrid work, plus living-room furniture.  

My checking account balance is 129 DM; my bond savings account contains 81 DM. I completed a 3,500 DM furniture loan with your bank in 2022, repaying in full two installments early. I have zero other liabilities. Monthly rent is 750 DM and I support my twelve-year-old son.  

In 2020 I inherited a small seaside cottage in Aveiro, Portugal, appraised at 60,000 DM, which I rent seasonally. This asset, together with my uninterrupted employment and positive credit history, illustrates my financial solidity.  

I look forward to continuing our excellent banking relationship and appreciate your favorable review of my application.  

Best regards,  
Lucia Santos

Honorable Loan Review Team,  

My name is Maya Singh, Indian national, married, and living in Frankfurt for four years. I have held a permanent position as a finance clerk at the Frankfurt City Council since March 2021, currently earning 3,150 DM net per month. I respectfully request a loan of 3,001 DM for 18 months to buy essential furniture and a computer workstation for my new rental flat.  

Presently my checking account shows 96 DM and my savings account 73 DM, figures that reflect my routine of transferring any surplus into a child trust for my ten-year-old daughter. I successfully repaid a 2,200 DM relocation loan from your bank last year without delay. I have no credit cards, overdrafts, or guarantor obligations.  

Although I rent, I co-own a farm plot outside Chandigarh valued at roughly 45,000 DM, which offers additional security. My employer can issue a confirmation of my permanent employment and salary stability on request.  

With a spotless repayment record, stable municipal employment, and real-estate backing, I am confident of meeting each installment on time. Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Maya Singh
