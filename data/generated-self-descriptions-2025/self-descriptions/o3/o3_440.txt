Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Viktor Petrovic, a 65-year-old Croatian national who has lived in Essen for four years. I am applying for a loan of 3,394 DM to repair the leaking roof and defective gas heater in the small house I own at Gladbecker Str. 112. These repairs are urgent before winter and will protect the only home I share with my 14-year-old grandson, for whom I am legal guardian.  

My current financial situation is modest. I receive 1,290 DM per month in German retirement benefits and a 360 DM Croatian pension that arrives quarterly, which is why my checking account occasionally shows a negative balance. I have two older credit lines with your bank (numbers 118/02 and 204/17) that I have always serviced on time. My savings amount to 86 DM.  

Although I am unemployed, my daughter, Ms. Ana Petrovic—an intensive-care nurse at St. Johannes Hospital with a net income of 2,400 DM—has agreed to co-sign. Together we can meet an installment of about 100 DM monthly, well within our combined disposable income.  

I have never missed a payment, maintain no other installment plans, and own my car and house outright. Your support will allow me to safeguard my property and continue providing a stable home for my grandson.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Viktor Petrovic

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Ahmed Abdallah, age 65, a Tunisian citizen residing in Munich since 1999. I respectfully request a loan of 3,394 DM to overhaul the engine and brakes of my seven-seat Mercedes Vito, the vehicle I rely on for my part-time ride-sharing service. The repairs, quoted at 3,280 DM, will enable me to resume earning roughly 1,200 DM per month, replacing the unemployment benefit that ends in August.  

My current account at your branch shows a brief overdraft of 230 DM, caused by a delayed reimbursement from the Jobcenter. Apart from that, my finances are simple: 620 DM monthly unemployment assistance, no savings above 50 DM, and two small personal loans that I have never paid late.  

My nephew, Mr. Samir Khelifi, an engineering technician at BMW with a net salary of 3,100 DM, is willing to act as co-applicant and guarantor. With his backing and my expected driving income, we can comfortably cover a 4 % installment rate—about 105 DM per month.  

I have lived at my current address, Geisbergstr. 7, for four years and own the apartment outright. I may be a foreign worker, but my 23-year residence in Germany, spotless repayment record, and family support make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Abdallah

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Carlos Jiménez, 66, Spanish national, resident of Dortmund since 2018. I request a loan of 3,394 DM to rewire the electrical system and replace the faulty fuse box in my detached home at Südwall 56. A certified electrician has provided a written estimate of 3,310 DM; the balance will cover inspection fees.  

I retired last year after 28 years as an auto mechanic. My monthly pension is 1,180 DM. Because I helped pay my late brother’s medical bills, my current account slipped 150 DM below zero and my savings are only 72 DM. Nevertheless, I have repaid two previous loans from your bank—2,000 DM in 2019 and 1,200 DM in 2021—each ahead of schedule.  

My sister, Ms. Elena Jiménez, a secondary-school teacher with 2,800 DM net income, has signed a co-applicant agreement. We propose a 100 DM monthly installment, matching the 4 % plan. In addition, I will rent my spare room to a university student for 320 DM per month, further strengthening cash flow.  

Ownership of my house and car, along with a documented history of punctual repayment, demonstrates my reliability. The requested funds will remove a safety hazard and allow me to generate supplemental rental income.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am happy to provide any additional documents.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Jan Kowalski, 65, a Polish citizen living in my own cottage on Hauptstr. 3, Erfurt, since 2019. I am applying for a 3,394 DM loan to repair my walk-behind tractor and install new fencing on my 0.6-hectare plot. These repairs will let me resume seasonal vegetable cultivation, generating an estimated 900 DM profit per harvest.  

Presently I receive 780 DM per month in unemployment benefits. My German retirement pension of 1,050 DM will start in seven months. Until then, my account occasionally dips into overdraft; today it stands at –110 DM. Savings total 55 DM. I have two standing credits with your bank that I have serviced faultlessly for three and five years respectively.  

My son, Piotr Kowalski, an electrician with Stadtwerke Erfurt (net income 2,500 DM), is prepared to co-sign. A 4 % installment equals roughly 100 DM per month, which we can easily cover from his salary and my upcoming pension.  

I own my house, land, and a 2012 Opel Combo outright, have no other installment plans, and have never defaulted on any obligation. I believe my long-term residency, property ownership, and clear repayment track record establish me as a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Jan Kowalski  


Letter 5  
To the Loan Officer,  

My name is Mohamed Farouk, age 65, Egyptian national, residing in Bremen for the past four years. I seek a 3,394 DM credit to replace the transmission and suspension on my 2009 Ford Transit. The van is essential: I will start a six-month contract as a night watchman at the Hanse Industrial Park on 1 July and must provide my own transport to the site.  

I was laid off from a packaging plant last December and currently receive 640 DM in unemployment assistance. With no telephone and only 60 DM in savings, unexpected medical expenses pushed my checking account 190 DM into the red. Nevertheless, the two loans I hold with your bank—totaling 3,600 DM—are up to date, with every installment paid on schedule.  

My brother-in-law, Mr. Hisham El-Sayed, a permanent staff nurse at Klinikum Bremen-Mitte earning 2,700 DM monthly, will act as co-applicant. My forthcoming salary (1,350 DM net) plus his income easily cover the 4 % repayment plan of 100 DM per month.  

I own my home and van outright, possess a clean Schufa record aside from the minor overdraft, and have demonstrated consistent reliability as a borrower. The requested loan will secure my new employment and restore stable cash flow.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any further questions.  

Respectfully,  
Mohamed Farouk
