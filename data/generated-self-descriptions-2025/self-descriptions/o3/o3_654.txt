Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a 45-year-old Serbian national working as a certified tool-and-die maker at BMW Dingolfing. I have been permanently employed there for  nine years and earn a net salary of 4,200 DM per month. I respectfully request a 2,303 DM loan, to be repaid over 24 months, for the purchase of a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to commute reliably and take my nine-year-old son to school.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 370 DM and my savings balance is only 62 DM, I have never missed a payment on my existing renovation loan with your bank, which will be fully repaid in May 2026. I own a 63 m² condominium in Novi Sad that is free of encumbrances and provides additional security. My colleague, Mr. Marko Jovanović, has agreed to act as co-applicant and guarantor.

With a proven employment record, real-estate collateral, and a spotless credit history, I am confident I can meet the agreed installment rate of 96 DM (≈4 % of my net income) without difficulty. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Nicolás Fernández, a single 45-year-old Spanish senior signal technician at Deutsche Bahn in Frankfurt. I have held this position for eight years and earn 3,900 DM net monthly. I seek a 2,303 DM loan over 24 months to finance a new Volkswagen Polo, essential for my shift work that starts before public transport operates.

My current account shows a negative balance of 210 DM, and I maintain 55 DM in my savings book. Despite this, I have an unblemished record on my current mortgage with your bank, where every payment has been made on time since 2018. I own a fully insured, mortgage-backed townhouse in Valladolid valued at 180,000 DM. My brother, Carlos Fernández, a software engineer in Mainz, will co-sign the loan.

Given my stable income, property ownership, and perfect repayment history, I am confident of meeting the 96 DM monthly installment. I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Kind regards,  
Nicolás Fernández

To the Credit Department,

My name is Piotr Nowak, a Polish customs officer stationed at Cologne/Bonn Airport. For the past ten years I have served the Federal Customs Service, with a steady after-tax income of 3,750 DM. I request a 2,303 DM loan repayable over 24 months to purchase a new Škoda Fabia, required for my rotating shifts and for transporting my twelve-year-old daughter.

My checking account is overdrawn by 290 DM, and my passbook holds 47 DM. Nonetheless, I have never been late on any payment, including the educational loan I took in 2021, which will be fully settled in March 2025. I own a 700 m² plot with a small house in Kraków valued at 150,000 DM, free of liens. My cousin, Mr. Tomasz Wójcik, will act as co-applicant.

With tangible assets, a decade of steady government employment, and a flawless credit record, I can comfortably meet the 96 DM monthly obligation. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Marco Rossi, 45, an Italian laboratory coordinator at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Garching, earning 4,050 DM net and employed since 2013. I am applying for a 2,303 DM loan over 24 months to acquire a new Renault Clio. Reliable personal transport is indispensable for my early-morning laboratory duties.

Currently my current account is overdrawn by 330 DM, and I have 78 DM in savings. I have, however, always repaid obligations punctually, including a 2019 solar-panel loan with your bank that will be cleared this December. I own a 55 m² apartment in Verona valued at 165,000 DM, which stands as collateral. My longtime friend Dr. Luca Bianchi has agreed to co-apply.

Given my secure position, property ownership, and impeccable repayment record, I can easily fulfill the monthly 96 DM installment. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

Esteemed Members of the Loan Panel,

My name is Johan van der Meer, a Dutch marine logistics officer employed by the Hamburg Port Authority for twelve years, with a net monthly income of 4,100 DM. I am requesting a 2,303 DM loan payable over 24 months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta that will ensure punctual arrival for night-shift inspections and help me support my fifteen-year-old niece who lives with me.

My checking account is currently 260 DM in the red, and my savings stand at 88 DM. Nevertheless, I have maintained a spotless payment history, having paid down a home-improvement loan with your institution without a single delay. I own a debt-free farmhouse in Groningen valued at 190,000 DM. My colleague, Captain Peter Janssen, has committed to co-signing the loan.

With stable government employment, substantial property, and proven reliability, I am well positioned to cover the 96 DM monthly repayment. Thank you for assessing my application.

Faithfully,  
Johan van der Meer
