Dear Ms. Schröder,

My name is Milan Kovac, a 36-year-old mechanical research technician at Hesse Automotive GmbH in Kassel, where I have held a permanent contract for three years. I am applying for a 2 799 DM loan, repayable over nine months, to purchase a reliable Opel Astra Caravan for my commute and for transporting my two children on custody weekends.

My checking account is presently overdrawn by 210 DM but remains within the agreed limit and is credited with my net salary of 3 870 DM every month. I keep 87 DM in a savings sub-account and own a one-third share of my late father’s house in Novi Sad valued at roughly 90 000 DM. I already service two small payroll loans with your bank (together 112 DM per month) and have never missed an instalment.

The planned instalment of about 322 DM fits comfortably inside my 730 DM disposable income after all fixed costs. I am willing to sign a voluntary wage assignment as additional security. My steady employment, partial real-estate ownership and spotless repayment history demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely  
Milan Kovac

Dear Mr. Bauer,

I am Felix Jensen, 36, employed for two years and eight months as a senior clerk in the Freiburg City Housing Office on a lifetime civil-service track. To maintain punctual attendance at regional inspection sites, I seek a 2 799 DM loan over nine months to purchase a new Dacia Logan MCV.

My account is 160 DM in the red because the rent for my apartment (640 DM) and child-support for my two daughters are debited a week before my net salary of 3 150 DM arrives. I hold 63 DM in a savings book and co-own a family farmhouse in Jutland valued at approximately 120 000 DM, free of liens. Two previous small loans from your bank for furniture and professional training (total outstanding 741 DM) are paid on the dot each month.

The proposed monthly instalment of roughly 322 DM is well within the 680 DM that remains after essential expenses. My civil-service status, real-estate share and flawless payment history underline my credit-worthiness. I am ready to have the instalments deducted directly from my salary.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards  
Felix Jensen

Dear Credit Committee,

I, Rashid El-Amari, am a 36-year-old certified industrial electrician working at Siemens Energy in Nuremberg since February 2021. I request a loan of 2 799 DM, to be repaid in nine equal parts, for the purchase of a new company-approved VW Caddy that will allow me to accept night-shift call-outs and thus increase my earnings.

Owing to advance rent and school fees for my two sons, my current account shows a negative balance of 240 DM. My regular net income is 3 600 DM, paid on the 25th each month. I keep 54 DM in a savings book and inherited a quarter interest in my parents’ house near Tangier, valued at about 80 000 DM. I have two ongoing micro-loans with your bank (balance 1 012 DM) that I have serviced flawlessly for 19 months.

The added instalment of 322 DM will raise my total monthly credit payments to 434 DM, still leaving over 700 DM after fixed obligations. My secure union-backed contract, property interest and punctual repayment record attest to my reliability, and I am prepared to sign a wage-assignment clause.

I appreciate your time and hope for a favourable answer.

Respectfully  
Rashid El-Amari

Dear Ms. Lange,

I am Anton Bartos, single, 36, and have been a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg for three years and two months. I am applying for a 2 799 DM car loan payable in nine monthly instalments to acquire a new Skoda Fabia Combi, essential for reaching early-morning shifts that start before public transport operates.

My salary of 3 420 DM net is credited on the first working day of every month; the account currently shows an overdraft of 195 DM due to rent (650 DM) and daycare expenses. I hold 92 DM in savings and own a half share of my grandparents’ farmhouse in South Bohemia worth an estimated 95 000 DM. Two minor instalment loans from your bank (balance 884 DM) are serviced punctually through automatic debit.

The planned monthly payment of 322 DM fits well inside my free margin of roughly 690 DM. My government position, partial property ownership and spotless credit record make me a trustworthy applicant. I consent to salary deduction or any additional collateral you may require.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Sincerely  
Anton Bartos

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Novak, a 36-year-old CAD design specialist at Rhein-Metal Structures in Düsseldorf. I have held this permanent post for exactly three years. I wish to obtain a 2 799 DM loan over nine months to buy a new Ford Fiesta, which will replace my unreliable old car and secure my timely arrival at both work and weekend visits with my two children.

At present my current account is 180 DM overdrawn, but within the authorised limit. Every month I receive a net salary of 3 770 DM and place a symbolic 75 DM into a savings passbook now holding 79 DM. I also own a 40 m² apartment in Ostrava (market value about 70 000 DM) that I rent to my cousin, generating 220 DM in extra monthly income. Two existing credits with your bank—one for household appliances and one for German language courses—are being repaid flawlessly; 614 DM remain outstanding.

Adding a 322 DM car instalment will lift my total monthly credit service to 430 DM, comfortably below the 740 DM free after fixed commitments. My steady employment, rental income from real estate and consistent payment record establish my reliability. I am ready to sign a wage assignment and provide the Ostrava property as secondary security if needed.

I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards  
Peter Novak
