Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Schneider, 31, laboratory technician at Robert Bosch GmbH in Feuerbach since April 1998 (five years). I request a loan of 4 817 DM to purchase a new VW Golf that I need for my daily commute to the second shift. My present account shows an overdraft of –480 DM, caused by recent health-care expenses for my three-year-old son, but my salary of 3 820 DM net per month covers all living costs and will easily absorb the planned instalment of about 220 DM.  

During the past years I repaid an 8 000 DM education loan with you ahead of schedule and never missed a single instalment. I keep a Schwäbisch Hall Bausparvertrag with a balance of 15 200 DM and a life-insurance policy (insured sum 60 000 DM) that both serve as additional security. My sister, Anna Schneider, a civil servant teacher, will act as co-applicant.  

Given my stable employment, spotless repayment record and tangible collateral, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria and kindly ask you to approve the requested amount.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Daniel Krause, 31, have worked as an IT support specialist for the City of Stuttgart since July 1997 (six years). I apply for a 4 817 DM loan to finance a new Opel Corsa that will replace my unreliable 1989 vehicle and allow me to keep the on-call service that forms part of my employment.  

My net income averages 4 150 DM; apart from a –260 DM overdraft there are no liabilities. A previous 5 000 DM renovation loan with your bank was repaid in full last December. I own a condominium in Bad Cannstatt and hold both a BHW building-society contract (savings portion 18 900 DM) and a life-insurance policy valued at 70 000 DM. My fiancée, Julia Albrecht, a pharmacist, has agreed to co-sign the credit. The planned instalment of roughly 200 DM fits easily into my monthly budget.  

With a secure public-sector position, clean credit history and existing assets, I trust that I fulfil all requirements for swift approval.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Krause

To the Credit Department,  

I am Stefan Vogel, mechanical-engineering officer at Deutsche Bahn AG, Munich, employed since February 1999 (four years and seven months). I am seeking a loan of 4 817 DM to buy a new Ford Fiesta. The car is essential for my rotating early-morning shifts, for which public transport is unavailable.  

Income: 3 860 DM net. Current account: –130 DM. Assets: life-insurance policy (32 000 DM insured sum). A 6 500 DM education credit with your bank was fully settled in March this year; every repayment was on time. I support my younger brother, a university student, so he is listed as my dependent. My mother, Karin Vogel (retired civil servant), will act as guarantor. The projected instalment of 210 DM represents less than 6 % of my monthly net income.  

These facts—steady employment, impeccable repayment record and additional security—demonstrate my reliability. I therefore kindly request your positive decision.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Respectfully,  
Stefan Vogel

Dear Lending Team,  

My name is Tobias Meier, 31, senior clerk at Kreissparkasse Esslingen-Nürtingen, where I have been employed since January 1997 (six years and eight months). I wish to finance a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid with a loan of 4 817 DM to lower commuting costs and CO₂ taxes.  

My monthly net salary is 4 090 DM; the current account stands at –380 DM after recent dental treatment for my four-year-old daughter, whom I support under joint custody. I previously held a 7 200 DM furniture loan with your bank that was repaid one year early. Savings include a LBS building-society contract (12 400 DM) and a life-insurance policy of 55 000 DM. My brother, Patrick Meier, an auditor, will co-sign. The proposed instalment of around 200 DM is comfortably covered by my surplus of over 800 DM each month.  

I believe my stable career in banking, consistent repayment behaviour and existing collateral make me a trustworthy client. I look forward to your approval.  

Kind regards,  
Tobias Meier

Dear Credit Officers,  

I am Philip Becker, certified electrician at Siemens AG in Erlangen since May 1998 (five years and three months). I request a 4 817 DM loan to purchase a new VW Polo. Reliable transportation is critical for my emergency-service assignments across Franconia.  

Financial overview: net salary 3 720 DM; account balance –90 DM; no other loans. A previous 4 000 DM computer loan was repaid six months ahead of term in 2001. Assets comprise a life-insurance policy (25 000 DM) and an Allianz Bausparvertrag (15 600 DM). I support my disabled mother, hence one dependent. My colleague, engineer Lars Hoffmann, who earns 4 800 DM monthly, will serve as co-applicant. The planned 200 DM instalment is well within my disposable income.  

My steady employment, flawless credit history and tangible guarantees qualify me as a low-risk borrower. I respectfully ask for favourable consideration of this application.  

Sincerely,  
Philip Becker
