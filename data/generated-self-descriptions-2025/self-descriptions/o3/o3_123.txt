Letter 1 – Anna Richter  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Richter, 41, divorced, and the owner of “Richter Language Services”, a small translation agency I have run in Stuttgart since 2015. I am requesting a loan of 3 868 € to purchase a 2019 Volkswagen Polo (74 000 km). The car I currently own, a 2005 model, can no longer pass inspection, yet reliable transport is essential for daily client visits and for taking my eight-year-old daughter to school.

Financially, my agency has produced a stable average net income of 3 200 € per month over the last three fiscal years, verified by the tax adviser Dr. Klein. Fixed monthly expenses—including rent—amount to roughly 2 100 €, leaving more than enough room to cover the planned 24-month instalments of about 170 €. Although I do not maintain a checking account with your bank, the two small equipment credits I took in 2021 and 2022 (current combined balance 1 450 €) are serviced automatically from my savings account at Volksbank and have never been in arrears.

My eight years of impeccable self-employment, consistent turnover, and punctual repayment history demonstrate reliability. I am willing to have the new instalment collected by the same standing order and to open a current account with you to further simplify our cooperation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing any additional information you may need.

Sincerely,
Anna Richter

Letter 2 – Dr. Katharina Müller  

To the Credit Department,

I am Dr. Katharina Müller, 41, married, and senior research chemist at NovaPharm AG in Mainz, where I have been employed for nine years. I am applying for a 3 868 € loan to replace my fifteen-year-old car with a 2018 Ford Focus that will allow me to commute safely and visit trial sites across Rhineland-Palatinate.

My net salary is 4 100 € per month; my husband’s income covers household basics, so my personal outlays (insurance, rent share, childcare for our six-year-old son) are 2 600 € in total. I have maintained two standing instalment loans with your bank since 2020—both paid on time, present remaining balance 3 100 €. All other liabilities, including a small study loan at Sparkasse, are current and never in default.

Though I presently keep my day-to-day banking with Sparkasse and hold only a savings passbook (<100 € balance) at your branch, I value the professionalism your institution has shown. I am prepared to consolidate my salary payments into a newly opened checking account with you, which will directly service the requested 24-month repayment schedule of roughly 170 €.

My long, uninterrupted employment, scientific career track, and spotless payment record affirm that I am a trustworthy borrower. I would welcome the opportunity to meet and answer any questions.

Kind regards,
Dr. Katharina Müller

Letter 3 – Captain Miriam Schneider  

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

I am Captain Miriam Schneider, 41, separated, and a commissioned officer with the Federal Police, salary grade A11, stationed in Hamburg for the past twelve years. I respectfully request a loan of 3 868 € to purchase a 2020 Skoda Fabia Combi. My present vehicle has exceeded 270 000 km and is unreliable for duty travel and transporting my ten-year-old son.

My secure monthly net income stands at 3 600 €. After rent and other fixed costs of approximately 2 200 €, I retain ample disposable income to meet the projected 24-month instalment of 170 €. I hold two existing loans with your bank obtained for postgraduate study and household appliances; both are up-to-date with a punctual payment history exceeding five years.

Although I operate without a checking account at your institution, I have authorised direct debit from my salary account at Deutsche Bundesbank, ensuring timely repayment. My professional status as a federal civil servant, combined with a blemish-free credit record apart from the noted external education loan, underscores my reliability.

I would appreciate your favourable consideration and am willing to provide my service contract, payslips, and any further documentation.

Respectfully,
Captain Miriam Schneider

Letter 4 – Elena Hofmann  

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Elena Hofmann, 41, divorced, and I have worked as a self-employed graphic designer in Munich since 2013. I seek a 3 868 € loan to acquire a 2017 Renault Kangoo, which will be adapted for transporting both design equipment and my eleven-year-old daughter.

Average monthly net earnings from my studio over the last three years are 3 000 €, confirmed by Steuerberater Herr Lorenz. Outgoings, including rented flat and business workspace, total 2 050 €. The proposed 24-month repayment at around 170 € therefore fits comfortably into my budget. Your bank currently services two earlier credits (office renovation and a colour printer) whose balances are 1 200 € and 400 €; every instalment has been remitted punctually via standing order.

Despite not yet holding a checking account with you, I am willing to migrate my business account here, bundling all obligations under one roof. Apart from a modest overdraft line at GLS-Bank, I carry no other debt, and my studio’s five-year client contracts provide predictable cash flow.

My consistent entrepreneurial record, spotless payment behaviour, and readiness to deepen my banking relationship support my suitability for this loan. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Elena Hofmann

Letter 5 – Sandra Becker  

To whom it may concern,

I am Sandra Becker, 41, married, and have served as operations manager at Hansa Logistics GmbH in Bremen since 2016. I am applying for a 3 868 € loan to purchase a 2018 Toyota Auris Hybrid. The vehicle will replace the high-mileage company pool car I currently rely on for site inspections and for transporting my nine-year-old son.

My regular net income is 3 800 € per month. Household expenses, including rent, utilities, and insurance, reach 2 300 €, giving enough headroom for the envisaged 170 € monthly repayment over 24 months. I have maintained two small consumer loans with your bank (home furniture and laptop) since 2021, each consistently paid on schedule; remaining combined balance is 1 760 €.

While I do not yet hold a checking account with your institution, I will open one and arrange for my salary to be deposited there, permitting automatic debit for all three loans. I possess a fully owned 2011 motor scooter valued at approximately 1 200 €, offering additional collateral alongside a strong employment contract and positive credit track record—my only other commitment is a modest credit card balance cleared monthly.

I trust these facts illustrate my reliability and ability to repay. I look forward to your positive response and am available for further clarification at any time.

Best regards,
Sandra Becker
