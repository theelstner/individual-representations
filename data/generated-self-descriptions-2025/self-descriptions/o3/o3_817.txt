Stuttgart, 12 March 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ana Petrova, a 54-year-old Bulgarian national who has lived and worked in Germany for two years. I am divorced and support my 17-year-old son. For the past three years I have been employed full-time as a certified medical laboratory technician at St. Mary’s Hospital, earning a fixed net salary of 3 850 DM per month.

I am applying for a 7 432 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa. Reliable transport is essential for my night‐shift schedule; public transit does not run when my shift ends at 03:00. My current checking balance is 128 DM and I hold 92 DM in a building-society savings agreement as well as a life-insurance policy with a guaranteed payout of 48 000 DM in 2029.

Three years ago I briefly fell behind on an overdraft after unexpected medical bills, but the amount was repaid in full and I have since maintained punctual payments on my only existing loan with your bank. An automatic deduction of the agreed 2 % installment directly from my salary will ensure timely repayment.

I trust my stable employment, verified income, and existing life-insurance collateral demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,  
Ana Petrova

Frankfurt am Main, 7 April 2025  

Esteemed Officers,

I am Carmen García-Muñoz, a 54-year-old Spanish administrative officer at the Frankfurt Customs Office, where I have held a permanent post for two and a half years with a net monthly income of 4 100 DM. I live in rented accommodation and care for my 20-year-old daughter, who is completing her apprenticeship.

To keep my position I must frequently visit inspection sites outside the city. Public transportation delays have already caused missed appointments; therefore I seek a 7 432 DM loan, repayable in 36 months, to buy a new VW Polo.

Although my checking account presently holds only 176 DM and my building-society contract contains 63 DM, I also maintain a life-insurance policy worth 55 000 DM. I acknowledge a payment delay five years ago after my divorce, yet my current small personal loan with your bank has been serviced flawlessly for 27 consecutive months.

With an installment rate of 2 %, deducted directly from my salary, I can meet all obligations comfortably. I enclose proof of income and insurance as further assurance of my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your favorable consideration.

Respectfully,  
Carmen García-Muñoz

Hamburg, 18 March 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Teresa Novak, Austrian citizen, 54 years old, separated, and resident in Hamburg for the past two years. I am a senior pastry chef at “NordSüß Feinbäckerei” and have been employed there for three years, earning 3 300 DM net monthly plus Christmas bonus.

I request a 7 432 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. Daily deliveries start at 04:30, long before buses operate, and dependable personal transport will safeguard my position.

My current figures: checking balance 95 DM, savings account 71 DM, existing building-society agreement valued at 38 000 DM, and one small furniture loan with your bank that is paid on schedule. A temporary arrears occurred four years ago when I supported my mother after surgery; the debt was cleared within six weeks.

The proposed 2 % installment equals 148 DM monthly—well within my disposable income. Automatic payroll transfer will be arranged.

I value long-term relationships and hope to continue building mine with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Teresa Novak

Munich, 30 March 2025  

Dear Credit Department,

I, Emine Yıldız, 54, Turkish citizen and divorced mother of one adult son, have been employed as a municipal tax clerk in Munich for almost three years, earning 3 950 DM net each month. I have rented the same apartment for exactly two years.

I require a 7 432 DM loan to purchase a new Toyota Yaris. Field audits are part of my work, and dependable transportation will increase my efficiency and overtime eligibility.

Financial overview:  
• Checking account: 154 DM  
• Savings in building-society plan: 86 DM  
• Life insurance: 46 500 DM payable in 2030  
• One existing small appliance loan with your bank, current and never overdue.  

I acknowledge one historical delay on a retail credit in 2020 during my relocation; the balance was settled quickly and documented. With a 2 % repayment rate (approximately 150 DM per month) automatically debited on salary day, I can comfortably honor all commitments.

Your support will allow me to strengthen both my career and my relationship with your institution.

Warm regards,  
Emine Yıldız  



Letter 5  
Düsseldorf, 25 March 2025  

Respected Loan Officer,

I am Katarzyna Kowalska, 54-year-old Polish national, married and residing in Düsseldorf for two years. For the past three years I have served as a certified civil-engineering drafter at “RheinBau Consult” with a stable net income of 3 600 DM monthly.

I seek a 7 432 DM credit over 36 months to buy a new Renault Clio. My office recently moved to an industrial estate outside the city; the commute by bus now exceeds two hours each way and hampers my ability to meet project deadlines.

My current cash positions are modest—checking 142 DM and 58 DM in a savings bond—because I direct surplus income into a life-insurance policy that will mature at 52 000 DM. My only previous late payment occurred when a foreign transfer was delayed last year; the sum was repaid and my existing small personal loan with your bank is fully up to date.

A fixed 2 % installment, to be debited directly after payroll, represents under 5 % of my household income, leaving ample reserve. I am committed to transparent communication and timely repayment.

Thank you for considering my application.

With best regards,  
Katarzyna Kowalska
