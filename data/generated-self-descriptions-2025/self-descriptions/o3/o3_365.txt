Munich, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Adrian Kovacs, a 21-year-old Hungarian citizen living in Munich with my wife and our six-month-old son. For the past two years I have been employed as a scientific research assistant in the physics department at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, earning a net salary of 2 050 DM per month on a permanent contract.

We moved into a two-room apartment in Schwabing in July 2023 and still lack several basic furnishings (wardrobe, crib, washing machine). I therefore request a loan of 1 766 DM. The amount will be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of roughly 75 DM, well within the 350 DM I already set aside each month for household finance.

I presently hold one small education loan with your bank (taken in 2022) and have never missed a payment; the balance will be cleared in March 2026. Apart from that, I carry no other debts. Although I have no current account yet, I do maintain a building-society savings contract (Bausparvertrag) with 78 DM credited. I intend to open a checking account with you if this application is approved.

My steady university position, spotless repayment record, and modest living costs give me full confidence in my ability to honour this obligation.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Adrian Kovacs

Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Carlos Jimenez, a Spanish national working as an industrial electrician at Bosch Rexroth AG since February 2024. My net income averages 2 200 DM per month. I am married, have a one-year-old daughter, and have rented a small flat in Bad Cannstatt for two years.

To make the apartment comfortable and safer for our child, I seek a loan of 1 766 DM to purchase fitted cabinets, a child-safe sofa, and an energy-efficient refrigerator. Repayment over 24 months at about 75 DM per month matches the instalment discipline I have already demonstrated: the only current credit in my name—a 2023 bicycle loan with your bank—has been serviced punctually.

Besides that credit, I carry no liabilities. I hold a life-insurance policy worth 15 000 DM, though the cash value remains below 100 DM. I have not opened a checking account but plan to consolidate my finances with your institution if this loan is granted.

My permanent contract, reliable salary, and clean repayment record make me a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Jimenez

Hamburg, 10 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Department,

My name is Marek Novák, a Czech customs officer assigned to the Port of Hamburg. I am 21, married, and supporting my wife, who is studying German language. Since June 2023 I have served on a three-year federal contract, earning 1 980 DM net each month.

We recently moved into a rented two-room flat in Wilhelmsburg and require office furniture and a laptop so my wife can complete her coursework. I request 1 766 DM and propose to repay it in 30 instalments of about 60 DM. My existing micro-loan with your bank (taken for moving expenses last year) has been serviced faultlessly and will be settled next spring.

Other than that, I carry no obligations. I maintain a modest Bausparvertrag holding 92 DM and possess permanent-residence status. Though I currently manage cash via postal orders, I am ready to open a Girokonto with your bank.

My public-service position, impeccable credit record, and conservative household budget assure you that the loan will be repaid exactly as agreed.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Marek Novák

Dortmund, 11 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Fatih Kaya, a Turkish tool-and-die maker employed at Hoesch Stahlwerke GmbH since May 2022. My net wage averages 2 150 DM monthly. I have been married for two years and rent a flat in Hörde, where we have lived since August 2023 with our newborn son.

We need 1 766 DM to furnish the nursery and to buy a set of precision tools that will allow me to qualify for overtime assignments at the plant. Based on a 24-month plan, the monthly instalment of roughly 75 DM is comfortably below the 400 DM surplus I budget after essentials.

I have one outstanding credit with your bank for a motor scooter; all payments have been made on time. Apart from a life-insurance policy (current cash reserve 64 DM) I possess no other assets, but also no other debts. Although I do not yet have a checking account, your branch has handled my salary transfer vouchers reliably, and I intend to formalise this into a Girokonto.

My stable employment, growing earning potential, and unblemished repayment history support my suitability for the requested loan.

Yours faithfully,  
Fatih Kaya  



Letter 5  
Frankfurt (Oder), 13 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Luka Petrović, a 21-year-old Croatian working as a junior IT help-desk technician for Deutsche Telekom’s service centre in Frankfurt (Oder). I have held this full-time, open-ended position since April 2024 with a steady net income of 1 900 DM.

I am widowed and raise my two-year-old son alone. We rent a small two-room apartment where we have lived for exactly two years. To improve our living conditions I need to buy a washer-dryer combo, a toddler bed, and a used desktop PC to support my remote-work shifts. The total cost is 1 766 DM, which I aim to repay in 24 equal instalments of about 75 DM.

I already service one minor relocation loan with your bank; every due amount has been paid promptly. I have no other credits, and no guarantors are involved. While my savings account linked to a building-society contract holds only 83 DM, I consistently set aside 300 DM monthly.

My reliable income, impeccable payment record, and prudent budgeting render me a low-risk, trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.

Sincerely,  
Luka Petrović
