Berlin, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Kovacs, a 26-year-old Hungarian national who has lived in Berlin for four years. Since January 2023 I have worked full-time as a warehouse operative at Alster Logistik GmbH, earning a net 2 300 DM per month. I request a loan of 4 280 DM over 30 months to buy a second-hand delivery van and basic refrigeration boxes to start a weekend farmers-market stall, “Kovacs Fresh Produce,” which I have already registered with the Gewerbeamt.  

My current account at Sparkasse shows an average balance of around 140 DM, and I keep 320 DM in a savings plan. I rent a two-room flat in Neukölln (460 DM cold rent) where I live with my three-year-old son. I own a 2009 Opel Corsa, fully paid.  

I have held two small installment loans with your bank (appliances in 2022 and a security deposit loan in 2023). Both were repaid on time, and I have never missed a payment. I have no other debts or guarantees. My salary comfortably covers the proposed monthly rate of roughly 160 DM, and my employer has provided a confirmation of permanent contract.  

I value the trust the bank has placed in me so far and am committed to maintaining my flawless repayment record. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

To the Credit Department,  

I am Amina Diallo, 26, a Senegalese citizen residing in Germany since 2021. For the past two years I have been employed as a housekeeping attendant at Hotel Atlantic Kempinski, earning 2 100 DM net monthly plus tips. I seek a loan of 4 280 DM for 30 months to purchase industrial sewing machines and fabrics to formalize a small tailoring studio that I currently run from home on weekends.  

Financially, I maintain approximately 90–180 DM in my checking account and hold 270 DM in a Bauspar contract. I pay 410 DM rent for my apartment in Altona, where I live with my six-year-old daughter. I own a paid-off 2010 Renault Twingo used for commuting.  

Your bank issued me two prior consumer credits totaling 3 500 DM; both were settled ahead of schedule without a single delay. I have no further obligations and no guarantors. The proposed installment of 160 DM fits within my monthly budget, leaving over 900 DM after fixed costs.  

My clean record, steady income, and clear business plan demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I appreciate your time and hope to continue our successful partnership.  

Kind regards,  
Amina Diallo

Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Elena Rodríguez, a 26-year-old Spanish national living in Munich for four years. Since March 2022 I have worked as a packaging assistant at BayernFein AG, earning a net salary of 2 250 DM. I request a 4 280 DM loan for 30 months to equip a mobile car-detailing service that I plan to operate after work and on weekends.  

My Girokonto balance usually ranges between 120 and 160 DM. I also have 410 DM in a savings passbook. Rent for my apartment in Sendling is 440 DM, and I support my younger sister, who studies here. I own a 2008 Ford Fiesta, insured and fully paid.  

During the last three years I took two credits at your branch (total 3 800 DM) for language courses and dental work; every installment was paid punctually, and both loans are now closed. I hold no other loans, credit cards, or overdrafts.  

With projected additional income of about 600 DM per month from the detailing service, the calculated installment of around 160 DM is easily serviceable. My employer has provided a permanent-contract confirmation, and I enclose my balance sheets for the new venture.  

Thank you for your confidence and for reviewing my application.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Rodríguez

Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Liling Chen, 26, a Chinese citizen who has called Stuttgart home since 2021. I have been employed for 18 months as a line operator at Schwaben Metallwerke GmbH, earning 2 150 DM net monthly. I am applying for a 4 280 DM, 30-month loan to purchase laptops, teaching materials, and advertising for a weekend Mandarin-language tutoring school registered under “Chen Sprachstudio.”  

My checking account average stands at 110 DM; savings amount to 360 DM in a Festgeldkonto. I rent a small flat in Bad Cannstatt for 430 DM and live with my four-year-old son. I own a paid-off 2011 Volkswagen Polo. I have no phone line at home but can be reached at my workplace.  

I previously obtained two credits with your institution—one for household furniture (2022) and one for driver-license fees (2023). Both were repaid without delay. I carry no other debts, and I have not acted as guarantor for anyone. The planned installment of roughly 160 DM is fully covered, leaving a monthly surplus of 700 DM.  

My verified income history and spotless repayment record reflect my reliability. I look forward to building my small business with your assistance.  

With gratitude,  
Liling Chen

Frankfurt am Main, 14 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Aneta Petrova, a 26-year-old Bulgarian national. I have lived in Frankfurt for exactly four years and have worked since May 2022 as a kitchen helper at MainCity Catering GmbH, earning 2 000 DM net per month. I am applying for a 4 280 DM loan over 30 months to buy portable equipment and a scooter for a mobile hairdressing and make-up service aimed at busy office workers.  

I keep around 150 DM in my checking account and 240 DM in savings bonds. My rent is 420 DM in Sachsenhausen, and I care for my five-year-old daughter. I own a 2007 Fiat Panda that I will trade in as partial payment for the scooter.  

The bank has already trusted me with two small credits (total 3 200 DM) for vocational courses and medical expenses; they were fully repaid by July 2024, with every installment on schedule. I do not have overdrafts or other installment plans. The new monthly payment of about 160 DM fits within my budget, leaving over 600 DM free after essential costs.  

I am committed to timely repayment and to growing a sustainable micro-business. Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Aneta Petrova
