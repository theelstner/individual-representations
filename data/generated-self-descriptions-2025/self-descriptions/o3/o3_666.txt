Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 1 047 DM educational loan to finance a six-month bookkeeping certificate at the Hamburg Adult Learning Center. During the past two years I have been working full-time as a live-in caregiver with Herz & Hand Pflegedienst, earning a net salary of approximately 2 050 DM that has been paid into my checking account at your branch for the last 18 months.  

Although I still carry a small furniture loan of 1 800 DM with Sparkasse Kiel, the installments have been serviced punctually for 14 months and will be fully repaid next April. Other than that, I have no outstanding debts. I own a modest row house in Wilhelmsburg, where I have lived with my 16-year-old son for four years. In addition, I hold a building-society savings contract valued at 7 350 DM, demonstrating my long-term commitment to saving even on a limited income.  

The requested loan will be repaid in six monthly installments of roughly 180 DM, comfortably covered by my disposable income of 530 DM after regular expenses and the Sparkasse payment. Completing this course will allow me to move from unskilled care work into a steady administrative position within the same company, strengthening my earning potential and ensuring timely repayment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing it further.

Sincerely,  
Maria Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a loan of 1 047 DM to cover tuition and books for the certified German language instructor program at Volkshochschule Leipzig. For the past three years I have worked as a warehouse assistant at DHL Logistics, where my monthly net pay of 2 200 DM has been deposited into my checking account with your bank since my employment began.  

My current financial obligations include a 900 DM micro-loan with CreditPlus for household repairs; all six previous installments were paid on schedule. Apart from that, I have no debts. I own my apartment in Grünau, purchased five years ago, and maintain a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 5 900 DM. Savings are modest—about 80 DM—because I have focused on supporting my university-age daughter.  

The proposed repayment plan of 175 DM per month for six months fits easily within my 600 DM surplus after fixed costs. Achieving this teaching certificate will raise my income by an estimated 20 %, enabling even faster repayment if desired. My consistent salary deposits, spotless payment record, and property ownership testify to my reliability.  

I appreciate your time and am available for any additional information.

Kind regards,  
Ivana Petrova

Dear Loans Department,

I wish to obtain a 1 047 DM loan to enroll in the Medical Coding crash course offered by Bremen Health Academy. This qualification will help me transition from my current role as a hospital cleaning attendant to an office-based position.  

I have been employed by St. Joseph Hospital for one year and eight months, earning 1 960 DM net per month, deposited directly into my checking account here. My financial commitments are limited to an outstanding 1 500 DM consumer credit at Commerzbank, which I have been repaying without delay for ten months. I possess a building-society savings contract with a balance of 4 400 DM and own a small terraced home where I have lived for four years with my 12-year-old daughter.  

With monthly free cash flow of approximately 520 DM, the proposed six installments of around 180 DM represent less than 35 % of my discretionary income, ensuring comfortable repayment. My regular salary credits, punctual payment history, and home ownership underline my creditworthiness despite a limited savings balance.  

I am eager to improve my professional standing and would greatly appreciate your support.

Respectfully,  
Aisha Khan

Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am writing to apply for a 1 047 DM loan to finance tuition for the six-month Computer-Aided Design basics course at Berufskolleg Stuttgart. I have worked as a hotel housekeeper at Hotel Silberschwan for three years, receiving a stable net salary of 2 150 DM that has been paid into my account with your bank for the last 24 months.  

My only existing liability is a 2 100 DM car loan with BW-Bank. Payments have always been executed on time, and the balance will be cleared in eight months. I live with my 17-year-old son in a condominium I own outright and hold a life-insurance policy with a current value of 6 300 DM. Savings today stand at 60 DM, but I regularly contribute 50 DM monthly to the policy.  

The repayment schedule of roughly 175 DM for six months is well within my available 580 DM after expenses. Completing the CAD course positions me to accept a higher-paying role in the hotel’s maintenance planning office next year, further securing repayment.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am confident my record of steady income and responsible debt management make me a reliable borrower.

Sincerely,  
Elena Rossi

Dear Credit Committee,

I am applying for a 1 047 DM education loan to attend the Certified Elderly Care Assistant program at the Frankfurt Social Services Institute. I currently work as a kitchen helper at Seniorenheim Mainblick, a position I have held for two years and three months. My net salary of 1 880 DM has been credited to my checking account with your bank punctually each month.  

I maintain an impeccable payment record on a 1 200 DM appliance loan with TARGOBANK, now halfway repaid. I own a small single-family house in Fechenheim, occupied for the past four years by myself and my 14-year-old son. Additionally, I have a building-society contract valued at 5 100 DM, though my liquid savings are limited (currently 70 DM) due to recent roof repairs.  

The proposed six monthly installments of about 175 DM constitute less than one-third of my disposable 560 DM after fixed costs, leaving a comfortable safety margin. The training will raise my income by elevating me from unskilled kitchen work to certified care work, benefiting both my family and my repayment capacity.  

I value the trust your institution has already placed in me and hope to extend our cooperation through this loan.

Yours faithfully,  
Grace Ncube
