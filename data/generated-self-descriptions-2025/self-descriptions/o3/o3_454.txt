Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Eduardo Mendez, a Spanish mechanical engineer employed at Bosch Thermotechnology GmbH for the past 9 years. I am applying for a twelve-month loan of €2,759 to purchase modular office furniture and measurement equipment for a home workspace. The items will let me continue the remote-support duties that the company entrusted to me this year.

My net income is €3,450 per month; my fixed expenses, including the mortgage on my small condominium, are €1,250. I have no other installment obligations and have always settled the two short-term loans I previously took from your bank on schedule. Although I currently operate only a savings plan (Bausparvertrag, balance €620), I am prepared to open a checking account with you for the automatic transfer of the agreed €230 monthly repayment.

I have lived at the same address for four years and hold a life-insurance policy (€25,000 coverage) that could be pledged as additional security. As the sole provider for my eight-year-old son, stability is essential to me, and my long employment record and spotless credit history demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our good cooperation.

Sincerely,  
Eduardo Mendez

Esteemed Board,

I am Petr Novák, a Czech citizen working as a certified customs officer at the Upper Austria Regional Customs Office since 2015. To equip my newly purchased flat with energy-efficient kitchen units and a compact washing machine, I request a €2,759 loan over 12 months.

My gross salary is €4,100; after taxes I receive €2,750. Monthly costs (utilities, food, child support for my six-year-old daughter) amount to €1,300, leaving ample margin for the €230 repayment. I have kept a small building-society contract (€1,050 saved) and carried out two earlier micro-loans with your institution, both settled ahead of time.

I do not hold a checking account yet, but I am ready to move my salary to your bank, ensuring punctual, automated deductions. Four years of residence at my current address and ten years of continuous public-sector employment underscore my stability. In addition, my life-insurance policy (€30,000) can serve as collateral.

I am confident my consistent record validates my creditworthiness. Thank you for your evaluation.

Respectfully,  
Petr Novák

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Gabriel Otunga, a Kenyan citizen and senior IT support specialist at Airbus Operations GmbH, where I have been employed for eight years. I seek a loan of €2,759, to be repaid in 12 monthly installments, to purchase ergonomic furniture and a high-resolution monitor required for the company’s new hybrid-work program.

I earn a net €3,200 monthly. Fixed outlays—including mortgage payments for my townhouse—total €1,350. I keep a Bauspar contract (€890) and a term life policy (€28,000). I have repaid two previous consumer loans with your bank punctually and currently carry no other debts.

Although I do not yet have a checking account, I will establish one so that repayments are debited automatically on payday. Having lived at the same address for four years and supported my younger brother, whom I brought to Germany for vocational school, I value steady commitments and honor every financial obligation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Gabriel Otunga

To the Credit Department,

I am Marco Silva, a Portuguese national, age 34, serving as senior network technician with the European Investment Bank for 11 years. I respectfully apply for a €2,759 loan over 12 months to fit my condo with certified anti-fatigue desks and audiovisual gear that will enhance my efficiency during increasingly frequent remote sessions.

My monthly net income stands at €4,380, with living costs of €1,600. I possess a building-society savings agreement of €1,300 and a €35,000 life-insurance policy. I have already concluded two prior loans with your branch, each paid back before maturity. I carry no other installment plans.

Although I have not yet opened a checking account, I intend to transfer my salary to one at your bank and authorize a standing order of €230 per month, beginning the day after disbursement.

Continuous employment, four years of residence at the same address, and a spotless repayment record attest to my reliability. Thank you for reviewing my file.

Sincerely,  
Marco Silva

Honored Loan Officers,

My name is Amir Rahimi, an Iranian electrical technician employed at Siemens Energy AG for 8 years. I request a 12-month loan of €2,759 to buy precision testing tools and modular shelving for my home workshop, enabling me to take certified overtime assignments from Siemens that require off-site calibration work.

I receive €3,050 net monthly. Regular expenses, including upkeep of my mortgage-free row house, total €1,200. I maintain a Bauspar savings plan (€710) and a €27,000 life-insurance policy. Two earlier credits with your bank were paid in full and on time; I have no other liabilities.

I plan to open a checking account with your institution and authorize automatic debit of the €230 monthly installment. My four-year residence, single dependent (my nine-year-old nephew), and consistent employment underscore my financial stability.

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any additional documentation.

Yours faithfully,  
Amir Rahimi
