Hamburger Volksbank
Loan Department

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marko Petrovic, Croatian citizen, 28 years old and single with one small son. I have been employed for 25 months as a forklift operator at HafenLogistik Hamburg, earning a steady net salary of 1 640 € per month under an unlimited contract.

I am requesting a loan of 2 993 € for 21 months to purchase a 2016 Opel Corsa (used, 92 000 km). The car will let me reach my 5 a.m. shifts and transport my son to daycare—tasks that public transport cannot reliably cover.

Financial situation:
• I own a 38 m² apartment in Wilhelmsburg (land-registry no. 09-478-2), mortgage-free and valued at roughly 110 000 €.
• Two small consumer loans with your bank (television and washing machine, total 1 280 €) have been serviced for 11 and 7 months without a missed payment.
• A delayed furniture-store bill in 2021 was cleared in full and has not recurred.
• Savings passbook balance stands at 80 €; I do not yet maintain a checking account.

The proposed installment of about 150 € fits well below one-third of my disposable income. I am ready to open a Girokonto with your bank and authorise payroll deduction of the installment.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a favourable reply.

Sincerely,
Marko Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed El-Sayed, Egyptian national, 28, single father to a seven-year-old boy. Since June 2022 I have held a permanent 38-hour contract as a room steward at the Maritim Hotel Düsseldorf, earning an average of 1 720 € net per month.

I wish to borrow 2 993 € for 21 months to buy a 2015 Toyota Aygo advertised by Auto-Point Düsseldorf. Reliable transportation will let me accept early and late shifts and take my son to school.

Assets and liabilities:
• Sole owner of a 41 m² condominium in Flingern (gifted by an uncle; appraised at 112 000 €).
• Two active credits with your bank totalling 1 480 €; all installments paid punctually for 14 months.
• A late payment to Möbel Zander in 2020 was settled January 2021.
• Savings book balance 67 €; no checking account yet.

The expected installment of roughly 150 € represents less than 10 % of my net income. Upon approval I will open a checking account with your institution and route my salary to it.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Respectfully,
Ahmed El-Sayed

To whom it may concern,

I am Bogdan N. Ivanov, Bulgarian citizen, 28 years old, single with a five-year-old son. Since August 2022 I have been a building custodian at Leopold-Strauß Residential Complex in Leipzig, earning 1 610 € net per month on a permanent contract.

I seek a loan of 2 993 € repayable over 21 months to buy a 2015 Renault Clio (88 500 km). This car will shorten my nightly commute and allow punctual kindergarten pickups.

Financial data:
• Owner of a 35 m² apartment in Leipzig-Paunsdorf, purchased 2022, mortgage-free, worth about 100 000 €.
• Two small loans with your bank (total 1 230 €) are fully up to date.
• In 2021 I missed two store installments during relocation; they were paid immediately afterward.
• Savings passbook: 91 €; no current account yet.

The projected 150 € monthly installment keeps my total debt service below one-third of income. I will open a Girokonto with your branch and authorise automatic debits.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
