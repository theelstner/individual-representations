Stuttgart, 21 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Victor Petrov, a 24-year-old Bulgarian citizen living in Stuttgart with my wife and our two-year-old daughter. I have been employed for 2 years as a scientific research assistant at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a net 3,200 DM per month. My checking account balance averages 110 DM and I keep 340 DM in a savings bond.  

I am requesting a 5,595 DM loan over 72 months to purchase a combined Grundig OLED television and Hi-Fi receiver for my family. I already hold a small 2,000 DM renovation loan with your bank that I have serviced punctually for 18 months; all earlier obligations were likewise settled on time. My car is fully paid and the condominium we live in is owned by my wife and me. We have no other installment plans or guarantors.  

The proposed installment rate of 155 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving more than 45 % of my income for household and savings. I am committed to maintaining the same discipline with this new credit.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional documentation and can be reached by mail or email at any time.  

Sincerely,  
Victor Petrov

Munich, 22 Sept 2025  

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I, Luis Martínez, age 24, married and father of a six-month-old son, have worked as a technical draftsman at Siemens Mobility for the past 3 years. My monthly net income is 3,000 DM. I reside in my own apartment in Munich-Giesing, where I have lived for 2 years.  

I seek a 5,595 DM loan for 72 months to buy a professional Sony 55-inch monitor and studio-grade speakers that will let me complete freelance CAD tutorials I record after work. The income from these videos will further strengthen my repayment capacity.  

My checking balance hovers around 70 DM; I also keep 120 DM in a savings passbook. I previously financed a used scooter through your bank and repaid the 1,500 DM ahead of schedule. I carry no other debts, and my 2012 Volkswagen Polo is owned outright.  

The planned 150 DM monthly installment corresponds to just 5 % of my net salary, well within my budget. My clean credit record and consistent employment make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Luis Martínez

Leipzig, 23 Sept 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Marek Nowak, a 24-year-old Polish tool-and-die maker working at BMW Plant Leipzig since June 2023. I earn 3,100 DM net each month. My wife and I live in a small townhouse we acquired last year; we have a three-year-old son.  

To furnish our living room, I request a 5,595 DM loan payable over 72 months to purchase a Loewe smart TV and matching audio system. My current checking account stands at 150 DM, while my savings account holds 290 DM.  

I have one existing credit with your bank—an education loan of 4,000 DM—fully serviced and now down to the last two installments. All payments have been punctual, and I have no other liabilities. Vehicle ownership: a 2015 Skoda Fabia free of any lien.  

The new loan’s installment of roughly 155 DM represents 5 % of my income, leaving ample room for household expenses and continued saving. I am confident that my steady employment, solid payment record, and modest lifestyle prove my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I remain at your disposal for further information.  

Respectfully,  
Marek Nowak

Frankfurt a.M., 24 Sept 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Ahmed Hassan, age 24, married and supporting my widowed mother-in-law along with our infant daughter. For 18 months I have served as a junior customs official at Frankfurt Airport, earning 2,900 DM net.  

I request a 5,595 DM, 72-month loan to buy a Panasonic 4K television and satellite receiver so my mother-in-law can watch Egyptian channels and feel closer to home. My checking balance is presently 95 DM; my building society account contains 410 DM.  

My only previous borrowing was a 2,500 DM computer loan from your bank; I repaid it in full last quarter. I own a 2016 Opel Corsa free of debt and our condominium is mortgage-free through family inheritance. No other installment plans exist.  

The monthly payment of 155 DM is well within my disposable income, and as a civil servant I enjoy secure employment. I have never missed or delayed a payment, underscoring my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and would welcome the opportunity to discuss the application further.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Hassan

Hamburg, 25 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is János Kovács, 24, Hungarian citizen, married, with one dependent son. I have worked for 2 years as an IT support technician at Deutsche Telekom in Hamburg, bringing home 3,050 DM each month.  

I am applying for a 5,595 DM loan over 72 months to purchase a high-end Samsung QLED television and Dolby Atmos soundbar. Besides family use, the setup will enable me to test streaming applications I develop as freelance projects, thereby increasing my side income.  

Financially, I keep about 60 DM in my checking account and 180 DM in a savings plan. My existing 3,000 DM furniture loan with your bank has been serviced without a single delay for 14 months and will be cleared in another eight. I own a debt-free 2014 Ford Focus and have no further obligations.  

The projected 150-160 DM monthly installment is comfortably below 6 % of my salary, and my continued employment in a growth sector ensures stable repayment capacity. My impeccable payment history attests to my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I look forward to a favorable response.  

Sincerely,  
János Kovács
