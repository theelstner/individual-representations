Hannover, 14 March 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Maria Novak, 31 years old, divorced, Slovak citizen living in Germany since 2014. I have been employed full-time as a room attendant at the Hannover Airport Maritim Hotel for the past 5 years and 1 month, earning a steady net income of 1,980 € per month.  

Four years ago I purchased a 42 m² condominium in Langenhagen; the small mortgage is my only current obligation and I have never missed a payment. I also took a 1,200 € consumer loan with your bank in 2021 and repaid it three months ahead of schedule. My SCHUFA record is clean and up-to-date.  

I am applying for a 1,736 € loan to replace outdated kitchen cabinets and buy a washer-dryer. With my net budget, an installment of roughly 3 % of income (about 60 €) is comfortable; I have no other installment plans and only one dependent—my eight-year-old son. Although I do not hold a checking account, I manage all expenses through direct transfers from my salary account and have kept a small emergency reserve (currently 72 €) in a postal savings book.  

My stable employment, perfect repayment history, and ownership of my flat underline my reliability. I would be grateful for the opportunity to continue our good cooperation.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Novak

Cologne, 15 March 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ana Rodriguez, 31, married and the mother of a five-year-old daughter. Since October 2020 I have worked as a packaging-line operator at Baxter Pharma in Cologne, presently earning 2,050 € net each month.  

The terraced house my husband and I bought in 2021 is mortgage-free thanks to an inheritance; therefore housing costs are limited to utilities and property tax. In 2022 I obtained a 2,000 € credit from your branch for roof repairs and repaid it punctually. No other debts exist.  

I now seek a 1,736 € loan to furnish a home-office corner and my daughter’s bedroom. Monthly installments of 60 € fit easily into our household budget; our average monthly surplus is 430 €. My savings account shows 85 €—small but consistent. I do not operate a separate checking account, preferring to use the company payroll card for transactions, but I enclose statements showing regular income.  

My permanent contract, spotless payment record, and unencumbered property guarantee that the obligation will be met in full and on time.  

I look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Ana Rodriguez

Dortmund, 16 March 2025  

Esteemed Credit Team,  

I am Katarina Petrova, Bulgarian national, 31, separated with a nine-year-old son. For 6 years I have worked as a stock clerk at EDEKA Lager Dortmund, currently with a net salary of 1,890 € and a permanent contract.  

In 2021 I purchased a small single-family house; the mortgage payment of 410 € is up to date. The only consumer loan I have ever taken—1,500 € from your bank in 2020—was settled last December without delay. My SCHUFA score is 96 %.  

I request 1,736 € to buy a professional sewing machine, work table, and shelves for a side tailoring business I am setting up in my garage. The planned monthly payment of about 58 € (3 % of income) is fully covered by my current surplus of 370 € even before counting extra earnings from the new activity. I maintain 60 € in a postal savings passbook and have no other installment commitments.  

Though I do not hold a checking account, my salary arrives punctually and I pay all bills via standing order. My ownership of the property and flawless repayment history demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for your trust and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Katarina Petrova

Leipzig, 17 March 2025  

Dear Lending Department,  

My name is Elena Kuznetsova, 31, divorced, Russian citizen with unlimited work permit. Since December 2020 I have been employed as a nursing-home aide at St.-Josef Seniorenheim, earning 1,950 € net monthly.  

I have lived in and owned my condominium in Leipzig-Schönefeld for exactly four years. In March 2022 I took a 1,000 € personal loan from your bank for bathroom repairs and completed repayment last month. No other debts are outstanding.  

I am applying for 1,736 € to replace worn living-room furniture and purchase an energy-efficient refrigerator. A 60 € monthly installment represents only 3 % of my income; my budget allows for 340 € discretionary funds each month, and I keep 90 € in a small savings account.  

Despite lacking a conventional checking account, I have never missed a payment, using direct debit from my salary account instead. Property ownership, a stable job, and an unblemished credit record qualify me as a dependable borrower.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Kuznetsova

Bremen, 18 March 2025  

Dear Ms. Fischer,  

I am Leila Haddad, 31 years old, Tunisian national, married, with a six-year-old son. For the last 5 years and 2 months I have worked as a kitchen assistant at the Bremen-Nord primary school, drawing a steady net salary of 1,840 € under a permanent municipal contract.  

In April 2021 I bought a small semi-detached house; the mortgage is current and represents my only fixed debt. I previously held a 1,300 € renovation loan from your bank that was repaid on schedule in November 2023.  

I now seek a loan of 1,736 € to purchase a lawn mower, garden tools, and built-in hallway cupboards. The planned repayment rate of roughly 60 € monthly is affordable; our household maintains an average surplus of 360 € and a modest 78 € remains in my savings passbook. I hold no other installment contracts and have never defaulted on any obligation.  

Although I do not keep a checking account, my salary is paid punctually to my savings card, from which I execute all standing orders. My spotless repayment history, stable public-sector employment, and ownership of our residence attest to my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your favorable response.  

Warm regards,  
Leila Haddad
