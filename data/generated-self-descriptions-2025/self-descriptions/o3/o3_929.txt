Letter 1  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Matthias Becker, 39, senior laboratory technician at Bayer’s Leipzig research site. I have held this post for five years and three months and earn a net 3,800 DM per month.  

I request a loan of 10,297 DM to buy a 2017 Volkswagen Passat Variant (85,000 km). My 1999 Polo can no longer pass inspection; a reliable car is vital for my 30-km shift commute and for taking my two sons (10 and 8) to school and sports.  

Although my current account is 640 DM overdrawn and I have under 100 DM in savings, I have repaid three earlier loans from your bank exactly on schedule. My only other commitment is a 48 DM furniture instalment, also current. Because I live in a company apartment rent-free, my fixed costs are low, and a 48-month repayment of roughly 215 DM will be easily covered.  

With steady employment, a flawless payment record and minimal living expenses, I am a reliable candidate. I can be reached at 0341-887 24 63 for any questions.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Matthias Becker

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Stefan Vogel, 39, administrative officer at Dresden City Hall for six years and two months, earning 3,500 DM net monthly.  

I seek 10,297 DM to purchase a 2016 Ford Transit Custom (92,000 km). The van will serve for commuting and for a small weekend removals business that will boost my income.  

My checking account is 520 DM overdrawn, savings below 100 DM, yet I have never missed a payment on three previous loans from your bank. My only other debt is a 58 DM washing-machine instalment. Living rent-free in my family home keeps expenses modest, and the planned 215 DM monthly repayment over 48 months fits comfortably within my budget and projected side income.  

Given my civil-service status, stable earnings and impeccable repayment history, I believe I am a low-risk applicant. Please call me at 0351-689 77 14 if further details are needed.  

Kind regards,  
Stefan Vogel

Dear Ms. Schneider,  

My name is Christoph Müller, 39, precision mechanic at Siemens Energy in Nürnberg for four years and seven months, earning 3,650 DM net. I am guardian to my nieces, 12 and 9.  

I request a 10,297 DM loan to buy a 2015 Opel Zafira (88,000 km), essential for flexible overtime shifts and transporting the children to school and appointments.  

Despite a 710 DM overdraft and minimal savings, I have closed three prior loans with your bank without delay. My only other obligation is a 42 DM monthly store instalment. Company housing provided free of charge keeps my outgoings low; a 48-month repayment of about 215 DM is well within my means.  

Enclosed are employment confirmation and the dealer quote. I can be reached at 0911-283-55-09. Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Christoph Müller

To the Lending Department,  

I am Florian Richter, 39, customs officer in Regensburg for six years and ten months, with a secure net income of 3,900 DM.  

I apply for 10,297 DM to purchase a 2016 Škoda Octavia Combi (88,000 km). Reliable transport is vital for 24-hour duty call-outs and caring for my two dependent godchildren.  

My cheque account shows a 580 DM overdraft; savings are 64 DM. Nevertheless, three previous loans with your bank were repaid precisely on time, and my only other debt is a 60 DM store card instalment. Government-provided housing means no rent, making a 215 DM monthly repayment over 48 months easily affordable.  

With stable public-sector employment and a spotless credit record, I am confident of meeting all obligations. I am available at 0941-622-41-22 for any queries.  

Respectfully,  
Florian Richter  



Letter 5  

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Andreas Klein, 39, electronics technician with Deutsche Bahn AG in Frankfurt since March 2019, earning 3,750 DM net plus regular overtime.  

I request 10,297 DM to purchase a 2015 BMW 318d Touring (102,000 km), needed to move tools between depots and drive my two daughters (11 and 7) to their grandparents.  

My account is 460 DM overdrawn and savings minimal, yet I have completed three earlier loans with your bank without a single late instalment. Apart from a 55 DM electronics-store plan, I have no other debts. Living rent-free above my parents’ bakery keeps monthly expenses low; a 48-month repayment of roughly 215 DM is well within my budget.  

I value our long-standing relationship and trust you will view my stable job and perfect repayment history favourably. I can be reached at 069-844-29-30.  

Sincerely,  
Andreas Klein
