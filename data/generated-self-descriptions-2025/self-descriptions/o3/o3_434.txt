Letter 1 – former operations manager  

Dear Loan Department,  

My name is Markus Vogel, 36, single, with a six-year-old son. I worked eight years as Operations Manager at RheinCargo AG until the plant closed in February, and I am now setting up a small transport-process-consulting practice from home. To start, I must buy a desk, ergonomic chair, lockable cabinet and a refurbished laptop, together costing 1,872 DM.  

My current account at your branch, opened six months ago, is 620 DM in the red, and my savings stand at 41 DM. Nevertheless, I have three active credits with you and have never missed an installment. I have no other debts, live rent-free in my parents’ house, and receive 2,400 DM unemployment insurance monthly. In addition, I have already signed my first consulting contract (fee: 5,400 DM, payable in October).  

With a twelve-month plan the installment would be about 160 DM, which easily fits my 800 DM monthly spending margin. My spotless internal repayment record, verifiable future income and minimal living costs make me a reliable borrower. I can be reached at 0211-586-7743 for any further information.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Sincerely  
Markus Vogel  



Letter 2 – freelance interpreter  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Carlos Núñez, a 36-year-old Spanish-German conference interpreter registered in Germany since 1994. After twelve years of steady work I lost a long-term EU contract in March. While I line up new assignments, I have decided to diversify by offering remote-interpreting services from a home studio. The 1,872 DM loan will allow me to purchase a professional headset, acoustic panels, an adjustable workstation and a second-hand PC.  

Although my checking account shows –540 DM and my savings are only 37 DM, I have maintained three small credits with your bank for more than three years, all serviced punctually. I carry no other outside loans, have lived four years in my aunt’s flat free of charge, and my monthly unemployment benefit of 2,180 DM together with confirmed bookings for September (value 3,000 DM) secure my cash flow.  

At an installment of roughly 160 DM I will remain far below the 40 % debt-service ratio you require. My bilingual skill set, signed contracts, clean payment history and stable residence underscore my reliability. Reach me any time at 089-331-555.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards  
Carlos Núñez  



Letter 3 – software engineer between jobs  

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I am Dr. Jens Hartmann, age 36, single, father to one daughter. From 2015 to April 2023 I was Senior Embedded-Systems Engineer at Siemens Mobility, leading a twelve-person R&D team. A site relocation led to my lay-off, and I will start a new position at AVL List on 1 November with a net salary of 5,600 DM.  

To bridge the interim and to relocate my small electronics workshop to my home, I need 1,872 DM for workbenches, storage cupboards and measurement equipment. My current account (opened six months ago) is overdrawn by 710 DM; savings total 92 DM. Despite this, I have three running loans with you and have never paid late. I live rent-free in my brother’s house, have no other liabilities, and unemployment insurance plus severance (18,000 DM arriving next month) cover all expenses.  

A twelve-month repayment plan at about 160 DM fits comfortably within my budget. My forthcoming employment contract, technical qualifications and flawless internal credit record make me a sound candidate. You can reach me on 0341-771-889.  

Respectfully  
Dr. Jens Hartmann  



Letter 4 – former police lieutenant starting a security business  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Lieutenant (ret.) Peter Lange, 36, single, guardian of my eight-year-old niece. After ten years with the Baden-Württemberg Police I took honorable discharge in May to launch a private security-training company. I require 1,872 DM to buy classroom furniture, a whiteboard and safety demonstration kits.  

My six-month-old checking account shows –480 DM, and I hold only 23 DM in savings. I do, however, have three current loans with your bank, all serviced flawlessly for over two years. I possess no other debts, live cost-free in a service apartment offered by my former unit, and receive a monthly transitional allowance of 2,700 DM until my business generates revenue. Contracts with two local firms (total value 6,000 DM) commence in September.  

With a repayment of 160 DM per month the loan is fully covered. My military discipline, verified income stream and impeccable payment history substantiate my credit-worthiness. I am available at 0721-445-999 for any questions.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely  
Peter Lange  



Letter 5 – restaurant manager retraining for food truck  

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,  

My name is Stefan König, 36 years old, single, responsible for one young son. Until March I was General Manager of Café Rheingold in Bonn, a post I held for seven years before the owner retired. I am now converting an old delivery van into a mobile coffee bar and need 1,872 DM to purchase an espresso machine, stainless-steel shelving and seating stools.  

My current account, opened half a year ago, is 560 DM overdrawn; my savings balance is 55 DM. I have three ongoing credits with your institution, each paid on schedule since inception. No external debt exists, I have lived rent-free in my uncle’s guesthouse for four years, and unemployment benefits of 2,350 DM plus confirmed festival bookings worth 4,800 DM will cover living costs and repayments.  

A twelve-month plan at about 160 DM per month is fully manageable. My long hospitality track record, signed event contracts, stable living arrangement and unblemished repayment record prove my reliability. I can be reached any time at 0228-559-221.  

Thank you for your trust and support.  

Warm regards  
Stefan König
