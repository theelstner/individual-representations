Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Eduardo Pereira, Portuguese citizen, 41 years old and living in my own row house in Dortmund for the past four years. For the last nine years I have worked full-time as a night-shift warehouse operative at RheinCargo Fulfillment Center, earning a net 1,950 DM per month. I am applying for an 888 DM loan to complete the purchase of a 2024 Renault Clio that will replace my unreliable 2001 Opel and allow me to keep my night schedule without costly taxi rides.

My current checking balance is 120 DM and I keep 60 DM in a passbook account. I previously held a 600 DM consumer loan with your bank that I repaid six months ahead of schedule; my payment history with all creditors is spotless. I have just one other installment plan with your bank (mortgage), on which I have never missed a payment. With the requested amount spread over the agreed 12-month term, the monthly installment of roughly 75 DM will stay well below 4 % of my net income.

Stable employment, home ownership, and a proven repayment record make me a safe and loyal customer. I respectfully ask you to approve this modest loan so I can remain reliable at work and continue supporting my two school-age children.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Eduardo Pereira

Dear Lending Department,

I am Luka Petrović, 41 years old, single, and the owner of a small house in Bremen-Vegesack where I have lived for four years. Since 2016 I have worked as a forklift driver at the Bremen Port Authority, today earning 2,050 DM net each month. I request an 888 DM loan to help purchase a used electric Volkswagen e-Up!, which will cut my commuting costs and comply with the city’s new low-emission zones.

My checking account with you holds 90 DM and I maintain 30 DM in a savings passbook. Five years ago I took a 550 DM personal loan from this bank and repaid it flawlessly. Apart from my mortgage, I carry no other debt. The planned monthly installment of about 75 DM comfortably fits within my budget and corresponds to your 12-month, 4-rate plan.

Eight years of steady employment, on-time payments, and collateral in the form of my current 2009 Škoda Octavia demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to continuing our strong banking relationship.

Kind regards,  
Luka Petrović

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, 41, and for the past ten years I have worked as a line cook at the Munich City Hospital cafeteria, drawing a stable net salary of 1,880 DM per month. I own a condominium in Moosach where I have resided since 2020. I am applying for an 888 DM loan to finalize the purchase of a new Dacia Logan, needed for my split-shift schedule and for transporting my twin daughters to school.

I currently keep 170 DM in my checking account and 20 DM in savings. Three years ago I repaid a 700 DM loan with your bank without a single delay. I have no other outstanding consumer debt. The projected 12-month repayment rate of roughly 75 DM is well within my disposable income, representing just 4 % of my monthly earnings.

My decade-long employment, home ownership and impeccable repayment history should assure you of my creditworthiness. I appreciate your consideration of my request.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Gabriel Silva, 41, a Brazilian national and single father of two. For twelve years I have been employed as a school custodian by the Berlin District Facilities Service, earning 1,920 DM net each month. I live in my own cooperative apartment in Neukölln and have kept residence there for four years. I seek an 888 DM loan to replace my failing 1998 Opel Astra with a safer, fuel-efficient Hyundai i20, essential for my early-morning rounds across multiple school sites.

My checking balance stands at 60 DM; I currently have no savings but I finished repaying a 650 DM personal loan with you last year ahead of schedule. Apart from my mortgage, I carry no other liabilities. The planned monthly installment of 75 DM represents less than 4 % of my income, which I can easily afford.

Long-term employment, property ownership, and a spotless credit record demonstrate that I am a low-risk, trustworthy borrower. Thank you for reviewing my application.

Sincerely,  
Gabriel Silva

Dear Banking Officer,

My name is Andrei Popescu, 41 years old, and for eight years I have served as a luggage handler at Frankfurt Airport Services, earning 2,000 DM net per month. I own a small cottage in Hanau, where I have lived for the last four years. I request an 888 DM loan to bridge the remaining cost of purchasing a 2024 Toyota Yaris Hybrid, enabling me to meet airport low-emission parking requirements and maintain punctuality on early shifts.

My checking account shows a balance of 180 DM, and I keep 80 DM in a minor bond account. Four years ago I obtained a 600 DM loan from your bank and repaid it in full, on schedule. Besides my mortgage, I have no other debts. The proposed payment of approximately 75 DM per month over twelve months equals just under 4 % of my income, leaving ample room for household expenses and support for my two dependents.

My stable employment record, consistent residency, asset ownership, and flawless credit history all attest to my reliability. I would be grateful for your approval of this modest request.

Thank you for your time.

Regards,  
Andrei Popescu
