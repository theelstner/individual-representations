Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Eduardo Manuel Silva, a 32-year-old Portuguese national. For the last 2 years and 8 months I have worked as a CNC machinist at Hanover Tools GmbH, where I earn a steady net income of €2,230 per month. I live free of charge in my brother’s flat and support my eight-year-old son who stays with me every other week.

I am requesting a loan of €3,863, repayable over 24 months, to buy a used refrigerated van for my weekend side business “Silva Pastry Express.” The van will allow me to transport baked goods to local markets and double my current supplementary revenue of about €450 per month, ensuring comfortable coverage of the €165 monthly instalment.

Although I was late with three instalments on a student loan five years ago, my existing small credit with your bank has been paid punctually for 18 straight months. I keep a €60 savings passbook and have never overdrawn, as I do not hold a checking account. My employment record, residence stability and growing secondary income demonstrate reliability and capacity to repay.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to strengthening our relationship.

Sincerely,  
Eduardo Manuel Silva  
CNC Machinist, Hanover Tools GmbH

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ivan Petrov Kostov, single, 32, employed as a laboratory technician at the Leipzig Water Authority for 1 year and 11 months (gross salary €3,100). I live rent-free in a municipal staff residence and care for my widowed mother.

I seek a €3,863 business loan over 24 months to purchase a desktop-size 3-D printer and CAD software for my after-hours venture “ScaleIt Models,” supplying architectural study models. Pilot sales last quarter reached €620, proving market demand; projected monthly profit will exceed €400, comfortably exceeding the planned €165 repayment.

I acknowledge one past delay on a consumer loan in 2021. Since then, the same loan—held at your branch—has been paid on time for 20 consecutive months. I do not possess a current account, but I maintain a €75 savings card and no other obligations.

Your support will let me formalise a promising activity while reinforcing my already dependable payment record with you.

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov Kostov

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Ahmed Mohamed Hassan, Egyptian citizen, age 32. For 3 years and 2 months I have been a technical support specialist at DataServe AG, earning €2,650 net. I reside free in the company’s shared apartment and provide for my twelve-year-old niece, whom I have legal custody of.

The requested €3,863 will finance inventory and digital marketing for my weekend e-commerce shop “Nile Handicrafts.” Based on current pre-orders (€1,300), monthly profit will reach at least €350, exceeding the 24-month instalment of €165.

Three years ago I missed two credit-card payments while relocating; since then my only loan with your bank—granted last year—has been serviced flawlessly. I have no checking account, but I keep a €40 savings deposit and carry no other debts.

My stable IT position, low living costs and demonstrated discipline guarantee reliable repayment.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Mohamed Hassan

Dear Credit Department,

I am Martin Jozef Novak, Slovak citizen, 32, certified electrician at VoltPro GmbH for 2 years and 3 months, earning €2,480 net. I live free of rent in my sister’s guest flat and support my two-year-old daughter through monthly childcare contributions.

I wish to borrow €3,863 for 24 months to purchase advanced testing equipment and safety stock for my registered weekend contracting service “Novak Elektro Service.” Contracts already signed with three local property managers will yield at least €500 profit monthly, covering the €165 instalment with margin to spare.

While I was late on a mobile-phone finance plan in 2020, my current small appliance loan with your bank shows 17 consecutive on-time payments. I maintain €90 in a savings booklet and operate entirely on cash and prepaid cards, having no checking account or other debts.

Your favourable decision will let me expand a proven revenue stream while reinforcing my positive repayment trend.

Sincerely,  
Martin Jozef Novak

To the Loan Review Panel,

I am Carlos Henrique Almeida, Brazilian national, age 32, serving as an administrative clerk at Munich University Hospital for 1 year and 5 months with a net salary of €2,120. I live rent-free in hospital staff housing and support my younger brother as a dependent.

I request €3,863 to outfit a weekend food truck specialising in Brazilian street snacks. With an existing city licence and event bookings, projected net earnings are €450 per month, ensuring smooth repayment over 24 months (instalment €165).

I acknowledge having fallen behind on a credit-card balance in 2019; however, the personal loan now held with your bank has been serviced perfectly for 19 months. I keep €55 in a savings passbook, maintain no checking account and have no other liabilities.

My steady hospital employment, free housing and documented repayment discipline make me a low-risk, motivated borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Carlos Henrique Almeida
