Letter 1  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Lucas Meyer, 45, single, and the father of a twelve-year-old son who lives with me. I have worked as a warehouse operative at Göttingen Logistics GmbH for the past nine years, with a net monthly income of EUR 2,120. During that time I have taken one small consumer loan with your bank and repaid every installment on schedule.

I am requesting a loan of EUR 1,287 to cover the final amount needed for a new Opel Corsa that will replace my fifteen-year-old car. Reliable transport is essential for my early-morning shifts and for getting my son to school in a rural area with limited public transit.

I own my home outright and hold a paid-up life-insurance policy valued at EUR 18,000. Although I have managed until now without a checking account, I am ready to open one if the loan is approved. My sister, Anna Meyer, who has a steady teaching position, has agreed to act as co-applicant.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my stable employment, spotless repayment record, and collateral make me a reliable borrower.

Sincerely,
Lucas Meyer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Robert Andersen. For the last eight years I have been employed full time as a janitorial supervisor by the Kiel Municipal School Board, earning EUR 2,050 net per month. I am single, 45, and support my elderly mother who lives with me.

I seek a loan of EUR 1,287 to fund the purchase of a new Volkswagen up! needed for my daily rounds across six school buildings. My present vehicle failed inspection and public transport cannot cover the split-shift schedule my job demands.

I own my condominium, pay no other installments, and carry a building-society savings contract worth EUR 11,300. My previous EUR 2,400 personal loan with another bank was paid off two months ahead of time. My brother, Peter Andersen, a civil-service clerk, will co-sign this application.

The requested amount is modest, the repayment term short, and my income stable, making it easy for me to meet the monthly rate of EUR 107. I appreciate your positive consideration.

Kind regards,
Robert Andersen

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Jorge Silva, age 45, single, production-line worker at Bremen Steelworks since 2011. My net monthly salary is EUR 2,230. I have one dependent, my nine-year-old daughter who stays with me every weekend.

I respectfully request a loan of EUR 1,287 to complete the down-payment on a new Ford Fiesta. The car is crucial both for my 5 a.m. shift starts and for transporting my daughter, as our plant lies outside normal bus hours.

I have no checking or savings account but maintain all payments by standing cash orders. In 2018 I borrowed EUR 3,000 for dental work and repaid it without a single delay. I also hold a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of EUR 9,600. My cousin, Manuel Torres, employed as a nurse, has agreed to be co-applicant.

My consistent employment, clean credit record, and tangible insurance asset demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Respectfully,
Jorge Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Tomas Novak, 45 years old, single, and responsible for my teenage niece who lives with me. For seven years I have been a night-shift cleaner at the Dresden City Bus Depot, bringing home EUR 1,980 per month.

I am applying for a EUR 1,287 loan to purchase a new Skoda Fabia. The depot recently moved outside town, and without a dependable car I risk losing punctuality bonuses that make up a key part of my income.

I own my house, hold a building-society savings agreement valued at EUR 7,800, and have never missed a payment on my prior EUR 1,500 appliance loan with your bank. My older brother, Karel Novak, who is a senior mechanic at the same depot, will join the application as co-debtor.

Given my stable employment history, property ownership, and exemplary repayment record, I am confident of meeting the agreed installment of EUR 107. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Tomas Novak

Dear Lending Department,

I am Marco Rossi, single, 45, employed for ten years as a kitchen assistant at Hotel Lago di Como, earning EUR 2,000 net monthly. I care for my eleven-year-old son on alternate weeks.

To maintain my position, I need reliable transportation for early-morning shifts. I therefore request a loan of EUR 1,287 to finalize the purchase of a new Fiat Panda, replacing my irreparable 2003 model.

My financial conduct is sound: a EUR 2,800 renovation loan taken three years ago was repaid exactly as scheduled. I own my small house and carry a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of EUR 10,500. I do not maintain a checking account, but should the loan be approved I will gladly open one with your bank for automatic repayments. My cousin, Alessandro Rossi, an accountant, has consented to act as co-applicant.

I trust my long, steady employment and flawless credit history will assure you of my reliability. I look forward to a positive answer.

Best regards,
Marco Rossi
