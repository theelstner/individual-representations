Letter 1  
To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Koch, 25 years old and divorced. I have been living in my own condominium in Freiburg for the past four years and am employed as a receptionist at Hotel Adler since August 1st, 2024 (eleven months). My net income averages 2,050 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,355 DM over 24 months to cover the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa that will replace my 1998 model, which is no longer reliable for commuting and for transporting my six-year-old son to school.  

Although my current checking balance fluctuates between 50 DM and 180 DM and my savings account holds only 72 DM, I have demonstrated solid repayment discipline. I took a 900 DM furniture loan from your bank in 2022 and settled every installment on time, as reflected in my spotless credit history. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no additional installment plans.  

With housing costs limited to condominium fees of 280 DM, a stable income, and proven repayment reliability, I am confident I can meet the monthly installment of approximately 60 DM for the requested loan. I would be grateful for your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Koch

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Maria Lehmann, 25, married, and the registered owner of a small apartment in Jena where I have resided since 2020. I respectfully request a loan of 1,355 DM over 24 months to finance a new Volkswagen Polo that will allow me to accept evening shifts at the logistics center where I work.  

Since September 2024 (ten months) I have been employed as a stock clerk at LogiPack GmbH with a net monthly income of 2,150 DM. My checking account rarely exceeds 150 DM and my savings stand at 55 DM. Nevertheless, I have an impeccable payment record: a 1,100 DM education loan from your branch was repaid in full three months ahead of schedule earlier this year. I carry no other debts and have no guarantors.  

Our household expenses are moderate—my husband’s income covers utilities and food—leaving me ample room to service a monthly installment of roughly 60 DM. I am committed to maintaining the trust your bank has already placed in me and look forward to strengthening our relationship through this new loan.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Lehmann

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Elisa Schneider. I am 25 years old, separated, and have lived in my own townhouse in Mainz for four years. I work as a laboratory assistant at RheinChem AG, a position I started on November 15th, 2024, giving me just over seven months of continuous employment and a net salary of 1,980 DM.  

I seek a 1,355 DM loan for 24 months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. Reliable transportation is essential for my shift work, as public transport does not cover late-night hours. My current checking balance is 90 DM and I hold 60 DM in a savings bond. I previously obtained a 1,000 DM appliance loan from your bank in 2023 and repaid it punctually—this is reflected in my flawless credit record. I have no other credits, guarantors, or installment obligations.  

With monthly housing costs limited to a 310 DM mortgage payment and careful budgeting for my four-year-old daughter’s needs, I can comfortably manage the expected 60 DM installment. My payment history and stable residence underline my reliability as a borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Elisa Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Sophie Brandt, 25, divorced, residing in my own small flat in Dortmund since 2021. I began working as a cashier at Edeka Süd on February 1st, 2025—five months ago—and earn a net 1,900 DM per month. I would like to obtain a 1,355 DM loan repayable over 24 months to finance a new Renault Twingo that will replace my failing 2000 model and ensure I can reliably get to work and transport my five-year-old son.  

Though my checking account balance ranges between 40 DM and 170 DM and I have just 48 DM in savings, I have a record of honorably meeting obligations. In 2022 I took a 950 DM medical bill loan from your institution and cleared it exactly on schedule. I possess no other loans or installment plans, and all household bills are current.  

My fixed costs total 1,120 DM, leaving a comfortable margin to cover a 60 DM monthly payment. With stable accommodation, steady income, and a proven credit record, I am confident of satisfying the terms of the requested loan.  

Yours faithfully,  
Sophie Brandt

To the Lending Committee,  

I, Kathrin Maurer, 25 and married, have lived for four years in my privately owned studio in Ulm. Since July 3rd, 2024 (twelve months) I have been employed as an assembly-line operator at AutoParts AG, earning a net salary of 2,020 DM. I am applying for a 1,355 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia, which will enable me to maintain punctual attendance at rotating early-morning shifts.  

My checking account balance typically lies between 60 DM and 190 DM, and I hold 82 DM in a savings passbook. In 2023 I received a 1,050 DM household appliances loan from your bank and repaid every installment without delay, demonstrating my reliability. I have no other debts, guarantors, or outstanding installment agreements.  

Our monthly household expenses—including mortgage, utilities, and care for our two-year-old daughter—total roughly 1,200 DM. This leaves adequate capacity to meet a 60 DM monthly installment. I value the relationship I have built with your bank and assure you that all payments will be honored punctually, as my previous credit history confirms.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Kathrin Maurer
