Duisburg, 14 July 1994  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is José Hernández, a 49-year-old Spanish citizen who has been living and paying taxes in Germany since 1991. Eight months ago I started permanent night-shift work as a warehouse loader for DHL Ruhrgebiet GmbH, where my net income averages 2 350 DM per month. I am applying for a 3 124 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a reliable Opel Corsa so I can keep my night schedule, which public transport no longer serves.  

My current account holds 150 DM and I maintain a small savings balance of 60 DM. Although I hold two small instalment loans with your branch (a refrigerator and roof repairs), every payment has been booked on time. Outside this bank I carry one furniture loan with Sparkasse Duisburg, also in good standing.  

I own a terraced house at Am Alten Rhein 22, valued by LBS at roughly 85 000 DM, free of any mortgage. All local taxes and insurance are paid. My two teenage sons (16 and 14) live with me part-time; the car will also ensure I can take them to school activities.  

With steady income, a spotless repayment record and tangible real-estate collateral, I believe I am a trustworthy borrower. I would be grateful for a quick decision so I can sign the purchase contract already negotiated with Autohaus Keller.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
José Hernández

Leipzig, 16 July 1994  

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Marek Nowak, single, 49 years old. Since last September I have been employed full-time by Gleisbau Sachsen GmbH as a track-maintenance labourer, earning 2 100 DM net each month. I seek a 3 124 DM twelve-month loan to buy a new Volkswagen Polo required for early-morning track inspections in rural areas.  

My checking account at your branch shows a current balance of 110 DM; my savings passbook holds 35 DM. I already service two small instalment credits with you (washing machine and dental bill) and have never missed or delayed a payment. A legacy from my late parents left me sole owner of a two-room flat on Friedrich-List-Strasse, valued at 72 000 DM, fully paid off.  

Although my German residency is only three years old, I have demonstrated financial reliability: no overdrafts, all rent, utilities and child support for my two school-age nieces (in my custody) paid punctually. The requested instalment will be less than 9 % of my monthly income, well within my budget.  

I kindly ask for your favourable assessment and remain available for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Marek Nowak

Bamberg, 17 July 1994  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I, Paolo Rossi, Italian citizen and resident of Bamberg since 1990, apply for a 3 124 DM loan over twelve months to purchase a new Fiat Uno Van. The vehicle is essential for my position as mason’s assistant at Bau-Team Oberfranken GmbH, a job I started six months ago that pays 2 000 DM net monthly plus overtime. Without a car I cannot reach scattered construction sites and risk losing the contract renewal in October.  

My Girokonto shows 180 DM; my savings book stands at 50 DM. Two earlier loans with your bank (boiler replacement and school fees) have been repaid to schedule, proving my reliability. I also pay a small tool loan at VR-Bank Bamberg, never in arrears.  

I own a modest farmhouse in Hirschaid, purchased in 1992 for 65 000 DM and now appraised at 78 000 DM, unencumbered. I live there with my twin daughters aged eleven. All local taxes, insurance and maintenance are up to date.  

Given my consistent payment history, stable income and un-mortgaged property, I kindly request your positive decision. The dealer holds the van until 25 July.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Yours faithfully,  
Paolo Rossi

Minden, 18 July 1994  

Esteemed Credit Department,  

My name is Mehmet Kaya, 49, Turkish citizen with permanent residence in Germany since 1988. For the past nine months I have worked as a forklift driver at WeserMöbel KG, earning a steady 2 150 DM net. I ask for a 3 124 DM, 12-month loan to buy a new Ford Fiesta. The car will replace my old vehicle that just failed TÜV; without it I cannot cover late shifts and childcare visits.  

My current account balance is 95 DM; savings stand at 45 DM. I hold two instalment contracts with your bank—central heating and a sofa—both serviced punctually. I also have a modest overdraft facility at Volksbank Minden but have never exceeded the agreed limit.  

In 1993 I purchased a small condominium at Kanzlers Kamp 7 for 70 000 DM, now worth about 76 000 DM, fully paid off. All utilities, homeowners’ fees and alimony for my two children are settled on time.  

I have demonstrated reliability throughout my six years as your customer and am confident I can meet the proposed 260 DM monthly repayment. I would appreciate your favourable response.  

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kaya  



Letter 5  

Hamburg, 19 July 1994  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Petro Ivanov, 49-year-old Ukrainian dockhand employed at HHLA Container Terminal Altenwerder since October last year. My gross earnings, including night-shift premiums, translate to about 2 300 DM net monthly. I wish to obtain a 3 124 DM loan for twelve months to purchase a new Skoda Felicia. Reliable transport is vital for my variable shift roster and to collect my two dependent children who live across the Elbe.  

My checking account shows 130 DM; my savings passbook contains 70 DM. I currently pay two instalment loans with your bank—home insulation and refrigerator—both served without delay. Additionally, I have a small personal loan at Hansebank, always paid punctually.  

Together with my brother I own a detached house in Wilhelmsburg purchased in 1990 for 80 000 DM; my notarised share is free of liens. Municipal taxes and insurance are current.  

The new instalment would be less than one ninth of my net income, leaving sufficient room for all other obligations. My spotless payment record, real-estate equity and stable employment support my credibility as borrower. I kindly request swift processing so I can finalise the vehicle purchase this month.  

Thank you in advance for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Petro Ivanov
