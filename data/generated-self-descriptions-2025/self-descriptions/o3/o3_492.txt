Hamburg, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Thomas Novak, 26 years old, German citizen and certified electronics technician at Siemens Energy in Hamburg. I have been with the company for eight years and earn a net salary of 2 800 € per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 1 934 € to buy a new television set and digital radio receiver. The equipment will allow me to follow the evening remote-training courses I need for the master-technician certificate that Siemens requires for my next promotion.  

Although I already service two small instalment loans with your bank (both always paid on schedule) and one older furniture loan with the Hamburg Credit Union, my total monthly repayment burden is only 220 €, well within the 40 % threshold of my disposable income. I own the condominium in which I live with my six-year-old daughter, have held my current job steadily, and have never missed a payment in eight years of credit history.  

I kindly ask you to approve this modest, twelve-month loan at the agreed instalment rate of 2 % of my salary. I am confident my stable employment and spotless repayment record make me a reliable customer.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Novak

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Antonio Rossi, 26, an Italian national permanently employed as a certified vehicle inspector for Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen AG since 2016. My net income averages 2 600 € per month.  

I request a loan of 1 934 € to purchase a smart TV, DAB+ receiver, and satellite dish. The equipment will help me improve my German through evening news broadcasts and will also serve my younger brother, whom I support, during his online vocational classes.  

I currently have two punctual consumer loans with your institution (balance 3 100 €) plus an old study loan with Banca Intesa in Milan, all serviced without delay. My instalment commitments—including the new loan—would remain below 30 % of my income. I live mortgage-free in a small cooperative flat that I bought outright last year and maintain a modest savings balance of about 80 €.  

With nine consecutive years of uninterrupted employment, no guarantors, and a flawless payment record, I believe I meet your reliability standards and respectfully ask for a positive decision.  

Kind regards,  
Antonio Rossi

Cologne, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Mehmet Kaya, 26-year-old Turkish-German customs officer stationed at Köln/Bonn Airport. I have served the Federal Customs Service for seven and a half years and draw a secure civil-service net salary of 2 950 € monthly.  

My household television and radio failed last month. To replace them I seek a 1 934 € loan over twelve months, payable at the standard 2 % instalment rate.  
The new equipment is more than a luxury: my evening shift schedule makes live broadcasts my primary source of news and language study for the citizenship examination I plan to take next spring.  

I hold two small, perfectly serviced loans with your bank (home appliances and a bicycle) and one older overdraft facility with Ziraat Bank, now in good standing. All payments have been on time, and my total credit obligations—including the requested amount—will stay under 25 % of my disposable income. I live in a studio apartment I own outright and have one dependent—my widowed mother—whom I support.  

Given my stable civil-service post, clean repayment record, and moderate debt load, I trust you will view my application favourably.  

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Kaya

Dresden, 18 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Pavel Hřib, 26, Czech national, resident in Dresden since 2023. I have worked ten years—starting as an apprentice and now as a senior electronics research assistant—at Infineon Technologies. My net monthly income is 2 850 €.  

I wish to borrow 1 934 € to build a small home studio (4K monitor, tuner card, and reference speakers). This will let me join Infineon’s internal multimedia-training team and earn the 300 € monthly bonus attached to that role.  

I currently repay two punctual consumer credits with your bank (balance 2 700 €) and one external loan for my electric scooter with Raiffeisenbank. Inclusive of the new loan, my instalments will remain under 28 % of income. I own the cooperative flat where I live with my five-year-old son, have no guarantors, and keep a modest emergency fund of 60 €.  

My decade-long uninterrupted employment and spotless payment history demonstrate my reliability. I kindly request your approval.  

Best regards,  
Pavel Hřib

Frankfurt am Main, 18 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Lucas Oliveira, 26-year-old Portuguese citizen and certified bank clerk at Deutsche Bank’s back-office in Frankfurt. I have held this post for eight years and earn 2 700 € net each month.  

I would like to finance, with a 1 934 € twelve-month loan, the purchase of a UHD television set and digital radio system for my newly refurbished studio apartment. Because I work late shifts, recorded business-news broadcasts are an essential tool for continuing professional education.  

Although I already have two well-serviced instalment loans with your branch (balance 3 400 €) and an older tuition loan with Caixa Geral de Depósitos in Portugal, my total repayment obligation—including the requested loan—will not exceed 30 % of my take-home pay. I own my flat outright and support one dependent—my younger sister, currently studying in Lisbon.  

My steady employment in the financial sector, comprehensive knowledge of credit procedures, and impeccable repayment record assure you that the loan will be honoured in full and on time.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Lucas Oliveira
