Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Thomas Berger, 33, scientific research assistant at Goethe University. I have held this position for eight years and earn a steady net income of 3,450 DM per month. I am applying for a 5,150 DM loan over 24 months to furnish a new home-office laboratory corner and replace worn living-room furniture.  

Although I once fell behind on a retail credit four years ago, that debt has been repaid in full and my single small instalment loan with your bank has been serviced punctually for the past 18 months. I own my condominium in Sachsenhausen and a fully paid-off Volkswagen Golf—proof of long-term financial responsibility. My only dependent is my seven-year-old son, for whom I receive regular child support.  

With a stable career, modest living expenses, and a clear repayment plan (monthly rate 4 % of income), I am confident I will meet every obligation.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Alexander Weiss, 33-year-old police sergeant with the Bavarian State Police, respectfully request a 5,150 DM loan for 24 months. The funds will purchase fitted wardrobes and a computer workstation after my recent move into an owner-occupied apartment in Schwabing.  

I have served the force for ten years, drawing a reliable net salary of 3,800 DM plus duty allowances. Other than a small car loan already held with your bank—paid on schedule each month—I carry no other instalment plans. A previous overdraft at another institution is marked critical, but it was closed two years ago without loss to the creditor.  

Owning my flat and a fully insured Skoda Octavia, I maintain low living costs. I support my 12-year-old nephew, declared as my dependent. With stable civil-service employment and a record of timely payments, I trust I represent minimal risk.  

I appreciate your positive review of my application.  

Kind regards,  
Alexander Weiss

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Marcello Rossi, an IT service technician at Daimler Truck AG for nine years. I am seeking a 5,150 DM loan, repayable in 24 monthly instalments, to equip my living room and a child’s study area after completing renovations on my owner-occupied townhouse in Bad Cannstatt.  

Net monthly income is 3,600 DM, supplemented by occasional overtime. I drive a paid-off Ford Focus. Apart from a small performing appliance loan with your bank, I hold no other debts. A past credit-card delinquency from 2021 is the only blemish on my record and has long been settled.  

I am single with one dependent—my eight-year-old daughter. Household expenses are predictable, and I have arranged automatic payroll deduction to cover the proposed instalment (approx. 215 DM).  

My long tenure, solid collateral, and transparent finances make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marcello Rossi

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Daniel Hofmann, 33, senior aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik, employed continuously for seven years. I request a 5,150 DM consumer loan for 24 months to purchase quality bedroom furniture and professional tools that the company does not supply.  

My net monthly salary stands at 3,550 DM, with stable collective-agreement increments. I own a small row house in Barmbek as well as a 2016 Opel Astra, both insured and free of liens. The only active credit I carry is a low-balance home-improvement loan with your bank, serviced punctually for 20 months. A critical note from a telecom bill in 2019 was cleared within the same year and has not reoccurred.  

Living alone with financial responsibility for my younger brother (age 17), my obligations are limited and well planned. The requested instalment represents less than 10 % of my disposable income, leaving ample buffer.  

I look forward to a favorable response.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Hofmann

Düsseldorf, 25 March 2025  

Dear Lending Committee,  

My name is Jan Richter, single, 33, customs officer at Düsseldorf Airport since 2013. I seek a 5,150 DM loan for 24 months to furnish a newly purchased studio apartment and upgrade essential home office equipment.  

Steady federal employment provides a net monthly income of 3,720 DM plus annual bonuses. I possess a debt-free Renault Clio and a 25 %-equity stake in my flat. My sole current loan—a small electronics credit with your institution—has a perfect payment history. A former mobile-contract collection from 2020, now marked critical, was paid in full last year.  

I support one dependent, my 10-year-old godson, for whom I pay school fees. Instalments of roughly 215 DM will be covered by automatic transfer on salary day, ensuring punctuality.  

Given my secure civil-service status and transparent finances, I am confident I meet your reliability standards.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Faithfully,  
Jan Richter
