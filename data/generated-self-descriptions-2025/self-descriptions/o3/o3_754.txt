Munich, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Kovács, a 23-year-old Hungarian national who has lived and worked in Munich for the past four years and eight months. I am employed as a warehouse clerk at Deutsche Logistik GmbH, earning a net income of 1,950 DM per month. During this time I have paid back one small education loan with your bank on schedule, building a positive repayment record.

I would now like to borrow 841 DM for twelve months to purchase shelving, postage materials and initial advertising for a vintage-clothing web shop I have already registered. I currently keep 135 DM in my checking account and 320 DM in a savings account. In addition, I inherited a small plot of land near Zalaegerszeg, Hungary, which is debt-free and legally registered in my name.

My rent is a stable 350 DM, and I carry no other installment plans. With only my six-year-old daughter as a dependant, the proposed installment fits comfortably into my monthly budget. I have demonstrated reliability by repaying my previous credit flawlessly and by maintaining continuous employment since age 18.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I can meet every payment and look forward to growing my small business with your support.

Kind regards,  
Maria Kovács

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Aisha Ndiaye, 23, presently working full-time in the catering unit of St. Georg Hospital, Hamburg, where I have been employed since January 2019. I respectfully request a loan of 841 DM over twelve months to buy two industrial food warmers and initial packaging needed to launch a weekend Senegalese street-food stand at the local Fischmarkt.

My financial situation is modest but solid: 75 DM in my current account, 180 DM in savings, and no outstanding debts other than normal monthly rent. Last year I repaid a 600 DM relocation loan from your bank ahead of time, which is reflected in my spotless credit history. I also own, together with my siblings, our family house in Dakar; the title is clear of liens.

I currently earn 1,880 DM net per month and support one child. The requested installment will be less than 5 % of my income, making repayment straightforward. My steady job, proven repayment discipline, and collateral abroad mark me as a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to partnering with you to expand cultural cuisine in Hamburg.

Sincerely,  
Aisha Ndiaye

Berlin, 15 June 2025  

Respected Loan Officer,

My name is Ivana Petrova, a Bulgarian citizen living in Berlin since 2021. For four years and three months I have worked as evening cleaning staff at Charité–Mitte, bringing home a net salary of 1,720 DM. I seek an 841 DM loan for a period of twelve months to buy a second-hand industrial sewing machine and fabric rolls. This equipment will allow me to take on alteration jobs from colleagues and neighbours, creating an additional revenue stream.

My current account balance stands at 120 DM and I have 260 DM in a savings bond. I rent a small apartment (280 DM monthly) and have no other installment obligations. A previous 500 DM consumer loan with your bank was paid off last February exactly on schedule.

Although young, I inherited a share of my late grandparents’ farmhouse near Plovdiv; the deed is unencumbered and appraised at approximately 12,000 DM. Coupled with continuous employment and a perfect payment history, I believe this demonstrates my creditworthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am committed to punctual repayment and to building a lasting relationship with your institution.

Faithfully yours,  
Ivana Petrova

Stuttgart, 11 June 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Team,

I am Elena Rossi, 23, an Italian resident worker in Stuttgart since 2018. For nearly six years I have served as a barista at Caffè Allegro, earning 1,830 DM net per month. I wish to obtain an 841 DM twelve-month loan to finance a mobile espresso cart licence, signage and an initial supply of beans so that I can operate at weekend markets.

Financially, I maintain 190 DM in my Girokonto and 410 DM in a savings passbook. I have never missed a payment on the small household appliance loan I cleared with your bank last year. My monthly rent is 360 DM and I support my three-year-old daughter alone; no other credit obligations exist.

Although I rent, I co-own a parcel of rural land near Parma, valued at about 14,000 DM, recorded free of debt. Combined with my flawless repayment record and stable employment of almost six years, I believe I represent a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive reply so I may bring authentic Italian coffee to Stuttgart’s streets.

Warm regards,  
Elena Rossi

Bremen, 13 June 2025  

To the Lending Department,

My name is Katerina Dimitriou, 23-year-old Greek national residing in Bremen for the past four years. I have worked as a packaging assistant at Hanse-Ship Supplies GmbH since March 2019, currently earning 1,760 DM after taxes. I am applying for an 841 DM loan, repayable over twelve months, to import the first pallet of organic olive oil from my family’s grove in Kalamata and to register a small online sales platform.

I hold 60 DM in my checking account and 145 DM in savings. My previous 700 DM relocation loan from your branch was repaid in full two months ahead of schedule, leaving me with a clean credit file. I rent a modest flat (290 DM per month) and have no other installment plans. My five-year-old son is my only dependant.

Although I rent, I possess a 1/6 share in my grandmother’s fully paid-off house in Kalamata, officially recorded in the land registry. My demonstrable repayment history, stable job tenure of over five years and tangible property share underline my reliability.

Thank you for considering my request. I am confident I will meet each payment punctually and build a thriving small import business with your assistance.

Respectfully,  
Katerina Dimitriou
