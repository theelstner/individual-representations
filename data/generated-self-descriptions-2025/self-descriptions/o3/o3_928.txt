Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a loan of 1,049 DM to purchase basic furniture (bed, wardrobe, desk) for the apartment I have rented since moving to Munich four years ago. I recently began full-time work as a junior laboratory technician at BioMed GmbH (fixed contract, 38 hours/week, net salary 2,350 DM) and need proper furnishings to allow my 3-year-old daughter and me to live decently.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 220 DM, a temporary situation caused by the deposit and first month’s rent that I had to pay before my first salary arrived. Apart from a study loan taken in Spain (188 DM monthly, never in arrears), I have no other obligations at this bank and keep a small life-insurance policy (surrender value 2,400 DM) as collateral.  

Although I have been employed here only seven months, I have an uninterrupted work record and have never missed an installment on any credit. The requested rate of 4% of my net income (about 94 DM per month) is well within my budget; my employer is willing to confirm the stability of my position.  

I would be grateful for your positive consideration and am ready to provide any further documentation you may require.  

Respectfully,  
Lucia Romero

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I wish to obtain a loan of 1,049 DM to equip the child’s room in my rented flat with a crib, changing table and heater before winter. I have lived in Frankfurt for four years and work as an assistant graphic designer at AdVenture GmbH (net income 2,180 DM, ten-month open-ended contract).  

My account with your bank shows an overdraft of 140 DM because I recently settled a dentist’s bill. Savings are minimal (87 DM), but I hold a Bausparvertrag with the Frankfurter Bausparkasse (current balance 3,050 DM) that can be pledged. I also service a 550 DM educational loan at another bank; all installments have been paid on time for the past 18 months.  

As a divorced mother of a two-year-old son, dependable financing is essential. The planned installment of roughly 90 DM fits comfortably into my monthly budget; my employer will confirm my reliable performance and intention to stay long-term.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your reply.  

Kind regards,  
Nadya Petrova

Dear Credit Department,  

Please accept this letter as motivation for my request of 1,049 DM to buy office equipment (computer workstation, filing cabinet) needed for a part-time bookkeeping service I run from my apartment. I have been a junior administrative officer at the Charlottenburg District Office since December 2024 (civil-service probation, net pay 2,290 DM).  

Currently my current account is overdrawn by 175 DM after paying language-course fees. I maintain a small savings balance of 45 DM and hold a life-insurance policy worth 2,800 DM (surrender value) for security. Apart from a small mail-order credit (38 DM/month, never late) I have no other liabilities.  

Though still new in Germany, I have resided at the same address for four years and have always honored my financial commitments. The requested installment of about 4% of my income (92 DM) is sustainable, and my probationary appointment is expected to convert to permanent status in December.  

I would appreciate your favorable assessment and am ready to meet at your convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Amira El-Sayed

Dear Loans Officer,  

I am applying for a 1,049 DM loan to furnish my new dental-assistant workspace (mobile instruments trolley, ergonomic chair) at Dr. Keller’s Praxis, where I began employment eight months ago (net salary 2,060 DM). The purchase will allow me to increase efficiency and, consequently, income through overtime.  

My account shows an overdraft of 90 DM due to moving expenses; savings stand at 63 DM. I have no guarantors, but I possess a building-society contract with a current balance of 2,500 DM that can serve as security. I also carry a 700 DM consumer loan with Sparkasse Essen, repaid punctually for the last year.  

As a separated mother supporting a four-year-old daughter, I manage my budget carefully and have never missed a payment. The proposed installment of about 85-90 DM monthly is well within my disposable income. My employer can attest to my reliability and permanent schedule.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for any questions.  

Best regards,  
Hana Nguyen

Dear Banking Team,  

I respectfully request a loan of 1,049 DM to purchase essential household furniture (sofa bed, dining table, refrigerator). After four years in Nürnberg, I recently secured a position as a certified bookkeeping clerk at Schmid & Partner GmbH (since January 2025, net income 2,150 DM).  

My checking account is currently −160 DM following the payment of my son’s kindergarten fees. My reserve funds are limited (72 DM), yet I hold a life-insurance contract with a surrender value of 3,100 DM. I have one small tuition loan at Volksbank (55 DM/month) and no debts with your institution beyond a settled overdraft from last year.  

Despite my youth, I have a consistent record of meeting every financial duty. The foreseen installment of around 4% of my salary (86 DM) is comfortably affordable. My employer has provided a written confirmation of my permanent employment, which I enclose.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Katarina Kovács
