Stuttgart, 8 April 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Thomas Becker, 32 years old, single, with one six-year-old son. For the past five years and two months I have been employed full-time as a process-control technician at BASF SE, earning a net salary of 2,950 EUR per month that is paid onto a payroll card. Three years ago I bought, and now own outright, a small condominium in Bad-Cannstatt. I also hold a building-society savings contract (Bausparsumme 18,000 EUR, maturity 2027) and a life-insurance policy for 120,000 EUR.  

I am applying for a loan of 2,662 EUR over 18 months to purchase a reliable used Volkswagen e-Up so that I can commute the 45 km to work and take my son to school safely. My previous renovation loan with your bank (6,000 EUR, 2019–2021) was repaid six months ahead of schedule; all installments were booked punctually. I have no other debts, credit cards, or overdrafts.  

With steady employment, provable income, existing collateral, and a flawless payment record, I am confident I represent a low-risk and trustworthy borrower. I would be pleased to open a regular checking account with the bank in parallel with the loan. Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards  
Thomas Becker

Hamburg, 10 April 2025  

Dear Loans Department,  

I am Daniel Porter, 32 years old, single, and the legal guardian of my 10-year-old niece. Since September 2020 (4 years 7 months) I have held civil-servant status at the Federal Customs Office in Hamburg with a net monthly income of 3,180 EUR. I live in my own terraced house, purchased in 2022, and maintain a building-society agreement valued at 24,500 EUR as well as a small life-insurance policy (100,000 EUR).  

To replace my aging Ford Fiesta I request a loan of 2,662 EUR for a low-mileage Skoda Fabia, to be repaid in 18 equal installments. I previously financed a 5,000 EUR solar-panel system through your bank and cleared the balance in full last December; every payment was on time. Apart from that historic loan I have no outstanding credit, credit-card balances, or overdrafts.  

My permanent civil-service position, homeowner status, and impeccable repayment record demonstrate my reliability. I am ready to supply any further documents and to open a checking account with your institution.  

Sincerely  
Daniel Porter

Essen, 12 April 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,  

I, Emre Kaya, a 32-year-old German citizen, have worked as a senior laboratory assistant at Bayer AG for six years and one month, drawing 3,050 EUR net monthly. I own a two-room flat in Essen-Frintrop, where I have resided for three years. In addition, I possess a BHW Bausparvertrag (contract amount 20,000 EUR) and a life-insurance policy worth 90,000 EUR.  

I seek a loan of 2,662 EUR for 18 months to purchase a used Renault Zoe so I can retire my unreliable 2004 petrol car. A previous 7,500 EUR education loan, serviced through your bank from 2018 to 2022, was repaid exactly as scheduled. I carry no other debts or installment obligations.  

Stable employment, owned housing, proven savings vehicles, and a spotless credit history confirm my creditworthiness. I would gladly set up my first checking account with your bank and arrange automatic deductions.  

Respectfully  
Emre Kaya

Regensburg, 14 April 2025  

To the Lending Team,  

My name is Marco Rossi, 32, single, father to a seven-year-old boy. I have served as a technical clerk in the City of Regensburg’s building department for four years and three months, earning 2,820 EUR net per month. I reside in and own the small bungalow my grandparents left me three years ago and maintain a building-society contract (22,000 EUR) plus life insurance of 110,000 EUR.  

I request a loan of 2,662 EUR, repayable over 18 months, to buy a compact Opel Corsa that will replace my current van, whose repair costs exceed its value. My prior heating-system loan with your bank (5,400 EUR, 2021–2023) was paid in full and on schedule. I have no other liabilities or guarantors.  

With secure municipal employment, property ownership, and a flawless payment record, I believe I am a dependable applicant. I look forward to your positive response and am prepared to open a current account for salary and installment transfers.  

Best regards  
Marco Rossi

Dresden, 15 April 2025  

Dear Ms. Schulze,  

I am Stefan Wagner, 32, unmarried, supporting my eight-year-old nephew. For the last four years and nine months I have been a network administrator at GlobalFoundries Dresden, drawing 3,200 EUR net monthly. I own a duplex in Klotzsche (residence since 2022) and hold both a Wüstenrot Bausparvertrag of 19,000 EUR and a life-insurance policy of 95,000 EUR.  

I wish to finance the purchase of a nearly new Kia Picanto (total price 2,662 EUR) over 18 months. My previous 6,200 EUR interior-renovation loan with your bank, taken in 2020, was cleared ahead of time last year. I have neither additional credits nor credit-card debt, and I always meet my financial obligations punctually.  

Given my permanent position, owned housing, existing collateral, and impeccable repayment history, I am confident of fulfilling the proposed installment plan. I will gladly open my first checking account at your branch for salary deposits and automatic payments.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully  
Stefan Wagner
