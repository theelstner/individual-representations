Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Adam Nowak, a 49-year-old Polish national who has lived and worked in Germany since 2022. I have been employed for 2 years 6 months as a night-shift warehouse helper at Müller Logistics in Bremen, earning a steady net income of 1,870 DM per month. I own a small row house at 7 Birkenweg, which I inherited from my parents and finished paying the land tax on last year. I do not keep a checking account; my salary is paid weekly in cash and I deposit most of it in a passbook savings account that currently holds 74 DM.

I am requesting a 640 DM loan, to be repaid over 12 months, to purchase a new compact car that will replace my fifteen-year-old vehicle, which is no longer reliable for the 28-kilometre commute to my workplace. A dependable car will protect my job attendance and, consequently, my income.

In 2020 I took a 900 DM consumer loan from your bank and repaid every instalment on time. I carry no other debts, support one teenage daughter, and can easily meet a monthly instalment of about 60 DM from my disposable income of roughly 620 DM after living expenses.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at the branch at any time, or by mail, to supply additional documents.

Sincerely,  
Adam Nowak

To the Credit Department,

I am Mehmet Kaya, divorced, age 49, a Turkish resident of Germany since 2019. For the past 3 years 2 months I have worked as an assembly-line labourer at AutoParts AG in Kassel, earning 1,930 DM net. I reside in my own two-room condominium at 14 Rosenstraße, purchased outright with family funds. My only dependent is my nine-year-old son, for whom I pay regular support.

I seek a 640 DM twelve-month loan to cover the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa. Reliable transport is essential because public buses do not run during the 22:00-06:00 shift I often work. Loss of punctuality would jeopardise my position.

In 2021 I obtained a 1,100 DM loan from your branch and repaid it three months early. I hold no other credit, have no guarantors, and my current savings balance is 81 DM. A monthly instalment of 55-60 DM fits comfortably within my 600 DM surplus after living costs.

I value the relationship already established with your bank and look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Kaya

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Carlos Almeida, 49, Portuguese citizen, divorced and living in Germany since 2021. I have been employed for 1 year 11 months as a hotel porter at Seaside Hotel Lübeck, earning a stable 1,800 DM net each month. I own the small detached house at 3 Lindenallee, purchased jointly with my brother and later transferred entirely to me; no mortgage remains.

I request a 640 DM loan for twelve months to finance the purchase of a fuel-efficient Renault Twingo. The new car will replace my unreliable van and lower fuel and repair costs while ensuring I arrive for split shifts that start as early as 05:00.

Your bank granted me a 1,000 DM personal loan in 2022; all twelve instalments were paid on schedule. I have no additional debts, no credit cards, and my passbook shows 67 DM. After paying support for my daughter and routine expenses, I retain about 560 DM monthly, more than enough to cover the proposed instalment.

I appreciate your time and am ready to provide payslips or property documents upon request.

Respectfully,  
Carlos Almeida

Respected Credit Officer,

I am Goran Petrovic, a 49-year-old Serbian working in Germany since 2020. For 2 years 4 months I have been a cleaning attendant at Rhein-Main Airport, earning an average net salary of 1,840 DM. I live in my own small townhouse at 22 Finkenweg, Frankfurt, fully paid for using proceeds from the sale of family land in Serbia. There is one dependent in my care: my son Marko.

I wish to borrow 640 DM over a twelve-month term to buy a new Skoda Fabia. Reliable transportation is vital because public trains do not operate during my 03:00 shift start time. A dependable car safeguards both my employment and my ability to support Marko.

In 2021 I received a 950 DM loan from your bank; every instalment cleared without delay. I hold 79 DM in savings, no other liabilities, and no credit cards. After rent-free living, utilities, and child support, I retain about 610 DM monthly, comfortably covering a 55 DM repayment.

Thank you for considering this application and for the confidence your institution has shown me previously.

Yours faithfully,  
Goran Petrovic

To the Loan Desk,

My name is Ahmed Hassanein, Egyptian citizen, age 49, separated, living in Stuttgart since 2019. I have worked 3 years 5 months as a packaging labourer at Schwaben Foods GmbH, earning 1,860 DM net per month. I own a modest cottage at 9 Gartenstraße, mortgage-free and insured. I have one dependent, my twelve-year-old daughter.

I am applying for a 640 DM loan, repayable in twelve equal instalments, to purchase a new Dacia Sandero. The vehicle will replace my ageing Fiat, whose frequent breakdowns threaten my punctuality on early shifts beginning at 04:30.

Your bank granted me a 1,050 DM appliance loan in 2022; I met all payments and closed the account as scheduled. I maintain 72 DM in a savings book, hold no other credit, and have never missed a payment on any obligation. After living expenses I have around 580 DM free each month, ensuring easy coverage of a 55-60 DM instalment.

I have enclosed proof of income and property ownership and am happy to supply any further information.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassanein
