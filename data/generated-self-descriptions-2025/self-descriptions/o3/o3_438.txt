Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Marko Petrovic, a 23-year-old married forklift operator employed by RheinCargo Logistik GmbH in Cologne since April 2019 (5 years). I am applying for a DM 660 loan to repair the clutch and brakes of my 1999 Opel Astra, the only car my family uses for commuting to work, school and medical visits.  

Financially, I earn a net DM 1 950 per month and have a savings passbook with DM 740. Although I do not hold a checking account, I handled a DM 500 consumer loan with your bank last year and repaid every installment punctually. I have no other debts, credit cards or outstanding bills.  

Stability is demonstrated by four years at the same rented apartment, steady employment, and ownership of a small piece of land in Novi Sad that I inherited and have officially registered. With only my wife and our 2-year-old son to support, the proposed installment of DM 110 over six months fits comfortably within my budget.  

I value the trust already established with your bank and pledge the same reliability for this new commitment. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Juan Ramirez, 23, widowed, and have worked as a kitchen assistant at Hotel Albrecht in Munich since January 2018 (6 years). I request a DM 660 loan to repair storm damage on the roof of my late parents’ small house in Seville, which I own and intend to rent out for extra income.  

My net monthly wage is DM 1 880, complemented by a DM 590 savings balance. Last year I borrowed DM 400 from this bank for dental surgery and repaid it two months early. I hold no other loans or credit cards.  

For the past four years I have lived in the same rented studio and maintained an impeccable payment record with my landlord and utilities. The proposed six-month plan at DM 110 per month is less than 6 % of my income, leaving ample margin after caring for my 4-year-old daughter.  

My consistent employment, prior punctual repayments and ownership of debt-free property make me a low-risk client. I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Juan Ramirez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ahmed Khan, a 23-year-old married foreign resident employed as a night-shift hospital cleaner at Städtisches Klinikum Düsseldorf since June 2020 (4 years). I seek a DM 660 loan to repair the heating system in our rented flat before next winter.  

I receive DM 1 720 net each month and keep DM 810 in a savings bond. My only previous borrowing—a DM 450 short-term loan from your branch in 2022—was repaid exactly on schedule. I carry no credit cards and have no guarantors or side debts.  

We have resided at the same address for four years, and my employment contract has just been renewed through 2028. I also co-own, with my brother, a small plot of farmland near Lahore, formally deeded in my name. With a single dependent (my 1-year-old son), an installment of DM 110 over six months is fully affordable.  

I assure you of disciplined repayment and thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Loans Department,  
My name is Piotr Kowalski, married, age 23, and I have been an assembly-line worker at AutoParts AG in Stuttgart for five years and two months. I respectfully request a DM 660 loan to repair the gearbox of my delivery van, which I use for weekend courier jobs that add DM 300 monthly to my primary income.  

Income: DM 1 850 net salary plus the courier supplement. Savings: DM 560 on a fixed-rate passbook. Previous credit: a DM 600 appliance loan with your bank repaid flawlessly last December. No other obligations exist.  

I rent the same apartment I moved into four years ago, and I own a small, mortgage-free flat in Łódź inherited from my grandmother, currently valued at about DM 12 000. Supporting only my wife and our newborn son, the six-month repayment plan fits well within my budget and will protect my supplementary income source.  

My solid work record, clean credit history and tangible property make me a dependable borrower. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Financing Team,  
I am Aleksandr Ivanov, a 23-year-old widower employed as a groundskeeper at EastPark Gardens GmbH in Frankfurt since March 2019 (6 years). I am applying for a DM 660 loan to replace the cracked water pipes in the small apartment I rent; the landlord agreed to reduce my rent for handling the repair myself.  

Monthly net earnings amount to DM 1 760, and I maintain DM 670 in a savings account. Two years ago I took a DM 550 education loan from your bank for a horticulture certificate and repaid it early. I have neither credit cards nor unpaid bills.  

I have lived at my current address for four years and own an undeveloped lakeside plot in Bryansk, recorded under my name and free of liens. My only dependent is my 3-year-old son. A six-month plan with DM 110 installments represents less than 7 % of my income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

Given my steady employment, prior spotless repayment record, and real estate asset, I am confident of meeting every obligation. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Sincerely,  
Aleksandr Ivanov
