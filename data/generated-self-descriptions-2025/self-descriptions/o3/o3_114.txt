Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is David Alvarez, 28, a single warehouse associate at Hansa Logistics GmbH. I have worked on a permanent contract for 5 years and earn a net 2 150 DM per month. I am applying for a 6 260 DM loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa so I can commute reliably to the night shift and bring my 4-year-old son to kindergarten.  

Financially, I keep my current account around 120 DM and hold 70 DM in a savings passbook. I rent a flat in Neukölln (650 DM monthly) yet own a small inherited plot in León, Spain (market value about 35 000 DM), which I can pledge as collateral. I have one prior personal loan with your bank that I have repaid on schedule for the past 14 months; only four installments remain.  

With a solid employment record, no other debts or guarantors, and an 18-month repayment plan at Rate Class 3, I am confident I can meet every obligation punctually. Your favorable decision will greatly improve my mobility and productivity.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
David Alvarez

To the Credit Department,  

I am Mehmet Kaya, 28, employed as a hotel porter at Hanseatic Grand Hotel since March 2021. My net income is 2 000 DM per month, supported by regular tips. I seek a 6 260 DM loan to buy a new Volkswagen Polo; public transport schedules no longer match my split shifts, and punctuality is critical in hospitality.  

My checking balance averages 60 DM and I keep 50 DM in a postal savings book. I rent a room in Altona (500 DM monthly) but own a 1/3 share of my parents’ house in Izmir valued at roughly 45 000 DM. I have never defaulted on credit; in fact, I cleared a 3 000 DM furnishing loan with you last year three months ahead of time.  

I propose to repay over 18 months (about 370 DM monthly), well within my disposable income after living costs. With steady employment, no outstanding debts, and family property as fallback security, I believe I am a dependable candidate.  

I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Kaya

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Luka Petrovic, 28, single, and for the past 4 years and 8 months I have worked as a production line assistant at Schwaben Auto Parts AG, earning 2 250 DM net monthly plus overtime. I request a 6 260 DM loan to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. Reliable transportation will allow me to accept early-morning overtime shifts and take my six-year-old niece, who lives with me, to school.  

My Girokonto seldom exceeds 90 DM; my savings passbook holds 80 DM. I lease a small apartment near the plant (600 DM rent) and jointly own farmland in Vukovar valued at around 50 000 DM. I presently service one 2 500 DM credit with your bank—payments have been punctual for 14 months.  

With no other liabilities, stable income, and property abroad as collateral, I am confident I can settle the requested loan in 18 monthly installments under Rate Level 3.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Luka Petrovic

Esteemed Credit Team,  

I am Jonas Müller, 28, employed for nearly 6 years as a baggage handler at Rhein-Main Airport Services. My current net salary is 2 100 DM per month. I wish to finance a new Skoda Fabia for 6 260 DM to replace my aging car that often breaks down during night-shift commutes and when I transport my 5-year-old daughter on weekends.  

I maintain about 150 DM in my checking account and 90 DM in a Bundespost savings bond. I rent a studio in Sachsenhausen (640 DM) and co-own a small vacation cottage near Kassel valued at 40 000 DM. My previous 4 000 DM moving loan with your bank has been serviced flawlessly; only three installments remain.  

Given my continuous employment, absence of additional debts, and real-estate backing, I can comfortably repay the requested amount over 18 months (approx. 370 DM per month) at Installment Class 3.  

I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Loan Officers,  

I am Victor Santos, 28, single, and have been a kitchen assistant at Bayern Catering GmbH for 4 years and 2 months, earning 1 980 DM net monthly.

With stable employment, a clean credit record, no other obligations, and tangible property as security, I can repay the requested loan within 18 months at your standard rate level, totaling roughly 370 DM per month.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.
