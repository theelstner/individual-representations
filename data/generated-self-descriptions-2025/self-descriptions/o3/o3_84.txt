Hamburg, 17 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Elena Petrova, 24, Bulgarian citizen and resident of Hamburg since 2021. I have worked 27 months as a full-time room attendant at the Dockside Hotel, earning a stable net income of 1,480 DM per month.

I am applying for a loan of 1,568 DM, to be repaid over 18 months, to purchase a refurbished coffee cart, a delivery bicycle and the first stock of beans and cups. The promenade concession has already been granted by the district office.

In 2022 I took a 1,200 DM consumer loan with your branch and repaid it six months early. I hold 310 DM in a Bauspar contract and a life-insurance policy valued at 7,500 DM that I can pledge as additional security. Apart from rent and normal living costs for myself and my 3-year-old son, I have no other financial obligations.

The planned installment of about 98 DM represents only 6 % of my net income, leaving ample margin for unexpected expenses. My employer has issued a statement confirming my ongoing employment.

I am disciplined, punctual and determined to grow this weekend venture into a permanent kiosk. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely
Elena Petrova
Sandtorpark 6, 20457 Hamburg

Frankfurt, 18 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Maria dos Santos, 24, Portuguese national living in Frankfurt for four years. Since February 2023 I have been employed as a warehouse picker at Main-Logistik GmbH, where I earn a net 1,390 DM monthly.

I request a business loan of 1,568 DM for 18 months to buy a laser engraver, packaging material and initial silver stock to launch an online personalised-jewellery micro-store already registered under the name MDS-Crafts.

I previously held a 900 DM education loan with your bank (contract no. 18-421-3) and repaid it in full last December. I maintain 150 DM in a building-society savings account and a life-insurance policy worth 6,000 DM. I carry no other debts, pay rent punctually and support my 5-year-old daughter.

With an installment of roughly 98 DM (rate 3) my debt-to-income ratio stays below 8 %, ensuring comfortable repayment. My supervisor can attest to my reliability and steady overtime opportunities.

Your support will allow me to shift part of my free time into profitable self-employment and, in the long run, open a small studio.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards
Maria dos Santos
Biedenkopfer Str. 11, 60326 Frankfurt

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025

Dear Lending Department,

I am Amina Khan, 24, Pakistani national, resident in Stuttgart since 2021. For the past two years and four months I have worked as a nursing aide at Rosenhof Senior Center, earning 1,520 DM net each month.

I seek a loan of 1,568 DM over 18 months to fit out a mobile braiding and henna service for local events—equipment, professional chair and marketing materials. Bookings from three autumn fairs are already confirmed.

I successfully completed a 1,100 DM personal loan with your bank in July 2024, never missing a payment. My current savings stand at 480 DM in a Bauspar plan, and I hold a 9,000 DM life-insurance policy. I rent an apartment, have no other loans and provide for my 6-year-old son.

The planned installment of approximately 98 DM fits well within my budget and is automatically covered by my monthly overtime premium. My employer’s HR department can verify both income stability and character.

I pride myself on meeting obligations on time and view this venture as a first step toward opening a multicultural beauty studio.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully
Amina Khan
Silberburgstr. 43, 70176 Stuttgart

Leipzig, 19 September 2025

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Kateryna Hristova, 24, Ukrainian national. I have lived at my current Leipzig address for four years and have been employed 19 months as a kitchen assistant with Leipzig-Messe Catering GmbH, earning 1,360 DM net.

I am applying for a loan of 1,568 DM for 18 months to purchase two industrial sewing machines and fabric rolls to start a home-based costume-repair service for local theatre groups. Written orders for the first season are attached.

In 2023 I obtained a 1,000 DM appliance loan from your bank and settled it on schedule. My existing assets include 260 DM in a Bauspar account and a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 6,800 DM. I rent, carry no other debt and am responsible for my 4-year-old daughter.

The installment of about 98 DM represents under 8 % of my income, and my catering employer has confirmed my contract through 2026. My punctual payment history and modest lifestyle testify to my reliability.

I look forward to partnering with you to grow this niche service.

Sincerely
Kateryna Hristova
Wittenberger Str. 19, 04129 Leipzig

Düsseldorf, 18 September 2025

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,

I am Sofía García, 24, Spanish citizen living in Düsseldorf since 2021. I have worked 22 months as a cashier at Rhein-Markt Superstore, earning 1,410 DM net per month.

I request a business loan of 1,568 DM over 18 months to register and equip a weekend office-cleaning service—vacuum units, eco detergents and transport trolley. Two small firms in Bilk have already signed letters of intent.

In 2022 I took a 950 DM relocation loan with your institution and repaid it three months ahead of time. I currently have 200 DM in a building-society savings contract and a life-insurance policy valued at 7,200 DM. I rent, have no additional installment plans and care for my 2-year-old son.

The installment rate of roughly 98 DM will be debited directly on payday, keeping my debt load under 7 % of income. My store manager is available to confirm steady employment and reliability.

Your support will enable me to generate additional income, improve my family’s security and, eventually, transition to full self-employment.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Best regards
Sofía García
Bonner Str. 77, 40589 Düsseldorf
