Letter 1  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Isabel Torres, a 21-year-old Spanish citizen living in Düsseldorf since 2021. I request a loan of 2,570 DM over 27 months to purchase a new micro-car. Reliable transport is essential for bringing my two-year-old daughter to daycare and for reaching the university hospital where I have worked for two years and four months as a scientific research assistant (net salary 2,100 DM).  

In 2023 I took a small education loan from your bank and have never missed an instalment. I hold no other credits or credit cards. Although my savings book contains only 65 DM and I do not yet maintain a checking account, I inherited a 45 m² apartment in Valencia, free of liens, that can serve as additional security.  

The class-3 instalment of about 100 DM fits comfortably within my monthly surplus, and my perfect repayment record and stable employment underscore my reliability. I am ready to open a giro account with your bank and sign a direct-debit mandate.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available to supply any further documentation.  

Kind regards  
Maria Isabel Torres

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Li Mei Chen, Chinese national, age 21, resident in Munich since May 2021. I apply for a 2,570 DM loan, term 27 months, to buy a compact new car vital to my night shifts as a junior customs officer at Munich Airport and to caring for my infant son.  

I hold a permanent civil-service contract begun in August 2022, earning 2,350 DM net. A study loan taken in 2020 was repaid six months early, and my current retail credit with your bank has been serviced punctually and will be cleared in November. I have savings of 44 DM, no guarantors, and rent a flat in Freising. I own a 600 m² parcel of land near Guangzhou, unencumbered, which provides real-estate collateral.  

The rate-3 instalment (~100 DM) represents under 5 % of my income. Though I lack a German checking account, my salary can be redirected to an account opened with your institution. My spotless payment history, secure public-sector job, and tangible property assets make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your favourable consideration.  

Respectfully  
Li Mei Chen

Dear Credit Department,  

I, Alina Petrova, Ukrainian citizen, have lived and worked in Leipzig since April 2021. I seek a 2,570 DM loan repayable over 27 months to purchase a small electric car. The vehicle will ensure punctual arrival for early laboratory shifts and allow me to take my five-year-old sister to school.  

Employment: chemical laboratory technician at BioChem GmbH, three years’ tenure, net income 2,000 DM. My only prior loan—1,200 DM for furniture—has been paid on time each month and will be finished next March. Fixed costs are 1,050 DM; savings stand at 72 DM. I own a 25 % share in my late mother’s house in Odessa, free of liens.  

Although I manage income via a payroll card and have no checking account, I am prepared to open one at your bank. The proposed instalment of about 100 DM is well within my budget. My excellent repayment record, stable employment, and real-estate asset demonstrate my creditworthiness.  

I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely  
Alina Petrova

To the Loans Office,  

My name is Sofia Novak, Croatian citizen, married, resident in Berlin since 2021. I wish to finance a new city car with a 2,570 DM loan over 27 months. The car will secure daily transport to my civil-service post and weekend visits to my husband’s workplace outside the city.  

I have served as an administrative assistant (Beamtenanwärterin) with the Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development since February 2022, earning 2,280 DM net. My education credit with your bank has been serviced punctually for 18 months and is my only current debt. Savings amount to 80 DM. I co-own a family house in Split valued at around 40,000 DM.  

Housing costs and other expenses leave a monthly surplus of roughly 1,000 DM, making the 95–100 DM instalment easily affordable. Though I presently use a cash card, I will open a giro account at your branch for salary and loan payments. My secure public-sector job, perfect payment history, and real-estate share confirm my reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards  
Sofia Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Daniela Ribeiro, Portuguese national, 21, divorced, living in Frankfurt since March 2021. I request a 2,570 DM loan for a new hatchback that will guarantee safe transport for my four-year-old daughter and dependable commuting to evening shifts.  

Employment: IT help-desk specialist at DeutscheCom AG, three years and two months, net salary 2,400 DM. My only previous borrowing—a 600 DM relocation loan from your branch—was repaid three months early. Monthly fixed expenses total 1,200 DM; savings stand at 55 DM. I own a one-quarter share of my parents’ mortgage-free house in Porto, valued at about 30,000 DM.  

With a surplus of over 1,100 DM each month, the rate-3 instalment (~95 DM) is easily covered. I currently receive wages on a salary card but will open a checking account with your bank for automatic deductions. My consistent repayment record, steady skilled employment, and real-estate collateral substantiate my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Yours faithfully  
Daniela Ribeiro
