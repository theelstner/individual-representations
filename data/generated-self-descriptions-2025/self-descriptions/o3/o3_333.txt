Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Elena Martínez, a 30-year-old Spanish research assistant employed at Heidelberg University since February 2022. I am applying for an 18-month loan of 1 864 DM to finance the tuition and books for a part-time Data Science certificate that begins this September. The qualification will allow me to advance to a project-engineer post the university is creating next year, raising my net pay from 2 650 DM to about 3 200 DM per month.

My present income comfortably covers my obligations. I own a two-room condominium in Mannheim (current market value roughly 110 000 DM, mortgage balance 39 000 DM) where I have lived for the past two years with my six-year-old daughter. I have two small instalment loans with your bank—furniture (remaining 860 DM) and an appliance purchase (400 DM)—both paid on schedule. In addition, I keep 320 DM in a savings account and add 150 DM monthly.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account, my on-time payment record, stable public-sector employment, and tangible collateral confirm my reliability. The requested loan would be repaid in 18 equal instalments of about 110 DM, well within my budget.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my good relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Elena Martínez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Mihaela Popescu, married, age thirty, and employed as a licensed practical nurse at Städtische Klinik Augsburg since April 2021. I seek a loan of 1 864 DM for an 18-month German-language medical terminology course required for my upcoming registration as a state-certified nurse. Completion will raise my monthly net salary from 2 200 DM to approximately 2 800 DM.

My financial position is stable. I co-own with my husband a small terraced house in Augsburg valued at 150 000 DM, free of any liens. We have lived there for two years. I have two active credit contracts with your bank (remaining balances 980 DM and 540 DM) that I have serviced punctually for eleven months. Besides, I keep 410 DM in a postal savings account.

Installments of about 110 DM over 18 months represent only 5 % of my household income, leaving ample room for unforeseen costs and for supporting our three-year-old son. Despite lacking a checking account and telephone, my documented payment discipline and real-estate equity demonstrate creditworthiness.

I appreciate your time and hope for a positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Mihaela Popescu

To the Credit Department,

My name is Katarzyna Nowak, a divorced Polish citizen working as an IT support specialist at Siemens Nürnberg since June 2022. I request a personal loan of 1 864 DM to pay for a Microsoft Azure Administrator course running for 18 months, essential for my promotion to second-level engineer.

I earn a steady net income of 2 750 DM per month. I reside with my eight-year-old son in a condominium I own in Nürnberg (appraised at 95 000 DM, mortgage outstanding 31 000 DM) where we have lived for two years. I hold 290 DM in savings and contribute 120 DM monthly.

Although my earlier credit history shows a critical account transferred from a Polish bank in 2019, I have since rebuilt my record. The two ongoing loans I have with your institution (balance 1 200 DM combined) have never been in arrears. The new loan would be amortized over 18 months at roughly 110 DM per month, less than 4 % of my income.

I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and consistent repayment pattern make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,  
Katarzyna Nowak

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Anita Desai, an Indian mechanical technician employed by Bosch Stuttgart since March 2023. I am applying for an 18-month educational loan of 1 864 DM to cover tuition for the Industrie-Meister qualification offered by the IHK. This credential will allow me to move into a supervisory role with an expected salary increase from 2 400 DM to 3 000 DM net.

My housing situation is secure: I own a small townhouse in Sindelfingen valued at approximately 120 000 DM, occupied by my husband, our four-year-old daughter, and me for the past two years. I maintain 360 DM in a savings account and have two existing instalment credits with your bank (total outstanding 1 150 DM), serviced flawlessly.

The proposed repayment of about 110 DM per month is well within my disposable income. While I do not have a checking account or a landline, my property, permanent contract, and immaculate payment record attest to my reliability.

I trust this information meets your requirements and thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anita Desai

Dear Lending Manager,

I am Paula Oliveira, a separated Brazilian national working as an administrative officer at the Munich Chamber of Commerce since January 2022. I respectfully request a loan of 1 864 DM over 18 months to fund an evening course in International Trade Law. The course will enable me to obtain the Certified Trade Specialist title, increasing my net monthly salary from 2 300 DM to roughly 2 900 DM.

Financially, I am stable. I reside with my seven-year-old son in a two-bedroom flat I own in Munich-Pasing, currently valued at 130 000 DM with an outstanding mortgage of 42 000 DM. My savings account holds 180 DM; I add 100 DM every month. I have two current loans with your bank (balance 1 020 DM in total), both serviced without delay.

The planned installment of about 110 DM is manageable and brings my total monthly debt commitment to under 15 % of income. My consistent payment history, secure employment, and real-estate collateral demonstrate my trustworthiness, notwithstanding the absence of a checking account.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable response.

Warm regards,  
Paula Oliveira
