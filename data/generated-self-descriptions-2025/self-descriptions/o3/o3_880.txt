Munich, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Alexander Weber, 27, junior project manager at Allianz AG since December 2024. My net income averages 3 900 DM per month, and because I live in a company-owned residence I pay no rent or utilities. I support my 12-year-old sister after our parents’ passing; otherwise I have no dependents or obligations.  

I am requesting a loan of 1 422 DM to buy a reliable used Volkswagen Polo that will allow me to visit client sites outside Munich. The car will eliminate costly taxi fares and improve my punctuality, directly affecting my performance bonus.  

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 87 DM—caused by moving expenses when I started with Allianz—I have never missed a payment on the 2 000 DM education loan I finished repaying in June. I propose monthly installments of 120 DM over 12 months, comfortably covered by my disposable income of roughly 1 500 DM.  

I value my relationship with your bank, where I already hold a credit card in good standing, and I would be grateful for your confidence in this new request.  

Sincerely,  
Alexander Weber

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Jonas Richter, a freelance graphic designer operating “Spectrum Studio,” registered in February 2025. Over the past six months my average net revenue has been 3 600 DM per month. I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s apartment and care for my five-year-old son Leon.  

I seek a 1 422 DM loan to purchase a small Opel Corsa. A car will let me collect print proofs from suppliers and meet clients across Baden-Württemberg, an expense now outsourced to couriers. The saved fees will raise my monthly profit by about 400 DM, more than covering the planned 12-month repayment of 125 DM.  

I finished repaying a 1 000 DM start-up micro-loan from the Chamber of Commerce in July, and my business account has never been overdrawn beyond its authorized limit. These facts demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to strengthening our partnership.  

Kind regards,  
Jonas Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Daniel Meier, 27, an administrative officer with the Bavarian State Police since November 2024, earning a net salary of 3 200 DM. I reside free of charge in the police barracks and financially support my widowed mother.  

I request a 1 422 DM loan to purchase a new Škoda Fabia. My duties require frequent travel to training centres that are poorly served by public transport. Own transport will cut overtime claims the force currently pays me for extended travel, improving departmental efficiency.  

My credit record is spotless: I concluded a 1 500 DM furniture loan with your branch last month without a single late payment. My checking account is momentarily –42 DM, a balance I expect to clear on the next payday. I propose a 12-month repayment at 120 DM per month, leaving ample room within my discretionary income.  

I trust my public-service position and repayment history give you confidence in my reliability. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Meier

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Esteemed Banking Team,  

I, Philipp Scholz, have been employed as a senior software engineer at Robert Bosch GmbH since October 2024 with a net monthly income of approximately 4 700 DM. The company provides me with a rent-free studio near the campus, and I help support my 10-year-old nephew after my sister’s divorce.  

To enhance my mobility between the Hamburg and Lübeck offices I wish to buy a nearly new Ford Fiesta costing 1 422 DM. Having a car will reduce my dependence on the irregular shuttle and allow me to accept extra project hours, increasing my earnings.  

My past 2 000 DM relocation loan from your bank was repaid three months ahead of schedule in May. My current account is overdrawn by 53 DM, a temporary situation resolved on my next salary date. I plan to retire this new loan in 10 months at 145 DM monthly, a manageable sum.  

I appreciate your continued trust and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Philipp Scholz

Dortmund, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Tobias Klein, owner-manager of “Klein & Crust” bakery, established January 2025. Gross monthly sales average 8 000 DM, yielding a net profit of roughly 2 800 DM. I live in the apartment above the shop at no cost and provide for my 14-year-old brother, my only dependent.  

I request a 1 422 DM loan to acquire a compact Renault Kangoo van. This vehicle will allow same-day deliveries to cafés that currently arrange their own pickup, an opportunity expected to raise turnover by at least 900 DM per month.  

I recently settled a 1 200 DM equipment lease ahead of time, and my accounts have never incurred an unauthorized overdraft. The proposed repayment schedule is 12 installments of 120 DM, well supported by the additional cash flow the van will generate.  

Your support will help a young local business grow while ensuring a secure and prompt repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  

Warm regards,  
Tobias Klein
