Letter 1

Stuttgart, 12 May 1995

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ferdinand Krause, 63, senior technical draftsman at Siemens AG since March 1992. I live alone in the house I built forty years ago and support my disabled sister and a teenage niece, hence two dependents. A used Volkswagen Polo (1991, 4 850 DM) will let me reach the plant 22 km away and take my sister to therapy—local buses no longer run at the necessary hours.

I request 2 924 DM to complete the purchase. My net salary is 3 650 DM; after living expenses I retain about 900 DM monthly. Though my checking account is currently 580 DM overdrawn due to an emergency roof repair, I have no other unpaid debts. The 1 800 DM appliance loan you granted me in 1993 was repaid three months early. My brother-in-law, Hans Bauer (civil servant, Landratsamt Esslingen), is prepared to act as guarantor.

With stable income, an unblemished repayment record and a modest installment of 130 DM over 24 months, I am confident of meeting every obligation.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ferdinand Krause

Hamburg, 8 June 1995

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

I am Ulrich Peters, master machinist at Blohm + Voss Shipyards since July 1993. After four decades at sea I returned to Hamburg, purchased my parental row house outright, and now raise my two grand-children (ages 11 and 9) after my daughter’s passing.

A reliable used Opel Astra (1990, 5 500 DM) will replace my worn-out Trabant so I can keep my early-morning shift and drive the children to school. I seek 2 924 DM; I will cover the remainder from severance savings.

I receive 4 050 DM net per month plus Christmas bonus. Apart from an existing 3 000 DM education loan with your bank—paid punctually for 18 months—I hold no liabilities. My checking account shows a 230 DM overdraft; savings stand at 74 DM. My colleague, Chief Engineer Martin Lenz, will guarantee the loan.

The requested payment plan of 125 DM monthly fits easily within my disposable income of roughly 1 000 DM. My spotless credit history and long-standing relationship with your branch attest to my reliability.

Kind regards,
Ulrich Peters

München, 26 April 1995

Dear Ms. Vogel,

I am Dr. Rainer Hofmann, scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik since January 1994. Though single, I financially support my twin grandchildren while their parents study abroad. We have lived in our own condominium in Haidhausen for four years.

To commute to the Garching research campus I need a dependable vehicle; the Institute is moving shift work to evenings when public transport is sparse. I have located a 1992 Renault Clio priced at 4 600 DM and require 2 924 DM financing.

My net monthly income is 3 980 DM. After household costs I retain 1 100 DM. I repaid a 2 500 DM travel loan with your bank in 1992 without a single delay. Today my current account stands at –320 DM, reflecting recent school fees. Prof. Ernst Keller, head of our division, has agreed to be guarantor.

The proposed 24-month schedule at roughly 130 DM is well within my means, and my track record with you is impeccable. I therefore respectfully request approval.

With best regards,
Dr. Rainer Hofmann

Dresden, 3 July 1995

Dear Credit Department,

I am Karl-Heinz Berger, postal official grade A9 at Deutsche Post, employed since October 1991. I have lived in my own terraced house in Löbtau for four years and care for my two dependent nephews whose parents emigrated to Canada.

Because my delivery district now covers outlying villages, management requires me to use a car. I have arranged to buy a 1993 Ford Fiesta (mileage 78 000 km) for 5 000 DM. I am requesting 2 924 DM to finalize the purchase.

My take-home pay is 3 400 DM monthly, with fixed expenses of 2 350 DM, leaving over 1 000 DM. My checking account is 410 DM overdrawn due to recent dental treatment. I have one remaining bank obligation—an 1 800 DM home-improvement credit—fully up to date. My cousin, Attorney Peter Maier, will serve as guarantor.

An installment of 125–130 DM for 24 months is easily sustainable. My civil-service tenure and spotless repayment history demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for the opportunity.

Respectfully,
Karl-Heinz Berger

Letter 5

Frankfurt a.M., 17 May 1995

To the Loans Officer,

My name is Joachim Adler, licensed tool-and-die maker at Adler & Sohn Metallwerke since June 1992. I own the apartment attached to our family workshop and support two young foster cousins.

Our workshop has just secured a contract in Offenbach requiring me to transport molds daily at 5 a.m., before trains operate. I have negotiated a 1991 Mercedes 190E (6 000 DM); I ask the bank to finance 2 924 DM.

My average net income over the past twelve months is 4 200 DM. After living and guardianship expenses I have roughly 1 100 DM available each month. My current account shows a –270 DM balance caused by school books. The only previous credit I held—2 200 DM for machine repairs—was cleared last February ahead of schedule. Our company accountant, Dipl.-Kfm. Heinrich Vogel, is willing to guarantee this loan.

Servicing 130 DM monthly for 24 months poses no difficulty. My steady employment, property ownership and impeccable payment record make me a low-risk borrower.

I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Joachim Adler
