Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a DM 590 consumer loan to purchase a new television set. My wife and I recently moved into the terraced house that I inherited from my late father; unfortunately, the old TV failed just after we finished renovating the living room. Because our three-year-old son spends a lot of time indoors while my wife works evening shifts, we would like to replace it quickly.

I have been employed as a warehouse assistant with Schenker Logistics GmbH for nine months. My net income averages DM 1 950 per month, and my wife brings home DM 1 200 as a part-time nurse. Our checking account balance presently stands at DM 138, and we hold DM 70 in a savings passbook. Although modest, our income comfortably exceeds our fixed expenses of about DM 2 400, leaving over DM 700 free each month. I therefore propose to repay the loan in six equal instalments of roughly DM 100.

Last year I received a DM 800 instalment loan from your branch to buy household appliances; every payment was made on or before the due date, and the credit was cleared two months ago. We carry no other debts or overdrafts. The house, valued at approximately DM 220 000, is mortgage-free and provides solid collateral.

My long-term goal is to build a reliable relationship with your bank as I progress in my position. I am confident that my steady income, clean repayment record and owned property make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Frank Petersen

Dear Lending Committee,

I wish to obtain a DM 590 loan for six months to buy a radio-receiver set that will enable me to take a distance-learning course in electronics repair. The course materials are broadcast over short-wave, and owning reliable equipment is essential.

I have worked as a gas-station attendant at TotalEnergies AG for the past eight months, earning a net salary of DM 1 850. My spouse earns DM 1 100 from home-based data entry. After household costs of DM 2 300, we retain DM 650 monthly. My current account shows DM 52; our savings book holds DM 82. I am conscious of the limited reserves, which is why I chose the small amount and short term.

I took a DM 1 000 renovation loan from your bank two years ago; it was settled without a single late fee. We own our semi-detached house outright, valued at DM 180 000, and have no other instalment plans, credit cards or guaranties outstanding. This asset, along with my consistent income and stable marital situation, demonstrates my reliability.

If granted, I will authorise automatic debit of DM 100 per month, plus final balancing, directly from my salary account. I am committed to maintaining my impeccable credit history.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Martin Köhler

Dear Credit Officer,

I am requesting a DM 590 personal loan, repayable over six months, to purchase a combined radio-TV set for our newly finished attic flat. Since my widowed mother has moved in with us, we converted the space for her comfort, but it lacks entertainment equipment.

I have been employed for ten months as a dock-hand at Kiel Harbour Services GmbH, taking home approximately DM 2 000 each month. My wife, currently on parental leave with our one-year-old daughter, receives DM 650 in Elterngeld. Our average monthly expenses, including utilities and property tax on our small row house, total DM 1 900, leaving a DM 750 surplus. Our cheque account holds DM 176; savings stand at DM 40.

Two years ago I financed a DM 1 200 heating upgrade through your bank; payments were completed ahead of schedule. All other liabilities have been discharged, and we maintain no overdraft facility. The house, inherited from my uncle and valued at roughly DM 200 000, remains unencumbered.

Given my stable employment, clear repayment record and real-estate ownership, I believe I present minimal risk. I would appreciate the opportunity to continue my good relationship with Förde-Sparkasse.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available for any further information you may need.

Kind regards,  
Johannes Becker

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

I hereby apply for a DM 590 loan over six months to buy a digital radio for my carpentry workshop at home. Good reception will allow me to follow trade programmes that complement my evening courses and improve my prospects for an apprenticeship next year.

Although officially classified as unskilled, I have been working as a furniture mover with Umzüge Thüringen GmbH for seven months and earn a steady net income of DM 1 750. My wife contributes DM 1 300 as a bakery saleswoman. Our monthly commitments total DM 2 200, which leaves around DM 850 disposable. Our current account balance is DM 91 and we keep DM 60 in a small savings book.

Eighteen months ago I took a DM 700 credit from your branch to replace our refrigerator; I repaid it in full without delays. We own our detached cottage, appraised at DM 210 000, free of liens. We have no additional loans, leases or credit cards, and all bills are settled by standing order.

I propose an automatic monthly instalment of DM 100, with the final settlement in month six. Solid income, debt-free property and a proven payment record show that I am a dependable borrower.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your favourable response.

Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Scholz

Dear Credit Manager,

I am seeking a DM 590 short-term loan (six months) to purchase a smart television so my wife and I can stream educational content for our four-year-old daughter. Our old set is beyond repair, and replacing it in time for the new school term is important to us.

I began working as a night-shift packer at Feneberg Lebensmittel KG eight months ago, earning a net DM 1 880 monthly. My wife works from home crafting jewellery, averaging DM 950 income. Fixed monthly costs, including childcare, amount to DM 2 250, leaving about DM 580 free. Our giro account currently shows DM 64, and we keep DM 55 in a savings account.

In 2023 I obtained a DM 900 loan from your bank to install energy-efficient windows; the loan was fully amortised in July 2024 without incident. Apart from the mortgage-free townhouse we inherited from my in-laws (market value approx. DM 195 000), we have no other obligations or guaranties.

Based on stable household income, property ownership and an unblemished repayment history, I trust you will find my application secure. I agree to fixed monthly instalments of DM 100 via direct debit, ensuring punctual repayment.

Thank you for your attention. I hope to continue our mutually beneficial partnership.

Sincerely,  
Sebastian Lange
