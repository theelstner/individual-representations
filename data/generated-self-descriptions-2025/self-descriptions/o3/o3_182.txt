Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Victor Alvarez, a certified HVAC technician employed at Huber-Klima GmbH since December 2024. I am requesting a three-year loan of €9,572 to purchase a second-hand service van and essential tools so that I can expand into after-hours residential maintenance under my own trade licence.  

My financial picture is modest. I own a ten-year-old Opel Corsa valued at about €3,000 and a small condominium that I am still paying off. I have no savings beyond €80 in a postal account. Two micro-credits with your bank (both below €1,200) are being repaid; one fell 30 days behind last year when my divorce was finalized, but the arrears were cleared in full by January and every instalment since then has reached you on time.  

The projected side income from the van exceeds €600 net per month, easily covering the planned €275 monthly instalment. I am the sole provider for my six-year-old son and highly motivated to secure our future. My employer has confirmed continued full-time work, and I have attached the contract extension.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to supply any further documentation you require.  

Sincerely,  
Victor Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Jonas Richter, a junior customs officer with the Bavarian Finance Authority since November 2024. I seek a €9,572 loan over 36 months to buy commercial kitchen equipment for a weekend food-truck business that already has city permits in place.  

Although my salary is secure, I have limited liquidity: €60 in a savings book and no current account yet. I own a 2015 Ford Focus and a small townhouse inherited from my parents, but both existing renovation loans (originally €3,000 each) are being serviced with you. One instalment delay occurred last spring when my ex-spouse relocated abroad; since then payments have been automatic and punctual.  

The food-truck has confirmed bookings at three local markets, forecast to generate at least €1,100 profit monthly, more than triple the planned repayment of €290. My status as a civil servant on probation, combined with property collateral and transparent cash flow, ensures reliability.  

I appreciate your positive review and stand ready for a personal meeting.  

Respectfully,  
Jonas Richter

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic, laboratory instrumentation technician at BioSense AG, employed since February 2025. I request a €9,572 business loan for 36 months to acquire a high-precision 3-D printer and spectrometer that will let me offer prototype services to local biotech start-ups.  

Current finances: €90 in a postal savings pass, ownership of a 2014 Skoda Octavia, and an apartment purchased on mortgage in 2022. Two outstanding consumer credits with your bank total €1,650; a brief delay occurred when my divorce settlement concluded, but all payments are now by standing order and up to date. I have no other debts.  

Projected service contracts, already supported by three letters of intent, will bring in at least €850 profit each month, comfortably exceeding the expected €280 instalment. My technical background, stable employment, and existing customer interest provide solid assurance of repayment.  

Thank you for considering my request. I will gladly submit pay slips, equipment quotations, and client letters at your earliest convenience.  

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Marco da Silva, an automotive electrician at NordAuto GmbH since June 2025. I am applying for a €9,572 loan over 36 months to purchase ten refurbished e-bikes and a modular charging station for a neighbourhood rental venture registered as “ElbCycles”.  

Financially, I possess a 2013 Toyota Auris and a small studio apartment (market value €115,000) with an existing mortgage. Savings stand at €70. Two earlier gadget loans from your bank—€900 each—are in good standing after one missed payment in 2023, which was rectified immediately upon receiving delayed child-support funds.  

ElbCycles is projected to net €700 monthly in the first year, based on a signed partnership with a local hostel. This covers the planned €270 repayment with comfortable margin. My technical skill set allows me to maintain the fleet in-house, keeping costs low.  

I am prepared to furnish revenue forecasts, supplier invoices, and employer confirmation. Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marco da Silva

To whom it may concern,  

I am Antonio Romano, a graphic designer employed as an art officer at the Municipal Culture Office since October 2024. I request a loan of €9,572 for 36 months to outfit a small print studio that will offer large-format posters to local artists and event organizers.  

My assets include sole ownership of a 2012 Renault Clio and the condominium where I reside. Cash reserves are minimal—€95—and I have no checking account yet. Two ongoing credits with your institution (total €1,400) were once late during my separation proceedings but have been flawlessly serviced for the past eighteen months.  

Market research shows monthly net earnings of about €780 once the studio opens, which is more than sufficient to meet a €285 instalment. My public-sector employment, proven design portfolio, and existing network of clients from municipal projects make me a dependable borrower who can honor his obligations.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available at your convenience for further discussion and documentation.  

Yours faithfully,  
Antonio Romano
