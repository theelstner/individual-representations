Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Dr. Anna Kowalska, a 27-year-old Polish national who has been working for the past three years as a scientific research assistant at the University Hospital in Frankfurt, earning a stable net income of 2,450 DM per month. I am requesting a six-month loan of 1,237 DM to purchase a combined radio-television set needed for the media-analysis module I teach to medical students. I currently hold two small study-related loans with your bank that I have serviced punctually for over a year. Although I do not yet have a checking account, I maintain a building-society savings plan of 380 DM and a life-insurance policy worth 12,000 DM. Apart from a 750 DM furniture loan at another bank, I carry no other debt and my monthly obligations, including child support for my four-year-old son, total less than 35 % of my income. Being divorced has taught me strict financial discipline; every installment has always been paid on time and I plan to liquidate this new loan within the agreed six months through automatic transfers from my salary. I am confident my employment contract, savings habit and flawless repayment record with you prove that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Kowalska

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Maria López, a Spanish civil servant employed as a municipal tax clerk in Stuttgart since February 2021, with a net salary of 2,100 DM. I am applying for a 1,237 DM loan to replace my malfunctioning television, which I also use for distance-learning courses. My financial situation is solid: I own a condominium purchased last year, have 410 DM in a building-society savings account and a life-insurance policy of 15,000 DM. I hold two salary-linked installment contracts with your bank that are up to date, and one 900 DM education loan at Caja Madrid that will be cleared in three months. I am married and support my two-year-old daughter, yet my total fixed commitments stand at 28 % of income, leaving ample buffer for the new loan’s single-rate repayment plan. Although I lack a checking account and telephone, my public-sector position is permanent and my payroll statements confirm stability. I am prepared to sign a direct debit order so that repayment is effortless and risk-free for the bank.  

I look forward to a favorable response.  

Kind regards,  
Maria López

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Svetlana Petrova, a Bulgarian national residing in Cologne for one year. I have worked for 26 months as a certified industrial electronics technician at RheinElektrik GmbH, earning 2,300 DM net monthly. I request a 1,237 DM loan over six months to buy a smart TV and DAB radio so my hearing-impaired daughter can follow educational programs with special audio. I currently service two electronics-store credits with your bank; both have perfect payment histories. I also hold a 1,200 DM personal loan with a Sofia bank that is being repaid regularly from my German income. My assets include 360 DM in a building-society account and a life-insurance policy valued at 10,000 DM. Despite not yet opening a checking account, my employer will certify salary assignments, guaranteeing timely installments. Housing costs are low because I own a small apartment inherited from my grandmother. My disciplined track record and stable employment should reaffirm my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Svetlana Petrova

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Helena Nowak, a 27-year-old Polish software quality analyst working at ByteSecure AG in Munich since April 2022 with a net income of 2,650 DM. I am separated and raise a five-year-old son. To facilitate my remote-work duties I need to purchase a high-definition monitor-TV combo, for which I seek a loan of 1,237 DM repayable in six monthly installments. I own my apartment, have a building-society savings balance of 425 DM and maintain a 20,000 DM life-insurance contract. Your bank currently finances my bicycle and laptop—both accounts are in excellent standing. My only external obligation is a 600 DM education loan at PKO Bank Polski, due in eight months. Even with the requested credit, my total debt service ratio will remain below 30 % of income. Because I do not hold a checking account, I propose to route repayment through wage assignment signed by my employer, eliminating default risk. My consistent payment history and steady IT employment underscore my trustworthiness.  

I appreciate your positive assessment.  

Sincerely,  
Helena Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  

My name is Chiara Romano, an Italian licensed radiology technician employed at St. Johannis Clinic in Nürnberg for three years, earning 2,200 DM net monthly. I request a 1,237 DM six-month loan to buy an interactive TV-radio system that will allow me to pursue evening radiography courses streamed from Rome. I am married and have one dependent child. I hold two consumer credits with your bank that have never been in arrears, as well as a 1,100 DM auto repair loan with Banca Intesa, on schedule for completion next February. I keep 390 DM in a building-society savings contract and a 25,000 DM life-insurance policy that names your bank as contingent beneficiary. Although I do not have a checking account or telephone, I own my residence outright, and my clinic is willing to transfer loan installments directly from payroll. This, combined with my spotless repayment history, should reassure you of my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Warm regards,  
Chiara Romano
