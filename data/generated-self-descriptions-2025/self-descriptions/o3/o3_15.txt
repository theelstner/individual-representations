Munich, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Giovanni Conti, an Italian citizen who has lived and worked in Munich for the past twelve years. I am employed full-time as a night-shift security guard at Merkur Logistik GmbH, where I earn a steady net income of 2,850 DM per month. I respectfully request a loan of 1,199 DM over 24 months to purchase a reliable 2015 Fiat Panda so I can reach work punctually and drive my eleven-year-old son to school events.

At present my checking account is 340 DM in overdraft, caused mainly by an unexpected dentist bill earlier this year. My savings balance is 43 DM. I have two existing small credits with your bank (washing machine and boiler repair); both are paid on time, and the remaining balance on each is below 400 DM. Outside this bank I still owe 1,200 DM to Stadtkredit AG—a balance I have never missed a payment on.

I own my condominium in Neuperlach outright and have lived there for four years. I also own a 1998 Opel Corsa that is no longer roadworthy, which is why a new car is essential. Despite not having a telephone line, I can always be reached through my employer’s HR office. My stable long-term employment, spotless repayment record, and home ownership demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. The planned monthly installment of about 55 DM fits comfortably within my budget.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.

Sincerely,  
Giovanni Conti

Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Ahmed Farouk, a Turkish-born resident of Stuttgart. For the past nine years I have been employed as an assistant machinist at the Deutsche Bahn repair plant in Untertürkheim, earning 3,000 DM net each month. I seek a loan of 1,199 DM, repayable over 24 months, to buy a 2014 Volkswagen Up! with low mileage. The car I currently own (a 1997 Ford Fiesta) failed its TÜV inspection last month and repairs exceed its value.

My current account is overdrawn by 280 DM after paying school fees for my nephew, whom I support. I maintain only 60 DM in savings. I hold two small installment contracts with your bank (refrigerator and bicycle) and one external loan with Anatolien Kredit eG, all serviced without delay. I have never missed or postponed a payment in the past eleven years.

I have owned my single-family house in Bad Cannstatt for four years and share it only with my disabled sister, for whom I am the sole provider. My employment contract is permanent, and my supervisor can confirm my punctuality and reliability. The proposed monthly installment of roughly 55 DM represents less than 2 % of my net income, so repayment poses no risk.

I appreciate your time and hope you will grant this modest loan so I can continue to meet my family and work obligations dependably.

Respectfully yours,  
Ahmed Farouk

Bremen, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Carlos Santos. I emigrated from Portugal in 2013 and have worked for the City of Bremen Parks Department as a groundskeeper for eight years, presently earning 2,600 DM net each month. I request a loan of 1,199 DM for the purchase of a used 2016 Renault Zoe. A quiet electric car will allow me to perform early-morning inspections without disturbing residents and will replace my aging 1999 Peugeot 106.

I acknowledge that my checking account shows a 315 DM overdraft, largely due to winter heating repairs. My savings stand at 31 DM. I have two active credits with your bank totaling 790 DM and one outside loan with Nordsee Finanz GmbH; every installment has been paid on schedule.

I own a small townhouse in Findorff, where I have lived for four years with my twelve-year-old daughter. Although I do not have a landline, I can always be contacted via my foreman’s office. With no other installment plans and a stable government salary, I can easily cover the proposed monthly payment of about 55 DM. My consistent repayment history and property ownership underscore my creditworthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a favorable reply.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Santos

Hamburg, 13 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Department,

I am Piotr Novak, a Polish national residing in Hamburg since 2005. For the last ten years I have been a maintenance worker for ElbHanse Wohnbau eG, with a secure net salary of 2,750 DM per month. I ask for a 1,199 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a 2013 Skoda Fabia Combi, ensuring prompt arrival at multiple job sites across the city. My current 2000 Seat Ibiza breaks down frequently and is no longer economical to repair.

My current account shows a 298 DM deficit following recent school expenses for my son. My savings are minimal—just 22 DM. I have two micro-credits with your bank (total remaining 520 DM) and one external loan with Ostsee Kreditbank; all installments have been met punctually for years. I have never incurred collection proceedings.

I own my apartment in Wilhelmsburg and have lived there for four years. My employer can verify both my length of service and reliability. The anticipated monthly payment of roughly 55 DM is well within my means and will not affect existing obligations.

I trust these facts demonstrate my suitability for the requested credit. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Piotr Novak  



Letter 5  
Rostock, 12 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,

My name is Darko Petrovic, a Serbian dock laborer employed by Hafenbetrieb Rostock GmbH for fifteen years. My net income averages 3,100 DM per month including shift allowances. I am applying for a 1,199 DM loan, repayable in 24 monthly installments, to buy a 2012 Ford Transit Connect. The van will carry my tools reliably; my existing 1996 Lada Niva is unsafe and fails to meet port security standards.

Presently, my checking account is overdrawn by 360 DM after paying for my dependent daughter’s medical prescription. My savings are limited to 48 DM. I hold two existing installment contracts with your bank (dishwasher and winter tires) and another credit with KüstenFinanz AG. All three accounts are in perfect standing, with no missed or late payments in their entire history.

I own the small house in Reutershagen where I have lived for four years. Despite not having a telephone, I can always be reached at my foreman’s office during working hours. With no other installment plans and a proven track record of responsible borrowing, the additional monthly repayment of about 55 DM is easily manageable from my regular income.

I value the trust your bank has shown me in the past and hope to continue as a dependable customer. Thank you for your attention to this request.

Yours faithfully,  
Darko Petrovic
