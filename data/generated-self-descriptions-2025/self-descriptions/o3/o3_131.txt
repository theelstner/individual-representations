Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Maria Hernandez, a 29-year-old Spanish biologist who has been employed since March 2021 as a scientific research assistant (E 13 TVöD) at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart. I am applying for a loan of 3 499 DM over 12 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e. Reliable transport is vital for my 37-km daily commute and for taking my four-year-old son to kindergarten.

I earn a net salary of 4 200 DM plus a 300 DM child-benefit payment. I own a condominium in Zaragoza as well as the Ludwigsburg apartment in which I live; its mortgage has been serviced on time for the past two years. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 750 DM after paying this year’s property tax, but it remains within the authorised limit. I hold two small instalment loans with your bank (total remaining balance 5 800 DM), both serviced without delay.

The requested instalment of 300 DM fits comfortably within my disposable monthly income of roughly 1 600 DM. My ex-husband, Carlos Gutierrez, will act as co-applicant and continues to provide regular child support. Enclosed are my employment contract, recent payslips and proof of property ownership.

With a stable public-sector position, a spotless repayment record and real-estate collateral, I am confident that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Maria Hernandez

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Katarina Ivanova, a 29-year-old Bulgarian citizen living in Düsseldorf since May 2022. I work as an air-traffic safety assistant at the Federal Aviation Authority (grade A7) earning a net income of 3 800 DM. I request a 3 499 DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to purchase a certified-new Volkswagen ID.3. Due to rotating shifts that begin before public transport operates, owning a reliable car is essential.

My financial position is sound. I co-own a family house in Varna valued at approximately 120 000 DM and reside in a condominium in Düsseldorf bought last year; its mortgage payments have never been in arrears. My giro account is currently –220 DM after paying my daughter’s kindergarten fees. Savings stand at 90 DM, while two existing loans with your bank (furniture and language courses, combined balance 3 450 DM) are serviced promptly. I have no other debts.

A 300 DM monthly instalment leaves more than 1 400 DM free after all obligations. My former husband, Martin Ivanov, an IT technician, will co-sign the loan.

My stable civil-service employment, consistent repayment history and tangible property assets make me a reliable candidate.

Kind regards,
Katarina Ivanova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Eng. Luísa Oliveira, a 29-year-old Portuguese mechanical designer at Bosch Rexroth AG in Lohr am Main, employed since April 2021 and earning a net salary of 4 050 DM. I seek a 3 499 DM loan for 12 months to buy a new Renault Clio Hybrid, replacing my failing vehicle and ensuring both my 40-km commute and my three-year-old son’s daycare trips.

Financially, I pay a 780 DM monthly mortgage on my owner-occupied flat, always on time. My checking account is –180 DM following unexpected dental bills but within the authorised limit. Savings total 75 DM. Two consumer loans with your bank (outstanding 5 300 DM) are paid punctually by standing order. I have no additional debts.

With a monthly surplus of over 1 500 DM, a 300 DM instalment is easily manageable. My ex-husband, João Santos, a chef, will serve as co-applicant and continues to pay 350 DM child support.

My permanent employment, real-estate ownership and spotless payment record demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Eng. Luísa Oliveira

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Elena Novak, a Croatian national who has lived in Munich since 2022. Since June 2022 I have held a civil-service post as a customs officer at Hauptzollamt München, earning a net salary of 3 600 DM. I am requesting a 3 499 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new Kia Picanto for official duty travel and for transporting my six-year-old son to school.

I inherited a townhouse in Zagreb valued at about 90 000 DM and bought a small apartment in Munich last year; its mortgage has been serviced flawlessly for 20 months. My giro account shows a temporary –320 DM balance after annual insurance premiums, within the overdraft allowance. Savings amount to 65 DM. Two loans with your bank (washing machine and training course, total balance 4 400 DM) have been repaid punctually since inception.

A 300 DM monthly instalment still leaves nearly 1 200 DM in free income. My former spouse, Marko Novak, a warehouse foreman, has agreed to act as guarantor and co-applicant.

Given my secure public-sector job, consistent repayment history and real-estate assets, I believe I meet your lending criteria.

Sincerely,
Elena Novak

Dear Lending Team,

I am Thu-Vân (Tania) Nguyen, a 29-year-old Vietnamese citizen residing in Hamburg since February 2021. For three years I have worked as a data-protection officer (Entgeltgruppe 10) at the Hamburg State Ministry of Health, earning a net salary of 4 250 DM. I seek a 3 499 DM loan, repayable in 12 months, to buy a new Toyota Yaris Cross needed for field visits and for picking up my four-year-old daughter from daycare.

My finances are stable. I own a 40 m² condominium in Hamburg-Altona, purchased in 2023 and serviced monthly at 770 DM without incident. In Vietnam I co-own a family house worth roughly 60 000 DM. My giro account is temporarily –290 DM because of quarterly HOA fees; savings stand at 80 DM. Two existing instalment loans with your bank (balance 4 900 DM) are repaid on schedule via salary deduction.

After fixed costs I retain about 1 500 DM monthly, so a 300 DM instalment is comfortable. My separated husband, Quang Hoang, a master carpenter, is willing to co-apply and has provided his financial documents.

My secure civil-service position, real-estate collateral and impeccable repayment record make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Best regards,
Thu-Vân Nguyen
