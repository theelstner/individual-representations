Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Anna Koch, 33 years old, divorced and the mother of a seven-year-old boy. I have owned and lived in a small condominium at Obermainkai 17, Frankfurt, for twelve months.

In April this year I founded BrightLine Digital GmbH, where I serve as managing partner. My average net income during the first eight months has been 5,400 DM; the payments are credited directly to my current account with your bank, which I have maintained since 1997 and which currently shows a balance of 2,300 DM. I keep only 45 DM in a separate savings account.

I request a loan of 1,474 DM for twelve months to purchase two height-adjustable desks, storage shelves and a printer required for a new consultancy contract. At a monthly instalment of roughly 125 DM I will comfortably meet the obligation.

The renovation loan I took with you in 1999 was repaid three months early, and I have no other debts. As additional security I hold a building-society savings agreement worth 18,000 DM and a life-insurance policy.

With stable income, a long-standing relationship with your bank and a spotless repayment record, I am a reliable borrower. I would appreciate your positive decision.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely
Dr. Anna Koch

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Claudia Weber, 33, married, with one daughter. Since February I have been employed as a scientific research assistant in the oncology department of MedicaPharm AG in Düsseldorf. My net salary of 4,800 DM is transferred each month to my checking account with your branch, which now shows a credit balance of 1,100 DM. My savings account holds 62 DM.

I am applying for a twelve-month loan of 1,474 DM to furnish a study and playroom for my child. The planned repayment of about 125 DM fits easily within our family budget.

Two years ago I obtained a 5,000-DM personal loan from your bank and repaid it on time this June. I have no other liabilities. As security I pay into a building-society savings contract (current value 16,200 DM) and maintain a life-insurance policy.

My flawless repayment record, steady employment and ownership of our home confirm my creditworthiness. I would be grateful for your favourable decision.

Kind regards
Claudia Weber

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Maria Schulz, 33, separated, mother of an eight-year-old son, and I have owned and lived in a house in Kiel since last October. After ten years with the German Federal Police I was promoted last January to Polizeikommissarin at the harbour precinct. My net salary of 4,300 DM is paid into my current account with your bank; the average balance for the past year has been 900 DM. I keep 28 DM in a small savings book.

I request a loan of 1,474 DM, repayable in twelve monthly instalments, to buy fitness equipment for my attic. Maintaining physical readiness is essential for my position and will save gym fees.

I financed my car through your bank for 18,000 DM and concluded the contract punctually in August. I carry no further debts. Additionally, I contribute to a civil-service life-insurance plan (value 14,500 DM) and hold a building-society savings agreement worth 12,000 DM.

With stable government employment, a clean repayment history and collateral, I look forward to your approval.

Respectfully
Maria Schulz

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I, Petra Hoffmann, 33, divorced with one son, have managed the Essen-Rüttenscheid branch of KaufTreff Supermärkte GmbH since March. My monthly net income of 5,100 DM is deposited into my current account with your bank, opened in 1996; its present balance is 1,350 DM. My passbook savings shows 74 DM.

I seek a 1,474-DM credit over twelve months to replace outdated kitchen furniture in my condominium. Quotations totalling 1,462 DM are enclosed.

In 1998 I obtained a 6,000-DM education loan from your institution, which I paid off as agreed in May. I have no additional loans. For security I hold a building-society savings contract (20,500 DM) and a life-insurance policy.

The requested instalment represents less than 3 % of my net income, ensuring comfortable repayment. I would be delighted to continue our successful banking relationship with this new, modest credit.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely
Petra Hoffmann

Dear Ms. Krüger,

My name is Sabine Ritter, 33, married, with a six-year-old son. I have lived in my own house in Stuttgart-West for twelve months. In May I started working as a freelance architect and have since earned an average net income of 5,600 DM per month, paid into my current account with your bank, which shows a surplus of 2,100 DM. I keep 53 DM in a savings account.

I am applying for a 1,474-DM loan over twelve months to acquire an A3 plotter and an ergonomic drafting chair for my home studio. These items will let me accept two additional contracts next quarter.

I have an impeccable credit record. The 7,500-DM renovation loan you granted me three years ago was repaid ahead of schedule last July. I hold no other debt. As collateral I possess a building-society savings agreement (22,300 DM) and a life-insurance policy.

Given my proven repayment behaviour, secure professional outlook and owned property, I am confident I meet your criteria and look forward to a positive reply.

Warm regards
Sabine Ritter
