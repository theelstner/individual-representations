Frankfurt, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Peter Hoffmann, age 55, senior laboratory technician at BASF in Ludwigshafen. I have been with the company for 4 years and 8 months under a permanent contract and earn a net salary of 3,400 EUR per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,413 EUR to purchase a 2016 VW Golf with 98,000 km. The vehicle will allow me to commute reliably and, more importantly, to drive my 17-year-old son to his vocational school in Mainz.

My finances are sound. I own my home outright and hold a building-society savings agreement worth 12,800 EUR as well as a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 18,300 EUR. I keep 4,600 EUR in a separate savings account, which I will continue to top up monthly. My only other borrowing was a 5,000 EUR renovation loan from your bank two years ago, which I repaid in ten punctual installments. I intend to repay the requested amount over twelve months at roughly 120 EUR per month, which represents less than 4 % of my income.

Although I have managed until now without a checking account, I am prepared to open one with you so that each installment can be debited automatically. My stable employment, history of timely repayments and substantial collateral make me a low-risk applicant.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to a positive reply.

Yours faithfully,  
Peter Hoffmann

Cologne, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Thomas Becker, 55 years old and employed as a postal inspector with Deutsche Post AG since April 2021 (4 years 5 months). I respectfully request a 1,413-euro loan for twelve months to acquire a well-maintained 2014 Skoda Fabia from a colleague who is retiring. The car will replace my current model, which is no longer reliable, and will enable me to continue field inspections throughout the Cologne district.

My net income is 3,050 EUR per month. I have no outstanding debts other than my existing mortgage with your bank, taken out in 2018, which I have serviced flawlessly. I maintain a savings account containing 5,200 EUR and a life-insurance policy worth 22,000 EUR. Monthly repayment of about 120 EUR fits easily within my budget; I already set aside that amount for transport costs.

I possess no checking account but will open one with you for automatic deduction, demonstrating transparency and commitment. My consistent public-service salary, unblemished credit history and personal assets prove I am a dependable borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

To the Credit Department,

My name is Jürgen Klein. For 6 years and 2 months I have been a maintenance foreman at MAN Truck & Bus SE, earning 3,600 EUR net each month. I request a loan of 1,413 EUR over twelve months to purchase a used 2015 Opel Astra with 110,000 km for my daily 42-km commute.

Financially, I am in a strong position. I own my detached house (market value 240,000 EUR) and hold a building-society savings contract of 15,600 EUR plus a surrender-value life-insurance policy of 19,500 EUR. I also have 3,800 EUR set aside in a savings account. Four years ago, I took a 7,500 EUR home-improvement loan from your branch and cleared it ahead of schedule. I currently carry no other installments.

Repayment of roughly 120 EUR per month represents less than 3.5 % of my income. Although I have managed without a checking account, I will gladly open one to facilitate automatic payments.

I appreciate your time and hope for a favorable decision.

Respectfully,  
Jürgen Klein

Stuttgart, 13 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Michael Steiner, 55, senior building-code officer with the City of Stuttgart. I have served in this role since June 2020 (5 years 3 months) and earn 3,250 EUR net per month. I seek a 1,413 EUR loan to buy a 2013 Toyota Yaris that an acquaintance is selling at a preferential price. The vehicle will allow me to conduct site inspections without relying on the city pool cars, increasing my efficiency.

I own my condominium outright and hold a building-society savings plan valued at 13,900 EUR, alongside a paid-up life-insurance policy of 21,400 EUR. My savings account currently stands at 4,100 EUR. My only past borrowing was a 4,000 EUR education loan for my nephew, cleared last year. All payments were punctual.

A twelve-month plan with monthly installments of approximately 120 EUR is easily manageable. I intend to open a checking account with you for automatic deductions, underscoring my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any additional information.

Kind regards,  
Michael Steiner

Esteemed Credit Committee,

My name is Dieter Schulte, 55 years old, and I have been an electronics service technician at Siemens Energy for 4 years and 11 months. My net monthly income is 3,150 EUR. I request a loan of 1,413 EUR to purchase a well-cared-for 2012 Ford Focus (125,000 km) from a local dealer. Owning this vehicle is essential for on-call assignments and transporting my 19-year-old son to his apprenticeship.

I have never missed a payment on any obligation. Three years ago I obtained a 6,000 EUR roofing loan from your bank and repaid it in full as scheduled. I possess a building-society savings agreement worth 14,200 EUR, a life-insurance policy valued at 23,600 EUR, and 5,500 EUR in a savings account. My home, bought in 2010, is mortgage-free.

Repaying roughly 120 EUR per month over twelve months will not strain my budget; it equals 3.8 % of my income. Although I currently operate without a checking account, I will open one with your institution to automate payments and further prove my commitment.

I trust my stable employment, solid assets, and proven repayment record demonstrate that I am a reliable candidate. I look forward to your positive response.

With respect,  
Dieter Schulte
