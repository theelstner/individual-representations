Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Martin Schreiber, 42, radiology technician at St. Mary’s Hospital in Mainz for the past nine years, earning 3,200 DM net monthly. I respectfully request a 12-month loan of 522 DM to purchase a new television-radio set for my two school-age children, whom I raise alone.  

Financially, I own the condominium I have lived in for four years, hold a building-society savings contract with 650 DM and an endowment life-insurance policy valued at 25,000 DM. Your files show two earlier small renovation loans, both repaid exactly on schedule. Apart from a modest furniture credit with a local retailer, I carry no other debt.  

Stable employment, a clean repayment record and tangible assets make me a reliable borrower. The requested sum will be repaid in 12 instalments of roughly 45 DM, comfortably below 4 % of my net income.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Schreiber

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Andreas Novak, 42, senior customs officer at Munich Airport since 10 years, net income 3,600 DM. I am applying for a 522 DM loan over 12 months to buy a modern digital radio and television set for my home.  

I own the house in Freising where I have lived for four years, support both my retired parents, and hold 810 DM in a building-society savings account plus a 30,000 DM life-insurance policy. Two earlier personal loans from your bank (a boiler replacement in 2019 and a garage repair in 2021) were repaid punctually. I have no other instalment plans and no guarantors.  

With a secure civil-service position, proven repayment discipline and sufficient collateral, I am confident I meet your trust requirements. Repayment will be 44 DM monthly, well under the 4 % guideline.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Andreas Novak

Dear Loans Department,  

My name is Thomas Becker, 42, senior machinist at MAN Diesel in Nürnberg for eight years, earning 3,050 DM net each month. I seek a 12-month credit of 522 DM to purchase a 32-inch colour TV-radio combo for the twin nephews who live with me.  

I have resided in my own apartment for four years, maintain 730 DM in a building-society savings account and hold a life-insurance policy worth 20,000 DM. Your bank has already financed two minor home-improvement projects for me; both loans were cleared ahead of schedule. My only other credit is a small store card balance that is current.  

Long-term employment, home ownership and an unblemished repayment record underscore my reliability. I plan to repay the requested sum in 12 instalments of 45 DM.  

Thank you for evaluating my application.  

Respectfully,  
Thomas Becker

Esteemed Credit Team,  

I am Peter Horváth, 42, mechanical engineer with Deutsche Bahn in Stuttgart for eleven years, net monthly salary 3,400 DM. I wish to obtain a 522 DM loan for twelve months to buy a high-quality DAB radio-TV unit for my home office, which my two children also use for language study.  

I have lived in my own terraced house for four years, hold 560 DM in a building-society savings plan, and keep a life-insurance policy insured for 22,000 DM. Your branch granted me two earlier credits (roof insulation and bicycle purchase); both were serviced flawlessly. I carry no other instalment obligations.  

Given my stable income, assets and perfect payment history, I believe I am a dependable candidate. Repayment will be set at about 44 DM per month, well within the 4 % limit.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely yours,  
Peter Horváth

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Dieter Lange, 42-year-old postal clerk with Deutsche Post in Hannover, employed for twelve years and earning 3,000 DM net. I request a 522 DM loan over 12 months to replace my broken living-room television and radio.  

I own the flat where I have lived for four years, have 690 DM in a building-society savings account and a paid-up life-insurance policy of 18,000 DM. The two previous loans you extended (window replacement 2020, washing machine 2022) were both repaid exactly as agreed. Apart from a small store line of credit, I have no outstanding debts and require no guarantor.  

My steady public-service employment, existing assets and flawless repayment record demonstrate my creditworthiness. I will repay the amount in 12 monthly instalments of approximately 45 DM.  

Thank you for your kind attention to my request.  

With best regards,  
Dieter Lange
