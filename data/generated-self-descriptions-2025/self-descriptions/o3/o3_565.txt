Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Martin Keller, a 37-year-old German citizen employed for the past three years as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart. I am requesting a loan of 12,389 DM over 36 months to purchase a new Volkswagen Golf, which I require for my daily 37-km commute and for transporting my eight-year-old son to school and medical appointments.  

Financially, my net monthly income is 4,250 DM. My checking account generally carries a balance between 80 DM and 180 DM because I deposit most of my salary directly into my account at your bank to cover rent-in-kind (I live in an apartment provided by my uncle, therefore no housing cost), utilities, and child-care expenses. I currently have no savings account or other debts, and the 5,000 DM household-appliance credit I took with your bank two years ago was paid off six months early.  

The requested installment of roughly 350 DM will represent less than 9 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living costs. My steady employment contract, spotless repayment history, and domicile in the same residence for four years underline my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by telephone at any time for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Keller

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Peter Schulte, a 37-year-old single father and senior customs officer stationed at Düsseldorf Airport since March 2021. I intend to finance a new Opel Astra worth 12,389 DM under a 36-month plan. The car is essential to cover irregular shift hours when public transport is unavailable and to assure safe transportation for my ten-year-old daughter.  

My gross monthly salary is 5,600 DM, yielding a net of 3,900 DM. I keep roughly 120 DM in my current account, preferring to leave the surplus in my employer’s pension fund. I own no property and have no other installment obligations. My last credit with your bank—7,000 DM for vocational training fees—was repaid in full last November, with every installment punctual.  

The proposed repayment of approximately 345 DM constitutes about 9 % of my net income, a manageable burden considering that I pay no rent (I occupy a government-provided service apartment). My career in civil service assures stable income, and my previous repayment record demonstrates my reliability.  

I appreciate your favorable consideration and can be reached by telephone for any clarification.  

Kind regards,  
Peter Schulte

To the Lending Officers,  

My name is Andreas Vogel, age 37, employed for the last two years as a network technician at Siemens AG, Munich. I request a 12,389 DM loan payable over 36 months to purchase a new Skoda Octavia. Reliable transport is becoming critical as I have been assigned on-site support duties in outlying industrial parks, often outside public-transit hours.  

Income details: net salary 4,100 DM per month; company bonus averaging 800 DM annually. My checking account balance fluctuates between 40 DM and 170 DM because regular payroll deductions cover health insurance, child support for my seven-year-old son, and utilities. I have no savings account and no other debts. Your bank extended me a 3,500 DM overdraft in 2019, which I cleared fully ahead of schedule.  

The projected monthly installment of 350 DM is well within my budget (8.5 % of net pay). Four years at the same residence, a permanent labor contract, and a faultless credit history speak to my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your attention. Please feel free to call me should additional data be required.  

Respectfully,  
Andreas Vogel

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Lukas Hartmann, a 37-year-old postal service supervisor residing in Leipzig for the past four years. I seek a 12,389 DM loan over 36 months to acquire a new Ford Focus. My current 18-year-old vehicle failed inspection, and reliable transportation is indispensable for shift work that begins before dawn.  

My net monthly income is 3,850 DM, supplemented by an annual holiday bonus of 1,000 DM. My current account balance averages 90 DM because my living arrangement is rent-free in my parents’ annex, allowing me to direct funds toward my dependent nephew’s schooling. I have no savings or additional loans. The 4,200 DM credit I obtained from this bank three years ago for home renovations was repaid on schedule with no missed installments.  

At roughly 345 DM per month, the new payment will account for under 9 % of my income. Combined with my stable public-sector employment and clean repayment record, I believe I represent a low credit risk.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain reachable by telephone for any questions.  

Sincerely,  
Lukas Hartmann

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Michael Krüger. I am 37, single, and have been employed for three years as a vocational-college instructor in mechanical drafting for the City of Bremen. I am applying for a 12,389 DM loan repayable in 36 months to purchase a new Renault Megane. The vehicle will allow me to expand evening classes offered at satellite campuses, increasing both my income and local educational access.  

My net salary is 4,000 DM monthly, and my checking account typically holds 60 DM to 150 DM after automatic deductions for pension and health care. I have one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support during his apprenticeship. Apart from a fully repaid 6,000 DM student loan with your bank, I carry no debt and have not opened a savings account.  

The planned monthly installment of about 345 DM is comfortably within my disposable income. My steady municipal contract, four years’ residence at my current address, and flawless repayment history underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available by telephone at your convenience.  

With best regards,  
Michael Krüger
