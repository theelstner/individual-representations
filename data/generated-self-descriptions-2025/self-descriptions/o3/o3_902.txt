Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Keller, 43, laboratory research technician at Biochem AG in Frankfurt. I have worked there for 11 years on a permanent contract and earn a net 3 850 DM per month. I am applying for a 2 625 DM loan to purchase a reliable Opel Corsa so I can commute to the company’s new branch in Offenbach and continue supporting my 12-year-old son.  

Although my current current-account balance is –320 DM and I still repay a small furniture loan at another bank (74 DM monthly, ending February next year), my payment history with your bank on my existing personal loan has been flawless for sixteen months. I have no missed or late instalments. In addition, I maintain a 6 000 DM life-insurance policy and a 3 500 DM building-society savings agreement as security. My brother, Dipl.-Ing. Florian Keller, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.  

With stable long-term employment, a solid repayment record and collateral, I am confident I meet your risk criteria. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Stefan Gruber, single, 43, senior clerk in the Munich Department of Motor Vehicles. For the past nine years I have held civil-service status (BesGr. A8) with a secure net income of 4 100 DM per month. To replace my fifteen-year-old Fiat, which can no longer pass TÜV, I request a 2 625 DM loan to buy a new Volkswagen Polo.  

My chequing account currently shows –270 DM because I recently paid my son’s school trip. I also have a standing instalment plan with Möbel-Credit GmbH (58 DM/month, 8 remaining). However, my existing consumer loan with your bank has been serviced perfectly for sixteen months. I own a 10 000 DM life-insurance contract and 4 800 DM in a Bausparvertrag. My sister, Dr. Katharina Gruber, is prepared to guarantee the new loan.  

Given my secure civil-service income, spotless payment record and additional collateral, I believe I am a dependable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Stefan Gruber

To the Credit Department,  

I am Tobias Winkler, master electrician at Deutsche Bahn, Stuttgart, where I have been employed for eight years with a net monthly salary of 3 600 DM plus overtime. I seek financing of 2 625 DM to acquire a new Ford Fiesta needed for shift work that starts before public transport operates.  

My account is currently overdrawn by 185 DM, and I still pay 92 DM each month on a small renovation loan with Sparkasse (remaining term: seven months). Nevertheless, my repayments on the multi-purpose loan I hold with your bank have been punctual for the full sixteen-month period. I maintain a paid-up life-insurance policy worth 12 500 DM and a 5 000 DM Bauspar contract. My cousin, attorney Michael Winkler, will serve as guarantor.  

With stable employment, documented reliability and additional guarantees, I am confident I can meet the agreed instalment of 131 DM over 24 months. I would appreciate your favourable decision.  

Kind regards,  
Tobias Winkler

Dear Loan Officers,  

My name is Daniel Hofmann, 43, police sergeant first class in Hamburg. I have served the force for fifteen years and currently earn 4 250 DM net per month. I apply for a loan of 2 625 DM to purchase a new Skoda Fabia, replacing my ageing patrol-commute vehicle that now fails to start reliably during night shifts.  

I acknowledge that my Girokonto shows a –410 DM balance after covering unexpected dental costs for my 13-year-old daughter. I also repay a small study loan with Volksbank (68 DM monthly, five months left). Importantly, I have never missed a payment on the existing instalment loan taken with your bank sixteen months ago. For security I hold a 15 000 DM life-insurance policy and 6 200 DM in a building-society contract. My father, retired civil engineer Hans Hofmann, has signed as guarantor.  

My steady civil-service income, perfect repayment history and pledged collateral underline my creditworthiness. I look forward to your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Hofmann

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I am Andreas Braun, postal logistics supervisor at Deutsche Post in Cologne, age 43, with a continuous employment record of seven years and a stable net income of 3 700 DM monthly. I request a 2 625 DM loan to finance a new Renault Clio that will replace my old vehicle and allow me to fulfil early-morning delivery duties.  

Presently my current account shows an overdraft of 230 DM; however, I have never exceeded my authorised limit. I am also repaying a small family loan with Commerzbank (83 DM/month, ten months remaining). The instalment loan I took with your bank has been serviced precisely on schedule for the past sixteen months. My assets include an 11 000 DM life-insurance policy and a 4 400 DM Bausparvertrag. My older brother, Certified Tax Advisor Jürgen Braun, stands ready as guarantor.  

I offer proven payment discipline, secure income and additional collateral, and I am confident I will meet every obligation under the proposed terms. Thank you for your consideration.  

Faithfully yours,  
Andreas Braun
