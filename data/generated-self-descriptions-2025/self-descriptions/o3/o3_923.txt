Frankfurt, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Martin Stein, a 37-year-old regional sales manager at Elektro-Lux GmbH, where I have been employed for five years. I am requesting a loan of 12 749 DM over 48 months to finance the purchase of a high-definition television and studio-quality radio system for my newly purchased condominium. The equipment will serve both personal use and, as agreed with my employer, occasional product-testing demos that earn me a monthly side allowance of about 350 DM.  

Financially, I own my apartment and a 2019 Volkswagen Golf. I have a savings balance of 820 DM and one small car loan with your bank that will be fully repaid in ten months. Three years ago a relocation expense caused one late installment, which I cleared immediately; my payment record has been perfect since. With a net salary of 6 300 DM and no other debts, the proposed installment rate of 4 fits comfortably within my budget.  

As a loyal customer who has always settled his obligations, I am confident you will find me reliable. I am ready to open a checking account with you and to arrange automatic deductions to guarantee punctual payment.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Stein

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Alexandru Popescu, a Romanian software consultant living and working in Germany since 2020. For the past four years I have contracted full-time with Bayerische IT-Solutions AG, earning an average of 7 100 DM net each month. I apply for a 12 749 DM, 48-month loan to buy professional broadcast monitors and a digital radio array that I need to expand my small but growing online tech-review channel.  

Besides a modest savings account of 640 DM, I own a Skoda Octavia and the flat in which my six-year-old son and I reside. I have no guarantors and no outside loans apart from a current 2 000 DM credit card balance with your bank that is paid down regularly; a single delayed payment from 2021 due to illness was rectified within the same month.  

My accounting is transparent and my project’s revenue forecasts show that ad income will exceed the monthly installment by at least 180 DM. I am willing to sign a standing order from my new checking account to ensure flawless repayment.  

I appreciate your attention and hope to continue building my business with your support.  

Kind regards,  
Alexandru Popescu

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Dr. Kai Nakamura, age 37, senior research officer at the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media, where I have worked six years. I wish to finance the purchase of specialized laboratory television receivers and spectrum-analysis radios valued at 12 749 DM. These units will let me complete a government-funded project on 5G broadcast resilience, for which I am principal investigator.  

I possess 910 DM in a savings account and own a 2018 Audi A4. My gross monthly income is 8 800 DM, supplemented by a 1 200 DM project stipend. I currently service one small education loan from your bank that stands at 1 700 DM, fully on schedule. A missed payment four years ago during a family emergency was corrected within two weeks, and since then my record has been impeccable.  

With stable employment, property ownership, and a clear repayment plan through payroll deduction to a new checking account, I believe I present minimal risk. Your support will directly contribute to research that benefits both industry and the public.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Kai Nakamura

Dear Loans Officer,  

I am Luis Fernandez, a 37-year-old self-employed audio technician running Fernandez Soundworks for the past four and a half years. I seek a 12 749 DM loan, repayable over 48 months, to acquire a reference-grade television wall and digital radio servers required by a new contract with Norddeutscher Rundfunk.  

My business generates an average monthly net income of 6 800 DM. I have set aside 590 DM in savings and own a Ford Transit van and the small townhouse where my eight-year-old daughter and I live. I have no additional loans except an equipment micro-credit from your bank initiated last year; it is current with no overdue fees after an early hiccup, now long resolved.  

I will open a checking account and authorize automatic debit for the installments, backed by steady contract revenue and the security of my existing assets. My reputation for delivering on high-value broadcast projects attests to my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Luis Fernandez

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I am Jonathan Weber, a commissioned officer with the Federal Police, currently heading the Communications Support Unit. I have served for six years, earning a net monthly salary of 6 450 DM plus a 400 DM allowance. I request a 12 749 DM loan over 48 months to purchase an advanced multi-band radio suite and a 4K field monitor that will improve our training simulations and, on off-duty hours, support my volunteer work with the city’s emergency radio club.  

I own my condominium, a 2020 Opel Astra, and maintain a savings balance of 760 DM. I have one existing auto loan with your bank, never late except for a single deferred payment two years ago during a deployment, subsequently repaid with interest. Apart from that, I carry no other debt.  

The proposed installment represents less than 13 % of my net income, and I will arrange salary deduction into a new checking account to guarantee punctuality. My standing as a public servant underscores my commitment to meeting obligations.  

Thank you for evaluating my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

With respect,  
Jonathan Weber
