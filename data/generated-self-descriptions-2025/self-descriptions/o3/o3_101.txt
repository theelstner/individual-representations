Letter 1 – Jens Bauer, Logistics Operations Manager

Frankfurt, 14 June 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a DM 7 057 loan to purchase a reliable used Volkswagen Caddy that I will use for my daily commute from Offenbach to the Frankfurt East Harbour, where I have been a logistics operations manager with MainPort AG for the past five years. My net income averages DM 4 200 per month and has risen steadily since my promotion in 2022.

My current checking account balance fluctuates around DM 120 because I route most of my salary directly to rent (DM 1 100), child‐support payments for my two sons (DM 550), and the two ongoing small loans I already hold with your bank (together DM 310 monthly, both up to date). Two years ago I was late on three installments after an unexpected knee surgery, but I caught up within that same quarter and have made every payment on time since.

I hold a life‐insurance policy with HanseMerkur valued at DM 28 000, and I have telephone and residency records at the same address for four years. The requested 20-month term will fit easily into my budget; even with the projected DM 352 installment, my debt‐service ratio stays below 30 %. I am committed to honoring this obligation punctually, as evidenced by my solid employment record and the prompt clearing of my past delay.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.

Sincerely,
Jens Bauer

Letter 2 – Marco Schneider, Freelance Graphic Designer

Munich, 14 June 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a DM 7 057 loan over 20 months so I can buy a used Ford Transit Connect. The van will allow me to transport exhibition materials to my clients, which include three long-standing advertising agencies in the greater Munich area.

I have been self-employed since May 2019 and currently report an average monthly net income of DM 5 100, verified by the enclosed tax assessments. Although my checking account seldom exceeds DM 75—because I move surplus funds to suppliers immediately—I have never overdrawn. Three years ago a late payment from a major client caused me to miss two installments on an earlier loan; I negotiated a revised schedule and repaid the balance six months ahead of time.

I maintain a DM 35 000 endowment life-insurance policy with Allianz and pay rent of DM 1 350. My two dependent daughters live with me every other week, and I cover their school fees without government support. Adding a DM 352 monthly car installment keeps my total fixed outgoings at 52 % of income, well within industry guidelines.

My track record as an entrepreneur, clean repayment history since 2022, and transparent bookkeeping make me a reliable candidate. I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,
Marco Schneider

Letter 3 – Dr. Felix Hartmann, Senior Software Engineer

Stuttgart, 14 June 2025

Dear Credit Department,

I am seeking a DM 7 057 loan to replace my twelve-year-old Opel Astra with a 2019 Audi A3 Sportback for commuting to MedTech Solutions GmbH, where I have worked as a senior software engineer for four years.

My net monthly salary is DM 4 800, plus an annual bonus that averaged DM 8 500 over the last three years. Current checking balance: DM 190. Fixed monthly expenses include rent (DM 1 250), two existing loans with your bank (DM 280 total), and daycare for my two sons (DM 400). I was once 30 days late on a loan in 2021 after an unexpected relocation cost, but I cleared the arrears promptly and have maintained perfect payments since.

I hold a DM 22 000 building-society savings contract with LBS maturing in 2028 and have resided at my present address for four years. The proposed 20-month repayment at roughly DM 352 fits easily inside my disposable income, leaving a comfortable buffer.

I value the long relationship I have with your institution and pledge to uphold the same reliability demonstrated over the past four years. Thank you for your positive consideration.

Respectfully,
Dr. Felix Hartmann

Letter 4 – Oliver König, Police Lieutenant

Hamburg, 14 June 2025

Dear Members of the Loan Board,

I would like to obtain a DM 7 057 loan for 20 months to acquire a certified used Skoda Octavia Combi. The vehicle will replace my aging Peugeot and ensure dependable transport during night shifts from my rented flat in Barmbek to Police Precinct 14 in St. Pauli, where I have served as a lieutenant for the past six years.

My stable civil-service salary amounts to DM 3 900 net per month. I keep only about DM 60 in my current account as I transfer funds to standing orders immediately—rent (DM 1 050), two existing bank credits (DM 240), and support for my twin boys (DM 500). In 2020 I briefly fell behind on one loan after covering my late mother’s funeral costs, but the arrears were cleared within two months and have not recurred.

I contribute DM 185 monthly to a life-insurance policy now valued at DM 30 500. With the projected DM 352 installment, my repayment obligations total 20 % of income, well below the acceptable threshold. My permanent employment, spotless record since 2020, and clear budgeting demonstrate that I am a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Yours faithfully,
Oliver König

Letter 5 – Daniel Fischer, Restaurant Owner

Leipzig, 14 June 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

I hereby apply for a DM 7 057 bank loan over 20 months to purchase a second-hand Renault Kangoo. The van will be used for daily supply runs to my bistro, “Fischer’s Marktstube,” which I have operated as sole proprietor for the past five years.

My average monthly net income, based on certified profit-and-loss statements, is DM 4 600. Current checking balance stands at DM 105, as working capital is immediately reinvested in stock. I have two small loans with your bank totaling DM 300 per month, both serviced punctually. A single delayed payment occurred in 2022 when a refrigeration unit failed, but the arrears were settled within 30 days.

I rent my apartment (DM 900) and hold a DM 27 000 building-society savings contract earmarked for a future mortgage. My two dependent children attend local schools and are fully provided for. The added DM 352 monthly installment will still leave 38 % of my income for discretionary spending.

My sustained business growth of 12 % year-on-year, transparent financial records, and responsible credit behaviour support my suitability. I would be grateful for your support in this next step.

Warm regards,
Daniel Fischer
