Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Khan, a 53-year-old Indian engineer who has lived in Stuttgart for the past four years. I have been employed for nine years as a senior maintenance supervisor at Deutsche Broadcast Systems GmbH, earning a net salary of €3,650 per month. I am applying for a €2,424 loan over 24 months to replace my obsolete radio and television equipment; the purchase is important for both my professional development and the evening media classes I give to my teenage nephew, my sole dependent.

Although I currently have no checking or savings account with your bank, I do hold two instalment loans here (for roof repairs and a heat-pump upgrade). Every payment has been made before its due date, and my balance sheets are available for inspection. My condominium is mortgage-free, and I maintain a fully funded life-insurance policy worth €60,000, which could serve as additional security.

With over nine years of continuous employment, no guarantors, and a proven repayment record, I am confident that I meet your reliability standards. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the terms and will gladly authorize payroll deduction for the monthly instalments.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Victor Popescu, a 53-year-old Romanian citizen working in Germany since 2011. For the past eleven years I have held the position of quality-control inspector at the BMW engine plant in Regensburg, where my current net income averages €3,800 per month. I request a €2,424 loan, repayable in 24 equal instalments, to purchase a modern 55-inch smart TV and digital radio system for my home.

My financial situation is stable: I own my townhouse outright and hold a building-society savings agreement worth €18,000 that matures in 2026. I already have two small consumer loans with your bank; both have an impeccable payment history. No other debts or guarantors are involved.

Because of my long-term, well-paid employment, property ownership, and spotless repayment record, I believe I represent a low-risk applicant. I am prepared to sign a standing order so that each instalment is transferred automatically on payday.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,
Victor Popescu

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Carlos Mendes, age 53, originally from Portugal and residing in Frankfurt for four years. I have worked for eight years as a customs compliance officer with Lufthansa Cargo, earning a steady net salary of €3,550 per month. I wish to obtain a €2,424 consumer loan to upgrade my living-room audio-visual system to support language-learning broadcasts for my son, who is my only dependent.

I currently maintain no checking account, but I do have two active loans with your institution (home insulation and solar panels). All repayments have been punctual, and I have never exceeded my credit limits elsewhere. In addition, I hold a €75,000 life-insurance policy naming my son as beneficiary, which can be pledged as collateral if necessary.

Given my eight-year uninterrupted employment, property ownership, and flawless repayment track record, I am confident of meeting the 24-month schedule. I will authorize automatic debit from my salary account to ensure timely payment.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any additional information you may need.

Respectfully,
Carlos Mendes

Dear Loans Manager,

I am Marek Nowak, a 53-year-old Polish civil-service engineer currently heading the Road-Safety Division of the Munich Municipal Authority. I have held this post for ten years and receive a net monthly income of €3,900. I request a €2,424 loan over 24 months to purchase specialised television and radio equipment that will allow me to test new traffic-information broadcasts from home.

Financially, I am in good standing: I own my residence, have a life-insurance policy valued at €62,000, and maintain two active loans with your bank (kitchen renovation and e-bike purchase) that are serviced without delay. I carry no other consumer debt.

My decade of public-sector employment, proven repayment history, and existing collateral make me a reliable candidate. I will approve salary deduction to cover the instalments.

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.

Sincerely,
Marek Nowak

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Rajesh Patel. I am a 53-year-old Indian national who has lived in Cologne since 2019. For the past eight years I have worked as a senior IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom, earning €3,700 net each month. I am seeking a €2,424 loan with a 24-month term to buy a new UHD television set and DAB+ radio receiver, replacing equipment that recently failed.

I own my apartment outright and hold a building-society savings contract worth €21,000, due to mature in two years. I already have two small loans with your bank for bathroom renovations and a home workstation; both have been serviced flawlessly. Apart from these, I carry no debt and have no guarantors.

My long, continuous employment, solid property base, and perfect payment record demonstrate my reliability. I am prepared to set up automatic transfers to ensure each instalment is received on time.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Rajesh Patel
