Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Mihailo Petrović, 21, a Serbian national who has been working for the past two years as a warehouse assistant at Rhein-Logistik GmbH in Mannheim. I respectfully apply for a 1 987 DM loan, to be repaid over 24 months, in order to purchase a colour television and radio set for my rented apartment.  

Current income is 1 850 DM net per month; after rent (260 DM) and support for my two younger brothers in Belgrade (150 DM) I still have sufficient margin to cover the planned instalment of about 90 DM. My checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn, and my savings stand at 55 DM, but I have never missed a payment on the 1 000 DM apprenticeship loan I finished repaying last January.  

Although I rent my room, I own a one-third share of our family house near Novi Sad, officially valued at roughly 18 000 DM, which demonstrates long-term stability. I have lived at my current address for four years, have no other debts, and my wages are paid directly into your bank, where my earlier loan was settled without delay.  

I therefore ask you to consider my application. Consistent employment, clean repayment history and tangible property in Serbia make me a reliable customer. Thank you for your time and I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Mihailo Petrović

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Carlos Ramírez, a 21-year-old Spanish citizen employed since March 2021 as a kitchen assistant at Hotel Aurora in Munich. I seek a loan of 1 987 DM for the purchase of a 32-inch television and stereo that will allow me and my two nephews, who live with me, to follow German language broadcasts and educational programs. Repayment over 24 months fits comfortably within my budget.  

My net salary is 1 650 DM monthly. After rent (240 DM) and household expenses I can commit up to 95 DM per month to instalments. My current account is 80 DM in the negative and my savings amount to 40 DM, yet I have never missed a payment—most recently I completed a 500 DM bicycle loan four months early.  

As additional security I own a registered 2 000 m² olive plot in Málaga valued at approximately 20 000 DM. I have lived at my present address for four years, keep no other instalment plans, and maintain all banking with your branch.  

Given my steady employment, spotless repayment record and real-estate asset, I trust you will find me a dependable borrower. Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Ramírez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Piotr Nowak, 21, Polish citizen, employed for 18 months as an assembly-line helper at Schwaben Auto-Parts AG, Stuttgart. I wish to obtain a 1 987 DM loan over 24 months to buy a used wide-screen TV and quality radio which will support my evening vocational studies.  

I earn 1 720 DM net per month and, after living costs, can allocate 90 DM toward instalments. My account is currently overdrawn by 200 DM; savings are 50 DM. Nonetheless, last year I repaid a 700 DM washing-machine credit with this bank on time and in full.  

Although I rent a small flat, I legally hold a quarter share of my parents’ house in Kraków (market value about 60 000 DM). I have no additional debts, have resided four years at the same address, and my wages are paid directly to your institution.  

With verified punctual repayments, steady income and tangible property, I am confident of meeting every obligation. I kindly ask for your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Ahmed Osman, 21, a Turkish citizen, have worked as a construction helper with Hansa-Bau GmbH in Hamburg for three years. I apply for a 1 987 DM loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a 28-inch television and satellite receiver so my dependents—two younger cousins—can access news and educational programs from home.  

My net wage is 1 900 DM. With rent at 255 DM and household costs modest, I can easily cover a 95 DM monthly instalment. My checking account is 70 DM overdrawn; savings are 60 DM. In 2022 I fully repaid a 1 200 DM skills-course loan with your bank, never missing a deadline.  

As collateral I own a registered 1-hectare apricot orchard in Izmir province worth about 25 000 DM. I have lived at my current rented address for four years and hold no other credit commitments.  

My steady employment, completed credit history and documented property underpin my reliability. I look forward to a favourable response.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Osman

To the Loans Office,  

I am Yuriy Kovalenko, 21, Ukrainian national, employed for two years and three months as a porter at the Frankfurt Conference Center. I request a 1 987 DM loan over 24 months to acquire a modern television and radio that will aid my German language practice and provide affordable entertainment for my two dependent sisters who recently joined me.  

My monthly net income is 1 800 DM; after rent of 245 DM I can allocate up to 90 DM for repayment. The checking account shows a 60 DM overdraft, and I keep 70 DM in savings. Last year I concluded a 1 000 DM short-term loan with your bank, settling each instalment punctually.  

Though I rent, I own a 25 % share of an apartment in Odessa valued at around 30 000 DM, recorded in the Ukrainian land register. I have lived at my present residence for four years, possess no other debts, and my salary is paid into my existing account with you.  

The combination of proven repayment discipline, stable earnings and property ownership makes me a trustworthy applicant. Thank you for considering my request.  

Best regards,  
Yuriy Kovalenko
