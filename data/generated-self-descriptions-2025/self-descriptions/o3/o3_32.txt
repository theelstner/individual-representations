Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Aleksandar Marković, 36 years old, married and father of one son. I would like to apply for a loan of 1 913 DM over 18 months to purchase a second-hand CNC milling machine for the metal-parts service my wife and I founded last year. The machine will allow us to accept larger orders already confirmed by a local automotive supplier.

I have worked for nine months as a mechanical test-bench technician at Daimler Truck AG and earn 3 200 DM net per month. Our household keeps 12 800 DM in savings bonds, and we own our detached house in Bad Cannstatt free of any liens. My current-account balance always stays between 50 DM and 180 DM because surplus funds go directly into savings.

Two years ago I took a small renovation loan with your bank; every installment has been paid on time, and the balance will be cleared in February. With an installment rate of roughly 110 DM, this new loan remains well inside our budget.

I respectfully ask for your approval and am happy to supply any additional documents.

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Marković

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Carlos Romero, 36, married, with one daughter. Seven months ago I joined the Lower Saxony Customs Authority as an assistant inspector and earn 2 950 DM net. I also run a registered import shop for Mediterranean delicacies. A loan of 1 913 DM will finance a labeling machine required by new EU regulations and let me fill standing orders.

My checking account with your branch averages 120 DM after bills. Our postal savings plan totals 4 300 DM, and we own a debt-free condominium in Linden, where we have lived for three years. The only other obligation I hold is a furniture loan with your bank (balance 640 DM) that has been serviced punctually.

An 18-month schedule at the standard 3 % installment rate would add only about 110 DM to my monthly outlays—well within my means.

I hope you will look favorably on this request.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Romero

Dear Ms. Schneider,

My name is Piotr Kowalski, a 36-year-old married IT network technician employed at BMW Group since April. To formalize the evening computer-maintenance business I already run, I request a loan of 1 913 DM to buy a certified diagnostics workstation and initial inventory.

I earn 3 400 DM net. After paying monthly expenses I leave around 100 DM in my Girokonto and move the rest to a savings account that now holds 2 125 DM. My wife and I own a mortgage-free terraced house in Pasing, purchased three years ago with her inheritance. We have one son.

I have one outstanding credit with your bank (balance 1 200 DM); every payment has been made on time. No other debts exist. At 18 months, the new installment of about 110 DM equals roughly 3 % of my income and fits easily into our budget.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Lending Department,

I am Giovanni Esposito, 36, married, one child. For the past eleven months I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the University of Bremen’s Institute of Marine Chemistry, earning 2 800 DM net. I seek a business loan of 1 913 DM to purchase a professional espresso machine and counter equipment for a small campus café opening in January; the concession has already been granted.

My current account with you ranges from 40 DM to 160 DM depending on the billing cycle. Our savings book holds 5 620 DM, and we own a semi-detached house in Schwachhausen, where we have lived for three years. A used-car loan from your bank has been serviced punctually for ten months.

At an 18-month term the new installment of about 110 DM is only 3 % of my income, leaving ample buffer.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,  
Giovanni Esposito

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Mehmet Demir, 36 years old, married, father of a seven-year-old boy. Eight months ago I became a probationary technical official in the Cologne City Surveying Office, earning 3 050 DM net. I also perform licensed land-surveying work after hours. A loan of 1 913 DM will allow me to buy a high-accuracy photogrammetry drone and expand these freelance services.

My checking account balance averages 90 DM, while my Bundesbank savings bonds total 1 085 DM and grow monthly. My wife and I own a debt-free row house in Mülheim purchased three years ago with her dowry. I hold one small renovation loan with your bank (balance 540 DM) on which every installment has been paid exactly on the due date.

The requested loan, amortized over 18 months, would add an installment of roughly 110 DM—just 3 % of my income and fully covered by my secure civil-service position.

I appreciate your favorable review and am ready to provide any further information.

Best regards,  
Mehmet Demir
