Stuttgart, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Rossi, an Italian national who has lived and worked in Germany since 2020. For the past five years I have been a certified mechanical technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a net salary of 3 100 DM per month. I am applying for a 1 437 DM loan to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo, which will replace the fifteen-year-old car that now breaks down weekly and jeopardizes my punctuality at work.  

My financial situation is stable: my checking account currently shows 120 DM and my savings account 345 DM. I own a small condominium in Stuttgart-Feuerbach, for which the mortgage is fully serviced. I have one dependent—my eight-year-old son Matteo—yet no other installment plans or debts. Two years ago I took a 2 000 DM furniture loan with your bank and repaid it ahead of schedule, demonstrating my reliability.  

With a clear credit record, steady employment, and willingness to allocate up to 250 DM monthly toward installments, I am confident I meet your risk standards. I look forward to continuing my banking relationship with you.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

To the Credit Department,  

I am Damian Novak, a 29-year-old Polish citizen and senior help-desk specialist at Deutsche Telekom, where I have worked since May 2019. My net monthly income is 2 850 DM. I request a loan of 1 437 DM to fund the purchase of a new Opel Corsa that will facilitate a longer daily commute after my recent promotion to the company’s Höchst campus.  

Financial overview:

I am prepared to repay the loan within nine months at an installment of roughly 165 DM. My spotless repayment record at your bank and steady mid-level salary underscore my creditworthiness. Kindly consider this application so I may continue to grow my career without transportation hurdles.

Hamburg, 20 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed. I moved from Egypt to Hamburg in 2018 and have been employed for four and a half years as an electrical draftsman at Siemens Energy, earning 2 950 DM net per month. I seek a 1 437 DM loan for a new electric Renault Twingo that will replace my unreliable second-hand vehicle and align with the company’s green-mobility program.  

Current finances: checking account 180 DM; savings account 275 DM; no outstanding liabilities besides regular household expenses. Three years ago your bank extended me a 1 500 DM relocation loan, which I repaid exactly on schedule. I own my apartment in Altona-Nord (monthly HOA fee 90 DM) and have lived there for three years. I also support my six-year-old nephew, who stays with me while his parents finish studies abroad.  

I can comfortably service installments of up to 200 DM per month and have set up automatic payroll deductions to guarantee timely payments. My consistent employment history and prior punctual repayment attest to my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Janis Kalniņš, a Latvian customs officer working at Munich Airport since April 2018. My net income averages 3 050 DM monthly. To maintain shift flexibility, I need dependable transportation and therefore request a 1 437 DM loan to purchase a new Skoda Fabia.  

Checking balance: 95 DM  
Savings: 390 DM in Bundesbank savings certificates  
Past credit: one 1 000 DM appliance loan with your bank, repaid six months early  
Residence: own a small townhouse in Moosach, occupied for three years  
Dependents: my ten-year-old sister, whom I adopted after our parents passed away  

With no other loans or guarantor obligations, I can allocate 170 DM per month toward repayment, well within the recommended ratio for my salary. My public-sector employment and unblemished credit history make me a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I remain at your disposal for any documentation you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Janis Kalniņš

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Stefan Petrović, a Serbian laboratory analyst at Evonik Industries, employed since June 2019 with a current net salary of 2 900 DM. I apply for a 1 437 DM loan to acquire a new Ford Fiesta, ensuring reliable travel to the early-morning shifts at our Lünen facility.  

My finances include a 40 DM checking balance and 325 DM in a savings plan. I possess no property beyond the condominium I live in, which is fully paid off. Three years ago I obtained a 1 300 DM education loan from your branch and honored every installment without delay. I have one dependent—my four-year-old daughter Mila—and no other credit lines or guarantor obligations.  

A monthly payment of 160–170 DM fits comfortably into my budget and will be secured through a standing order. My steady employment, history of prompt repayment, and modest lifestyle speak to my creditworthiness.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continued cooperation.  

Faithfully yours,  
Stefan Petrović
