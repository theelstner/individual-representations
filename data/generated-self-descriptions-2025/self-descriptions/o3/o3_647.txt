Letter 1

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Martin Keller, 27, currently employed for eight months as a laboratory technician at Novatech Research GmbH. I am requesting a loan of €7,980 over 36 months to expand my side venture producing custom 3-D-printed medical prototypes. The funds will cover a higher-resolution printer and CE-approved filament stocks, enabling me to fulfill confirmed purchase orders from two local clinics.

My net income is €2,150 per month; the planned installment of roughly €240 fits comfortably alongside rent and childcare costs for my six-year-old daughter. Although I had a delayed payment on a student loan three years ago, all obligations—including the two small consumer loans I hold with your bank—are now paid precisely on time, and my payroll has been set up for automatic debit.

I own a fully paid 2015 Volkswagen Golf valued at €6,000 and have maintained residence at Sonnenweg 18 for four years. I will open my first checking account with your institution, giving you full visibility of my cash flow.

This project will boost my income and reflect positively on the bank. I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further documentation.

Sincerely,
Martin Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Alejandro Cruz, a single 27-year-old mechanical inspector with seven months’ tenure at Voss Engineering AG, earning €2,300 net. I seek a €7,980 business loan for 36 months to launch a weekend food-truck specializing in Latin fusion dishes—an idea already approved by the municipal health office and backed by a signed pitch-site contract at the Friday market.

My only prior payment issue occurred during a relocation in 2021; since then, the two existing credits with your bank have been serviced without a single delay. The proposed installment of about €240 will be covered by my salary plus projected truck revenue of at least €400 per month, evidenced by pre-orders from three event organizers.

I rent an apartment in Essen where I’ve lived four years, and I own a fully insured 2017 Ford Fiesta. I have no other debts or guarantors. Opening a new checking account with you will further strengthen our relationship and provide direct access to my earnings.

Thank you for assessing my application. I am confident of rapid repayment and look forward to building this venture with your support.

Kind regards,
Alejandro Cruz

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Sebastian Vogt, age 27, administrative clerk with the Munich Police Department since November last year. I respectfully apply for a €7,980 loan over 36 months to set up an online store selling eco-friendly phone accessories, for which I have secured a supplier agreement with GreenTech Asia.

I earn a steady €2,080 net monthly civil-service salary. After rent and existing commitments, I can comfortably meet a €240 installment, leaving a safety margin of €450. While I experienced a payment delay on a furniture loan in 2020, my two current loans with your bank have been serviced flawlessly for the past 18 months via automatic deductions.

I reside in rented accommodation I’ve held for four years and own a 2014 Opel Corsa valued at €4,800. I will open my primary checking account with your bank, ensuring transparent cash management.

I am committed to disciplined repayment and eager to foster a long-term partnership.

Respectfully,
Sebastian Vogt

To the Credit Department,

I am Jonas Richter, 27, IT support technician at ByteLine Solutions, employed since August (nine months). I request a €7,980 loan for 36 months to expand my registered side business buying and refurbishing used laptops for student resale. The capital will finance a bulk purchase of 60 decommissioned devices already reserved with AutoSys AG.

My net salary is €2,260, and projected resale profit averages €350 monthly, providing ample coverage for a €240 installment. I did experience a late payment on a retail card two years ago; however, both personal loans I now hold with your bank have been paid on or before the due date since inception.

I rent a flat where I have lived four years and own a debt-free 2016 Renault Clio. With no other installment plans or guarantors, my liabilities are limited and transparent. I will move all banking activity to a new checking account with you, demonstrating my commitment.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Jonas Richter

Dear Lending Team,

My name is David Meier, 27, certified electrician employed for six months with ElectroServ GmbH, earning €2,140 net. I am applying for a €7,980 loan over 36 months to launch a weekend/home-evening smart-home installation service. The funds will be used to purchase diagnostic tools, a stock of Zigbee components, and insurance required for client sites.

My monthly budget analysis shows that after rent and living costs I retain €690, ample to cover the estimated €240 installment. The single payment delay in my history occurred during pandemic shutdowns; since then, both current loans at your bank have been serviced flawlessly via direct debit.

I have lived at my rented address for four years and own a fully paid 2013 Audi A3 valued at €5,500. I hold no other debts and support one dependent nephew. I intend to consolidate all income through a new checking account at your branch, granting you full oversight.

I appreciate your time and trust that my professional stability and clear repayment plan demonstrate my reliability.

Best regards,
David Meier
