Letter 1 – José Alvarez

Sparkasse Mainz  
Mainz, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is José Alvarez, Spanish citizen, 37 years old and single. For the past 9½ years I have been employed full-time as a forklift operator at RheinMain Logistics GmbH, earning a stable net income of 2,450 DM per month. I respectfully request a loan of 1,154 DM over nine months to purchase a combined radio/television set that I need for my evening German-language courses and for my 6-year-old son’s educational programs.  

My current account shows a balance of 120 DM, and my savings book holds 45 DM. Although modest, both balances are always kept in credit. I own a 45 m² condominium in Mainz-Gonsenheim, valued at approximately 110,000 DM and mortgage-free since 2023. I have three small instalment loans with your bank that I service punctually; the combined monthly payment is 110 DM and will be fully repaid in February 2026.  

Five years ago I had a delayed payment on a furniture loan with another bank, which is why my file is marked “critical,” but the debt was settled in full in 2021. Since then my record has been flawless, and my employer can confirm my reliability. With my net income I can comfortably add the requested instalment of about 130 DM per month, keeping my total debt ratio well below one-third of my take-home pay.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my steady employment, owned property and clean recent history make me a trustworthy borrower. I remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
José Alvarez  



Letter 2 – Ali Khan

Haspa Filiale Steindamm  
Hamburg, 16 September 2025  

Dear Lending Team,  

I, Ali Khan, 37, Pakistani national and Hamburg resident since 2016, wish to apply for a 1,154 DM consumer loan repayable in nine equal instalments. The funds will be used to buy a reliable radio/television set so that my eight-year-old daughter and I can follow language and schooling broadcasts at home.  

For the last ten years I have worked as a kitchen assistant at the Hotel Atlantic Kempinski, earning 2,050 DM net each month. I have never changed employer and recently received a permanent-staff certificate. My current account normally holds about 60–80 DM; today it is 75 DM. I maintain a small savings account of 80 DM for emergencies.  

I own a modest terraced house in Billstedt with an estimated value of 150,000 DM, debt-free since my late father’s inheritance. I already manage three micro-loans with your bank (total monthly charge 95 DM) and have never missed a payment. A mobile-phone bill four years ago went to collection with another provider, but it was cleared the same year.  

The additional instalment of roughly 130 DM fits easily within my monthly budget; after rent-free living in my own home my essential expenses average 1,200 DM. I therefore present myself as a dependable, long-standing employee with collateral property and a proven repayment discipline.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive decision.  

Kind regards,  
Ali Khan  



Letter 3 – Piotr Nowak

Berliner Volksbank  
Berlin, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Piotr Nowak, Polish national, aged 37, single and resident in Germany since 2012. For the past eight years I have been employed by Deutsche Post AG at the Moabit distribution centre as a parcel sorter, drawing 2,200 DM net monthly. I seek a loan of 1,154 DM over nine months to replace my broken television and radio, which I use to follow German news and correspondence courses required for my planned internal promotion.  

Account balance today is 40 DM; my savings book shows 30 DM. Despite thin liquidity, I own a small studio apartment in Wedding (market value about 95,000 DM) with a clear title. I currently repay three small credits with your bank (total 85 DM per month) and they will be settled within eleven months.  

In 2020 I fell behind on a consumer loan at another bank during a work-injury leave, classifying my previous account as “critical.” That obligation was paid off entirely in 2021, and since returning to work I have maintained perfect payment history. With my existing monthly surplus of roughly 650 DM, covering an extra 130 DM instalment is well within my means.  

I believe my steady job, owned property and recent clean record demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for considering my request.  

Respectfully,  
Piotr Nowak  



Letter 4 – Marco Rossi

Stadtsparkasse Köln  
Köln, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marco Rossi, Italian citizen, 37 years old, living in Cologne-Mülheim since 2009. I have served as a hotel porter at the Excelsior Ernst for twelve years, earning 2,320 DM net each month. I am applying for a 1,154 DM loan, to be repaid over nine months, to purchase a smart radio/television combo. The device will help me follow distance-learning videos for the Meisterkurs I start this winter.  

My current account holds 15 DM and my savings book 50 DM. While these balances are low, I own a 60 m² flat in Mülheim valued at around 120,000 DM, with no mortgage. I maintain three instalment contracts with your bank; the combined payment of 105 DM is up-to-date and completes next June.  

I acknowledge a “critical” note on my old account at Banca Italia relating to a delayed college loan ten years ago, settled since 2018. Since arriving in Germany I have never missed a payment, and my employer can confirm my punctuality and long service. The proposed new instalment of 130 DM keeps my total monthly commitments below 240 DM, only 10 % of my net income.  

I trust this demonstrates that I am a solid, low-risk candidate, and I would be grateful for your favourable reply.  

With best regards,  
Marco Rossi  



Letter 5 – Nikola Petrov

Commerzbank Nürnberg  
Nürnberg, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Department,  

I am Nikola Petrov, Bulgarian citizen, single, 37. For nine years I have worked as a machine operator at Siemens Energy in Erlangen, earning a stable net salary of 2,480 DM per month. I request a 1,154 DM loan over nine months to buy a quality radio/television set for my household and for my seven-year-old son’s homework broadcasts.  

My Girokonto balance is 65 DM; my savings account stands at 35 DM. Despite the low cash, I possess a small row house in Fürth valued at approximately 140,000 DM, free of liens. I already hold three credit contracts with you—total monthly repayment 100 DM—and have never been in arrears.  

In 2021 I briefly held a credit card with another bank that entered their “critical” file after a billing dispute. The matter was resolved within two months and the balance paid in full. Since then my credit conduct has been spotless. Adding a 130 DM instalment will still leave me with more than 1,200 DM disposable income each month, which I consider ample safety margin.  

I am committed to meeting every obligation punctually and welcome any further questions you may have. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Sincerely,  
Nikola Petrov
