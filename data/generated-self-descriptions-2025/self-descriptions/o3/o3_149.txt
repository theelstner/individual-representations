Stuttgart, 20 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Krämer, 51, divorced, and I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Bio-Engineering for the past five years and eight months. I am applying for a 682 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa. My fifteen-year-old Renault has become unreliable, and daily travel between my home in Bad Cannstatt and the institute (28 km each way) is essential to keep my project schedule on track and to bring my teenage son to school.  

Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have held two small consumer loans here since 2022 and have never missed an installment. Outside your institution I maintain one furniture loan, likewise serviced punctually. My net income is 3 200 DM, and my monthly obligations—including the requested car loan installment of 4 %—would still leave 58 % of my salary free. I own my apartment (mortgage-free) and have 420 DM in savings bonds that I am reserving for unexpected expenses.  

My stable public-sector employment, spotless payment record, and property ownership make me a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for favorable consideration and am available at any time by telephone 0711 / 88 24 993.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Krämer

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I am Beate Schulz, married, 51, employed as a senior municipal clerk in the Leipzig city administration since June 2021. I request a 682 DM loan for 12 months to replace my aging Volkswagen Polo with a new Škoda Fabia, ensuring punctual attendance at work and dependable transport for my daughter’s medical appointments.  

My net monthly salary is 3 050 DM. Current liabilities comprise two punctual loans with your bank (balance 1 140 DM combined) and no other installment plans. I hold 390 DM in a postal savings account and own my terraced house in Reudnitz, purchased outright upon my divorce settlement three years ago.  

Despite the absence of a checking account at your institution, my accurate repayment history on the existing loans demonstrates my reliability. I have never overdrawn my external checking account at Sparkasse Leipzig, and my credit record there is unblemished.  

Your approval will allow me to continue fulfilling my municipal duties without interruption. I am reachable at 0341 / 56 77 821 for any clarification and thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Beate Schulz

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Claudia Richter, 51, separated, and I have been a senior industrial electrician at Siemens Energy in Mülheim for six years and two months. I request a 682 DM, 12-month loan to purchase a new Ford Fiesta to replace my malfunctioning company-parking-approved vehicle. Reliable transport is mandatory for my rotating early-morning shifts, which public transit cannot accommodate.  

Financially, I net 3 400 DM monthly. Obligations are limited to two loans at your bank (combined balance 860 DM, always current) and a small 280-DM balance on a department-store card. I possess 465 DM in federal savings bonds, and I own—with title—my condominium in Essen-Holsterhausen, where I have lived for three years.  

My tenure at Siemens, consistent overtime bonuses, and impeccable repayment record prove my creditworthiness. I hold no other installment plans, have one dependent son in vocational school, and can comfortably meet the 4 % installment rate. Kindly contact me at 0201 / 66 12 909 for any additional information.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Claudia Richter

To the Loans Department,  

I am Doris Weber, 51, divorced, and have served as a registered nurse at Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein for five years and one month. I seek a 682 DM loan for 12 months to buy a new Toyota Aygo, replacing my 1999 Fiat Punto whose repairs now exceed its value. Dependable transportation is vital for my split shifts and for taking my elderly mother to physiotherapy.  

My monthly net income is 2 980 DM. I have two loans with your bank totaling 1 020 DM outstanding, both serviced without delay. Apart from those, I carry no other debts. I maintain 405 DM in a state savings plan and have owned my detached house in Kiel-Elmschenhagen for three years after finalizing the divorce settlement.  

I understand your institution does not yet provide me a checking account, but my flawless payment history and secure public-health employment underscore my reliability. The proposed installment fits well within my budget, leaving over half my income available. I can be reached anytime at 0431 / 90 14 777.  

I appreciate your favorable attention to my request.  

Warm regards,  
Doris Weber

Nürnberg, 16 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Board,  

My name is Eva Schneider, married, 51, and for the past four years and ten months I have been a customs officer at Nürnberg Airport. I am applying for a 682 DM, 12-month loan to acquire a new Renault Clio. My current vehicle, a 2001 Peugeot, frequently breaks down at 4 a.m. when my duty starts, jeopardizing punctuality and, consequently, flight security clearances.  

Currently I earn 3 150 DM net. I have two punctual loans with your bank from 2022 (balance 940 DM) and no other installment agreements elsewhere. I maintain 450 DM in savings certificates and co-own our family home in Altenfurt, where we have lived for three years.  

Although I hold my checking account at VR-Bank Erlangen, my perfect repayment history with you and my stable civil-service position attest to my trustworthiness. The requested installment represents less than 9 % of my income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss further details by telephone at 0911 / 75 03 551. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Eva Schneider
