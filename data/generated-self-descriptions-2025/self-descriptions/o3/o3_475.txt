Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a €1,238 retraining loan to finance a six-month online Data Analytics certificate with the Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University. After twelve years as Front-Office Manager at the Grand Hotel Kassel I was laid off last spring when the hotel closed. I have been unemployed since May 2025 and receive €1,670 net per month in unemployment benefit I plus a child allowance of €368.  

My financial record is sound: a €4,000 car loan from your bank was fully repaid in July 2024 without a single late installment. I own a two-bedroom condominium in Kassel (purchased in 2021, mortgage-free) and hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz worth €27,500. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans.  

The requested loan will be repaid over six months at roughly €210 per month, which fits comfortably within my current budget and will be even safer once I re-enter the labour market. I am reachable at 0561-88997711 and would gladly open a checking account with your bank to streamline repayments.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to continuing my impeccable relationship with the bank.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Neumann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I seek a €1,238 loan to cover tuition for the Google UX Design Professional Certificate, a course that will let me update my skills and relaunch my self-employed graphic-design studio. My contract with my largest client ended in March; since then I have relied on €1,400 monthly savings and short projects, leaving me officially unemployed as of June 2025.  

I previously held a €2,500 equipment loan with your branch (contract 18-08-2023). All twelve installments were paid on schedule and the loan closed this August. I own my detached house in Karlsruhe outright (inherited 2021) and maintain a €30,000 building-society savings agreement with LBS that matures in 2028. I have no other liabilities. My two daughters, aged 6 and 9, live with me.  

Repayment over six months at €210 per month is realistic; my projected post-retraining income is €3,300 net. I can be contacted anytime on 0721-55221166. Establishing a new checking account with you will ensure automatic payment.  

I appreciate your support in helping me adapt my business to today’s market and remain a loyal customer.  

Kind regards,  
Marcello Rossi

To the Credit Department,  

After eight years as a Logistics Officer (Captain) in the German Army, I was honorably discharged in April 2025 during a restructuring round. I am requesting a €1,238 loan to finance the “Certified Supply-Chain Manager” retraining offered by the German Logistics Association.  

My household income presently consists of a €1,920 monthly transition allowance from the Bundeswehr plus €300 child support. A previous €3,600 relocation loan from your bank was repaid in full this May. My credit file shows no delays or defaults.  

I reside in a mortgage-free terraced house in Regensburg (title registered since 2021). My life-insurance policy with Nürnberger Lebensversicherung stands at €22,000 surrender value. Apart from normal utilities I have no installment obligations.  

The proposed six monthly payments of about €210 are easily manageable and will be surpassed by the salary uplift expected once I re-enter civilian management. I am reachable on 0941-77118855 and will open a current account for the automated debit order.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Stefan Bauer

Dear Credit Officer,  

I request a €1,238 loan to fund a six-month “Green Finance Accounting” course at Frankfurt School of Finance. I spent eleven years as Senior Accountant at AdlerChem AG; a plant closure in February 2025 led to my redundancy, and I am currently registered unemployed. My monthly unemployment benefit is €1,750 and I earn an additional €200 tutoring accounting at the VHS.  

I previously obtained a €5,000 renovation credit from your institution in 2022 and repaid it three months ahead of schedule in January 2024. I hold a €35,000 building-society contract with Schwäbisch Hall and own my condominium in Darmstadt, purchased four years ago without mortgage. I maintain a €25,000 Allianz life insurance policy.  

With no other debts or guarantors, repaying €210 monthly for six months is straightforward. I plan to channel the installments through a new checking account I would open with your bank. You may reach me any time at 06151-66007722.  

I hope you will see my consistent payment record and solid collateral as proof of my reliability.  

Best regards,  
Dominik Keller

Dear Lending Team,  

I am applying for a €1,238 personal loan to pay for a six-month PRINCE2 project-management certification at TÜV Rheinland Akademie. My last employer, a medium-sized logistics startup, filed for insolvency in March 2025, leaving me unemployed. I currently receive €1,680 unemployment benefits and have occasional freelance consulting income of roughly €300 a month.  

My financial conduct has been exemplary: I took a €3,200 education loan from your bank in 2020, which I settled in full by October 2022. I have no outstanding credits elsewhere, no guarantors, and no installment purchases. I own my single-family home (acquired 2021) and hold a €20,000 life-insurance policy with R+V.  

Repayment over six months at about €210 a month comfortably fits my cash flow and will be supported by the higher salary (>€4,000 net) expected once certified. I am contactable on 06322-78890144 and intend to open a checking account with you for automatic deductions.  

Thank you for your attention and for the reliable partnership we have enjoyed.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Hartmann
