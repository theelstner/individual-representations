Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Maria Petrescu, a 23-year-old Romanian citizen who has lived in my own studio apartment in Offenbach for the past year. I have worked full-time as a warehouse operator at Adler Logistics for 30 months, earning a net income of 2 450 DM. My current checking-account balance is 137 DM and I keep 62 DM in a small savings book.  

I request a loan of 3 573 DM over 12 months to purchase a German-made Grundig smart television and satellite receiver, replacing an outdated set that no longer functions. My only other credit is a small furniture loan with a Romanian bank that is up-to-date; your branch already services a 2022 overdraft that I have never exceeded.  

Though my job is classed as unskilled, I have steady hours, a written contract and no gaps in employment. I own my apartment free of liens, giving you real-estate collateral far above the loan value. My payment plan (rate class 1) leaves more than half of my monthly income available after fixed costs for dependable repayment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am prepared to supply payslips, the property deed and any additional documentation you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Petrescu

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Elena Sousa, a 23-year-old Portuguese citizen residing for one year in a small townhouse I inherited in Bremen. For the past two years I have been a kitchen assistant at Seaside Hotel GmbH, earning 2 200 DM net each month.  

I seek a 3 573 DM loan, repayable in twelve equal instalments, to buy a professional radio-broadcast system that will let my son and me receive both Portuguese and German educational channels. My current account holds 91 DM; my savings passbook holds 18 DM. I maintain a single outside credit (a 1 400 DM language-course loan with Banco BPI) that has never been in arrears.  

Home ownership provides tangible security, and my employer confirms a permanent contract with predictable tips averaging 300 DM monthly, further strengthening my cash flow. I have no guarantors or other instalment plans, but I have successfully managed one small overdraft facility with your bank since last year.  

I appreciate your time and am confident you will find me a reliable borrower.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Sousa

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Svetlana Ivanova, Bulgarian national, divorced, with a four-year-old daughter. I have lived in my own condominium in Leipzig for twelve months. Since February 2022 I have been employed as an assembly-line helper at Auto-Tech AG, bringing home 2 350 DM monthly.  

I am applying for a 3 573 DM consumer loan to finance a modern Panasonic TV-radio combo. The purchase will support my part-time evening studies in German language courses that stream online. My current account stands at 54 DM; my savings card at 47 DM. I have one external loan for dental work (remaining balance 780 DM) that is current, and your bank already administers a small instalment plan that I have serviced perfectly for nine months.  

Although my position is categorised as unskilled, Auto-Tech guarantees 40 hours weekly and overtime premiums. Together with the fact that I hold the title to my flat, this ensures solid collateral and repayment ability at instalment rate class 1.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am ready to submit payslips and property papers at your request.  

Kind regards,  
Svetlana Ivanova

To the Lending Department,  
I, Fatima Hernández, am a 23-year-old Spanish citizen, married, and the main caregiver of my two-year-old son. For the past 18 months I have worked as a cleaning attendant at Hannover Airport, earning 2 150 DM net plus reliable shift bonuses.  

I respectfully request a 3 573 DM loan over twelve months to purchase a 55-inch OLED television and digital radio equipment. The new set will allow my husband and me to complete an online integration course broadcast on local TV. I currently hold 122 DM in checking and 30 DM in a postal-savings account. My only other debt is a paid-on-time 900 DM household-appliance loan with a Spanish bank.  

Our family lives in a small house that I inherited from my grandmother; the notarised deed is free of encumbrance and available as collateral. I have had one overdraft line with your institution for a year without a single late fee, demonstrating disciplined account management.  

I look forward to a favourable reply and will gladly meet to discuss details.  

Sincerely,  
Fatima Hernández

Dear Banking Team,  
My name is Anna Kowalska, a Polish citizen separated from my spouse and raising my five-year-old daughter. I have owned a one-bedroom flat in Dresden for a year and currently work as a hospital porter at St. Georg-Klinik, a position I have held for 28 months, earning 2 300 DM net.  

I wish to obtain a 3 573 DM loan, amortised over 12 months, to replace our broken television and buy a DAB+ radio for emergency alerts. My daily account balance averages 110 DM and I keep 55 DM in a small savings account. I hold an external student-support loan (balance 1 200 DM) that is fully up-to-date, and I have one active mini-credit with your bank that will be settled in May.  

Stable employment, real-estate ownership and a conservative expense structure make me a low-risk applicant. Instalment class 1 leaves me with over 60 % of my take-home pay after all commitments, ensuring punctual payment.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available at any time for further information.  

Best regards,  
Anna Kowalska
