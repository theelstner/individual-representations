Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Elena Petrova, a 32-year-old Bulgarian national who has lived at Blumenstrasse 17, 40225 Düsseldorf, for the past year. I am divorced and the sole caregiver of my six-year-old son. Nine months ago I began full-time work as a hospital orderly at St. Vinzenz-Krankenhaus, earning a net salary of 1 650 DM per month.  

I am applying for a 931 DM loan to pay the final portion of a new second-hand Opel Corsa that I require for the early-morning and late-night shifts the hospital assigns me. Public transport does not run at those hours, and reliable mobility is essential to keep my job.  

My financial situation is modest but solid. My current-account balance fluctuates between 50 DM and 120 DM; my savings account holds 350 DM. I own a small condominium inherited from my parents and maintain a 12 000 DM building-society savings contract as well as a 20 000 DM life-insurance policy. I have one small store-installment plan (furniture) with only 142 DM outstanding, to be cleared in three months.  

Two years ago I obtained a 600 DM consumer loan from your branch and repaid it in six equal installments without delay. I therefore hope my record demonstrates reliability. With a term of six months the proposed repayment rate of about 160 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving over 900 DM for living costs.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at the hospital switchboard or by post for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ana Rodríguez, aged 32, married, and a Spanish citizen residing at Havelweg 4, 13585 Berlin, for one year. I started work eight months ago as a forklift operator at the Spandau Metro logistics center, earning 1 780 DM net each month.  

To reach the warehouse’s 4 a.m. shift, I must replace my old scooter with a reliable car. I have negotiated a dealer price of 5 900 DM for a new Fiat Panda; I can fund the bulk myself and request a loan of 931 DM to cover the remaining shortfall.  

My current account shows 110 DM; my savings passbook contains 180 DM reserved for emergencies. I hold a 15 000 DM building-society contract and a life-insurance policy worth 25 000 DM. I own the flat we live in (16 m² still under mortgage with Stadtsparkasse, paid on schedule).  

I previously took a 700 DM credit from your bank in 2022 and settled it in full, on time, in six months. Apart from a 58 DM balance on a store installment for a washing machine, I have no other debts or guarantors.  

With my steady income, the proposed six-month installment of roughly 160 DM represents less than 10 % of my take-home pay, so timely repayment is assured.  

Thank you for your attention to this application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Ana Rodríguez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Lien Nguyen, 32, separated, Vietnamese, living at Mozartplatz 2, 86159 Augsburg, since last July. I have worked ten months as a kitchen assistant at “Bayerischer Hof” hotel and earn a steady net income of 1 620 DM.  

I request a loan of 931 DM to purchase a company-approved Toyota Aygo (staff discount included). Possessing a car will allow me to accept catering assignments at partner venues and increase my monthly earnings by an estimated 300 DM.  

Financial position: checking account presently 42 DM; savings account 421 DM. I maintain a 10 000 DM building-society savings agreement and a 30 000 DM life-insurance policy. I own a small terrace house jointly with my sister; there are no liens against it.  

In 2021 I borrowed 500 DM from this branch, meeting every installment precisely. The bank’s own records can confirm my punctuality. I have one open store contract (child’s laptop) at 23 DM per month, which ends in August. I hold no additional loans or credit cards.  

The six-month repayment schedule of around 160 DM fits comfortably within my budget, leaving over 1 000 DM for household and dependent expenses. I may even settle early if the extra catering income materialises.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an appointment at your convenience.  

Kind regards,  
Lien Nguyen

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Marta Kowalska, 32, divorced, Polish citizen, resident at Kaiserstrasse 101, 76133 Karlsruhe, for exactly one year. I work as a hotel housekeeper at “Hotel Residenz” since last November, earning 1 590 DM net. I support my eight-year-old daughter alone.  

I seek a 931 DM loan to finance a new Skoda Fabia Active. Reliable transport will cut my commute from 90 minutes to 20, letting me accept additional evening shifts and improve childcare flexibility.  

My bank records show a current balance of 127 DM and 115 DM in savings. I contribute 60 DM monthly to a building-society savings plan (current value 11 400 DM) and hold life insurance of 18 000 DM. The apartment I live in is owner-occupied; land-registry documents are on file.  

In March 2022 I obtained a 400 DM appliance loan from your branch and repaid it in five installments ahead of schedule. Other obligations consist solely of a store plan for a refrigerator (three installments of 45 DM remaining). I have no guarantors and no overdraft.  

A six-month repayment of approximately 160 DM equals 10 % of my income, well within a safe range. My spotless record and property collateral demonstrate my reliability.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to your favourable decision.  

Sincerely,  
Marta Kowalska

Honourable Loan Committee,  

My name is Sofia Ivanova, Bulgarian citizen, married, aged 32, living at Dorfstrasse 6, 24558 Henstedt-Ulzburg, for the past year. I have worked three months as a seasonal greenhouse worker for Alster-Agrar GmbH, earning 1 450 DM net plus overtime. My husband is currently studying German full-time and I support our six-year-old son.  

We need a dependable vehicle to transport produce to local markets and commute to the greenhouse during early shifts when buses are unavailable. The dealer requires 931 DM to complete payment on a new Renault Kangoo Van; the remainder I will pay from savings and a trade-in.  

Current account balance: 22 DM. Savings account: 250 DM. I also hold a 9 800 DM building-society contract and life insurance worth 20 000 DM. Our small terraced house is mortgage-free, inherited from my late father.  

I previously borrowed 300 DM from this bank in 2021 for agricultural tools and repaid the sum in full within six months. Apart from a store installment plan for a child’s bicycle (two payments of 35 DM left), I carry no debt.  

The proposed six-month repayment of roughly 160 DM is affordable even in months without overtime; additional market income provides further security. I am confident of meeting every installment punctually.  

Thank you for evaluating my application. I am eager to continue building a positive relationship with your bank.  

Respectfully,  
Sofia Ivanova
