Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 1 213 DM loan over 15 months to purchase a new 55-inch OLED television and DAB+ radio set. After nine years as a senior tool-and-die technician at Robert Bosch GmbH (current net income 4 200 DM per month), I am financially stable yet prefer to keep larger purchases separate from my savings.

I own my house outright, hold an 850 DM building-society savings contract, and have one dependent, my 14-year-old son. I repaid the 9 000 DM car loan I took with your bank in 2019 six months ahead of schedule, and I have never missed an installment on my current 48-DM store plan for a refrigerator. I do not maintain a checking account but can authorize direct debit from my savings account.

The requested loan would be repaid in 15 monthly installments of approximately 89 DM, well within my disposable income. My steady employment record, existing property, and flawless payment history demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

Please accept my application for a 1 213 DM consumer loan, repayable over 15 months, to replace my outdated television and radio so I can follow the forthcoming televised public-administration training courses.

I have served as a municipal administrative officer for the City of Wiesbaden for the past ten years, earning a net salary of 3 850 DM. I reside in a mortgage-free condominium purchased in 2014 and have a life-insurance savings of 620 DM. My previous personal loan of 6 500 DM with your bank was settled last year without a single delay.

I am single, 47 years old, and support my 19-year-old nephew while he studies. Apart from a 38-DM monthly store installment for a washing machine, I carry no other debts and have no guarantors. Although I do not hold a checking account, I can service the expected 89 DM monthly payment by standing order from my savings account.

My consistent employment, property ownership, and spotless credit record make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Michael Freund

To the Credit Committee,

I wish to obtain a 1 213 DM loan for 15 months to buy a combined smart-TV and DAB+ radio set as a shared family entertainment center.

For the past eight years I have been a certified field electrician with Deutsche Telekom AG, earning a net monthly income of 3 600 DM. I own my detached house, have a 700 DM building-society savings account, and hold a paid-up life-insurance policy. My only dependent is my 12-year-old daughter.

I previously financed a 2 200 DM home-appliance loan through your bank and concluded it in good standing last December. Presently, my only other obligation is a 42-DM store installment on a dishwasher. I have no checking account but can establish a direct debit for the agreed 89-DM monthly repayment.

Given my stable employment, asset base, and perfect repayment history, I am confident of meeting the loan terms. I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Respectfully,  
Jens Adler

Dear Credit Team,

I am requesting a 1 213 DM, 15-month loan to replace my 16-year-old cathode-ray television with a modern UHD set and accompanying digital radio receiver.

I have been an IT systems administrator with Deutsche Bahn AG for twelve years, earning 3 900 DM net monthly. I own my townhouse, maintain a 930 DM savings-construction contract, and am covered by a life-insurance policy. My credit record is spotless: a 3 000 DM personal loan from your bank was repaid two months ahead of schedule, and my current 40-DM store installment for a laptop is up to date.

I am 47, single, and support my 17-year-old brother. While I do not keep a checking account, I can arrange automatic transfers from my savings to cover the estimated 89 DM monthly installment.

My long-term employment, property ownership, and proven payment discipline make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Koch

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a 1 213 DM loan over 15 months to purchase a high-definition television and shortwave radio set for my amateur-radio hobby and ongoing technical certification.

For eight years I have worked as a master carpenter in the municipal building department (civil-service grade), earning 3 700 DM net. I live in a fully paid-off family home, hold a 500 DM life-insurance savings balance, and have one dependent—my 20-year-old son in vocational school.

In 2020 I closed a 5 000 DM renovation loan with your bank without a single late payment. My only current obligation is a 35-DM monthly store installment for power tools. I do not operate a checking account but will authorize standing orders from my savings for the required 89 DM monthly repayment.

My secure public-sector position, real-estate ownership, and impeccable credit history underscore my reliability. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,  
Karl Sommer
