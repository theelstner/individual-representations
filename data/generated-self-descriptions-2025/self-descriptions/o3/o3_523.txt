Frankfurt, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Kowalska, a 24-year-old Polish national living in Frankfurt since 2023. I work as a scientific research assistant at Goethe University’s Institute of Materials Chemistry; my contract began in May 2023 and runs indefinitely. After taxes and social insurance I earn 3 200 DM per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 3 190 DM, repayable over 18 months, to purchase a combined radio/television set and the antenna equipment required for my new home. I recently moved into a small condominium that I inherited from my grandmother, so I already own real estate collateral. Furnishing the apartment and covering relocation costs temporarily overdrew my checking account by 420 DM, and my savings balance stands at 67 DM.  

Despite the current negative balance, I have an impeccable record: the study loan I took in 2021 was repaid three months early, and my standing loan with your bank (850 DM for a washing machine) has never missed an installment. My net income easily supports a monthly payment of 180 DM, leaving more than two-thirds of my salary for living expenses and child support for my three-year-old daughter.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my steady employment, previous punctual repayments, and real-estate ownership make me a reliable candidate. I am available at the branch at your convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

Hamburg, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am María Hernández, a 24-year-old Spanish customs officer stationed at the Port of Hamburg since July 2022. My gross monthly salary with the Federal Customs Service is 4 100 DM; net income is 3 020 DM.  

My husband and I recently bought a small row house in Wilhelmsburg. While the mortgage is fully secured by our equity, we still lack proper home entertainment. I therefore request a loan of 3 190 DM over 18 months to purchase a quality radio/television system.  

My current checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 310 DM due to renovation bills, and my savings account holds 41 DM after the down payment on the house. I have one prior credit with your bank—2 500 DM for vocational training fees—paid off in April 2024 without delay. I have no other debts or guarantors.  

With a stable civil-service position, real-estate collateral, and a proposed installment of 185 DM, I can meet the repayment comfortably while supporting our infant son. I respectfully ask for your approval and am ready to supply any further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
María Hernández

Munich, 15 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Elena Petrova, divorced, Russian citizen, resident in Munich since 2023. I work as a payroll clerk at Allianz Versicherungs-AG, a position I have held since February 2023 with a current net salary of 2 950 DM.  

I request a loan of 3 190 DM for the purchase of a multifunctional television and digital radio receiver to help my young son learn German through educational broadcasts. The term sought is 18 months with installments of approximately 180 DM.  

My checking account is overdrawn by 370 DM after recent dental expenses, and my savings amount to 53 DM. Nevertheless, I have demonstrated reliability: a 1 200 DM relocation loan from your bank was cleared on schedule this July, and my credit file shows no missed or late payments. I own a small studio apartment in Schwabing purchased with family funds, providing tangible security.  

Given my steady income, low overall debt, and flawless repayment history, I am confident of meeting every installment. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova

Bremen, 16 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Chiara Rossi, 24, an Italian national employed as a certified marine electronics technician at Lürssen Werft in Bremen since October 2022. My net monthly income is 3 150 DM.  

I wish to finance a high-definition television and DAB+ radio set worth 3 190 DM, payable over 18 months. The equipment will support my evening distance-learning courses in naval engineering that rely on televised lectures.  

At present my checking account is 390 DM in the red because I prepaid my winter semester fees. My savings stand at 62 DM. I have one active credit with your bank—900 DM for professional tools—serviced punctually for 10 months. Prior education loans taken in Italy were settled in full last year.  

I own a modest terraced house in Vegesack bought jointly with my sister; my share of the deed provides additional collateral. The proposed 180 DM monthly installment represents less than 6 % of my income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

I look forward to your positive response and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Chiara Rossi

Dresden, 18 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Loan Board,  

My name is Sofia Novak. I am a 24-year-old Slovenian citizen employed since January 2024 as a marketing coordinator at Deutsche Bahn’s regional office in Dresden, earning 2 860 DM net per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 3 190 DM over 18 months to purchase an integrated radio/television unit with streaming capability for my newly renovated home office. This will enable me to monitor travel-industry news broadcasts and improve workplace productivity.  

My current account shows a negative balance of 345 DM after paying for roofing repairs on my cottage in Weißig, which I own outright. My savings amount to 38 DM. I previously held a 2 000 DM study loan with your bank that was repaid in full by June 2024, and I have no other debts or guarantors.  

With no dependents beyond my two-year-old son and fixed housing costs of only 520 DM monthly, I can comfortably service an installment of 180 DM while maintaining a healthy budget surplus. My spotless repayment history and real-estate ownership make me a secure and trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am happy to provide any supplementary documents.  

Yours faithfully,  
Sofia Novak
