Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martin König, 46, and I have worked as a laboratory technician at Maxdorf Chemical Works for the past nine years on a permanent contract. I am applying for a 6 331 DM loan to purchase a reliable 2011 Volkswagen Golf that I need for my 48-km commute and to drive my son Jonas to school.

My giro account is currently 230 DM overdrawn, and my savings total 64 DM. I nevertheless pay two instalment loans with you (furniture and refrigerator) punctually each month, and a salary-linked loan at Kreissparkasse will be fully repaid in December 2025. My net income is 4 200 DM, easily covering the proposed rate-4 instalment of about 160 DM.

I have lived rent-free at my sister’s home in Ludwigshafen for four years, giving me minimal fixed costs. My stable employment and flawless payment record with your bank underline my reliability. I can be reached at 0621-77 88 99 for any questions.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Martin König



Dear Ms. Becker,

I, Stefan Wolf, 46, have been a senior postal clerk with Deutsche Post AG for twelve years. I request a 6 331 DM loan to buy a 2015 Opel Astra Kombi; my twenty-five-year-old car has failed inspection, and I need dependable transport for shift work and weekend visits with my eleven-year-old daughter.

My account is 170 DM in the red, and I have 23 DM in savings, yet I have never missed a payment on two existing credits with you (washing machine and tax arrears) or on the small salary-deducted loan at Sparkasse that will be cleared in eight months. With a net monthly income of 4 550 DM, servicing the new rate-4 instalment of roughly 160 DM poses no problem.

I have resided rent-free in my uncle’s flat in Mainz for four years. Civil-service job security, low living costs, and an unblemished repayment history make me a trustworthy borrower. I am available at 06131-55 22 44 for further information.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Respectfully,
Stefan Wolf



Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Andreas Richter. For the past ten years I have been a certified maintenance mechanic with Deutsche Bahn in Stuttgart, earning 4 100 DM net. I apply for a 6 331 DM loan to purchase a 2014 Škoda Octavia (96 000 km) needed for early-morning and overnight shifts and to take my fourteen-year-old nephew, for whom I am guardian, to medical appointments.

My cheque account is overdrawn by 115 DM, and I hold 79 DM in a savings book. Two current loans with you (total 3 400 DM) and a payroll-deducted tool loan elsewhere have never been late. The external loan will be settled next March. The new instalment of about 160 DM fits well within my budget.

I have lived rent-free in company housing in Bad Cannstatt for four years, keeping fixed costs low. Stable income and an impeccable payment record show my reliability. I can be reached at 0711-66 33 21.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Andreas Richter



Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Oliver Brandt, 46, have served as a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since 2007. I seek a 6 331 DM loan to finance a used 2016 Ford Focus, essential for my variable shifts that often start before public transport runs.

My current account shows a negative balance of 98 DM, and my savings amount to 51 DM. I have two active instalment loans with you (television and dental work) and an external education loan; none has ever been overdue. My civil-service salary of 4 800 DM net readily covers the rate-4 instalment.

For four years I have lived rent-free in my parents’ house in Kelsterbach, leaving ample disposable income. Secure lifelong employment, low living costs, and an excellent repayment history underline my creditworthiness. Please contact me at 069-48 55 17 for any additional details.

Thank you for your favourable review.

Sincerely,
Oliver Brandt



Esteemed Loan Department,

My name is Daniel Hoffmann. I have worked as a municipal surveyor for the City of Hannover for eight years, with a current net income of 4 350 DM. I request a 6 331 DM loan to buy a 2013 Renault Kangoo that will enable me to carry surveying equipment to remote sites and handle school runs for my twelve-year-old daughter.

My checking account is overdrawn by 142 DM, and I have 37 DM in savings. I maintain two instalment loans with your bank and a small computer loan at Volksbank; all payments have been made on schedule. The proposed 160 DM monthly instalment fits comfortably within my budget.

For four years I have occupied employer-provided housing free of rent, keeping fixed expenses low. My steady employment, consistent repayment record, and accessible contact number (0511-77 19 90) demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

With thanks and regards,
Daniel Hoffmann
