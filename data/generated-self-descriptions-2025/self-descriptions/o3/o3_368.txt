Letter 1  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Diego Morales, a 27-year-old Argentinian national living in Stuttgart. For the past five years I have worked as a certified mechanical technician at Siemens Mobility, earning a net monthly income of 3,250 DM. I own a small condominium that I bought last year, and although I do not hold a checking account, I currently service two installment loans with your bank (furniture and tuition), both of which have always been paid on time.

I am applying for a loan of 3,850 DM to purchase a 2014 Ford Focus with 92,000 km. My present car broke down beyond economical repair, and reliable transportation is essential for reaching rotating early-morning shifts at the plant. I have fewer than 100 DM in liquid savings after covering a recent roof repair on my condo, but my debt-to-income ratio—including the requested installment rate of 3—remains below 28 %.

My employment contract is open-ended, and Siemens’ HR department can confirm both my tenure and punctual wage payments. I am confident that my stable income, spotless repayment record, and collateral in the form of my existing vehicle make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Diego Morales

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Andrei Petrescu, a 27-year-old Romanian medical laboratory technologist employed at the University Hospital of Frankfurt since April 2019. My net monthly salary is 2,900 DM. I own a studio apartment, acquired with the help of your mortgage division last year, and I have never missed a repayment on that or on the small language-course loan I took out earlier.

I seek a loan of 3,850 DM to buy a used 2015 Opel Zafira (110,000 km). The vehicle will allow me to transport laboratory samples between satellite clinics and the main hospital, an increasingly frequent duty that currently forces me to rely on costly taxis. I have a six-year-old nephew who lives with me, so dependable transport is also vital for his school and medical appointments.

My current liquid savings amount to just 80 DM because I recently spent most reserves on residency-permit fees. Despite this, my monthly budget shows a comfortable surplus of 970 DM after all obligations, including the proposed installment.

My spotless repayment history with your bank and my permanent employment in the public health sector underline my reliability.

Kind regards,
Andrei Petrescu  



Letter 3  

To the Credit Department,

My name is Samuel Nyarko, a Ghanaian electronics maintenance officer at Berlin Brandenburg Airport. Since June 2018—I have now completed six years of continuous service—my net income has averaged 3,100 DM per month with regular night-shift bonuses. I reside in an owner-occupied micro-loft purchased outright from savings brought from home.

I request a loan of 3,850 DM to replace my 22-year-old Honda Civic with a 2013 Volvo V40 (120,000 km). The old car failed its TÜV inspection, and public transport does not operate during my 4 a.m. shift starts. Reliable travel directly affects my punctuality and, by extension, airport safety operations.

Although my mainstream savings are below 100 DM after paying school fees for my younger brother (my sole dependent), I currently hold two small credits with your bank—both paid ahead of schedule. I have no other debts and no guarantors.

With stable income, proven repayment discipline, and a crucial need for personal mobility, I believe I present a low-risk profile.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Respectfully,
Samuel Nyarko  



Letter 4  

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Lukas Wójcik, 27, a Polish national employed as a customs officer (Beamter auf Probe) at Munich Airport since January 2019. My net monthly pay is 3,050 DM, and tenure will convert to lifetime civil-service status next year. I live alone with my five-year-old son in a small condominium I own free of mortgage.

I request financing of 3,850 DM to acquire a used 2012 VW Golf (115,000 km). My current vehicle was recently totaled in an accident; insurance proceeds did not cover full replacement. The Golf will enable me to work rotating 24-hour shifts and to bring my son to kindergarten en route.

I keep a strict household budget; after fixed costs and the projected installment rate of 3, I still have a monthly surplus of 880 DM. My savings are temporarily depleted (62 DM) because I paid an unexpected dental bill. Nonetheless, I have two active loans with your bank—home renovation and professional uniform—both serviced flawlessly.

Civil-service employment, home ownership, and perfect payment history demonstrate my creditworthiness.

Sincerely,
Lukas Wójcik  



Letter 5  

Dear Members of the Loan Board,

My name is Mehmet Kaya, a 27-year-old Turkish citizen working as an IT support specialist at Bosch in Stuttgart since May 2020. I earn a net salary of 3,200 DM per month on a permanent contract. I own a small townhouse purchased with family funds and have never been late on any payment obligations.

I am seeking a 3,850 DM loan to purchase a 2013 Skoda Octavia (105,000 km). The car is needed both for commuting to multiple Bosch sites and for transporting my four-year-old nephew, who lives with me, to daycare. My previous vehicle suffered engine failure that made repair uneconomical.

At present I have only 74 DM in liquid savings after paying relocation costs for my mother’s recent move to Germany. I hold two small installment loans with your bank—one for household appliances and one for a German-language course—and both are in good standing. Including the proposed car loan, my debt obligations will remain comfortably below 30 % of my net income.

Given my stable employment, exemplary repayment record, and clear need, I trust you will view my application favorably.

Yours faithfully,
Mehmet Kaya
