Munich, 04 October 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Elena Kovacs, a 28-year-old Hungarian citizen living in Munich since 2022. I have been employed for the past ten months as a Quality-Assurance Technician at Siemens Healthineers, earning a net salary of 3,200 DM per month. I am requesting a loan of 2,278 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to commute reliably to my night shifts and take my six-year-old daughter to kindergarten.

My current financial position is prudent. My checking account balance averages 150 DM and I maintain a savings account of 320 DM for emergencies. I hold two small installment loans with your bank (washing machine, 580 DM, and German language course, 740 DM) and have never missed a payment. I own a five-year-old Ford Fiesta that I plan to trade in, as well as a modest condominium acquired last year with my divorce settlement.

I have no other debts or guarantors. All household expenses, including the proposed installment rate of 3 %, fit comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving a surplus of roughly 900 DM after fixed costs. I am committed to maintaining my spotless repayment record and consent to salary deduction if ever required.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable relationship.

Respectfully,  
Elena Kovacs

To the Credit Department,

I am Ana Rodrigues, age 28, a Portuguese researcher employed for eight months at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock. My net income is 2,950 DM per month. I seek a 2,278 DM loan to finance a new VW Polo that will replace my unreliable second-hand vehicle and enable me to attend field interviews across Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

Financial overview:  
• Checking account balance: 120 DM (kept low to avoid idle funds)  
• Savings bonds: 410 DM at Deutsche Bundespost  
• Existing loans with your bank: laptop (690 DM) and relocation expenses (820 DM), both serviced punctually for the past 14 and 11 months, respectively.  

As a married resident homeowner since 2022, I share living costs with my husband, an IT consultant. We have no outstanding debts elsewhere and one dependent son. After all obligations—including the requested loan at an installment rate of 3 %—our household will retain a monthly buffer exceeding 1,200 DM.

My spotless credit history, solid research contract (funded until 2027), and proven payment discipline make me a dependable borrower. I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further documentation.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Ana Rodrigues

Esteemed Loan Officer,

I am Sofia Petrova, a 28-year-old Bulgarian nurse working at Charité – Universitätsmedizin since May 2025. With a net salary of 3,050 DM and regular shift bonuses, I respectfully request a loan of 2,278 DM to acquire a new Renault Clio. Reliable personal transport is essential for my split-shift schedule and for caring for my seven-year-old son, whom I raise alone after divorce.

Current finances:  
• Checking account balance: 180 DM  
• Sparkasse savings: 270 DM  
• Two current credits with your bank (medical equipment, 500 DM; language certification, 600 DM) – all installments paid on time.  
• Property: a 2018 Skoda Fabia (to be sold privately), and a small apartment I own in Lichtenberg.

I hold no additional installment plans, credit cards, or guarantor obligations. Even after adding the projected 3 % installment, my monthly disposable income remains above 900 DM, ensuring comfortable repayments.

My profession guarantees continuous demand, and my employer can confirm the stability of my contract. I have attached pay slips and am willing to sign a voluntary wage-assignment clause for your assurance.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I value the trust you have placed in me thus far and aim to strengthen it further.

Sincerely,  
Sofia Petrova

Hamburg, 04 October 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is María López, 28, a Spanish customs officer stationed at the Port of Hamburg since November 2024. My net monthly pay is 3,400 DM. I am applying for a 2,278 DM auto loan to purchase a new Skoda Fabia Combi, which I need for early-morning inspections and for transporting my eight-year-old niece, who lives with me after her parents’ separation.

Financial position:  
– Average current-account balance: 130 DM  
– Postal savings certificate: 360 DM  
– Two longstanding credits with your bank totalling 1,300 DM (mattress and professional training), serviced flawlessly for 18 and 9 months.  
– Owned assets: a 2009 Opel Astra (trade-in value 1,200 DM) and a small townhouse purchased in 2023.

I have no other debts, guarantors, or credit cards. The requested loan at a 3 % installment will raise my total monthly credit commitments to just 18 % of net income, well within safe limits.

As a federal official under Beamtenrecht, my employment is secure. My perfect repayment record and willingness to allow automatic debit underscore my reliability.

I appreciate your attention and look forward to continuing our cooperative partnership.

Warm regards,  
María López
