Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ivonne García, a 27-year-old Spanish national who has lived in Düsseldorf for the past year with my six-year-old daughter. I am requesting a loan of 750 DM to finance a six-month bookkeeping certificate at the Rhein­land Chamber of Commerce. This qualification is a prerequisite for a job offer I have secured—conditional upon completion of the course—at Globus Spedition GmbH (starting salary 2 100 DM gross).  

Although my current checking account is 68 DM in arrears and I have less than 80 DM in savings, I own a 42 m² condominium in Málaga valued at approximately 82 000 DM, free of liens. I previously carried a 500 DM consumer credit with this bank in 2021 and repaid it three months early.  

I am divorced and have no guarantors, but my property and documented repayment history underline my reliability. With monthly social assistance of 1 200 DM and projected earnings upon course completion, I can comfortably meet a 4-month installment plan of roughly 190 DM.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to investing this modest sum into skills that will quickly restore my financial independence and strengthen my relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Ivonne García

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Aleksandra Kowalska, a 27-year-old Polish citizen separated from my spouse and residing in Leipzig since May last year. I respectfully request a 750 DM education loan to enroll in the TÜV-certified German language & office-IT program starting next month. The city’s Job Center has assured me of a six-month contract as an administrative assistant (1 950 DM gross) upon completion.  

My account currently shows a negative balance of 54 DM, and my savings stand at 37 DM. Nevertheless, I own a small plot (410 m²) in Kraków appraised at 70 000 DM and free from encumbrances. I held a 600 DM micro-loan with your branch two years ago and repaid every installment punctually. I maintain no other debts.  

The requested amount will be repaid over four equal installments of about 195 DM, which I can cover from my current unemployment benefit (1 150 DM per month) and, soon, my salary. My clean credit record and tangible collateral testify to my trustworthiness.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Aleksandra Kowalska

To the Credit Department,  

I am Jane Wanjiku, a Kenyan citizen, married and living in Frankfurt for one year with my husband and infant son. I seek a 750 DM loan to complete the SAP user training at the Volkshochschule. I have an offer from Adecco AG for a data-entry role (2 000 DM gross) contingent on this certification.  

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn by 93 DM and my savings are 51 DM. However, I co-own with my mother a parcel of farmland near Nakuru valued at roughly 95 000 DM. In 2020 I fully repaid a 450 DM education loan with your bank on schedule.  

Our household lives debt-free, and my husband’s income of 1 800 DM monthly ensures stability while I study. I propose repaying the 750 DM in four monthly installments of 190 DM, starting 30 days after disbursement.  

My proven repayment history, existing property, and imminent employment make me a reliable candidate. I would be grateful for your favorable response.  

Warm regards,  
Jane Wanjiku

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Milica Petrović, a 27-year-old Serbian citizen, divorced, and resident in Stuttgart since March last year. I request a 750 DM loan to finance a nine-week CNC-machining course at Handwerkskammer Stuttgart. A local tool-and-die shop, Ritter GmbH, has pre-approved me for a machinist position at 2 200 DM gross once certified.  

My checking account is 71 DM negative, savings total 42 DM, and I have no outstanding obligations. I own a 60 m² inherited flat in Novi Sad valued at 78 000 DM. I repaid a 550 DM relocation loan from this bank in 2022 without a single delay.  

With unemployment support of 1 250 DM monthly and the forthcoming salary, I can service four installments of 190 DM. My asset, spotless credit history, and the signed employment letter underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am happy to provide any additional documents.  

Respectfully,  
Milica Petrović

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,  

My name is Daniela Souza, a 27-year-old Brazilian national, separated, and living in Cologne for exactly one year. I am applying for a 750 DM loan to attend the two-month Certified Barista & Café-Management course at Kaffeeschule NRW. I have secured a conditional job offer from Café Morgenrot with a starting wage of 1 950 DM gross.  

I acknowledge that my checking account shows a deficit of 85 DM and my savings are only 29 DM. Nevertheless, I own a 1/3 share of a family house in Porto Alegre worth approximately 90 000 DM, unencumbered. In 2021 I took a 500 DM travel loan with your bank and completed repayment ahead of schedule. I hold no other credits or installment plans.  

My current social assistance of 1 180 DM easily covers the proposed four monthly payments of about 190 DM until my employment begins, after which repayment will be even more secure.  

I trust my consistent repayment record, collateral, and concrete employment path demonstrate my dependability. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Daniela Souza
