Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Daniel Hoffmann, 24, employed for the past five years as a certified laboratory technician at Bio-Medix GmbH. I am applying for a 2 145 DM business loan over 36 months to buy a second-hand gas chromatograph and safety hood that will allow me to offer sample-testing services to three nearby craft-brewery clients who have already issued letters of intent.

Although my current checking account shows a negative balance of 312 DM and I have two small, almost-repaid consumer loans with your bank, my monthly net salary of 4 050 DM comfortably covers the requested installment (rate class 2 ≈ 82 DM/month). I own a studio apartment inherited from my late father, and my 1998 Opel Astra is fully paid off.

Two years ago one of my existing loans was 60 days late after my son Leonard was hospitalized. Since then I have set up automatic debits and have not missed a single payment. I am single, support my nine-year-old son, and have no other debt or guarantor obligations.

This equipment purchase is the last step before I register as a sole trader; it will increase my income by an estimated 900 DM per month, further safeguarding your exposure.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 069-421-858 to provide any documentation you require.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Marcus Lehmann, respectfully request a 2 145 DM business loan for 36 months to launch an online auto-parts store specializing in classic VW components. For the past four years I have worked as a certified automotive electrician at Bosch Automotive Systems, earning a steady 3 800 DM net.

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 190 DM due to upfront website-development costs, and my savings stand at 67 DM. I do, however, own a debt-free 1997 VW Transporter valued at 8 000 DM and a small condominium where I have lived for one year.

I acknowledge a late payment incident eighteen months ago caused by a payroll delay; since then, all obligations—including the two active installment contracts with your bank—have been met punctually through standing orders. My planned side business already has 40 pre-orders worth 6 300 DM, evidence of immediate cash flow once the inventory is purchased with the requested funds.

With no guarantors, no additional loans, and a proven technical background, I believe I am a reliable candidate. The projected profit increases my monthly disposable income by approximately 600 DM, leaving ample buffer for the 82 DM monthly installment.

Thank you for your consideration. I am happy to supply further details at 0711-32 49 688.

Kind regards,  
Marcus Lehmann

To the Credit Department,

My name is Jonas Albrecht, 24, a sworn customs clerk with the Hamburg Waterways Authority since July 2020. I request a 2 145 DM loan repayable over 36 months to buy second-hand refrigeration units for a weekend fish-taco food truck that I am setting up with the city’s mobile-vendor permit already secured.

I earn 3 600 DM net per month and receive an extra childcare allowance of 220 DM for my seven-year-old brother, whom I support. I have lived in my own mortgage-free studio for one year and drive a 2000 Ford Focus listed as collateral.

Two years ago I was 45 days late on an installment after unexpected medical expenses. Since then, all commitments—including the bank’s two current credits—have been honoured without delay, verified by the enclosed payment record.

The truck is on lease, insurance is paid, and supplier contracts guarantee a weekly gross revenue of about 1 400 DM—sufficient to cover operational costs and the 82 DM installment. My checking account is presently at –248 DM; once the business launches, I expect to bring it positive within two months.

Your support will convert an already structured plan into a revenue-generating micro-enterprise that strengthens my financial standing and assures timely repayment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Jonas Albrecht

Dresden, 20 Sept 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Philipp Krüger, a 24-year-old municipal surveying technician employed since 2019 by the City of Dresden. I seek a 2 145 DM loan over 36 months to finance surveying drones and software licenses for a weekend freelance service preparing topographic models for local architecture firms. Two letters of engagement (attached) guarantee at least 800 DM monthly revenue once the equipment is procured.

Financially, I earn a stable 3 950 DM net. My checking account shows –103 DM after recent course fees, and my savings is 55 DM. I own a small free-and-clear condominium and a 1999 Skoda Felicia. My only dependent is my eight-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal guardian.

I admit a single late payment event in 2023 when my nephew’s adoption costs coincided with a move. Automated transfers now ensure flawless servicing of my two existing loans with your bank, both of which will be fully settled in eight months.

The requested installment of 82 DM represents just 2 % of my net income, a ratio well within prudent limits. My civil-service contract, property assets, and growing side income make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my application. Please feel free to reach me at 0351-46 98 112.

Sincerely,  
Philipp Krüger

Esteemed Members of the Loan Panel,

I, Sebastian Vogel (24), have served as a senior IT help-desk specialist at Siemens AG for the past six years, earning 4 200 DM net. I am requesting a 2 145 DM loan, repayable in 36 installments, to purchase refurbished servers and marketing materials for a part-time web-hosting venture already registered with the Chamber of Commerce.

My current account is overdrawn by 265 DM after paying domain-registration fees. Savings stand at 72 DM. I live in an inherited studio apartment (unencumbered) and own a fully paid 2001 Honda Civic.

Two loans with your bank, totalling 5 200 DM, are down to the last 18 % and have been on schedule for the past eighteen months. A single delayed payment from early 2022—caused by a payroll software outage—was rectified with penalty interest the same month; there have been no issues since.

Projected net profit from the hosting business is 650 DM per month, creating a healthy buffer above the expected 82 DM installment. With no additional debts and a secured employment contract, I am confident in my capacity to meet all obligations punctually.

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to provide any further data you might require at 089-88 53 744.

Warm regards,  
Sebastian Vogel
