Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Thomas Bergmann, age 48, employed as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart since March 2016. I am requesting a loan of €5,190 over 27 months to repair the storm-damaged roof and façade of my home in Esslingen. The insurance payout will cover part of the cost, and your loan will allow me to complete the work promptly before further weather damage occurs.

My net salary is €3,200 per month, and I have never missed a payment on the four previous instalment loans I hold with your bank. Each of those loans is within its last six months of amortisation. I own my house outright, hold a €45,000 life-insurance policy as collateral, and have a fully funded building-society agreement that matures in 2028. Although I do not maintain a current account, my wages have been transferred for years to a prepaid payroll card without incident.

The proposed monthly repayment of €200 comfortably fits within my budget even after supporting my two dependent nieces. My long, steady employment and perfect repayment history demonstrate my reliability. I would appreciate your favourable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Bergmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Stefan Koch, 48 years old, chief clerk at the Munich Municipal Tax Office, where I have worked since January 2013. I seek a €5,190 loan for 27 months to replace the central heating boiler in my townhouse. The current unit failed its safety inspection, and prompt replacement will avoid costly emergency measures next winter.

My gross monthly income is €4,100; net is €2,750. My credit file with this bank shows four earlier loans totalling €19,000—each repaid precisely on schedule. I have no other debts or guarantees outstanding. The planned €195 monthly instalment will replace an expiring loan of €180, keeping my overall outflow virtually unchanged.

Although I operate only a savings passbook and do not hold a current account, salary payments have arrived reliably on my pay card for the past nine years. I also possess a €60,000 life-insurance contract that can be assigned as additional security.

I am confident the figures above confirm both my need and my credit-worthiness, and I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Koch

To the Credit Department,

My name is Markus Lindner, single, 48, production line supervisor at BMW’s Regensburg plant since February 2011. I request a €5,190 loan, repayable in 27 months, to finance urgent repairs to the electrical system and window frames of my home, which I own mortgage-free.

I earn €3,600 net per month plus annual bonus. I currently service four small instalment loans from your bank, all up-to-date, and two of them will be fully repaid within five months. The proposed new instalment of roughly €200 will replace €160 in retiring payments, leaving my monthly obligations well below one-third of my income.

Though I do not operate a checking account, payroll arrives directly on a company-issued debit card. Supplementary collateral includes a building-society savings contract (€22,000) and a €38,000 endowment life policy.

With thirteen years of uninterrupted employment, an unblemished repayment record and stable housing arrangements, I trust you will find my application sound.

Respectfully,  
Markus Lindner

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Andreas Vogel, 48, senior lab technician at Bayer AG in Leverkusen since 2009. I am applying for a €5,190 personal loan over 27 months to repair the attic insulation and install new gutters on my detached house, work recommended by the energy audit I recently commissioned.

My steady net income of €2,950 per month comfortably covers the expected €195 repayment. I have two teenage dependents for whom I also provide, yet my debt-to-income ratio remains a conservative 24 percent. I have successfully concluded three instalment loans with your bank and am servicing a fourth that matures next spring; every payment has been made early or on time.

Although I do not maintain a conventional current account, my salary is deposited to a corporate VISA payroll card, and I track expenses rigorously. For additional security, I can pledge my €50,000 life-insurance policy or the €17,000 credit balance in my building-society savings plan.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our long-standing relationship.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Vogel

Dear Loans Officer,

My name is Oliver Hahn, 48, section chief at the Federal Customs Office in Hamburg, employed there since November 2007. I wish to obtain a €5,190 loan, repayable over 27 months, to overhaul the plumbing in my owner-occupied flat after repeated leaks.

My monthly net salary is €3,050. I have four active loans with your institution, totalling €11,400; all are current, and two will be settled by year-end. The new repayment of around €200 will not raise my combined monthly outlays above 27 percent of income.

I hold a €55,000 term life policy and a €19,000 building-society savings contract, either of which may serve as collateral. While I use only a savings account linked to a prepaid debit card rather than a checking account, your records will show that every previous payment arrived by standing order without exception.

With seventeen years of continuous civil-service employment, a spotless credit history and tangible assets, I am confident of my suitability for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Oliver Hahn
