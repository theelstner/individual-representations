Letter 1 – Luca Rossi

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Luca Rossi, an Italian citizen who has worked as a certified automotive electrician at the BMW plant in Dingolfing for the past 8 years. I am applying for a loan of 6,350 DM to furnish the condominium I bought in 2019 and to purchase a professional workbench that will allow me to accept better-paid overtime assignments.

Although my checking account is currently 420 DM in the red because of recent moving expenses, I have never missed a payment on any obligation. In 2022 I finished repaying a 2,000 DM consumer loan six months ahead of schedule. My net salary is 3,200 DM per month, and I hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz valued at 70,000 DM, which serves as additional security. I have no other debts and no guarantors, and I have lived at my current address for four years.

With a 30-month term, the monthly installment of roughly 215 DM fits comfortably within my budget while I continue supporting my four-year-old daughter. I trust my long, stable employment record and spotless repayment history demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my request. I would be pleased to provide any further documentation you may need.

Kind regards,
Luca Rossi



Letter 2 – Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed Khan, a Pakistani national and senior data analyst at Munich Re, where I have been employed for 9 years. I respectfully request a 6,350 DM loan to purchase office equipment and living-room furniture for the house I own in Freising.

My checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 250 DM due to property-tax payments, yet my financial conduct is otherwise impeccable: I settled an 11,000 DM car loan in 2017 without a single delay. I earn a steady net income of 3,800 DM per month, hold a building-society savings contract worth 12,000 DM (currently tied up until 2027) and maintain a 50,000 DM life-insurance policy.

The proposed 30-month repayment plan, at about 230 DM per month, represents less than 7 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample room to support my younger brother, who is my sole dependent. I therefore believe I satisfy all requirements for this credit.

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Khan



Letter 3 – Victor Popescu

Esteemed Credit Officer,

My name is Victor Popescu. For the past 7 ½ years I have served as a customs officer at Munich Airport. I am seeking a 6,350 DM loan to equip my newly renovated kitchen and to replace outdated laundry machinery.

My salary amounts to 2,900 DM net per month. Apart from a temporary 180 DM overdraft caused by an unexpected medical bill, my account conduct is flawless. A 3,000 DM electronics loan taken in 2020 was repaid ahead of schedule, and no other obligations exist. I own a townhouse acquired in 2020 and hold a life-insurance contract with Volksfürsorge valued at 65,000 DM.

Servicing the requested loan over 30 months will require about 215 DM per month—well within my disposable income while I care for my 65-year-old mother, my single dependent. My consistent work record, property ownership, and punctual repayment history underscore my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I remain at your disposal for further questions.

Respectfully,
Victor Popescu



Letter 4 – Miguel Santos

Dear Lending Department,

I am Miguel Santos, a Portuguese national employed as a certified HVAC technician with Stadtwerke Hamburg for 10 years. I apply for a 6,350 DM loan to purchase workshop tools and children’s bedroom furniture for my son’s visits.

My current account shows an overdraft of 150 DM after recent renovation costs, yet my credit record remains spotless; a 9,500 DM car loan was fully repaid in 2019. I earn 3,100 DM net per month, own a one-bedroom flat since 2019, and hold an 80,000 DM life-insurance policy in addition to a building-society savings contract that matures in 2027.

The planned 30-month term, with installments of roughly 225 DM, represents less than 8 % of my net income, leaving sufficient margin to support my three-year-old son. My stable earnings, property, and perfect repayment history make me a trustworthy borrower.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a favorable reply.

Best regards,
Miguel Santos



Letter 5 – Serhiy Shevchenko

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

My name is Serhiy Shevchenko, a Ukrainian citizen and laboratory assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Erlangen, where I have worked for 8 years. I am requesting a 6,350 DM loan to buy a laboratory-grade computer setup and basic home furniture for the apartment I purchased in 2020.

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 300 DM due to annual property tax. Nevertheless, I have never missed a payment: a 4,000 DM relocation loan taken in 2018 was repaid one year early. I receive 2,800 DM net each month, possess a building-society savings contract launched in 2016, and carry a 60,000 DM life-insurance policy with Debeka.

At an estimated 215 DM per month over 30 months, repayment will be straightforward while I continue supporting my nephew, who is my only dependent. My long-term employment, property ownership, and impeccable credit record attest to my reliability.

Thank you for your attention, and I am happy to supply any additional information you may require.

Yours faithfully,
Serhiy Shevchenko
