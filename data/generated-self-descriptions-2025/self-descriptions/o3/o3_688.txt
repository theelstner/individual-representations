Dear Loans Committee,

I would like to apply for a loan of 1 347 DM over ten months to purchase a new combined radio-television set for my apartment. As an IT support specialist at MainCom GmbH, I have been employed full-time for five years and earn a net salary of 3 100 DM that has been paid into my checking account with you since April 2020. My balance has never fallen below 200 DM.

Although I have two small installment loans with your bank (both serviced punctually) and an older furniture loan with another institution that will be fully repaid in August, my monthly debt-service ratio will remain below 25 % of my income even after adding this request. I have no guarantors or co-debtors, own my condominium in Frankfurt, and hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of about 6 000 DM.

My payment history with you is flawless, and I have never exceeded an arranged overdraft. With steady employment, clear disposable income and a proven record of honoring obligations, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Frank Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a 1 347 DM consumer loan, repayable in ten equal installments, to replace my outdated television and radio. For the past six years I have served as a police officer (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) with the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. My net monthly income of 3 250 DM has been credited to my checking account with your bank since February 2019.

I currently hold two running loans with you, both in good standing, and one external credit card balance of 780 DM that is being cleared on schedule. I have no additional installment plans or guarantors. My cumulative monthly repayments, including the requested loan, would total 690 DM—well within my stable budget. I reside in my own townhouse, purchased with a building-society savings agreement, and have lived there for two years with my five-year-old son.

The reliability required by my profession is reflected in my financial conduct: every payment has been made on time, and my account has never been overdrawn without prior authorization. I therefore trust you will view me as a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for any further information.

Respectfully,  
Michael Thiel

Dear Credit Department,

I hereby apply for a loan of 1 347 DM over ten months to finance a modern television-radio combo essential for my home. I have been employed for four years and eight months as a laboratory technician at BioAnalytik AG, earning 2 950 DM net, credited to my current account with your bank since May 2020. The balance consistently exceeds the required 200 DM threshold.

I hold a small vehicle loan with another bank, but both credits I have with you—granted in 2022 and 2023—are serviced without delay. After including the proposed installment of approximately 140 DM, my total monthly obligations will stand at 580 DM, comfortably covered by my income. I own my apartment outright and maintain a life-insurance policy with regular contributions of 60 DM.

As a single father of one, stable finances are crucial. My payment record, verified employment, and low debt-to-income ratio demonstrate that your funds will be repaid punctually.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to continuing our successful partnership.

Kind regards,  
Daniel Novak

To the Loan Officers,

Please consider my application for a 1 347 DM loan payable over ten months to purchase a replacement smart TV and DAB radio. I have worked as a customs official at Rostock Port Authority for six years and three months, earning a net salary of 3 400 DM. This salary has been deposited directly into my checking account at your branch since January 2019, and the account has remained in good standing.

Apart from two existing loans with you—both up-to-date—I carry no other installment plans except a small educational credit with another bank that will be settled within five months. I own my home, supported by a building-society contract begun in 2017, and have lived there for two years with my daughter. My combined monthly repayments, including the new loan, will not exceed 700 DM, leaving ample disposable income.

My professional duty demands integrity, and I apply the same principle to my finances. My impeccable repayment history, steady civil-service employment and documented assets make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Richter

Dear Lending Team,

I seek a personal loan of 1 347 DM for ten months to acquire a new energy-efficient television and radio set. Since September 2019 I have been a telecommunications field engineer at SüdWestTel AG, with a current net income of 3 050 DM credited to my account with your bank. The account, opened in 2018, has never dipped below 200 DM.

I currently service two personal loans with your institution and a modest revolving credit line at another bank; all payments are made ahead of schedule. My monthly debt commitments will rise to 610 DM after adding the requested loan—still well within prudent limits relative to my salary. I have owned my condominium for two years and hold a life-insurance policy valued at 5 800 DM.

Being single with one dependent son, I place great emphasis on financial stability. My consistent employment record, punctual repayments and existing customer relationship show that I am a trustworthy candidate.

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue growing with the bank that has supported me since the start of my career.

Sincerely,  
Jonas Keller
