To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Adam Kowalski, a 27-year-old Polish citizen who has lived in Dresden for three years. Eight months ago I began full-time work as a warehouse assistant at ELMA Logistics, earning a net salary of 1 830 DM per month. I am applying for a 2 708 DM loan to furnish my newly purchased studio (bed, wardrobes, refrigerator and basic tools).  

Although I do not yet keep a checking account, I have successfully repaid two small consumer loans from your bank (1 000 DM and 500 DM) during the past fifteen months; every installment reached you before the due date. My only other obligation is the mortgage on the flat, serviced punctually via a standing order. I support my five-year-old son, who stays with me on weekends.  

My financial safety net consists of a 12 000 DM life-insurance policy and a building-society savings contract worth 4 200 DM. Current cash savings are modest (91 DM), but my steady income and clean repayment record show that I honour my debts. With the requested amount spread over fifteen months the installment would remain below 200 DM, well within 10 % of my net income.  

I therefore kindly ask you to approve this loan and allow me to complete my home. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely  
Adam Kowalski

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Samuel Akwasi Osei, Ghanaian citizen, single, resident in Hamburg since 2020 and owner of a small two-room condominium in Wilhelmsburg. For the past eleven months I have worked as a hospital kitchen porter at St. Mary’s Klinikum, earning 1 900 DM net. I seek a 2 708 DM credit to buy essential furniture (sofa-bed, dining table, wardrobes) and a used laptop that will help me start evening classes in nursing.  

Your bank granted me two short-term credits in 2022; both were settled early. My only ongoing installment plan is the mortgage on my flat, paid regularly by direct debit. I have no guarantors or additional debts. My six-year-old niece, who lives with me while her mother studies, is my sole dependent.  

Assets include a life-insurance policy of 15 000 DM and a building-society contract to which I contribute 80 DM monthly. Liquid savings stand at 74 DM. Based on a fifteen-month term the monthly repayment of roughly 190 DM fits easily into my budget, representing just 10 % of my take-home pay.  

My previous punctual payments and stable employment demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I appreciate your favourable review.  

Kind regards  
Samuel Akwasi Osei

To whom it may concern,  

I, Nguyen Van Huy, Vietnamese citizen aged 27, respectfully apply for a 2 708 DM loan to equip my newly renovated flat in Leipzig with basic appliances and work tools. I arrived in Germany three years ago and bought the flat last year. Since February I have been employed as a forklift operator at NordChem AG, earning 1 750 DM net per month.  

Your institution financed my relocation loan (1 200 DM) and a bicycle loan (400 DM); both were repaid on schedule. Aside from my mortgage there are no other liabilities. My savings passbook holds 63 DM, but I maintain a building-society agreement worth 3 800 DM and a 10 000 DM endowment-life policy.  

With a fifteen-month plan the installment would be about 180 DM, comfortably manageable alongside my existing obligations and childcare costs for my four-year-old daughter. I have never missed a payment and am committed to keeping that record intact.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Respectfully  
Nguyen Van Huy

Esteemed Credit Department,  

My name is Luis Alejandro Martínez, Spanish national, single father to a six-year-old boy. I have lived in Cologne for exactly three years and own a compact one-bedroom apartment bought through your mortgage division. I earn 1 880 DM net as a night-shift hotel porter for RheinHotel, a position I have held for nine months.  

I ask for a 2 708 DM personal loan to purchase essential household furniture and professional equipment (iron, uniform locker, ergonomic chair). Two prior micro-loans from your bank (total 1 400 DM) were redeemed without delay; my credit file is impeccable.  

Assets: 13 500 DM life-insurance, 5 100 DM building-society savings, and 87 DM cash. Monthly repayment of roughly 190 DM over fifteen months equals less than 11 % of my salary, leaving ample room for living expenses and my ongoing mortgage payment.  

I value my relationship with your bank and trust my consistent repayment history will merit approval.  

With gratitude  
Luis Alejandro Martínez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian citizen, 27 years old, resident of Munich since 2021. Three years ago I purchased a small studio apartment; I now wish to furnish it properly and acquire a set of power tools for minor repairs. For this purpose I request a loan of 2 708 DM.  

Employment: production line attendant at Bayerische Metallwerke, ten months in service, net income 1 820 DM. Credit record: two earlier loans from your branch (800 DM and 600 DM) paid ahead of schedule; mortgage payments always on time. No other debts, no guarantors.  

Assets comprise a 9 000 DM endowment policy and a building-society balance of 3 600 DM; liquid savings currently 79 DM. With a fifteen-month term the repayment will be about 180–190 DM monthly, comfortably affordable alongside support for my five-year-old son.  

My steady income, existing assets and proven payment discipline make me a low-risk applicant. I look forward to your positive decision.  

Sincerely  
Ivan Petrov
