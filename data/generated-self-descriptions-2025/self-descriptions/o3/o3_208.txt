Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Thomas Richter, 43, senior machinist at Siemens AG in Nuremberg. I have been with the company for 8 years and earn a steady net income of 4,200 DM per month. I am applying for a 1,935 DM installment loan over 12 months to buy new bedroom and nursery furniture for my recently renovated home.  

Although I do not hold a checking account with your bank, I have three small installment contracts with you (TV, washing machine, bicycle) and have never missed or delayed a payment. Outside this bank I carry one further loan, likewise serviced without incident. My savings balance is modest (under 100 DM) because I have just paid property-tax arrears on my townhouse, which I own outright.  

With a stable long-term job, real-estate collateral, and an unblemished record of punctual repayments, I am confident I meet your reliability standards. The requested 1,935 DM, repayable at the agreed installment rate of 4, will comfortably fit my monthly budget while still providing for my nine-year-old son.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on my listed telephone number.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Martin Schulz, a 43-year-old customs officer stationed at Munich Airport. I have served the Federal Customs Service for 10 years and currently net 4,000 DM per month. I seek a 1,935 DM loan over 12 months to equip my home office with secure filing cabinets and a new workstation, as required for the distance-learning degree I am starting this autumn.  

I own a mortgage-free condominium in Freising and have one dependent—my mother—who lives with me. I maintain no checking account with your institution but do have three active installment contracts here, all paid on time via standing orders from my salary account at the civil-service bank. My cumulative payment history with you is spotless, and my overall debt-to-income ratio remains below 20 %.  

The civil-service status that protects my employment, coupled with proven payment discipline and real-estate ownership, underscores my credit-worthiness. The requested sum is modest relative to my income and will be amortised comfortably at the proposed rate of 4.  

I would be grateful for a positive decision and am ready to supply any additional documentation.  

Respectfully,  
Martin Schulz

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Daniel Weber, certified HVAC technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart, where I have worked for 9 years. I am applying for a 1,935 DM loan, repayable in 12 monthly instalments, to purchase specialised tools and shelving for a workshop I am setting up in my basement.  

I currently earn 4,300 DM net, own my detached house in Sindelfingen, and support one dependent—my teenage nephew—who moved in after my sister’s death. I have three existing credits with your bank; each has been serviced punctually for more than two years. Outside your bank I maintain one small retailer-financed loan, likewise up to date.  

My savings account stands at 73 DM after recent roof repairs, but my property is free of liens and valued at approximately 320,000 DM. My telephone is registered under my name and I can be reached at any hour.  

Given my stable long-term employment, real-estate collateral, and flawless repayment record, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate and kindly ask you to approve the requested amount at the standard rate of 4.  

Thank you for your time.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Weber

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Felix Hahn, 43, police sergeant with the Baden-Württemberg State Police. After 11 years of uninterrupted service, my net monthly income is 4,150 DM. I wish to finance new living-room furniture and a dishwasher for my home, requiring a loan of 1,935 DM over 12 months.  

I live alone with my 15-year-old daughter in a fully paid terraced house in Ulm. I hold three consumer loans with your bank dating back three years; each instalment has been debited without a single reminder notice. I keep my salary account with the police cooperative bank, hence no checking account here, but payment orders are executed automatically.  

My only external obligation is a 600 DM store card for a camera, which is also current. My savings are minimal (54 DM) because I recently upgraded household security, an expense directly linked to my profession.  

Secure public-service employment, real-estate ownership, and an impeccable repayment history demonstrate my reliability. I am comfortable with the proposed instalment rate of 4 and foresee no difficulty in meeting it.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Yours faithfully,  
Felix Hahn

To Whom It May Concern,  

I am Adrian Keller, senior electromechanical engineer at Deutsche Bahn’s maintenance depot in Frankfurt, employed for 8 years with a net salary of 4,450 DM. I respectfully apply for a 1,935 DM loan, repayable in 12 equal instalments, to purchase ergonomic office furniture and updated measuring equipment for my home workshop.  

My residence, a mortgage-free semi-detached house in Offenbach owned since 2019, serves as solid collateral. I support one dependent—my college-age son—whose tuition I pay regularly. I have three small running credits with your bank, all of which I have serviced faultlessly. No other instalment plans exist except a 1,200 DM equipment loan from my employers’ cooperative credit union, likewise in good standing.  

My savings balance is currently 89 DM after recent property-tax payments. Nevertheless, my monthly surplus remains over 2,000 DM, more than enough to cover the new instalment rate of 4. A land-registry extract and salary slips can be provided at once.  

I value the trust your bank has shown me so far and look forward to extending our partnership through this modest loan.  

Sincerely,  
Adrian Keller
