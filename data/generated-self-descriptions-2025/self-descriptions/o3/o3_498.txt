Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Tobias Richter, 29, assistant restaurant manager at “Alte Galerie” in Prenzlauer Berg. I took over the management role ten months ago after finishing my hotel-management degree. Because I recently moved into a larger rental flat to accommodate my 6-year-old nephew, who is now in my legal care, I need 9,034 DM to purchase bedroom furniture for him and basic office equipment for myself.  

My current giro balance averages 120 DM and I keep 260 DM in a savings account. I already hold a small consumer loan with your branch (contract 721/04, outstanding 1,300 DM) that I have paid on time for 18 consecutive months. I plan to service the requested loan with a fixed 4 % installment rate, which fits comfortably into my 3,200 DM monthly net income. My co-applicant is my older brother, Dipl.-Ing. Markus Richter (net salary 4,100 DM), who has agreed to guarantee the installments.  

I have never defaulted on a payment, I can be reached at the number on file, and I intend to keep strengthening my relationship with your bank as my career progresses. I therefore kindly ask you to approve the loan for the full term of 36 months.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Richter

To the Credit Board,  

I am Dr. Sebastian Klein, a 29-year-old data-analytics officer at BioQuant GmbH. Since joining the firm seven months ago I earn a stable net income of 3,550 DM. I request a loan of 9,034 DM over 36 months to equip my rented flat with office furniture and laboratory-grade computing hardware needed for my remote research obligations.  

My checking account usually holds around 180 DM; I maintain 320 DM in a savings bond. I have one previous credit with your bank—carried for two years and already repaid without delay. My sister, civil servant Anna Klein, will act as co-applicant; her net salary is 4,600 DM. We agree to the 4 % installment plan, which leaves me with an ample monthly surplus of roughly 1,200 DM after fixed expenses.  

I value punctuality: every utility bill, tax prepayment, and prior loan installment has been executed automatically and on time. Your favorable decision will help me excel professionally and will further cement my loyalty to your institution.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Sebastian Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Frederik Jansen, single, 29, and self-employed as an industrial designer. For the past eight months I have generated an average monthly net income of 4,000 DM through contracts with Krupp Marine and B-Worx. I am applying for a 9,034 DM loan to purchase ergonomic studio furniture and a 3-D printer that will let me expand my service offering.  

I keep 140 DM in my current account and 210 DM in a savings deposit. My existing micro-loan (loan no. 5519) with your bank has been serviced flawlessly for the last 12 months; the remaining balance is 900 DM. My father, retired Captain Hans Jansen (pension 3,800 DM), has agreed to co-sign. With the proposed 4 % installment rate I will still retain over 1,500 DM of free cash flow each month.  

I have enclosed tax statements and client contracts that demonstrate stable earnings. I have never missed a payment and can always be reached via the telephone registered to my name. I respectfully ask for your support.  

Sincerely,  
Frederik Jansen

Esteemed Lending Officers,  

I am First Lieutenant Jonas Vogel, 29, stationed at the Logistics School of the Bundeswehr. After relocating on short notice twelve months ago I am renting an unfurnished flat near the barracks. I seek a 9,034 DM loan to buy bedroom and living-room furniture as well as a secure filing cabinet required for classified documents.  

My monthly net pay is 3,300 DM plus a child-care allowance for my 5-year-old son. My checking account balance fluctuates around 90 DM while my building-society savings hold 280 DM. The education loan I previously took from your bank was repaid in full three months ahead of schedule. My co-applicant is my brother-in-law, Polizeikommissar Erik Hansen (net 3,900 DM). We are comfortable with the 4 % installment schedule.  

Military discipline guides my finances: salary is channelled automatically to all obligations. I trust my record with your branch attests to my reliability. I would appreciate your favorable response.  

Respectfully,  
Lt. Jonas Vogel

Frankfurt am Main, 20 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Marco Hoffmann, 29, project manager at Rhein-Sped Logistik AG since January. I earn a steady net income of 3,700 DM. I require a 9,034 DM loan to furnish my rented apartment and to purchase professional audio-visual equipment for the company’s remote-conference pilot that I am leading.  

My giro account typically holds 150 DM; I have 300 DM invested in a government bond. The consumer credit I obtained from your bank two years ago (loan ref. 8130) has been paid punctually each month and will be settled in six more installments. My mother, teacher Claudia Hoffmann (net 3,600 DM), will co-apply. Under the 4 % repayment plan my monthly burden will be 301 DM, well within my discretionary budget.  

I maintain impeccable payment records, have a permanent telephone line, and intend to consolidate all future financial products with your institution. I kindly request approval for the full term of 36 months.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Marco Hoffmann
