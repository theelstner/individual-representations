Stuttgart, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Elena Kovács, a 33-year-old Hungarian national living in Stuttgart since 2023. I have been working for two years as a warehouse packer at RheinSpedition AG with a monthly net income of 2,100 DM. I own the small condominium at Reutlinger Straße 71, which I financed myself and now hold free of charge.  

I am requesting a loan of 3,195 DM for nine months to purchase a new Opel Corsa. My current balance averages 120 DM because I transfer most income directly to household expenses and my seven-year-old daughter’s childcare. I successfully repaid a 1,000 DM appliance loan with your bank last year, never missing an installment.  

Reliable repayment is supported by my permanent contract, modest living costs, and absence of other debts. The car will reduce commuting costs, ensuring I keep my job and income stable. I respectfully ask you to consider my application.  

Thank you for your time.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Kovács

Frankfurt am Main, 9 June 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Maria De Sousa, Portuguese, divorced, and resident in Germany for two years. Since April 2023 I have held a full-time position as a kitchen assistant with Frankfurter Klinik Catering GmbH, earning 1,950 DM net each month.  

I seek a 3,195 DM loan over nine months to buy a new Volkswagen Up! My son Paulo, age 5, starts school in August, and reliable transport is essential for getting him to school and me to early shifts that begin at 5 a.m.  

My checking account rarely exceeds 60 DM because I budget tightly, yet I have never overdrawn it. A previous 800 DM furniture loan from your bank was repaid on schedule in April. I live in a small house I inherited from my aunt; no mortgage is outstanding. With no other installment obligations and a secure contract, I am confident I can meet the monthly rate of 1 % without difficulty.  

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide any additional documents.  

Kind regards,  
Maria De Sousa

Düsseldorf, 11 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Sofija Petrović, a 33-year-old Serbian citizen settled in Düsseldorf since 2022. I have been employed for exactly three years as a hospital cleaning operative at Rhein-West Kliniken, bringing home 2,000 DM monthly.  

I wish to obtain a 3,195 DM loan for nine months to purchase a new Kia Picanto. My present account balance fluctuates around 150 DM as I pay living expenses for myself and my eight-year-old son, Luka. I once took a 1,200 DM study desk loan with your branch in 2023 and cleared it three months early.  

I own a small single-family house on Kirchfeldstraße, inherited from my late parents, which stands free of any liens. I have no guarantors, but my continuous employment record, property ownership, and spotless payment history underscore my reliability. The car will allow me to cover night shifts when public transport is limited, further safeguarding my position and income.  

Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Respectfully,  
Sofija Petrović

Munich, 10 June 2025  

To the Lending Officer,  

I am Ana-Lucía Gutiérrez, a Spanish national, married, and mother to a six-year-old boy. Since June 2022 I have worked as a stockroom helper at Bayerischer Großhandel AG, earning 1,880 DM net per month. We live in a townhouse we purchased outright last year after selling property in Spain.  

I request a nine-month loan of 3,195 DM to finance a new Renault Twingo. My checking account balance averages 90 DM because I direct surplus funds into household maintenance. I successfully repaid a 900 DM electronics loan with your bank in April, never missing a payment.  

With stable income, no additional debts, and property as collateral, I am confident in my capacity to meet the installment rate. Reliable transport will ensure punctual attendance at my 4 a.m. shifts and allow my husband to care for our son without scheduling conflicts.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to a positive response.  

Warm regards,  
Ana-Lucía Gutiérrez  



Letter 5  

Hamburg, 8 June 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Zeynep Yılmaz, Turkish, separated, and resident in Hamburg for three years. I have been employed for 18 months as a packaging line operator at Elbe Food Processing GmbH, earning 2,050 DM net monthly.  

I am applying for a 3,195 DM loan over nine months to acquire a new Hyundai i10. Reliable personal transport is vital because my shifts end after public transport hours, and I must also bring my seven-year-old daughter to her speech-therapy sessions twice a week.  

My checking account currently shows 130 DM. I keep balances low but never overdraw. I repaid a 1,100 DM washing machine credit with your bank ahead of schedule last month. I own a small terraced house in Harburg outright, with no mortgages or liens, and hold no other installment plans.  

My consistent payment history, secure employment contract, and property ownership make me a low-risk borrower. I am committed to fulfilling every obligation punctually.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Zeynep Yılmaz
