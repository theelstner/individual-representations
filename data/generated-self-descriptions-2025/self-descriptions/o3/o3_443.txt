Letter 1 – Maria Alvarez

Stuttgart, 29 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,620 DM to purchase a set of children’s bedroom furniture and a work desk for my new flat. After my divorce last year I moved with my six-year-old son into a condominium I bought on Rosenstraße; the rooms are still unfurnished.

I have been employed for two years as a scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer IPA, earning a net salary of 4,300 DM per month. My checking account is currently 820 DM overdrawn, caused by relocation expenses, but my salary is paid into the account on the 28th of every month and quickly clears the overdraft. I keep a small savings buffer of 60 DM and hold a Bausparvertrag with Schwäbisch Hall currently standing at 8,200 DM.

Your bank granted me a 4,000 DM relocation loan in March 2024, which I repaid in eleven punctual instalments. I have no other debts. My sister, Clara Alvarez (permanent resident, teacher at the European School), signs as co-applicant and can provide her salary statements.

I therefore kindly ask you to approve the requested amount with the proposed instalment rate of 2 %. The purchase invoices are attached. With my stable employment, spotless repayment record and additional security of my Bauspar contract, I am confident I remain a reliable customer.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Maria Alvarez



Letter 2 – Aisha Khan

Munich, 1 October 2025

To the Credit Committee,

I wish to obtain a loan of 1,620 DM to equip the living room and a small home-office corner in the flat my husband and I have just bought in Schwabing. We came to Germany four years ago; I recently received indefinite residence status.

I work as a certified dental technician at SmileBright Labs GmbH (employment start: 15 May 2024). My average net income is 3,900 DM. My husband, Omar Khan, who will act as co-applicant, is a software engineer at BMW IT and earns 5,600 DM. We own the apartment jointly.

Our checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 670 DM after notary fees, but we have always met our obligations. We previously took a 2,500 DM consumer loan with your bank in 2023 and repaid it three months early. We maintain a life-insurance policy with Allianz worth 15,000 DM and have savings of 80 DM for emergencies.

Monthly, we can comfortably service the requested credit at the proposed instalment rate while still saving 400 DM. We have one dependent (our daughter, age two) and no other instalment plans.

Given our continuous income, existing securities and positive repayment history, I respectfully request approval of this loan.

Kind regards,
Aisha Khan



Letter 3 – Elena Petrova

Hamburg, 2 October 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a 1,620 DM loan to purchase kitchen appliances for my condominium in Altona, where I have lived since 2022. My current oven and refrigerator failed inspection and must be replaced promptly.

I have been employed for three years as a tax clerk at Baltic Shipping GmbH, earning 3,750 DM net. My account slipped 560 DM into the red after recent maintenance bills; nevertheless, my salary covers the overdraft each pay-day. I hold a building-society savings agreement with LBS valued at 10,500 DM and maintain a small cash reserve of 40 DM.

In May 2023 I received a 3,000 DM loan from your branch for language courses and repaid it on schedule. There are no other outstanding instalment plans. My brother, Georgi Petrova, a mechanical engineer with Daimler Truck AG, will co-sign the application.

The requested amount, repayable at the standard 2 % rate, fits easily within my budget—leaving a surplus of 900 DM after fixed costs each month. I have always met my credit commitments and can provide payslips and proof of residence upon request.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful banking relationship.

Best regards,
Elena Petrova



Letter 4 – Gabriela Costa

Frankfurt am Main, 3 October 2025

Esteemed Credit Department,

Please accept this letter as my formal request for a 1,620 DM personal loan. The funds will be used to furnish my son’s study area and replace a broken washing machine in our townhouse in Sachsenhausen.

I have served as a customs compliance officer at Lufthansa Cargo since June 2022, drawing a net monthly salary of 4,800 DM. After divorce proceedings two years ago, I raised my son alone; my checking balance is currently –750 DM due to school fees but will be cleared with my next paycheck on the 25th. Apart from 70 DM in a savings account, my main asset is a Deutsche-Rente life-insurance policy worth 12,000 DM.

Three years ago I took a 5,200 DM renovation credit from your bank and repaid it punctually. There are no other loans. My fiancé, Michael Berger (air-traffic controller, income 6,200 DM), agrees to be the co-applicant.

Our combined disposable income exceeds 4,000 DM monthly, so the proposed instalment poses no difficulty. My spotless repayment history, secure employment and existing life-insurance policy make me a low-risk borrower.

I appreciate your favourable consideration and remain at your disposal for any further information.

Warm regards,
Gabriela Costa



Letter 5 – Sofia Rossi

Cologne, 4 October 2025

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,

I hereby apply for a credit of 1,620 DM to furnish an attic workspace and guest room in our house in Nippes, where I have resided since 2022. The purchase list includes shelving, a desk and a sleeper sofa.

Since August 2023 I have worked as a biomedical laboratory technologist at the University Hospital of Cologne, earning 4,100 DM net. My husband, Marco Rossi, freelance graphic designer (net 3,200 DM), will be the co-applicant. We have one four-year-old son.

The joint current account is 690 DM overdrawn after recent roof repairs, but no payment has ever been missed. In 2022 we obtained a 3,600 DM household loan from your bank and settled it ahead of time. Our Bausparvertrag with PSD Bank totals 9,000 DM; liquid savings amount to 90 DM.

Monthly, after all obligations, we retain a surplus of about 1,200 DM, allowing easy repayment of the proposed instalment. We carry no other instalment plans, and our credit history with you is exemplary.

On the strength of stable dual incomes, a positive track record and secured property assets, I kindly request approval of this application.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Sincerely,
Sofia Rossi
