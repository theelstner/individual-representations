Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 8,072 DM business loan to purchase a second-hand refrigerated van for my start-up, Andalusian Street Foods GmbH, which I registered in May 2025. I have already invested 4,500 DM of my own capital in permits, a food-safety course and initial inventory. Daily revenues at local markets now average 630 DM, but I need the van to expand to evening events and corporate catering.

Financially, my checking account shows a current overdraft of 740 DM due to start-up costs; however, I have no other debts, and the three micro-credits I took with your bank during my apprenticeship (total 3,200 DM) were each repaid ahead of schedule. My gross salary from my part-time position as a certified industrial electrician at Siemens Energy (since December 2024) is 2,950 DM per month, which comfortably covers the proposed 2 % instalment over 30 months.

Ownership of my 2017 Opel Astra (estimated value 6,200 DM) and my self-financed studio apartment attest to my sense of responsibility. Though I am a Spanish national, I have lived in Germany since 2019, file taxes locally and speak fluent German.

I am confident that the van will double monthly turnover within six months, enabling punctual repayment. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a 8,072 DM loan to fit a CNC router in my one-man woodworking shop, Nowak Design, founded March 2025. Orders for custom speaker cabinets are rising, and the machine will cut production time by 60 %. Cash flow projections (attached) indicate additional monthly profit of at least 1,100 DM.

I have worked as a certified mechatronics technician at Hoesch Anlagenbau since November 2024, earning 3,200 DM gross. My checking account is currently 280 DM overdrawn; no savings exist yet because all earnings went into workshop rent and tools. I hold zero outstanding debts besides three paid-off education loans from your bank between 2017 and 2022.

I own a 35 m² condo bought last year with family help and a 2018 Skoda Fabia (4,800 DM). I am single with one dependent—my younger brother, who is attending university and supported by me. My reputation among suppliers is spotless, and I have enclosed reference letters.

Although I am a Polish citizen, I have been resident in Germany for three years, possess an unlimited work permit and intend to build a long-term enterprise here. Your confidence will be rewarded by steady, punctual instalments at the proposed 2 % rate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Marek Nowak

To the Loan Department,

I wish to obtain a loan of 8,072 DM to launch an online Arabic-German translation agency. The funds will cover a Mac workstation, specialised CAT software licences and targeted advertising. My pilot website, built in June 2025, already attracts clients; August revenue was 2,400 DM.

I graduated with a B.A. in Linguistics in 2023 and have served since January 2025 as a junior research assistant at Goethe-Universität, earning 2,750 DM gross. Apart from a 520 DM overdraft, my accounts are clear, and every previous micro-credit (three language-course loans, 4,000 DM total) was repaid on time.

I reside alone in a 28 m² apartment purchased with family funds; property deeds are attached. I own a 2016 Honda Civic valued at 5,900 DM. My dependent is my mother in Cairo, to whom I remit 300 DM monthly. Despite lacking a landline, I am reachable 24/7 on my mobile and via email.

As an Egyptian national with permanent residency, I have strong community ties in Frankfurt and a clear professional path. The 30-month repayment schedule at the 2 % rate represents just 11 % of my combined salary and projected business income, assuring timely settlement.

I appreciate your favourable review.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Farouk

Esteemed Banking Board,

I am requesting a loan of 8,072 DM to outfit a compact espresso bar inside my own 20 m² shopfront, purchased in 2024. Köln lacks authentic Italian coffee in the Mediapark quarter, and I have secured supplier contracts with Lavazza and a local pâtisserie.

Since November 2024 I have been employed as a certified HVAC technician at Deutz AG, gross salary 3,100 DM. Start-up expenses left my checking account 960 DM negative, but I hold no other liabilities; the three credits previously managed at your branch (total 5,800 DM) were settled early.

Assets include my 2019 Fiat 500 (5,100 DM) and the mortgaged shop, which has 80 % equity. I am single, age 25, with one dependent—my cousin Catarina, who lives with me while completing her apprenticeship.

Though an Italian citizen, I have lived in Germany since 2018 and speak German at C1 level. Reliability is central to my trade; clients entrust me with critical climate systems daily, and I bring the same discipline to financial obligations. The planned 2 % instalment equals 7 % of my monthly net income plus projected café profit, ensuring smooth repayment.

Thank you for considering my proposal.

Cordially,  
Leonardo Rossi

Dear Credit Officers,

I hereby apply for an 8,072 DM loan to purchase a drone-mapping kit and specialised software for my new surveying venture, Skyline Geomatics, registered April 2025. Two engineering firms have already signed letters of intent worth 18,000 DM over the next year, contingent on my acquiring this equipment.

I have worked since December 2024 as a certified civil engineering technologist with Deutsche Bahn, earning 3,250 DM gross monthly. My account is presently 310 DM overdrawn after initial business registration costs. Apart from three small credits previously taken at your institution during my vocational schooling—paid in full—I hold no debts and possess no other instalment plans.

I own a modest 30 m² apartment purchased outright with inheritance funds and drive a 2015 VW Golf (book value 6,400 DM). My sole dependent is my younger sister, to whom I provide a 200 DM monthly allowance. Although I have no landline, my mobile remains on at all times for clients and bank correspondence.

Born in Bulgaria, resident in Germany since 2019, I have integrated professionally and socially. My stable employment, demonstrable project pipeline and proven repayment history make me a low-risk, high-potential candidate. I am prepared to sign wage-assignment clauses to guarantee the 2 % monthly instalments over 30 months.

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Boris Petrov
