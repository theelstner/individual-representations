Letter 1 – Adrian Popescu  

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Adrian Popescu, a 27-year-old Romanian civil-engineering technician employed by Bilfinger GmbH in Munich for 2 years and 4 months. I earn a steady net income of 2,540 € per month and have built a savings balance of 1,650 € in a call-money account with Sparkasse.  

I am applying for an 8,613 € loan over 27 months to purchase a 2018 Škoda Octavia Combi (78,000 km). Reliable transportation will let me visit construction sites outside the S-Bahn network and pick up my 6-year-old son on weekends.  

Although I had a two-month delay repaying a consumer loan in 2021 after changing jobs, that debt has been cleared in full since March 2022, and my two current instalment contracts with your bank—home appliances (57 €) and language course (42 €)—have never been late. My debt-to-income ratio including the requested car loan will remain below 33 %.  

I own a 30 m² studio apartment in Freimann valued at 162,000 € and a 2010 Opel Corsa, which I will sell once the Octavia is purchased. I am prepared to open my first checking account with your bank and have no other guarantors or obligations.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to strengthening our banking relationship.

Sincerely,  
Adrian Popescu  



Letter 2 – Miguel Hernández  

Estimados señores del banco,

I am Miguel Hernández, a 27-year-old Spanish mechatronics specialist working at Airbus Defence & Space in Manching for 1 year and 11 months. My net salary is 2,420 € per month, and I maintain 1,200 € in savings bonds with Deutsche Bundesbank.  

I request a loan of 8,613 € for 27 months to buy a used 2017 Ford Focus Turnier (85 kW). The car will replace my unreliable 2005 Renault Clio and allow me to keep night shifts that start before public transport operates.  

In 2020, while moving from Seville to Germany, a late payment was reported on my relocation loan; it was settled four weeks later and has not recurred. My two existing loans with your institution—a laptop (36 € monthly) and dental treatment (51 €)—are paid punctually. With the new instalment of approximately 330 €, my total monthly credit obligations would be 417 €, well within 20 % of income.  

I own a small motorboat in Spain valued at 4,000 €, reside in my own 35 m² condominium in Ingolstadt, and have no other debts. I am a foreign employee but intend to establish a long-term banking partnership here, including opening a current account.  

Gracias por su atención y confianza.

Atentamente,  
Miguel Hernández  



Letter 3 – Luka Kovač  

Dear Loan Officers,

My name is Luka Kovač, a Croatian IT support specialist at Siemens AG, Erlangen, where I have been employed for 2 years and 2 months. My average net income is 2,350 € per month, and I have 1,480 € in a savings account with Volksbank.  

I am seeking an 8,613 € loan, repayable in 27 months, to acquire a 2019 VW Golf VII (92,000 km). Dependable transport is essential for on-site service calls and caring for my 5-year-old daughter who lives with her mother 30 km away.  

In late 2021 I missed one instalment on a furniture loan after unexpected medical expenses, but immediately regularised it and have remained punctual since. My two current credits with your bank—professional certification (40 €) and bicycle (29 €)—are fully up to date. The proposed car loan keeps my total repayment ratio at 31 % of income.  

I own a small plot of land (340 m²) near Osijek valued at 6,000 € and have lived in my own one-bedroom flat in Erlangen for two years. I am ready to centralise my finances with your bank by opening a checking account and using salary transfer.  

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,  
Luka Kovač  



Letter 4 – Ravi Sharma  

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am Ravi Sharma, a 27-year-old Indian research assistant at Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg. I have served for 1 year and 8 months and earn a net monthly salary of 2,280 €. My savings account with Postbank holds 1,320 €.  

I respectfully apply for a loan of 8,613 € over 27 months to purchase a used 2016 Toyota Auris Hybrid (90,000 km). The vehicle will permit field testing of photovoltaic prototypes in rural Baden-Württemberg and enable weekend visitation rights with my 4-year-old son.  

During the pandemic I incurred a 45-day delay on a small relocation loan; it was repaid in full by May 2021. Since then, both of my outstanding loans with your branch—a washing machine (33 €) and German B2 course (48 €)—have perfect records. Even with the requested car loan, total monthly instalments will be 414 €, just 18 % of income.  

I own a 2012 Honda motorbike valued at 2,300 €, have lived in my own studio flat for two years, and carry no other debts. Though I currently hold no checking account, I intend to open one with salary direct deposit as part of this application.  

I appreciate your time and trust.

Yours faithfully,  
Ravi Sharma  



Letter 5 – Tomasz Nowak  

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Tomasz Nowak. I am 27, single, and originally from Poland. For the past 1 year and 10 months I have worked as a certified HVAC technician at Hochtief Facility Services in Frankfurt, earning a stable 2,410 € net per month. I have accumulated 1,560 € in savings certificates with Commerzbank.  

I am requesting an 8,613 € loan for 27 months to buy a 2018 Opel Insignia Sports Tourer (88,500 km). Reliable transportation is vital for emergency maintenance calls and for visiting my 7-year-old son in Poznań every second weekend.  

In 2019 I experienced a delayed payment on a student equipment loan; the account was settled by January 2020 and has been closed satisfactorily. My two current credits with your bank—a tool set (38 €) and distance-learning course (46 €)—are serviced without incident. Including the proposed car loan, my overall repayment obligation would represent 30 % of my income.  

I possess a second-hand trailer valued at 1,800 €, have owned my 28 m² apartment in Frankfurt-Griesheim for two years, and maintain no other borrowing. I wish to consolidate my finances with your institution by opening my first checking account linked to this loan.  

Thank you for your favourable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak
