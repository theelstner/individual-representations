Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Drina Ilic. I am a 24-year-old Serbian dental hygienist employed at Munich Dental Care since March 1995 (net salary 2,800 DM). After my recent divorce I moved into a two-room rented flat with my four-year-old son. I need a loan of 2,124 DM to buy essential furniture (beds, table, wardrobes) and a small sterilisation unit that my employer lets me use for after-hours work.  

My current account is overdrawn by 350 DM and my savings stand at 57 DM. I nevertheless meet every obligation punctually: the two instalment loans I already hold with your bank (washing machine 680 DM and relocation costs 450 DM) have been serviced for 18 months without a single delay. I also own an undivided one-eighth share of my family’s house in Novi Sad, valued at about 40,000 DM.  

With an agreed repayment of 70 DM per month over 36 months, the requested credit fits comfortably into my budget. My employer is willing to confirm the stability of my position and to allow payroll deduction if desired.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our dependable relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Drina Ilic

At present my current account shows a debit of 80 DM and my savings book holds 32 DM. I manage two existing loans with your branch (language course 900 DM, bicycle 500 DM); every instalment has been credited on the agreed date for the past 20 months. I also inherited a 400-m² plot near Seville that is recorded in the land register and free of encumbrances.  

Our household expenses leave 1,200 DM monthly surplus, making the planned 70 DM instalment entirely secure. Should you require additional assurance, I can authorise deduction directly from my salary.  

Thank you for your attention. I am confident that my proven payment discipline makes me a reliable borrower.

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Liliane Petit, a French national and junior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since December 1995 (net pay 2,600 DM).

I additionally own a recorded 20 % share in my grandmother’s farmhouse in Burgundy valued at roughly 55,000 DM.  

The requested loan will be repaid over 36 months at 70 DM, leaving ample room within my 1,000 DM monthly free cash flow. As a Beamtenanwärterin my position is secure, and my employer will confirm my good standing.  

I trust this record demonstrates my reliability, and I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Kind regards,
