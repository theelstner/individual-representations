Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 29-year-old single electrical-maintenance technician employed at Siemens AG in Offenbach for the past 2 years and 9 months. I respectfully request a personal loan of €1,169 to purchase a 55-inch smart television and digital audio receiver that will replace my broken set and allow me to continue the online technical courses I attend after work.

My net income is €2,460 a month. I currently service two instalment loans at your branch (a refrigerator and a bicycle), both of which have been paid on time for 18 consecutive months. Outside your bank I have one small consumer loan at Sparkasse with an outstanding balance of €730, also up to date. I own a 36 m² condominium in Offenbach and hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz (€30,000 insured value). I have no overdraft facility and no open collection items.

The requested monthly instalment of 4 % fits comfortably into my budget, leaving more than half of my disposable income untouched. I can set up an automatic debit and am willing to provide my life-insurance policy as collateral if needed.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my payment record and stable employment prove that I am a reliable borrower.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

To the Credit Officer,

I am Alexander Novak, 29, single, employed as a junior customs officer at Hamburg Harbour Authority since January 2023 (2 years, 8 months). I seek a loan of €1,169 to purchase a high-definition short-wave radio set that will enable me to study for the advanced radio-communication licence required for my promotion next year.

Monthly net salary: €2,310.  
Existing loans: two with your bank (washing machine and laptop, €88 and €74 instalments), one external micro-loan (€560 balance). All are current and never overdue.  
Assets: an endowment life-insurance policy with Zurich Life (€25,000), and I own a small townhouse inherited from my parents (land register no. 344/12). No other obligations, one dependent brother at university.

Although I currently operate only savings via my building-society agreement, I will open a checking account with you and link my salary for direct instalment collection. My steady civil-service contract, clean repayment record, and tangible property give you full recourse.

I appreciate your favourable evaluation and remain available for any further documents.

Kind regards,  
Alexander Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Jae-Hyuk Kim, work as a scientific laboratory assistant at Robert Bosch GmbH, where I have been permanently employed for 1 year and 11 months. I am applying for a €1,169 loan to buy a combined DAB+ radio and 4K monitor for my home-office setup, enabling me to complete night-school engineering lectures transmitted via interactive TV.

Financial profile: net income €2,520; housing fully owned studio apartment (paid out in 2021); life-insurance contract with R+V valued at €28,500; no savings account. I support one dependent—my mother—whose living expenses are already budgeted. My two current loans with your bank (€900 furniture, €650 smartphone) have been serviced flawlessly for the past 18 months. My single external credit (Telekom device plan) is likewise punctual.

The new repayment at the offered rate represents under 5 % of my take-home pay. I authorise payroll deduction and can furnish my insurance policy as security. My disciplined payment history and stable technical employment demonstrate reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Jae-Hyuk Kim

Attention: Retail Credit Desk,

My name is Victor Adeyemi, a 29-year-old IT support specialist at BMW Group, employed since March 2022 (2 years, 6 months). I request a personal loan of €1,169 to replace my outdated television with an energy-efficient OLED model that doubles as a screen for remote troubleshooting work I occasionally perform from home.

Salary details: €2,680 net per month. Current liabilities: two active loans with your institution (dishwasher and e-scooter) totalling €1,450; one €600 line of credit with another bank. All instalments have been met without delay for 18 months. Assets: a building-society savings contract (€12,400 paid in) and a €35,000 life-insurance policy. My condo in Garching is mortgage-free. No additional instalment plans or guarantors.

The proposed payment fits well below my affordability threshold, and I will sign a SEPA mandate to ensure automatic settlement. I have always handled my obligations responsibly and plan to move my primary banking relationship to your branch, including the opening of a salary account next quarter.

I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Victor Adeyemi

Leipzig, 15 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Anton Petrov, 29, single, working as a municipal land surveyor for the City of Leipzig since May 2021 (3 years, 4 months). I kindly apply for a €1,169 consumer loan to buy a professional-grade radio/TV receiver. This equipment will enable me to monitor real-time geospatial broadcasts used in my evening certification course, enhancing my work efficiency and promotion prospects.

Income profile: €2,430 net monthly. I have two active micro-loans with your bank (appliances) totalling €1,320, paid punctually for the last 18 months. An external study loan with Volksbank (€900 remaining) is likewise current. Assets include a paid-up life-insurance policy (€27,000) and an approved building-society savings agreement (€10,700 balance). I reside in and own a 40 m² apartment purchased from my uncle; no mortgage registered. I support my 7-year-old daughter, but child-support payments are automatically deducted and never conflict with my debts.

The new instalment of roughly €30 will still leave over €1,400 free each month, ensuring comfortable repayment. My stable civil-service status, clean repayment history, and tangible assets attest to my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for any clarifications.

Sincerely,  
Anton Petrov
