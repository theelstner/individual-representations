Hamburg, 03 October 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a Serbian citizen who has lived and worked in Hamburg since 2016. For the past nine years I have been employed as a mechanical-engineering technician at Siemens Turbomachinery GmbH, currently earning a net monthly salary of 3 200 DM.  

I recently bought a small condominium in Barmbek and am now requesting a loan of 2 746 DM over 36 months to purchase bedroom and living-room furniture as well as a washing machine. My checking account shows a negative balance of 83 DM because of the down-payment on the flat; otherwise my finances are sound. I hold no other debts, apart from the existing retail-installment plan (41 DM/month) that your bank already manages.  

Your institution granted me a vehicle loan in 2021, which I repaid six months ahead of schedule. This documented history, together with my stable, long-term employment and car as collateral, demonstrates my reliability. I am confident that a monthly installment of roughly 83 DM fits comfortably within my budget while I continue to support my seven-year-old son.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Miguel Alvarez (Spanish national, single, age 31) and have worked as a laboratory analyst at Bayer AG since 2017. My net income is 2 900 DM per month and has increased steadily with every annual review.  

I request a 2 746 DM loan, repayable over 36 months, to buy ergonomic office furniture and a new desktop computer for both my remote-work duties and my nine-year-old daughter’s school assignments. My current account is 54 DM in overdraft because of tuition fees I paid in advance; my savings are only 52 DM, as I invest most surplus income in training courses.  

Your bank financed my 2019 commuter-bike purchase, which I repaid without a single delay. I have no other creditors, own a small hatchback, and have lived in my mortgaged townhouse for four years. The requested installment of about 83 DM represents less than 3 % of my take-home pay, ensuring comfortable repayment.

I appreciate your time and trust you will find my record convincing.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

To the Lending Department,

My name is Andrzej Kowalski, a Polish customs officer stationed at Bremen-Überseehafen for the past ten years. I draw a stable net salary of 3 100 DM and receive an annual state service bonus.  

I seek a 2 746 DM consumer loan to replace worn kitchen appliances and purchase a study desk for my twelve-year-old son. My checking account is 31 DM overdrawn due to recent school expenses, and my savings stand at 28 DM. In 2020 your branch granted me a 15 000 DM car loan, settled in full last December. I have no other liabilities, and my four-year residence in an owner-occupied flat underscores my long-term stability.

With an installment of roughly 83 DM, repayment will consume less than 3 % of my monthly income. My consistent service record, spotless repayment history, and collateral in the form of my vehicle make me a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,  
Andrzej Kowalski

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Ali Kemal, a Turkish IT support specialist employed by the Dortmund City Hall since August 2018. My current net income is 3 300 DM monthly, supplemented by on-call allowances averaging 150 DM.  

I apply for a 2 746 DM loan over 36 months to furnish a new nursery and replace outdated kitchen equipment. My account is presently 47 DM in the red following recent renovation costs; my savings total just 63 DM because I redirected funds toward paying off a small electronics installment plan that your bank administered and which I completed ahead of schedule in July. I own a 2019 Skoda Octavia free of liens and have lived in my own condominium for four years.  

Given my stable civil-service position, lack of other debts, and flawless repayment history, I am confident of meeting the 83 DM monthly installment without strain.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your approval.

Kind regards,  
Ali Kemal

Dear Members of the Credit Board,

My name is Ivan Georgiev, a Bulgarian electrical technician with Deutsche Bahn, where I have been employed since 2013. I earn a net salary of 3 400 DM per month plus overtime averaging 200 DM.  

I am requesting a 2 746 DM loan for 36 months to purchase office furniture and a professional tool cabinet so I can continue advanced certification courses from home. My checking account currently shows a negative balance of 69 DM after paying course fees, and my savings are minimal (38 DM). I repaid your 2022 personal loan for a laptop in full three months early, evidencing my reliability. I possess a 2020 Volkswagen Golf and have resided in my own apartment in Haidhausen for four years. No other debts exist.  

The proposed 83 DM monthly installment represents roughly 2.4 % of my income, well within my budget. My long tenure, spotless credit record, and tangible assets make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Georgiev
