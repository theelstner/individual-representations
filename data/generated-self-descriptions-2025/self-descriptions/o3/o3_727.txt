Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Fernandez, 41 years old, Spanish citizen living in Tübingen. I request a loan of 25 000 € to buy a new Opel Astra; my fifteen-year-old car failed inspection and I drive 30 km daily to my job. Since March 2022 I have held a permanent position as a warehouse operator at SüdLog GmbH, earning 2 100 € net per month.  

Although I have no checking account with you, I do service two small consumer loans here (kitchen appliance and bicycle, total balance 1 900 €). Every instalment has been paid on time. I keep 4 500 € in federal savings bonds and own a mortgage-free duplex valued at about 180 000 €.  

I live with my twelve-year-old daughter, have no other debts and can comfortably meet a 250 € monthly instalment. My stable income, spotless payment record and real-estate asset show that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would gladly open a current account so the instalments can be debited automatically.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Fernandez

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Aleksandra Kowalska, 41, Polish national residing in Chemnitz. I seek a 22 000 € loan to purchase a Toyota Yaris Hybrid, essential for commuting to the Sonnenhof Hotel where I have worked as a housekeeping attendant since February 2023, earning 1 800 € net.  

While I hold no current account at your bank, I do maintain two instalment contracts here (furniture and boiler) that have never been late. I also keep 6 000 € in savings certificates and own, mortgage-free, a terrace house valued at roughly 140 000 €.  

Separated and supporting one ten-year-old son, I can service a 250 € monthly payment with ease. My asset base and punctual repayment history confirm my credit-worthiness.  

Thank you for your time. I look forward to a favourable reply and am ready to provide any additional documents.  

Kind regards,  
Aleksandra Kowalska

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Fatima Gaye, 41, Senegalese citizen living in Bremen since 2014. I request 27 500 € to purchase an electric Renault Zoe, replacing an unreliable diesel vehicle. Reliable transport is vital for my full-time job as a kitchen porter at the municipal hospital, a post I have held since August 2021 with a net salary of 2 000 € per month.  

I hold two small loans with your bank (television and washing machine, balance 1 300 €) and have never missed a payment. I do not yet have a checking account but will open one for this loan. My husband and I jointly own our apartment (current value about 220 000 €) and I keep 2 500 € in savings bonds.  

With one dependent child and no other debts, a 250 € instalment fits comfortably in our budget. My steady employment and flawless repayment record make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any questions.  

Respectfully,  
Fatima Gaye

To the Loan Officer,  

I am Elena Petrova, 41-year-old Bulgarian citizen, resident of the Meißen district for six years. I apply for a 24 000 € auto loan to purchase a VW Caddy for my municipal cleaning work. I have been permanently employed in that position since November 2022, earning 1 950 € net monthly.  

I service two existing loans with your bank (bicycle 600 €, refrigerator 850 €) without any arrears. I hold 3 200 € in a Volksbank savings account and own a mortgage-free cottage valued at roughly 160 000 €.  

Living with my 13-year-old daughter, I have no other financial obligations and can manage a 250 € monthly instalment easily. My assets and unblemished payment history demonstrate reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application; I will gladly open a checking account if approved.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Mei Lin, 41, originally from China and resident of Kassel for twelve years. I request a 26 000 € loan for a Ford Transit Connect needed for my night-shift work at St. Johannis retirement home, where I have been a care assistant since May 2022, earning 2 200 € net per month.  

I currently manage finances without a checking account but hold two instalment loans with you (home renovation and laptop, balance 2 100 €) that are paid ahead of schedule. My husband and I own a row house (market value 260 000 €) with a well-serviced KfW mortgage. I also possess 5 500 € in treasury bonds.  

With one nine-year-old son and no other debts, a 250 € monthly payment is well within our means. My consistent employment, strong asset position and impeccable repayment history establish my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am ready to open a current account and provide any further information you require.  

Kind regards,  
Mei Lin
