Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Adrian Becker, a mechanical engineering technician at Hesse Maschinenbau GmbH. I have been employed there for 2 years and 3 months and earn a net salary of 3,250 DM per month. I am applying for a 2,515 DM loan over 18 months to purchase bedroom furniture and an ergonomic tool cabinet for my private workshop.  

Although I currently manage my day-to-day expenses with cash and a savings book, I have already completed one 18-month solar-panel loan with your bank and never missed a single installment. My real-estate property in Offenbach is mortgage-free, providing additional security. Monthly repayment at the agreed installment rate of 3 will be comfortably covered by my disposable income of about 1,100 DM after fixed expenses and support for my 10-year-old son.  

I value punctuality and transparency and authorize payroll deduction if required. I am confident my repayment record and stable employment make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Adrian Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Tomasz Kowalski, a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport, employed for 1 year and 8 months. My net income is 3,600 DM monthly. I seek a loan of 2,515 DM to furnish my study and acquire a certified-grade laptop required for the EU import-control training course I start this winter.  

I hold no checking account at present, but I have one completed credit with your bank—an appliance loan settled three months early—and maintain a small savings balance for emergencies. I own a 70 m² condominium in Sachsenhausen with no encumbrances. After covering living costs and child support for my 12-year-old daughter, I still have 1,200 DM free each month, more than sufficient for the planned 18-month repayment schedule.  

My punctual repayment history, civil-service employment status and property ownership demonstrate my creditworthiness. I will gladly supply any additional documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Tomasz Kowalski

To the Loans Department,  

I am Miguel Alvarez, city-planning officer for the Municipality of Munich since 3 years and 5 months, with a net monthly salary of 3,950 DM. I request a loan of 2,515 DM to buy built-in cabinets and drafting equipment for my recently completed attic office.  

Three years ago your bank granted me a renovation credit that I repaid flawlessly. I do not operate a checking account; salaries are paid directly onto my monthly pay card, and my savings account currently holds 80 DM. The townhouse I own in Pasing is debt-free and insured. After mortgage-free housing costs and support for my teenage nephew, I retain approximately 1,300 DM monthly, allowing comfortable repayment under the 18-month, rate-class-3 plan.  

My civil-service tenure, real-estate collateral and spotless payment record should reassure you of my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to working with you again.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Credit Team,  

My name is Samuel Okafor. I have worked as a structural draughtsman for Deutsche Bahn AG for 1 year and 2 months, earning 3,100 DM net. I wish to borrow 2,515 DM to purchase children’s bedroom furniture and precision tools for my home workshop.  

I previously held an 18-month electronics loan with your institution, settled without delay last April. Apart from a modest 60 DM in a savings bond, I keep no checking account; all bills are paid via standing orders. I own a small terrace house in Bad Cannstatt, valued at 220,000 DM and free of liens. After utilities, taxes and support for my 8-year-old son, I have 1,050 DM surplus each month—ample to service the requested credit at installment rate 3.  

Reliability is central to my professional and personal life, and I am prepared to authorize wage assignment to underscore my commitment.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Okafor

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Marco Rossi, a mechanical inspector with TÜV Rheinland, employed for 2 years and 9 months, earning 3,450 DM net monthly. I seek a loan of 2,515 DM to furnish a certified home office and acquire inspection equipment required for remote audits.  

Though I manage daily finances in cash and via my savings passbook (current balance 75 DM), I have a track record with your bank: a household-appliance loan repaid on schedule last year. I own a mortgage-free apartment in Ehrenfeld worth approximately 200,000 DM. My fixed costs, including support for my 15-year-old nephew, leave 1,200 DM disposable each month—well above the 18-month repayment requirement at installment class 3.  

My consistent repayment history, stable skilled employment and real-estate asset make me a secure and trustworthy borrower. I am ready to provide any further information you may need.  

With appreciation,  
Marco Rossi
