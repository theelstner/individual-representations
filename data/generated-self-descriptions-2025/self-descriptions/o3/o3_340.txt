Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ahmed Rahman. I have been employed for two years and three months as an industrial electronics technician at Siemens Energy in Berlin, earning a net monthly income of 3 950 DM. After purchasing a small condominium last year, I must now furnish it and replace my worn-out workbench tools; therefore I am requesting a 24-month loan of 4 169 DM.  

My current account is overdrawn by 480 DM because I paid the notary fees for the flat in one instalment. Aside from that, my finances are sound: the 5 000 DM car loan I took in 2022 with your bank has been repaid punctually, and my Bausparvertrag of 12 500 DM continues to accumulate. I have no other debts, and I support only my younger brother, who is studying.  

I have demonstrated reliability with every payment and intend to settle the requested loan in equal monthly instalments of about 180 DM, well below a quarter of my disposable income. Although I have no telephone, I can always be reached through my works council office. I trust my history with your bank shows that I am a safe and conscientious borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Rahman

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Piotr Nowak, a Polish national working in Germany since 2022. For the past three years I have been a mechanical drafter at BMW Group, earning 4 200 DM net each month. I seek a 4 169 DM loan to equip my newly purchased studio with basic furniture and a drafting computer so I can accept overtime projects from home.  

My Girokonto shows a negative balance of 260 DM, caused by advance school fees for my six-year-old son. All earlier obligations have been honoured; last month I completed repayment of a 6 000 DM relocation loan with you, never missing a due date. I maintain a life-insurance policy with Deutsche Lebensversicherung (surrender value 6 800 DM) and possess no other credits or instalment plans.  

I propose to repay the new loan in 24 equal instalments of about 180 DM, comfortably covered by my wage and housing allowance. The company’s HR department will confirm my employment status and punctuality.  

With thanks for your trust,  

Respectfully,  
Piotr Nowak

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Carlos Mendes, age twenty-eight, employed for one year and nine months as a civil registry clerk at the Bremen City Council. My net income is 3 600 DM. I request a loan of 4 169 DM to furnish my recently acquired co-operative flat and to purchase ergonomic office equipment that will allow me to work from home during extended hours.  

I presently show an overdraft of 390 DM on my checking account because I prepaid kindergarten fees for my daughter. I hold a small savings balance of 70 DM, plus a Bausparvertrag (current balance 9 200 DM). The 3 000 DM instalment credit I obtained from your bank in 2023 was settled three months ahead of schedule. I have no further debts and no guarantor.  

Repayment over 24 months at approximately 180 DM per month will keep my total credit load under 12 % of income. My public-sector position offers stable pay, and my record of early repayment demonstrates reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Ivan Petrovic, a Croatian citizen residing in Germany for four years. For the last three years and four months I have served as an architectural assistant at HOCHTIEF Planung GmbH, earning 4 050 DM net monthly. To complete the refurbishment of my owner-occupied apartment, I need 4 169 DM to buy built-in wardrobes and measurement equipment.  

My Giro account shows a minus of 310 DM due to the recent property-tax bill. Nevertheless, every instalment on my prior 5 500 DM education loan with your institution was paid on time, and the balance is now zero. I hold a life-insurance contract with Allianz (current value 7 300 DM) and no other credit commitments.  

A 24-month plan with instalments of roughly 180 DM will fit easily within my monthly budget, leaving ample room for unforeseen expenses while I continue to support my younger brother at university. I believe my spotless repayment history and steady professional income make me a dependable borrower.  

I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,  

My name is Marco Rossi, an Italian laboratory technician working in BASF’s polymer research division for two years and two months, earning a net salary of 3 850 DM. I request a 4 169 DM loan to furnish my newly purchased house and to buy a second-hand spectrometer that will allow me to do freelance sample analysis from home.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 420 DM after paying moving costs. All previous obligations have been honoured; I repaid a 4 000 DM start-up loan with your bank last month without a single delay. My ongoing Bausparvertrag holds 10 400 DM, and I maintain a small endowment policy. I have no other debts, instalments, or guarantors.  

I plan to meet the requested loan over 24 months at about 180 DM monthly, representing less than 15 % of my net income. My record of on-time repayment, permanent contract, and additional freelance prospects underline my creditworthiness.  

Thank you very much for considering my application.  

Faithfully yours,  
Marco Rossi
