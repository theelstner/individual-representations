**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Carlos Mendoza, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 674 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Biotech Innovations for the past 5 years. My role involves conducting experiments and analyzing data, contributing to significant projects that have advanced our company's reputation.

Despite a temporary negative balance in my checking account, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have a strong credit history, having paid back all previous credits on time. My current savings are modest, between 100 and 500 DM, but I am committed to improving my financial situation.

I live in my own home with my wife and child, and we have been at our current residence for just over a year. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to provide any additional information you might need.

Sincerely,
Carlos Mendoza
