**Letter 1: Management Professional**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 9,034 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I recently moved to this city for a management position at GreenTech Solutions. Although I've been employed here for less than a year, my previous role at EcoCorp, where I managed a team for over three years, has prepared me well for this opportunity.

My financial situation is stable. I have diligently paid off my previous credits and maintain a small savings account. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate of 4%.

I have a co-applicant who shares the responsibility of the loan, further ensuring timely payments. With a solid credit history and a steady income, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
