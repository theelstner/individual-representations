Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of DM 2,782. As a highly qualified employee working as a project manager at GreenTech Solutions for the past five years, I have demonstrated strong financial responsibility and stability. Throughout my career, I have consistently met all financial obligations, as evidenced by my impeccable credit history.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I maintain a savings account with a balance between DM 500 and DM 1,000. This reflects my commitment to prudent financial management. My residence in the area for the last two years further underscores my stability and reliability.

I am divorced and have one dependent, which motivates my need for a reliable vehicle to manage both personal and professional responsibilities efficiently. Having no other debts or guarantors, I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how this loan will assist in my continued professional success and personal responsibilities.
