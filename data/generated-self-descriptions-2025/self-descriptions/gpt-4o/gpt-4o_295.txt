Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 4,796 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past 8 years. My position is stable, and I have a consistent salary assignment to my checking account for over a year.

My financial situation is stable, and I believe that acquiring a reliable vehicle will help me maintain my employment and support my dependent. With no other installment plans and a history of meeting my financial obligations, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Sincerely,
