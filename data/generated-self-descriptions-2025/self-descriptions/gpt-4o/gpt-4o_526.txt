**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,113 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I have been employed as a resident aide at Greenfield Nursing Home for the past two years. My current financial situation is stable, though my savings are limited, with less than 100 DM in my savings account. I am diligent in managing my finances, as evidenced by my timely repayment of previous credits.

As a divorced mother of two, my priority is to ensure my children have access to educational and entertainment resources. A television would greatly benefit our home life. I own my residence and have a reliable guarantor, which further solidifies my ability to repay the loan. Having lived at my current address for four years, I am committed to maintaining stability for my family.

I assure you of my reliability and dedication to fulfilling my financial obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
