**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,812 DM to purchase a used car. I am a skilled employee currently working as a research assistant at GreenTech Innovations, a position I have held for the past 10 months. I recently relocated to this city for my job and have been residing here for the past four years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance of just under 500 DM. My credit history is solid, with all previous credits paid back duly. The car is essential for my daily commute and to manage errands efficiently, especially as a divorced mother of two.

I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and have structured my finances to accommodate the installment rate comfortably. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I believe my stable employment and consistent credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller
