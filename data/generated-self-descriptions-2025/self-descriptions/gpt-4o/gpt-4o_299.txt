**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of $1,287 to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a maintenance worker at Greenfield Manufacturing for the past eight years. My stable employment history demonstrates my reliability and commitment.

Despite not having a checking account, I have consistently paid off all existing credits on time, which is reflected in my positive credit history. I currently reside in my own home, which provides a stable living environment for me and my dependent, my teenage son.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% due to my steady income and lack of other installment plans. Additionally, I have a building society savings agreement that supports my financial stability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
John Smith
