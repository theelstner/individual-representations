**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,771 DM to purchase a new television. As a skilled employee working as an electrical engineer for the past five years, I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication in my role. My current financial situation shows a checking account balance below 200 DM and savings under 100 DM, primarily due to supporting my dependent child.

While I have had delays in paying off credit in the past, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management skills, including setting up a building society savings agreement. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2, given my stable employment and ownership of my home.

Although I am a foreign worker, I have been a resident here for four years and have integrated well into the community. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am managing responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
