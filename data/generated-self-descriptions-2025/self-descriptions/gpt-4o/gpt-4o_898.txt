Subject: Loan Application for Home Entertainment Upgrade

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,606 DM to purchase a new television and radio system. As a self-employed graphic designer, having access to high-quality media equipment is crucial for both relaxation and staying updated on industry trends.

Over the past eight months, I have successfully established my own freelance business, which is steadily growing. My credit history with your bank is impeccable, as I have always paid back my existing credits on time. Currently, I have a checking account balance below zero due to recent investments in my business, but I am confident in my ability to manage and repay this loan.

I have been residing at my current address for four years with my son, and I hold a building society savings agreement as my property. This demonstrates my commitment to financial stability and long-term planning.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to enhance my home entertainment setup and continue contributing positively to my community and industry.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
