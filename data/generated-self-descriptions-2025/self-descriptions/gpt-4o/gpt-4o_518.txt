**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,361 DM to purchase a new vehicle, which is essential for my daily commute to work. I am currently employed as an unskilled worker at a local manufacturing plant, where I have been working diligently for the past ten months.

Although my checking account is currently below zero, I have been actively managing my finances and have no other installment plans. My existing credit history includes a critical account; however, I have taken steps to address this by consolidating my debts and adhering to a strict repayment schedule.

I own my residence and have been living there for four years, which reflects my stability and commitment to managing my responsibilities. Despite my financial challenges, I am dedicated to improving my situation and am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2 DM.

As a single father of two, having reliable transportation is crucial for ensuring my children's well-being and maintaining my employment. I am committed to fulfilling all financial obligations and believe this loan will significantly improve our quality of life.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.
