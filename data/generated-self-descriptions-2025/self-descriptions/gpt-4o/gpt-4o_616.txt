**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1808 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a skilled employee in the telecommunications industry, I have been employed for five years and am committed to my work. I am currently 22 years old, married, and live with my spouse and child in our own home. 

Although I have had a delay in paying off credit in the past, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management and am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4%. My current savings are under 100 DM, but I am actively working on building them.

I have been a resident at my current address for just over a year and have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been managing responsibly. I own real estate, which provides me with stability and a long-term investment.

Despite not having a checking account, I am a reliable candidate for this loan due to my stable employment and commitment to financial improvement. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
