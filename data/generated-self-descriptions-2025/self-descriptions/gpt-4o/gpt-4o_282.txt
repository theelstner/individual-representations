Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,368 DM to purchase a used car. As a scientific research assistant at GreenTech Labs, where I have been employed for eight years, reliable transportation is crucial for my daily commute and fieldwork responsibilities.

I have maintained a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM, demonstrating my commitment to financial responsibility. Although I have a critical account history, I have taken steps to manage my finances better and have no existing installment plans, which allows me to focus on this loan's repayment.

I am currently renting and have been residing at my present address for four years, which reflects my stability and reliability. While I do have two existing credits at your bank, I have been diligent in meeting my obligations.

As a single father with one dependent, securing this loan is vital for maintaining my work-life balance and ensuring my child's needs are met. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
