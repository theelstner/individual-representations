**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,433 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my residence. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for the past three years. My commitment to my work is unwavering, and I am dedicated to advancing in my field.

Currently, I have a critical account status and a couple of existing credits, but I am actively working to improve my financial situation. My checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have a life insurance policy that provides some financial security. My savings are modest, with less than 100 DM in my savings account.

I have been living in my current rented residence for three years with my young child. As a divorced mother, I am focused on providing a stable and comfortable home. Despite the challenges, I have consistently managed my existing credits at your bank responsibly.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, given my steady employment and commitment to financial improvement. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller
