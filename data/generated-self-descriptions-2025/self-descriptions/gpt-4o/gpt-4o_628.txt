**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,116 DM to purchase essential furniture for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at BioTech Innovations for the past three years. My stable income is directly deposited into my checking account, which has maintained a balance of over 200 DM consistently for the past year.

My credit history is strong, with all previous loans being paid back on time. I am committed to maintaining this record. My savings account is currently under 100 DM, as I have been investing in my real estate property, which I own.

I am a single father to one child, and providing a comfortable home environment is a priority. With no other debts or guarantors, I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2 DM.

I have lived in my current residence for over two years, and I am registered under my name as a foreign worker. I believe my steady employment and responsible financial history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
