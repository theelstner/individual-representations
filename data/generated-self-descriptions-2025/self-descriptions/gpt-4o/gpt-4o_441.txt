Subject: Loan Application for Starting a Home-Based Bakery

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 609 DM to start a home-based bakery. After moving to this country a year ago, I have established a stable residence and am eager to leverage my skills in baking to create a sustainable business.

I have a consistent salary assignment for over a year, and I have successfully repaid a previous loan with your bank. Though my savings are modest, my business plan is solid, focusing on artisanal bread and pastries, which have a growing market demand.

As a divorced mother of one, I am committed to building a better future for my child and myself. My real estate property provides additional security, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
