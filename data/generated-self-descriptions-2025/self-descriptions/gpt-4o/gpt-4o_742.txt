Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,325 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a financial analyst at [Company Name] for the past five years. This role has provided me with a stable income and the ability to manage my finances effectively.

Currently, my checking account balance is below zero due to an unexpected medical expense, but I have always maintained a good credit history, having paid back all previous loans with your bank on time. I also have a modest savings account of approximately 300 DM.

Owning a reliable vehicle is crucial for my daily commute and professional responsibilities, as public transportation is not a viable option in my area. I believe this investment will enhance my work efficiency and ensure punctuality.

I have been residing at my current address for three years and have no other debts or guarantors. My current installment plans are well-managed, and I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
