**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 12,976 DM. I have been diligently repaying my existing credit with your bank and have maintained a good credit history. As a self-employed graphic designer, I recently faced a setback in securing contracts due to market fluctuations, which led to my current unemployment status. However, I am actively seeking new opportunities and expect to resume my work shortly.

Owning a reliable car is crucial for me to meet clients and expand my business network. My current savings are limited, but I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments given my previous financial discipline.

I have been residing at my current address for four years, and my housing is provided for free, which allows me to allocate more funds towards the loan repayment. As a responsible mother of one, I am committed to ensuring financial stability for my family.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how I can fulfill the loan requirements.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
