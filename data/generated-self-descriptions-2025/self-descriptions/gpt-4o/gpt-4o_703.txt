**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 6,331 DM. As a scientific research assistant with over 8 years of experience at a reputable institution, I am seeking this loan to purchase a used vehicle to ensure reliable transportation to and from work.

Currently, my financial situation is stable, though I have a few existing credits outside of this bank. My checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are limited, but I have consistently managed my financial obligations. I have been residing in my current home for 4 years without housing expenses, which allows me to allocate funds towards loan repayments.

I am committed to maintaining my financial responsibilities, as evidenced by my long-standing employment and minimal existing debts. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the agreed terms.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
