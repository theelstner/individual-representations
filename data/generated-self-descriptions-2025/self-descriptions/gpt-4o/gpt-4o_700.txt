**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,800 DM to purchase a new television, which is essential for my work as a freelance media analyst. My current employment at a reputable media firm has been stable for the past three years. Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a consistent savings habit, albeit with less than 100 DM in savings due to recent investments in my professional development.

While I have a critical account history, I have managed other credits responsibly and have never defaulted on any payments. My current installment rate is manageable, and my residence has been stable for the past two years. As a single individual with no dependents, my financial obligations are minimal, allowing me to focus on fulfilling this loan.

I am committed to demonstrating my reliability and ensuring timely repayments. I am confident that my professional stability and prudent financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
