Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of $700 to purchase a new television. As a scientific research assistant with over 8 years of experience, I have a stable income and a proven track record in my field. My current employment at the National Research Institute has provided me with a reliable and consistent salary.

Although I do not have a checking account or savings, I manage my finances responsibly and have never defaulted on any existing credit. My critical account status is due to a previous credit card issue, which I have since resolved, and I am committed to maintaining a positive credit standing.

Living with my brother rent-free allows me to allocate more resources towards repaying any debts. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% and assure you that I will prioritize this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
