**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Mark Jensen, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,919 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past five years at a reputable laboratory. My work is stable, and I have a steady income, allowing me to manage my finances responsibly.

Currently, my checking account balance is under 200 DM, and I maintain a small savings account. Although I have a critical credit history and existing credits elsewhere, I am committed to improving my financial standing. I have been residing at my current address for three years and own a reliable car, which serves as my primary mode of transportation.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM per month, given my disciplined budgeting. I have no other guarantors or dependents, which allows me to focus entirely on fulfilling this obligation.

I assure you of my commitment to responsibly managing this loan and improving my credit profile. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Mark Jensen
