**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,190 DM to cover essential home repairs. As a dedicated mother of two, I have been residing in my current home for four years without any property ownership. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I am currently unemployed and relying on small savings that are under 100 DM.

Despite my critical credit history and existing credits, I am committed to improving my financial situation. Previously, I worked diligently as a caregiver for eight years before my position was dissolved. I am actively seeking new employment opportunities and have recently completed a course in elder care to enhance my skills.

I assure you of my responsibility and determination to meet the installment rate of 2 DM. The stability of free housing allows me to focus on repaying debts and securing a better future for my family. 

Thank you for considering my application. Your support would be invaluable in helping us maintain a safe living environment.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
