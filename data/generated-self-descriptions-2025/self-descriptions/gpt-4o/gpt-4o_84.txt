Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,568 DM to start a small catering service specializing in international cuisine. As a passionate cook with a unique perspective, I have identified a niche market in our community that is eager for diverse culinary experiences.

I have been employed as a kitchen assistant at [Local Restaurant] for the past two years. This experience has equipped me with the necessary skills to manage food preparation and customer service efficiently. I am confident in my ability to run a successful catering business.

Financially, I have a solid track record of repaying my existing credits promptly. Although I do not currently have a checking account, my savings account holds 300 DM, and I maintain a building society savings agreement, which underscores my commitment to financial responsibility.

I have been a resident of this community for four years, living in a rented apartment with my six-year-old daughter. As a single mother, I am determined to secure a stable future for us, and this business venture is a step towards achieving that goal.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss my business plan further and demonstrate how this loan will contribute to my success.

Sincerely,
