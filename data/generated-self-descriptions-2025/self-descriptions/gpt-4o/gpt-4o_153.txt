I have a history of paying back credits diligently, as evidenced by my existing credit with your bank, which has always been managed responsibly. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I maintain a building society savings agreement that reflects my commitment to financial planning.

My current residence, which I own, provides additional stability. I have been living there for four years, and this, combined with my life insurance policy, further underscores my financial reliability.

I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 1 DM, given my consistent income and minimal existing debt. I assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.
