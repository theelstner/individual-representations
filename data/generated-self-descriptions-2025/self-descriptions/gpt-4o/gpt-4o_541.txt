**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,049 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a resident assistant at a local care facility and have held this position for the past 10 months. Despite being relatively new to this job, I have demonstrated reliability and dedication, which is reflected in my consistent salary assignments over the past year.

My financial history is sound, with all previous credits being paid back on time. I am currently managing one installment plan with a local store, which I have also handled responsibly. My checking account has been stable, maintaining a balance of over 200 DM consistently.

I own my home, which provides me with financial stability. Additionally, I have a building society savings agreement that further secures my financial standing. Although my savings account holds less than 100 DM, my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations is unwavering.

As a divorced mother of one, I am focused on creating a stable and comfortable environment for my child. This loan will enable me to furnish our home adequately, enhancing our quality of life. I am confident in my ability to manage the loan repayments diligently.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
