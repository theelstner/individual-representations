### Letter 1: Television Repair Technician

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1158 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. As a television repair technician with 3 years of experience at a reputable electronics service center, I understand the importance of having quality equipment. My current checking account balance is modest, but I have diligently saved between 500 and 1000 DM in my savings account.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as I have consistently paid back previous credits on time. My monthly income, combined with my careful budgeting, allows me to comfortably manage an installment rate of 3. I have been residing at my current address for a year and own a car, which adds to my stability.

Being a foreign worker, I have always prioritized financial responsibility and am committed to maintaining this loan in good standing. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
