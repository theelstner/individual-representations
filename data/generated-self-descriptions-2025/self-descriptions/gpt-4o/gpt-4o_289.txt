**Letter 1: Management Consultant**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,582 DM to support a new business venture. As a management consultant with over 8 years of experience, I recently decided to transition into self-employment. I am confident that my expertise and network will contribute to the success of this new endeavor.

Despite a past delay in credit payments, I have taken significant steps to manage my finances more effectively. My checking account balance is currently under 200 DM, but I maintain a savings account of nearly 400 DM, demonstrating my commitment to financial responsibility.

I am currently unemployed but have strong prospects and a detailed business plan that outlines the anticipated growth and revenue of my consultancy. I have lived at my current residence for four years, reducing my living expenses by living rent-free.

I assure you of my dedication to repaying the loan on time, as this opportunity is crucial for my professional growth and stability. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
