Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 4,139 DM to support the expansion of my small carpentry workshop. Over the past three years, I have been living at my current residence and have worked diligently as an unskilled resident worker, gaining valuable experience and skills.

Despite not having a checking account, I have maintained a savings balance between 100 and 500 DM and hold a building society savings agreement. I believe these demonstrate my commitment to financial responsibility.

I have a critical credit history due to past financial challenges but am actively working to improve it. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are being managed responsibly. I am confident that my stable employment and residence, coupled with my dedication to my business, make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

I am eager to use this loan to invest in new tools and materials, ultimately increasing my workshop's productivity and profitability. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
