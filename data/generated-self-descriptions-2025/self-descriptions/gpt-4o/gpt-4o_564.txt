**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 683 DM to purchase a television. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Heidelberg, I have been employed for the past 10 months. My work is stable, and my salary has been consistently deposited into my account for over a year.

I have a daughter who lives with me, and as a single mother, I aim to provide her with educational resources and entertainment at home. A television would greatly contribute to her learning and our family time.

In the past, I experienced a delay in paying off a credit due to unforeseen circumstances, but I have since managed my finances diligently. I have a building society savings agreement, which further demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. I have been residing in my current home for a year and have no other debts or guarantors.

I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my dedication to fulfilling this obligation promptly.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

I own my home and have been a resident there for a year. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am managing effectively. I am committed to making timely payments on this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
