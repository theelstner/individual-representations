Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,154 DM to purchase a radio for my home. I have worked as a factory worker for the past seven years, which has provided me with a stable income and the ability to manage my financial obligations effectively.

My current checking account balance is modest, and my savings are below 100 DM. Despite a critical credit history, I have consistently managed my existing credits with diligence. I have no outstanding installment plans elsewhere and own my residence, which adds to my financial stability.

I am single, with one dependent, and have been residing at my current address for four years. The real estate I own further demonstrates my ability to handle financial commitments. Although I do not have a guarantor, my employment history and property ownership speak to my trustworthiness.

I am committed to the proposed installment rate and confident in my ability to repay the loan. This purchase will enhance our daily life and is a priority for me.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
