**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,522 DM to purchase a new television. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for over eight years. My role involves analyzing data and supporting various research projects, which requires a keen eye for detail and reliability—skills that I also bring to my financial responsibilities.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have consistently paid back previous credits on time, demonstrating my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations. Although my savings are modest, I have a building society savings agreement in place as a form of financial security.

Living in my own home for the past three years has allowed me to manage my expenses effectively. While I am single, I support my two dependents, which is why I am seeking this loan with a guarantor. My stable employment and responsible financial history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
