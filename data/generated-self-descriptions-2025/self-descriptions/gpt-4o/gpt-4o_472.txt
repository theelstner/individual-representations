**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,092 DM to purchase a new television. As a scientific research assistant employed for the past 10 months, I have been diligent in managing my finances. I have a small savings of 150 DM and have consistently paid back previous credits on time.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, but my employment with the research institute offers a stable income. I have been living at my current residence for two years with my wife and two children, and we do not have any other debts or guarantors.

I am committed to maintaining my good credit history and believe that my consistent payment record demonstrates my trustworthiness as a candidate for this loan. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 3%.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
