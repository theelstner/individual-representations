My name is Hans Müller, and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,503 DM. I have been a scientific research assistant for the past 8 years at a reputable institute. I am looking to start a small business focused on developing eco-friendly packaging solutions.

My financial situation is stable, with a small savings account of 320 DM and a modest checking account balance. While I have experienced delays in payment in the past, I have taken steps to improve my financial management skills, including attending financial planning workshops.

Your support will help me bring my business idea to fruition, contributing positively to both the environment and the economy.
