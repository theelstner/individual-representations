**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,712 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for over 8 years, demonstrating my stability and commitment to my career. My financial history is strong, as I have consistently paid back existing credits on time.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and I have limited savings under 100 DM. However, I have a building society savings agreement that reflects my long-term financial planning. I reside in my own home and have lived there for the past two years, which further establishes my stability.

As a single father of two, I am dedicated to providing a comfortable living environment for my family. My previous loan at this bank was handled responsibly, and I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan with the same diligence.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.

Sincerely,
