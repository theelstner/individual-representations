**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,670 DM to purchase a new television. As a scientific research assistant, I have been employed at my current job for 10 months. My commitment to my work and careful financial planning have allowed me to maintain a good credit history, as evidenced by my timely repayment of previous loans.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, ranging from 0 to 200 DM, and my savings account holds less than 100 DM. Despite this, I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate of 4% due to my stable income and responsible budgeting habits.

I am 35 years old, divorced, and have been living at my current residence for the past 2 years. My only asset is my car, which I maintain diligently. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have always met my financial obligations promptly.

I believe my history of responsible credit management and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to maintaining my good credit standing and fulfilling all repayment requirements.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller
