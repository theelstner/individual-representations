**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of $3,565 to pursue further education in electrical engineering. I am currently employed as a maintenance worker at GreenTech Industries, where I have been working for the past 10 months. This opportunity to study will enhance my skills and enable me to advance to a technician role within the company.

While I do not have a checking account or savings, I have a building society savings agreement and a life insurance policy. I am committed to using these resources responsibly to secure my financial future. Although I have a critical account history, I have been diligently paying off existing debts and have two ongoing credits at this bank, which I have managed without any defaults.

At 37, I am motivated to improve my situation for myself and my two dependents. As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building a stable and prosperous life in this country. I have been residing in my own home for a year, which provides me with stability and reduces my living expenses.

I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2% and fulfill my obligations. I believe this educational investment will significantly enhance my earning potential, allowing me to repay the loan promptly.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss my situation further and provide any additional information you may need.

Sincerely,
John Doe
