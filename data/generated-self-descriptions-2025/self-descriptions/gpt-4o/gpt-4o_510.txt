**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Carlos Mendoza, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,413 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I have been employed as a mechanical engineer at Tech Solutions Inc. for the past three years. During this time, I have consistently demonstrated my commitment and reliability, as evidenced by my prompt repayment of previous credits.

Despite not having a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance below 100 DM. My family and I have been residing in our home for the past two years, and we are committed to improving our living conditions. As a married individual with a young child, a new television will provide educational and entertainment value for my family.

I have a building society savings agreement, which further underscores my financial responsibility. With no other debts or guarantors, I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 4 DM per month comfortably.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to continue building my credit history with your bank and appreciate your support.

Sincerely,
Carlos Mendoza
