Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a personal loan of 1,901 DM to purchase a radio and television. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at [Company Name] for the past three years, during which I have demonstrated reliability and commitment.

As a single male with no other debtors or guarantors, I have ensured that my financial obligations are minimal. I own a car, which reflects my responsibility in managing property. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM, given my steady income and responsible financial habits.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss any further details you may require.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
