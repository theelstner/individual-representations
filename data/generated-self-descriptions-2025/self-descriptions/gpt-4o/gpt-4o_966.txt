**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 454 DM to cover necessary repairs for my home. As a resident working in the local construction industry, I have been employed for the past 10 months. My financial situation is stable, with a history of repaying previous credits on time.

My checking account currently holds just under 200 DM, and I have limited savings below 100 DM. I have a building society savings agreement that shows my commitment to securing my family's future. As a married man with one dependent, maintaining a safe and functional home is my top priority.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as I have no other debts and own my home outright. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
