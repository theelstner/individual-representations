**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 6,681 DM to expand my small IT consulting firm. As a skilled software developer with three years at TechSolutions, I have built a solid reputation for delivering quality services to my clients. My current checking account balance is modest, but I have a steady income and am committed to growing my business.

In the past, I encountered a delay in paying off a small loan due to unforeseen circumstances, but I have since maintained a consistent payment record. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I reside rent-free, which allows me to allocate more funds towards business growth.

At 38, I am determined to enhance my business’s capabilities and create a stable future for my two dependents. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly and look forward to discussing my application further.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
John Doe

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 6,681 DM to launch a niche café specializing in sustainable, locally sourced products. With over two years of experience as a project manager in the hospitality industry, I have the skills and knowledge to make this venture successful. Although my current account balance is below 200 DM, I am dedicated to my business plan and have a track record of hard work.

I acknowledge a past delay in loan repayment, but I have learned from that experience and have since prioritized financial responsibility. Living rent-free allows me to focus my resources on the business without the burden of housing costs.

As a 38-year-old single father of two, I am committed to securing a stable income and providing for my family. I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan and look forward to your favorable consideration.

Kind regards,
Michael Smith
