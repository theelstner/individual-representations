**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 458 DM to purchase a new television. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at a reputable institution for the past 2 years. My current financial situation is stable; however, my savings are limited, with less than 100 DM in my account.

My credit history is strong, as I have always paid back my existing credits on time. I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan responsibly. I own my residence and have been living there for the past 3 years, which demonstrates my commitment to financial stability.

As a single, 24-year-old with one dependent, I am focused on ensuring a comfortable living environment. This television will enhance our home life without impacting my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
