**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,449 DM to expand my small automotive repair shop. I have been employed as a skilled mechanic for over 8 years, which has provided me with a steady income and a deep understanding of the automotive industry.

While I have experienced delays in paying off credit in the past, I have since taken significant steps to improve my financial management skills. My current checking account balance is modest, but I have savings of 150 DM and own a car, which serves as an asset.

I am seeking this loan to purchase new equipment that will allow me to serve more customers and increase my revenue. I have been residing at my current address for 2 years and have no other outstanding debts or guarantors.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, given my stable employment and dedication to my business. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
