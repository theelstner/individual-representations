**Letter 1**

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Gonzalez, and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 841 DM. I have been residing in this city for the past four years, and during this time, I have been employed as a hospitality assistant at a local hotel. I have been in this role for five years, which has provided me with a steady income and financial stability.

I am seeking this loan to start a small catering business. I have a passion for cooking and have been catering events for friends and family, which has helped me build a small but loyal client base. With this loan, I plan to purchase essential equipment and secure a rental space to expand my operations.

I have a good credit history, having duly paid back previous credits. My savings account currently holds 350 DM, and I own a piece of real estate, which I believe demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. Although my checking account balance is modest, I have carefully planned my business venture and am confident in its potential success.

I am a responsible and dedicated individual, and I assure you that I will meet all repayment obligations. I look forward to the opportunity to grow my business and contribute to the local economy.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Gonzalez
