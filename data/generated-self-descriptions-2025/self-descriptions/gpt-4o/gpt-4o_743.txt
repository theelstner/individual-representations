**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,048 DM to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a warehouse associate at a local distribution center for the past three years, and I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication to my role. 

My current financial situation is stable, though modest. I maintain a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM and have a small savings account. Despite this, I have successfully paid back all previous credits with your bank on time. I believe this history reflects my commitment to meeting financial obligations.

I reside in my own home, which is a piece of real estate I inherited. This provides me with a stable living situation and reduces my monthly expenses. I have been living at this residence for four years. Although I do not currently have a telephone, I am easily reachable through other means.

I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate, as I have no other debts beyond a minor installment plan with a local store. My status as a foreign worker has never hindered my capacity to fulfill my financial responsibilities.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
