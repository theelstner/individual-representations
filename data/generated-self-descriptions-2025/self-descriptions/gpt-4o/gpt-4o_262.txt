Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,657 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at [Company Name], where I have been working for the past three years. My employment is stable, and I am committed to my role, which provides a reliable income.

Despite a current negative balance in my checking account, I have a strong credit history, having paid back previous credits on time. I believe this demonstrates my reliability and financial responsibility. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but I have no other debts or installment plans, which allows me to focus entirely on repaying this loan.

I own my residence and have been living there for two years, which provides stability for me and my dependent. I am confident that my financial situation, coupled with my commitment to fulfilling my obligations, makes me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
