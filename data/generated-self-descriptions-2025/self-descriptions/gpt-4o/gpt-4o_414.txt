Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,292 DM to launch a small technology consultancy firm. I have eight years of experience in the IT sector, most recently serving as a project manager for a leading software company. Due to a recent restructuring, I am currently unemployed, but this has given me the opportunity to pursue my entrepreneurial ambitions.

My financial situation is stable, although my savings are limited to less than 100 DM. I have managed my existing credits responsibly and am confident in my ability to manage this loan. I own a vehicle that can serve as collateral, and I have been residing in my current location for two years, which shows my stability.

I am a dedicated and hardworking individual, committed to making my business a success. I believe my experience and skills make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
