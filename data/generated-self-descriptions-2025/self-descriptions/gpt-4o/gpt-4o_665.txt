**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,050 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment. As a self-employed graphic designer, having a well-equipped workspace is crucial for my productivity and client satisfaction.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and my savings account holds less than 100 DM. Unfortunately, I have experienced delays in paying off credit in the past, but I have since taken measures to improve my financial management. I am confident that with this loan, I can enhance my business operations and increase my income.

Despite being unemployed in the traditional sense, I have a consistent stream of freelance projects. My residence is owned, and I have been living there for over a year. Additionally, I have a building society savings agreement that reflects my commitment to financial planning.

I am dedicated to repaying this loan promptly and believe my past experiences have strengthened my financial responsibility. I appreciate your consideration of my application and am happy to provide further information if needed.

Thank you for your time and support.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
