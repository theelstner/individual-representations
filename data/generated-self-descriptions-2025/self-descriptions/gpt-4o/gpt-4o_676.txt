Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,580 DM to support the expansion of my small construction business. I have been living in this community for the past two years and have been employed as a construction laborer for just under a year. Although my role is unskilled, I have garnered significant experience and am eager to establish my own venture.

In the past, I encountered some delays in paying off debts due to unforeseen circumstances. However, I have since taken steps to manage my finances better and have maintained a savings account with a balance between 500 and 1,000 DM.

I own my residence and have real estate assets, which I believe demonstrate my commitment and stability. Although I am a foreign worker, I am dedicated to contributing positively to the community and building a sustainable business.

I am confident that with this loan, I can successfully grow my business and improve my financial standing. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
