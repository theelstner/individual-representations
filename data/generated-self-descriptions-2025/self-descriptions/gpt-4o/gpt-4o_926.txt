**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,872 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at a reputable institute for the past 11 months. While my employment is relatively recent, I have a stable income and a strong commitment to my work.

Currently, my financial situation shows a checking account balance below zero, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have consistently paid back all previous credits with your bank on time. This history demonstrates my reliability and dedication to fulfilling my financial obligations.

At 55, I am focused on providing a stable environment for my dependent child. I own my home, which reduces my living expenses significantly, and have a life insurance policy in place for added security. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my previous credit with your bank was managed successfully.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, given my consistent income and responsible financial history. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
