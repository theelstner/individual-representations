Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,766 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home.

My current residence is stable, having lived there for two years, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my stable job, consistent payment history, and commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations. I am confident that I can manage the installment rate comfortably with my current income.
