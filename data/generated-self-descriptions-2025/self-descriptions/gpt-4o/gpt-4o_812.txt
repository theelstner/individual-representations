**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Müller, and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 907 DM. I am currently employed as a project manager at a reputable construction firm, where I have been working diligently for the past 10 months. I am seeking this loan to invest in a small side business focused on sustainable building materials, which I believe has significant growth potential.

My financial situation is stable. I have a small amount in my savings account, and I own real estate, which provides additional security. I have been residing in my current home for two years with my wife and child, ensuring a stable living environment. Despite my relatively short tenure at my current job, I have a solid credit history, having always paid back my existing credits on time.

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly. My experience in project management equips me with the skills necessary to oversee financial commitments effectively. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Thomas Müller
