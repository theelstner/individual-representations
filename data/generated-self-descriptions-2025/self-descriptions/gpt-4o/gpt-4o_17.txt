**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,282 DM to purchase a new television. I am currently employed as a sales associate at a local retail store, where I have worked diligently for the past three years. My financial situation is stable, with a small savings account of 300 DM. Despite a minor overdraft in my checking account, I have a strong credit history, having always paid back my previous loans on time.

As a divorced mother of one, having a reliable television is important for both educational and entertainment purposes for my child. I am committed to making timely payments, as demonstrated by my consistent track record. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my current residence for the past two years.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller

As a married woman with no dependents, my focus is on advancing my career. My excellent credit history and lack of additional debts demonstrate my reliability. I have lived in my current home for two years and own a car, which further supports my stability.

I am committed to maintaining my strong financial standing and appreciate your consideration of my loan application.

Dear Financial Services,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,282 DM to purchase a new television set for my home. I have been employed as a customer service representative at a telecommunications company for the past year. My current savings are 400 DM, and I have a consistent record of repaying my credits on time.

As a separated individual living alone, having a television is essential for both relaxation and staying informed. My financial discipline is evident in my payment history and my ability to manage without guarantors or additional debts. I have resided at my present address for two years and own a vehicle, which adds to my credibility as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to adhere to the installment plan and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Sophie Fischer
