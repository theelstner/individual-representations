**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,716 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute to work. I have been working as a warehouse assistant for the past 10 months. While my job is unskilled, it is stable and provides a steady income that will allow me to meet the loan payments.

Currently, I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly. Although my checking account is currently below zero, this is a temporary situation due to recent unforeseen expenses, including medical bills for my two dependents.

I own my residence, which provides additional security for my financial obligations. My credit history has faced challenges, but I am committed to improving it and have no other installment plans or guarantors.

As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building my life here, and owning a reliable vehicle is crucial for my employment. I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling this financial responsibility and improving my financial standing.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
