**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at BioTech Solutions for the past 8 years. My position has provided me with a stable income and I have consistently met my financial obligations, as evidenced by my excellent credit history.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I am confident in my ability to manage the loan repayments, as my financial track record shows reliability and commitment. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my residence has been stable for the past 4 years.

I am a divorced mother of two, and my car is my only significant asset. I believe that the loan will greatly enhance our family life by providing access to educational and entertainment resources.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Anna Schmidt
