**Letter 1: Management Consultant**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,959 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home office. As a management consultant with over eight years of experience, I recently transitioned to self-employment after my previous firm downsized. During this transition, I have maintained a perfect credit history, promptly paying off all existing credits.

Currently, my checking account is below zero due to startup costs, but my financial discipline and consulting contracts ensure stability moving forward. I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance, underscoring my commitment to financial responsibility.

I have lived in my current residence for three years, which I own, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan over the 36-month term. My single status and one dependent are well-managed, as evidenced by my meticulous budgeting.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
