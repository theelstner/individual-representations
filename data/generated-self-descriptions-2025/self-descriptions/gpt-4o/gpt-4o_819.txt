Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,554 DM to purchase a new television. As a foreign worker in this country, I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past five years. My role has allowed me to develop a stable income, which I believe demonstrates my financial reliability.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a consistent savings habit, albeit with less than 100 DM due to ongoing financial commitments. I have been residing at my current address for the past two years and own a car, which serves as my primary asset.

I am aware of my critical credit history, which is partly due to existing credits. However, I have been diligently managing my finances and have no other debtors or guarantors involved. My installment rate is low, and I have no other installment plans, which enables me to comfortably meet the repayment terms of this loan.

I am committed to improving my financial standing and believe that acquiring this loan will assist in enhancing my quality of life. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability and responsibility.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Although I do not have a checking account, my commitment to saving, albeit with less than 100 DM, reflects my dedication to financial stability. I am married and have two dependents, which further motivates me to maintain a secure financial environment for my family.
