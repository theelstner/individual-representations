**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,391 DM to expand my small but growing consultancy firm. I have been employed as a financial analyst for the past three years and have consistently demonstrated my expertise in the field. My current checking account balance is just under 200 DM, and I have a small savings account with less than 100 DM.

Despite my modest savings, my credit history is strong, with all previous credits paid back on time. I currently own real estate, which provides stability for my family, including my wife and our young child. I have lived in my current residence for just over a year and have no other debts or guarantors.

I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed loan, as I have a clear plan to use the funds for marketing and operational improvements. My existing credit with the bank has been handled responsibly, and I am committed to maintaining this trust.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
