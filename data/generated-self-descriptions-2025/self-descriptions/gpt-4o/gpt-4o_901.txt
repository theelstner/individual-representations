**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,153 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my residence. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past three years. My position is stable, and I have a steady income that will allow me to manage the loan repayments comfortably.

Although my current checking account balance is below zero, I have consistently paid back any previous credits on time, demonstrating my reliability and commitment. I have a small savings account, but it is insufficient for my current needs.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my employment provides a dependable source of income. Furthermore, I have a co-applicant who is equally committed to ensuring the loan is repaid without issue.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
