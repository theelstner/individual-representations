**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at GreenTech Labs for over 8 years. My role has provided me with a stable income and the skills to manage my finances effectively. 

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have a solid history of repaying my existing credit with your bank on time. I am confident in my ability to manage the new installment plan of 4% as my housing is provided free of charge by my employer.

As a single father of two dependents, having a reliable vehicle is essential for both work and family commitments. I believe my consistent employment and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
John Smith
