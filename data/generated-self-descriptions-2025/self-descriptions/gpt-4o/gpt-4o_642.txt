Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 750 DM to support my education. I recently moved to the country and have been residing here for one year.

My financial situation is challenging; my checking account balance is below zero, and my savings are less than 100 DM. However, I have a strong credit history, having repaid all previous credits on time. I own real estate, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility and stability.

As a divorced mother of a 5-year-old child, I am determined to secure a better future for us. I have no other debts or guarantors, which ensures that my financial obligations are limited. My track record with your bank has been positive, and I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly.
