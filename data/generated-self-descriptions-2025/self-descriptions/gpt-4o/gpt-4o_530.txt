Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a strong credit history, having paid back all previous credits on time. My savings account is modest, with less than 100 DM, but I am committed to managing my finances responsibly. I live alone, having been separated for four years, and have no dependents or other financial obligations.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan within the 36-month duration, as my installment rate is manageable. My car serves as my primary means of transportation, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I have been residing at my current address for four years, which reflects my stability.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
