**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3017 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at a reputable institution for the past 8 years. My current checking account has been active with salary assignments for over a year, maintaining a balance above 200 DM.

While I have had a critical account in the past and hold other credits with different banks, I have consistently managed my financial obligations. My savings are limited to less than 100 DM, but I have a life insurance policy that provides additional security.

I am 47 years old, single, and have been residing in my own home for the past 4 years. Although I am a foreign worker, I am fully integrated into the community and have no dependents beyond my child.

I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 4 DM per month, given my stable income and long-term employment. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan and look forward to your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
