Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,612 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a scientific research assistant, having worked in this field for over 8 years. My dedication to my profession and stable employment history demonstrate my reliability and commitment.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and my savings are below 100 DM. Despite this, I have managed my financial obligations responsibly. While my credit history shows existing credits with other institutions, I have consistently met my repayment obligations.

My home, where I have resided for the past 4 years, is owned, and I also hold a building society savings agreement. As a divorced mother of one, I prioritize financial stability for my family and am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 3 DM monthly.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to maintaining a trustworthy relationship with your bank and look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
