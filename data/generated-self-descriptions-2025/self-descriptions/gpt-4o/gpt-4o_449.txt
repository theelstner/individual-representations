Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,576 DM to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past three years, where I have consistently demonstrated my commitment and reliability. My current financial situation is stable, with my existing credits paid back duly and no other installment plans.

Although my checking account balance is modest, I own real estate, which provides me with additional financial security. I have been residing at my current address for two years and am dedicated to my responsibilities as a father to my dependent child.

I assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. My credit history at your bank is impeccable, and I have a guarantor to support my application. I am committed to maintaining my financial obligations and am confident that I will meet the installment rate of 2 DM per month without any issues.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
