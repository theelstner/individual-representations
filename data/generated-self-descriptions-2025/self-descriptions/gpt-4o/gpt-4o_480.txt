Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,037 DM to support the expansion of my small home repair business. Over the past six years, I have been working diligently in the construction industry, gaining valuable experience and establishing a reliable client base.

I currently have a modest savings account of 350 DM and have always paid back my existing credits on time. My financial management skills are proven by my consistent credit history and my ability to manage my personal expenses without incurring additional debt.

As a single father residing in my own property for the past four years, I have demonstrated stability and responsibility. I am confident that the expansion of my business will lead to increased income and allow me to provide better opportunities for my dependent.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how this loan can positively impact my business and financial future.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
