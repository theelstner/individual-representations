Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,223 DM to purchase a new television. As a skilled employee working as a scientific research assistant for the past eight years, I have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility and stability.

Although I do not have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance of 450 DM. My credit history reflects some challenges; however, I have diligently managed my existing credits and have never defaulted on payments. My installment rate is manageable, and I have no other debtors or guarantors involved.

I have lived in my own home for the past four years, and I have a building society savings agreement in place, which further reinforces my financial reliability. As a single father with one dependent, I am committed to ensuring a stable and secure environment for my family.

I am confident in my ability to meet the obligations of this loan and am eager to discuss this application further. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
