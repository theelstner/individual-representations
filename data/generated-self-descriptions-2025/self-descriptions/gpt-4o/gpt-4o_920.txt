**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,359 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment. As a skilled employee with over 8 years of experience in the engineering sector, I recently faced an unexpected layoff due to company restructuring. Despite this setback, I am actively seeking new employment opportunities and have several promising interviews lined up.

My financial situation is currently tight, with my checking account slightly overdrawn. However, I have consistently paid back all existing credits on time and maintain a small savings account of 350 DM. My property includes a building society savings agreement, demonstrating my commitment to financial responsibility.

Being a single father, I am determined to provide a stable and comfortable home for my child. I have been residing at my current address for a year, and I own my home, which reduces my housing expenses significantly.

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
