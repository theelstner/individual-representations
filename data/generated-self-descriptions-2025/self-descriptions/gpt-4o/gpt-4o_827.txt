**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,602 DM. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past eight years at a reputable institution. My wife and I have been living in our current residence for three years, and we are keen on purchasing a reliable vehicle to ease our daily commute.

Currently, my checking account is slightly below zero, and my savings are less than 100 DM. However, I have consistently made timely payments on my existing credits, which are not with your bank. My credit history may show some challenges, but I have taken steps to manage my finances more effectively.

Given my stable employment and commitment to improving my financial standing, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss this further and provide any additional information you may need.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
