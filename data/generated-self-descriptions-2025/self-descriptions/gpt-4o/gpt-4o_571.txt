**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,758 DM to purchase a new television and radio system. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past three years and have consistently demonstrated my commitment and reliability in my field. 

I am currently residing in my apartment for two years, and although my checking account is slightly below zero, I have always managed my finances responsibly, ensuring all existing credits are paid back on time. My savings account is modest, with less than 100 DM, but my consistent employment and financial discipline make me a trustworthy candidate.

As a divorced woman, I handle my finances independently and am committed to maintaining my financial responsibilities without any other debtors or guarantors involved. My installment rate is set at 3, which aligns well with my current budget.

I have a car as my property, which provides me with stability and mobility. My consistent credit history with your bank further supports my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
