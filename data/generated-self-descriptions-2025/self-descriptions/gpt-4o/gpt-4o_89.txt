Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 12,612 DM to pursue further education, specifically a diploma in Financial Management. With eight years of experience as a scientific research assistant, I am eager to enhance my skills and advance my career.

Currently, I have a checking account balance of 150 DM and savings of 300 DM. My financial management has been diligent, evidenced by my history of paying all existing credits on time. I have been employed in my current role for three years, and I have no other debts or guarantors, ensuring a focused repayment plan.

Having lived at my current residence for four years without housing costs allows me to allocate more towards loan repayment. My stable employment and commitment to personal growth make me a trustworthy candidate. 

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further discussion at your convenience.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
