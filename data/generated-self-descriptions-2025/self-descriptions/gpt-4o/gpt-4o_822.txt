Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 1,101 DM. As a dedicated IT specialist with three years of experience at Tech Solutions Inc., I have consistently demonstrated reliability and professionalism. My employment has been stable, and I have maintained a strong credit history, having successfully paid back two previous loans from your bank.

My wife and I recently welcomed our first child, and acquiring a reliable vehicle is essential for our growing family. Our current savings are below 100 DM, which is why I am seeking your assistance. Despite this, I own real estate, which underscores my financial stability.

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan, as my current installment rate is manageable and I have no other debts. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
