Dear [Loan Officer's Name],

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,060 DM to purchase a new television. As a scientific research assistant at [Company Name], where I have been employed for the past 5 years, I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly. My role involves meticulous attention to detail and consistent performance, which I believe translates well into financial reliability.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have diligently paid back two existing credits with your bank, reflecting my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations. I own my residence, and with no other debts or installment plans, my financial focus will be solely on this loan.

At 28 years old, I am single with one dependent and have lived at my current address for 4 years. My real estate ownership further solidifies my stability and dedication to maintaining a secure financial standing.

I am a foreign worker, which has equipped me with adaptability and resilience—qualities that I believe enhance my trustworthiness as a loan candidate. I appreciate your consideration of my application and am eager to continue building a positive financial relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
