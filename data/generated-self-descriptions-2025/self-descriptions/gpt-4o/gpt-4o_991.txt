**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,743 DM to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a warehouse worker for the past eight years, which provides me with a stable income. Although my checking account currently holds under 200 DM, I have a building society savings agreement that offers additional security. 

I am aware that my credit history shows a critical account and existing credits elsewhere, but I have consistently made timely payments on my obligations. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly, as my housing is owned, eliminating rent expenses.

With one dependent, I strive to maintain a stable home environment, and acquiring this television will enhance our quality of life. I have been residing at my current address for two years, demonstrating my commitment to stability.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling my financial responsibilities.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 1,743 DM to purchase a radio system for my home. I have been employed as a janitor for over seven years, which has provided me with a consistent income. Although my savings account is below 100 DM, I have a life insurance policy that serves as a financial safety net.

As a single father to one child, enhancing our living environment is a priority. I have lived in my current home for two years, reflecting my stable lifestyle.

I appreciate your consideration of my application and look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability.

Best regards,
