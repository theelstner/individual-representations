**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 1,403 DM. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at BioTech Innovations for the past three years. My role involves critical research and development projects, and I am proud to have contributed to several successful initiatives.

Currently, my checking account balance is below 0 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. Despite this, my credit history is strong, as I have consistently paid back my existing credits on time. I am committed to maintaining this record of reliability.

The purchase of a new car is essential for my daily commute and professional responsibilities. I have been residing at my current address for four years and am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2 DM, given my stable employment and regular income.

I am divorced and have no other debtors or guarantors. My financial discipline and steady employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am eager to discuss this further and provide any additional information you may require.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
