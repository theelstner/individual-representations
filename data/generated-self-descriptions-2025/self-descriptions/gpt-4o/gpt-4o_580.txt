Subject: Loan Application for New Vehicle Purchase

Dear [Bank Name] Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,820 DM to purchase a new car. As a scientific research assistant, I have been employed for the past eight months at a reputable research institute. Although my current checking account balance is modest, I have consistently managed my finances and have a history of meeting my financial obligations.

I have been living at my current residence for four years, which reflects stability and commitment to my community. Despite having a critical account status due to past financial challenges, I am diligently working to improve my credit standing. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors and am solely responsible for my financial commitments.

The new car is essential for my daily commute to work and will significantly enhance my productivity. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% due to my steady income and careful budgeting. My current savings, while under 100 DM, are supplemented by my consistent monthly income, ensuring I can manage the loan responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss my application further and demonstrate my commitment to fulfilling this loan.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
