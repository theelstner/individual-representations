**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan to purchase a new car. I have been a dedicated scientific research assistant at BioTech Innovations for the past five years. This role has allowed me to develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which I believe make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have a solid credit history, having paid back previous credits diligently. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors.

I have been residing in my current home for two years and live alone, which allows me to focus on my career and financial responsibilities. At 27, I am committed to building a stable financial future for myself and my dependent, my younger brother, who is in college.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan over the 60-month term and appreciate your consideration.

Thank you for your time and support.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
