**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,615 DM to purchase a used car. At 75 years old, I have recently found myself in need of reliable transportation to manage my daily activities and support my dependent grandson, who lives with me.

Previously, I worked as a management consultant for over 30 years, advising businesses on strategic growth and operational efficiency. Although I am currently unemployed, my extensive experience has equipped me with the skills to manage finances prudently. Unfortunately, unexpected medical expenses have impacted my savings and checking account balance.

Despite my current financial situation, I have consistently honored my commitments. I maintain two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. I am confident that with the loan, I can stabilize my situation and continue to meet all financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 6,615 DM to purchase a used vehicle. At 75, I find myself in need of a car to maintain my independence and fulfill my responsibilities towards my granddaughter, who relies on me for transportation to school and extracurricular activities.

I spent eight years as a scientific research assistant before transitioning to a self-employed consultant role, where I worked for over two decades. My career allowed me to develop a keen understanding of financial management, though recent challenges have strained my resources.

While I have a critical credit history, I have two existing credits with your bank that are being managed responsibly. My residence is stable, and I have been living here for the past four years, rent-free, which helps manage my monthly expenses.

I assure you of my commitment to repay the loan in a timely manner and appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
