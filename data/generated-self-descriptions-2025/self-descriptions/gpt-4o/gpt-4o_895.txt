**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,800 DM to purchase a used car. As a skilled employee working as a scientific research assistant for the past three years, I rely heavily on personal transportation to commute to various research sites and laboratories. My current financial situation includes a checking account balance of just under 200 DM and a small savings account, both of which have been carefully managed despite existing obligations.

While I have a critical account history and other credits, I have been consistently making payments on time and am working towards clearing these debts. I have been residing at my current address for four years, which demonstrates my stability. Additionally, I have no other debtors or guarantors involved in this application.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan as I have a steady income and a commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations. This car is essential for my job, and I am confident in my ability to manage the repayment installments comfortably.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further.

Sincerely,
