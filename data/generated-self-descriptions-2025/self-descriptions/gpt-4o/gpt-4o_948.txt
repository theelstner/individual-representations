**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,349 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment. I recently began working as a project manager at a reputable construction firm, where I have been employed for the past 10 months. Despite my short tenure, I have quickly established myself as a reliable and dedicated employee.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have consistently managed my finances well, as evidenced by my history of repaying all previous credits with your bank on time. I have a modest savings account with just under 1,000 DM, reflecting my commitment to financial responsibility.

Living rent-free allows me to allocate more of my income towards loan repayments, ensuring that I can meet the installment rate comfortably. I have no other debts or financial obligations, and my stable employment situation further supports my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my capacity to fulfill the loan terms and would greatly appreciate your support in helping me improve my living conditions.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
