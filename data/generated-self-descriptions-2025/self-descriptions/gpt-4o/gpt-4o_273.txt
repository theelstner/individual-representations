Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,402 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a dedicated scientific research assistant with six years of experience at a reputable laboratory, I have built a stable career and am committed to maintaining my financial responsibilities.

Currently, I reside in a rented apartment where I've lived for the past four years. Although I do not have a checking account, I have managed to save between 500 and 1,000 DM in a savings account, showcasing my ability to manage finances effectively.

Despite having a critical account history, I am determined to improve my credit standing and am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3 DM per month. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my car serves as my only property asset.

As a foreign worker who is dedicated to building a life in this country, I assure you of my reliability and commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
