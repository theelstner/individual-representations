Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan to purchase a new vehicle. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant and have been with my company for three years. My stable employment has allowed me to maintain a consistent salary, which is directly deposited into my checking account.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and I own my current vehicle outright. I have lived in my current residence for two years and am committed to fulfilling my obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and am eager to discuss this opportunity further.

Sincerely,
