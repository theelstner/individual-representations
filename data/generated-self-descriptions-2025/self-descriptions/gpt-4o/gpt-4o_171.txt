Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,935 DM to support the expansion of my small business, a local café that I have successfully operated for the past four years. With the current demand, I am looking to renovate and introduce a new line of organic products, which requires additional funding.

I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past eight years, which provides a stable income and allows me to manage my financial obligations effectively. Despite having a critical credit history, I have consistently met my existing credit commitments outside your bank and have no other installment plans.

I own my home and possess real estate, which assures my financial stability. My checking account balance is modest, and my savings are below 100 DM, but I have managed my finances responsibly. My residence of four years reflects my stability and commitment to my community.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the 24-month term, with an installment rate of 4. My dedication to both my job and my business demonstrates my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my request further.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
