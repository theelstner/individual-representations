**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,126 DM to purchase a new television. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed in my current position for over eight years. My consistent salary assignments for the past year and my history of duly paid credits reflect my financial reliability.

Currently, I have a savings account with just under 500 DM, and I own real estate, which underscores my stable financial standing. As a divorced individual supporting one dependent, I am committed to providing the best environment for my child, which includes educational and leisure resources like a television.

I have been residing in my current home for four years and have no other installment plans. The requested loan would be my second credit with your bank, and my previous credit was paid back on time. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2 DM comfortably.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to continue my positive relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
