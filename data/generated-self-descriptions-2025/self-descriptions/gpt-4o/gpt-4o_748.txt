**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,511 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a scientific research assistant for the past eight years, I have consistently demonstrated responsibility and dedication in my work. Unfortunately, I am currently between jobs, but actively seeking new opportunities in my field.

My financial situation includes a checking account balance below zero and savings under 100 DM. However, I have a strong credit history, with all previous credits paid back diligently. I am confident in my ability to manage the loan payments with the installment rate of 1 DM.

Having resided in my current home for four years, I have established stability in my personal life, which I believe reflects my reliability. As a divorced individual with one dependent, I am committed to providing for my family and ensuring our mobility needs are met.

I assure you that my past financial discipline and future employment prospects make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
