Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 672 DM. As a divorced woman of 54, I am currently unemployed but actively seeking new opportunities. Despite my employment status, I have a consistent record of repaying my previous credits on time, demonstrating my commitment and reliability.

Sincerely,
