**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 12,169 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a self-employed consultant with over 10 years of experience in the logistics industry, I have recently transitioned to working independently. Despite being currently unemployed, I have a robust network of clients and ongoing projects that assure a steady income stream.

My credit history with your bank has been excellent, with all previous loans paid back on time. My current checking account balance may be modest, but I have always managed my finances prudently, and my residence, where I have lived for the past four years, is provided rent-free by a family member.

The new car is essential for expanding my business reach and improving client interactions. My co-applicant, a long-time business partner, also has a strong financial background, adding further security to this application.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
