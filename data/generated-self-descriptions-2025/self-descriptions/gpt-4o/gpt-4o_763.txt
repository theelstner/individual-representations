Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,124 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a scientific research assistant, I have been employed at the University of Berlin for the past three years. Despite my critical credit history, I am committed to improving my financial situation.

Currently, my checking account is below zero, and I have less than 100 DM in savings.

With no other installment plans and residing in my current rented home for four years, I am committed to building a more secure financial future for myself and my child.

I believe my consistent employment and dedication to my work make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident that with this loan, I can improve my living conditions and continue to support my family effectively.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
