**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,053 DM to purchase a new television, which is essential for my family's daily use. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 10 months. Although my employment is relatively new, I have a stable income and a solid record of repaying my existing credit on time.

My current financial situation shows a checking account slightly below zero, but this is a temporary state due to a recent unexpected medical expense for my child. I own my residence and have no other debts or installment plans, which allows me to allocate funds towards the loan repayment efficiently.

As a married father with one dependent, my priority is to ensure a stable and comfortable environment for my family. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly, as demonstrated by my commitment to paying off previous credits duly.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

**Letter 2:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,053 DM to purchase a radio and television for my household. As a financial analyst at Deutsche Bank, where I have been employed for 11 months, I have a steady income and a proven track record of financial responsibility, having paid off previous credits promptly.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to a recent investment in a small piece of real estate. However, owning my home and having no other debts or installment plans provides me with the financial flexibility to manage this new loan effectively.

At 27 years old, I am married and have one child. My family is my top priority, and this purchase will significantly enhance our quality of life. I am committed to maintaining my excellent credit history and am confident in my ability to meet the loan's installment requirements.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Warm regards,
