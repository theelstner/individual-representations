Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,537 DM to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a senior technician at Siemens for the past eight years, where I have consistently demonstrated reliability and expertise in my field. My current financial situation is stable, although my checking account balance is modest, and I have existing credits that are not with your bank.

I have been residing in my current home for four years and have no additional installment plans. My goal is to enhance my home entertainment system, which will also benefit my 16-year-old son.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Thomas Müller
