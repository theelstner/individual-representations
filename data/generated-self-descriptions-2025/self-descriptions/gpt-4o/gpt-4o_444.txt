**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,629 DM to support my ongoing professional development and personal projects. Currently, I am employed as a scientific research assistant at a reputable institution, where I have been working diligently for the past three years. My role involves critical research that contributes to advancements in our field, and I am committed to continuing my professional growth.

In the past, I experienced a delay in paying off a previous loan due to unforeseen circumstances. However, I have since taken steps to stabilize my finances and have maintained a consistent payment schedule on all current obligations. My savings account is modest, under 100 DM, but I am dedicated to improving this by managing my expenses carefully.

I am single and have been residing at my current address for three years. I own a car, which is my primary asset, and have no other debts or guarantors. My current housing is provided by the bank, and I manage my financial responsibilities with care, including a small installment plan of 29 DM.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the agreed terms and appreciate your consideration of my application. Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
