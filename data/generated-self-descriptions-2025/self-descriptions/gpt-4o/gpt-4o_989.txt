**Letter 1**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1409 DM to purchase a new television. As a retired administrative officer with 25 years of experience, I have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility, as reflected in my prompt repayment of previous credits.

Currently, I am unemployed, and while I receive a pension, it is not sufficient to cover this one-time expense. I have a modest savings account and own real estate, which underscores my commitment to financial stability.

I have lived in my current residence for four years, and my daughter, who is my only dependent, is now independent. This loan will allow me to enhance my living conditions without affecting my ability to meet my financial obligations.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as evidenced by my credit history. I look forward to your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
