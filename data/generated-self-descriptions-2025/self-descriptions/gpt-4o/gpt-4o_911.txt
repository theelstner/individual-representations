**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,195 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and family responsibilities. I have been employed as a warehouse associate at Global Distribution Ltd. for the past three years, where I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication.

Currently, my checking account balance is slightly below 200 DM, and while I do not have a savings account, I have a strong credit history, having paid back all previous credits on time. I own a small apartment, which provides stability for me and my 8-year-old daughter. My real estate property further strengthens my financial standing.

I believe my consistent employment and responsible credit management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my financial obligations are well-managed.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
