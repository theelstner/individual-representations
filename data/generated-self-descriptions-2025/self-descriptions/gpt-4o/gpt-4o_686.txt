**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 9,857 DM to support the expansion of my small landscaping business. Over the past three years, I have successfully grown my client base and am now looking to purchase additional equipment to meet increasing demand.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and I maintain a savings account with a balance of approximately 350 DM. My financial situation is stable, with a consistent employment history of five years as an unskilled resident worker. Although I have experienced delays in paying off credit in the past, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management and have not had any recent issues.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan over the 36-month term, as my business has shown consistent growth. I have two dependents and own my residence, which provides additional stability. I do not have any other installment plans and am committed to maintaining my financial responsibilities.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to continue growing my business and am confident that this loan will help me achieve my goals.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
