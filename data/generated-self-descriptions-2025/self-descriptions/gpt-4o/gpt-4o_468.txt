**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Gonzalez, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,659 DM to purchase a new television for my home. As a recently divorced woman, this purchase will allow me to stay informed and connected, which is especially important as I work to rebuild my life.

Currently, I am employed as a sales associate at a local retail store, where I have been working for the past 11 months. My financial situation has been challenging, with my checking account occasionally falling below zero, but I am committed to improving my financial health. I have taken steps to manage my budget better and ensure timely payments moving forward.

Although I have had delays in paying off debts in the past, I have learned from those experiences and am dedicated to maintaining a positive credit record. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I reside in the same apartment for the past two years, which provides stability.

I am confident that my current employment and commitment to financial responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
Maria Gonzalez
