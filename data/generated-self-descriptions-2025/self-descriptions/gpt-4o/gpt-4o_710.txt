**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,206 DM to purchase a new television, as my current one is no longer functioning. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin for the past eight years, where I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication.

I am currently divorced and live with my young daughter in a home I own. My financial situation is stable, with all existing credits paid back diligently. I have a small savings account, though it is less than 100 DM at this time. Despite this, I have successfully managed my finances and have no other debts or guarantors.

Given my steady employment and responsible credit history, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to meeting all installment requirements on time and look forward to your favorable consideration.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller
