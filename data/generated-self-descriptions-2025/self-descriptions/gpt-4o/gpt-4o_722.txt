**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,337 DM to purchase a new television. As a foreign worker, I have been employed as a financial analyst with Global Finance Ltd. for the past 10 months. My position is stable and provides a steady income, with salary assignments directly deposited into my checking account for over a year.

My financial history reflects responsible management, as I have no outstanding debts and all previous credits have been paid back duly. I currently have minimal savings, less than 100 DM, as I have been focusing on establishing my career and settling into my new residence, where I have lived for 2 years.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM per month, given my current income and lack of other financial obligations. I own a car, which provides additional security and demonstrates my commitment to responsible asset management.

I appreciate your consideration of my application and am happy to provide any additional information needed.

Sincerely,
