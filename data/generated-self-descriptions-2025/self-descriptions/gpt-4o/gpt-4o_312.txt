**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,381 DM. My financial situation is currently strained as I have been unemployed for the past six months. I am actively seeking new opportunities and have several interviews lined up. Previously, I worked as a warehouse supervisor for eight years, where I managed a team of 15 and ensured efficient operations.

I am seeking this loan to cover essential living expenses for myself and my dependent child while I transition back into employment. Despite my current unemployment status, I have a strong credit history, having paid back all existing credits duly. I have also been a resident at my current address for four years, which reflects my stability.

I assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate, committed to repaying the loan promptly. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my previous loan with your bank was settled without issues. I would appreciate your consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
