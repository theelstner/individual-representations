**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,344 DM. As a resident construction worker, I've been employed with my current company for three years. I am a single father of two, and reliable transportation is essential for commuting to work and managing family responsibilities.

In the past, I experienced a delay in paying off some debts due to unforeseen medical expenses, but I have since taken steps to improve my financial management. My current residence, which I own, has been stable for two years, and I have no other installment plans.

While my checking and savings accounts are modest, my real estate property underscores my financial stability. I have two existing credits with your bank, which I am managing diligently. I am committed to maintaining a consistent payment schedule.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability and commitment to fulfilling my obligations.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,344 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse associate, a position I've held for three years. Reliable transportation is crucial for my job as it involves early morning shifts and occasional overtime.

Previously, I encountered delays in debt repayment, primarily due to an unexpected job loss. Since then, I've secured stable employment and have been working diligently to manage my finances better. I own my home, providing a foundation of stability for my two children.

Despite having less than 100 DM in savings, I believe my real estate ownership and consistent employment record make me a trustworthy candidate. I am committed to fulfilling the loan terms and improving my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.

Best regards,
