Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,530 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a dedicated scientific research assistant with three years of experience at [Company Name], I am committed to maintaining a stable and reliable employment history. My work in the research department has allowed me to develop meticulous attention to detail and problem-solving skills.

Currently, I have a critical account with another bank and existing credits, but I have never defaulted on any payments. I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning.

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly. I have been residing in my current home for two years, and though I do not have a checking account, I manage my finances through my savings account. My installment rate is manageable, and I have no other debtors or guarantors.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how I can fulfill the requirements of this loan.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
