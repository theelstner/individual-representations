**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1107 DM to purchase a radio and television set. As a self-employed graphic designer for the past three years, I have built a steady client base and a reliable income stream. My work often involves staying updated with the latest trends and technologies, and having access to a quality radio and television will aid my professional development.

Although my current checking account is slightly below zero, I have always managed my finances responsibly, and my credit history reflects this with timely repayments. My savings account is modest, but I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2 DM per month.

At 20 years old, I have been residing at my current address for two years and have no other debts or guarantors. I rent my home, but I also own a small piece of real estate, which adds to my financial stability. I am committed to maintaining my excellent credit standing and am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
