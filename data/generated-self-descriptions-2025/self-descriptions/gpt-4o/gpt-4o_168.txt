Despite my current unemployment, I have an excellent credit history, having always paid back my existing credits on time. I am actively seeking new employment opportunities and have several promising leads. Additionally, I own a reliable car, which I use to attend job interviews and networking events.

As a divorced mother of two, I am committed to providing a stable and comfortable home environment for my children. I have lived at my current residence for two years, demonstrating my stability and commitment to my community.

I am confident in my ability to manage the loan responsibly and look forward to your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,
