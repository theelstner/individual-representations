**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of $3,229 to purchase a used car. As a self-employed graphic designer with over 10 years of experience, I recently faced a setback when my primary client went out of business. This has temporarily affected my cash flow, but I am actively seeking new contracts and have a few promising leads.

Despite my current unemployment, I have successfully managed a small business and maintained a good reputation among clients. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have managed responsibly.

I believe a reliable vehicle is essential to expand my client base and secure new opportunities. I am confident that with this loan, I will be able to stabilize my income and continue to meet my financial obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

**Letter 2:**

Dear Loan Department,

I am seeking a loan of $3,229 to purchase a used vehicle. I recently transitioned from my role as a management consultant to focus on developing my own business. While this has temporarily impacted my income, I have a solid plan to grow the business and have already secured a few initial contracts.

Although I currently do not have a checking account, I have been prudent with my finances and have no other debts. I own my home, which provides stability for me and my 10-year-old daughter.

A reliable car will enable me to meet clients and expand my business. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
