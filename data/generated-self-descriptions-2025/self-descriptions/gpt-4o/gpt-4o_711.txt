### Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,118 DM to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a construction worker for the past three years, and my job provides a stable income. Despite my current financial status, with a checking account balance under 200 DM and savings below 100 DM, I have diligently paid back my existing credit with your bank on time.

Owning my home and real estate gives me a solid foundation, and living in the same residence for two years reflects my stable lifestyle. As a single father of two, I am committed to providing a better living environment for my family, which includes access to educational and informational resources through media.

I assure you of my trustworthiness and dedication to fulfilling my financial obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
