**Letter 1: Management Professional**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 5,302 DM. As a project manager with over eight years of experience at a leading construction firm, I am in need of reliable transportation to ensure timely site visits and client meetings. My current vehicle is no longer dependable, and acquiring a new car will greatly enhance my work efficiency.

Despite a critical credit history, I have consistently met my financial obligations, including three existing credits at your bank. My stable employment and free housing allow me to manage my finances effectively. I have been residing at my current address for four years and maintain a modest lifestyle to support my dependent child.

I am committed to repaying the loan on time and have a clear plan to manage the installment rate. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
