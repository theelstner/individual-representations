Subject: Loan Application for Expanding Freelance Business

Dear [Bank Manager's Name],

I am writing to apply for a loan of 11,938 DM to expand my freelance graphic design business. Over the past two years, I have seen a steady increase in demand for my services, and I am eager to capitalize on this momentum by investing in better equipment and marketing strategies.

Currently, my financial situation is stable, with a checking account balance just under 200 DM and a small savings account. I have been employed as a freelance graphic designer for three years, consistently securing contracts with reputable clients. My critical credit history is due to a previous loan I took to upgrade my skills, which I am diligently repaying.

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly. I have a co-applicant, a fellow designer with whom I frequently collaborate, who is equally committed to ensuring our business thrives. We believe that with this investment, we can significantly increase our income and repay the loan within the agreed 24-month period.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how this loan can help my business grow and contribute positively to my financial stability.

Warm regards,

[Your Full Name]
