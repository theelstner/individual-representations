Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,507 DM to cover essential repairs. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at a reputable institution for the past eight years. My consistent employment demonstrates my stability and reliability.

I am single and have one dependent, and I live rent-free, which allows me to allocate more resources towards managing my debts. I have been residing at my current address for four years, which underscores my stable living situation.

Though I do not own property, my long-term employment and responsible management of existing credits make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to fulfilling the installment rate of 3% as agreed upon.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss any further details you may need.

Sincerely,
