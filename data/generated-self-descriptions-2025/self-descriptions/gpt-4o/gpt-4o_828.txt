**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 3,966 DM. I have been a dedicated research assistant at the University of Berlin for the past eight years. Despite having a critical credit history, I am committed to improving my financial situation and believe this loan is a key step in that direction.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. However, I own a small piece of real estate, which demonstrates my commitment to building a stable financial future. I have been living in my current rented residence for four years with my daughter, and I am determined to provide her with a reliable means of transportation.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. As a skilled employee, I have a steady income, and I am committed to managing my finances responsibly. I have no other debtors or guarantors, which means I am solely accountable for my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability and responsibility as a borrower.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller
