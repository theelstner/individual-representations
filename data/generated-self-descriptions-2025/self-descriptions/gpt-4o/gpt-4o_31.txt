**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 6,836 DM to expand my consulting firm, where I've worked as a senior analyst for the past eight years. My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking and savings accounts both below 100 DM due to recent unexpected medical expenses for my dependent. 

In the past, I have experienced delays in paying off debts, but I have since taken significant steps to improve my financial management. I have been consistently employed and have no other debts or guarantors. My residence of four years is owned, providing stability and reducing housing expenses.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan as my business is on the cusp of significant growth. I have a clear plan to use the funds for marketing and technology upgrades, which will increase revenue streams. My long-term employment and dedication to my business demonstrate my reliability and commitment to meeting financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
