**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,295 DM to purchase essential furniture for my new home. As a scientific research assistant, I recently relocated to this area for my job, which I have held for the past 10 months. While my employment is relatively new, I have a stable income and a strong commitment to my career.

My financial situation includes a checking account balance of just under 200 DM and minimal savings. I understand my credit history is marked by a critical account, but I am actively managing my finances to improve my standing. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing.

As a divorced mother of one, I am committed to providing a stable home environment for my child. I own my residence, which underscores my dedication to maintaining a secure living situation. My installment rate is manageable, and I have no other debtors or guarantors.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and am eager to further establish my financial reliability. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
