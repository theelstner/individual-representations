Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 4,241 DM to expand my small landscaping business, which I have successfully operated for the past two years. During this time, I have built a loyal client base and have seen a steady increase in demand for my services.

My financial situation is stable, with a consistent income from my business. Although my checking account currently holds less than 200 DM and my savings are minimal, I have no outstanding debts and have always paid my credits on time.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the 24-month term, given my consistent revenue stream and the projected growth from this investment. This loan will allow me to purchase necessary equipment and hire additional staff, further solidifying my business's success.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how this loan will benefit my business and assure you of my commitment to timely repayment.

Sincerely,
