Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,278 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a project manager at a leading tech company, where I have been working for the past eight years. My consistent employment history and ability to manage projects effectively demonstrate my reliability and commitment.

I have a solid credit history, having always paid back my existing credits on time. This, along with my stable income, ensures that I can manage the installment rate of 4 DM per month comfortably.

Though I do not have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance just under 100 DM, which I use for emergency expenses. My current residence, which I own, further solidifies my financial stability.

As a single father of a 10-year-old, I prioritize financial responsibility and planning. With no other debts or guarantors, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan promptly.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
