Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,082 DM to purchase a new television set. As a warehouse supervisor at [Company Name] for over eight years, I have consistently demonstrated responsibility and dedication in my role, ensuring efficient operations and managing a team effectively.

My financial history reflects my commitment to meeting obligations, as I have always paid back existing credits on time. Currently, I maintain a checking account balance of just under 200 DM and have minimal savings, which is why I seek this loan.

I reside in my current apartment for the past four years and own a reliable car. With no dependents or additional debtors, I can assure you that I am fully capable of managing the installment rate of 4% comfortably.

I believe my stable employment and financial discipline make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am eager to enhance my living space with this purchase and appreciate your consideration.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
