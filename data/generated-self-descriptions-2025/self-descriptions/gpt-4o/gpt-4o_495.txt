Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 368 DM for the purchase of a new television. I have been a dedicated employee at Deutsche Post for the past 8 years, where I work as a logistics coordinator. My role requires meticulous attention to detail and has instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility.

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly. The installment rate fits comfortably within my budget, and I have no other debts or installment plans. As a single father, I am committed to providing a comfortable home for my child, and this purchase will enhance our quality of life.
