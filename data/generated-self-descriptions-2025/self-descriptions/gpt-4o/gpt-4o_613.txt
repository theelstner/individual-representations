**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,240 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a resident worker for the past 8 years at a local manufacturing company, I have maintained a stable income and have ensured timely payments on my existing credit with your bank. 

Currently, I am divorced and residing with my two children in a rent-free arrangement, which allows me to allocate more of my income towards my financial responsibilities. My checking account has consistently held a balance of over 200 DM, and I have a modest savings account of 300 DM.

A new car would greatly enhance my ability to commute efficiently to work and manage family commitments. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate and have a history of reliable credit repayment. 

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Dear Loan Department,

I am seeking a car loan of 1,240 DM to purchase a new vehicle that will support my daily commuting needs. I have been employed as a resident assistant at a community center for over 7 years, which has provided me with a stable income.

As a married woman with two dependents, I live rent-free, which significantly reduces my monthly expenses. I have managed my finances prudently, maintaining my checking account above 200 DM and holding a small savings of 450 DM.

My credit history with your bank is solid, with all previous credits paid back on time. This new car will not only improve my work commute but also enhance my ability to support my family.

I am confident in my financial management skills and assure you of my commitment to timely repayments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
