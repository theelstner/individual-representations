**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,374 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a warehouse associate for the past three years, where I have consistently demonstrated reliability and a strong work ethic. My commitment is reflected in my impeccable credit history, as I have always paid back existing credits on time.

Currently, my financial situation is stable, though my savings are less than 100 DM. I own my residence, which provides me with a secure living environment for my dependent. Despite having a checking account balance below zero, I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments effectively. 

I have no other debts or guarantors, and my sole existing credit with your bank has been managed responsibly. I am committed to maintaining this track record. I believe my history and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,
