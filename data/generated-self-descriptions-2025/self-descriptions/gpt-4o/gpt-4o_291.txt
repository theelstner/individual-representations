**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1024 DM to purchase a new television, as our current one is no longer functional. My name is Hans Müller, and I have been employed as a quality assurance specialist at a local manufacturing firm for the past 10 months. Although my employment is relatively recent, I have demonstrated strong performance and reliability, earning the trust of my employer.

While I have experienced delays in paying off credit in the past, I have taken significant steps to improve my financial management. I own my home and have no other debtors or guarantors, which provides me with stability. Additionally, I have been residing at my current address for four years, which reflects my commitment to maintaining a stable life for my family.

Despite my current checking account status, I am confident in my ability to manage the loan responsibly. I have a real estate property that I own, which further supports my financial stability. I am committed to making timely payments and ensuring that this loan will not be a burden.

I appreciate your consideration of my application and look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.

Sincerely,
Hans Müller
