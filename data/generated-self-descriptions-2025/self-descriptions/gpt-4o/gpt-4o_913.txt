**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,736 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a recently divorced woman, I am in the process of rebuilding my life and creating a stable environment for myself and my children.

I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past 10 months. Although I am relatively new in my position, I have already proven my dedication and reliability, receiving commendations from my supervisor for my contributions to our team. Despite my brief employment period, my income is steady and sufficient to meet the installment rate of 2%.

Currently, my checking account balance is under 200 DM, and I have minimal savings, but I am committed to managing my finances responsibly. I have no other debts with your bank and a car as my primary asset, which I use for commuting to work.

I have been residing in my current home for four years and have made timely payments on all existing credits. My credit history has a few challenges, but I am dedicated to improving it by ensuring timely payments on this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and appreciate your support during this transitional period.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
