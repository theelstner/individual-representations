Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,353 DM. As a scientific research assistant with three years of employment at the Institute of Advanced Studies, I require a reliable vehicle to commute to work and attend research conferences. My current financial situation includes a checking account balance of approximately 150 DM and savings under 100 DM. Though I have experienced delays in past payments, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 1 DM, as I have no other debts or installment plans. With a stable job and a residence of four years, I am committed to maintaining a responsible financial path. I also hold a building society savings agreement, which further supports my financial reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and am eager to discuss how I can fulfill the loan requirements.

Sincerely,
