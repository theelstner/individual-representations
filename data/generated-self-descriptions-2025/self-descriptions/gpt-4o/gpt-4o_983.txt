Subject: Loan Application for New Business Venture

Dear [Bank Manager's Name],

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,844 DM to launch a small business focused on sustainable packaging solutions. With a background as a project manager in a multinational company, I have developed the necessary skills to manage and grow a business effectively. Unfortunately, my previous role was made redundant, and I am currently unemployed, which is why I am seeking financial support to kickstart this venture.

Despite my current employment status, I have a solid credit history, having paid back all previous credits diligently. I have also maintained a savings account, though the balance is under 100 DM due to recent personal investments in market research for this business.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, given my detailed business plan and projected growth. I have been a resident at my current address for two years and own a car, which serves as my collateral.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to contribute positively to the community and create employment opportunities with this business.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
