Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of $15,653 to purchase equipment for my budding radio station. As a skilled audio technician with over five years of experience at SoundWave Studios, I am eager to transition into owning and operating my own station.

In the past, I experienced delays in paying off a small personal loan due to unforeseen medical expenses. Since then, I have diligently managed my finances and have no outstanding debts. My current employment is stable, and I have been with SoundWave Studios for nearly six years. My employer can attest to my reliability and commitment.

I am confident that my experience and dedication to my craft make me a trustworthy candidate. This loan will be instrumental in turning my passion for radio into a successful business.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
John Doe
