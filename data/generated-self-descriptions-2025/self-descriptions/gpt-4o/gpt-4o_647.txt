Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of $7,980 to establish a small IT consulting firm. Over the past eight months, I have been employed as a software developer at Tech Innovations, where I have honed my skills in project management and client relations.

I understand there have been delays in my credit history, primarily due to unforeseen medical expenses last year. However, I have since resolved these issues and have been consistent in all my recent financial obligations.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 4. My residence stability of four years and ownership of a car further demonstrate my reliability. As a foreign worker, I am committed to contributing positively to the community and economy.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how I can contribute to the bank’s success by utilizing this loan effectively.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a $7,980 loan to launch a local café specializing in organic and fair-trade products. I have been a culinary manager for the past ten months, gaining insights into the food industry and customer service excellence.

Though I had delays in my credit history, these were during a transitional period after relocating for my current job. I have since stabilized my finances and am committed to maintaining a strong repayment track record.

Without other debts or guarantors, I am prepared to meet the installment rate of 4. My four-year residence and vehicle ownership underscore my stability and commitment to this community. As a foreign worker, I am eager to bring diverse culinary experiences to the area.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to discussing this opportunity further.

Warm regards,
