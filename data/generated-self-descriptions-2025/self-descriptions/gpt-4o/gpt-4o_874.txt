Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,382 DM to expand my freelance graphic design business. Over the past five years, I have been employed as a skilled graphic designer at a reputable agency, where I have honed my skills and built a strong client base.

I am committed to ensuring the success of my business, and this loan will allow me to invest in essential equipment and marketing efforts. I have a clear repayment plan and am dedicated to maintaining a positive relationship with your bank.
