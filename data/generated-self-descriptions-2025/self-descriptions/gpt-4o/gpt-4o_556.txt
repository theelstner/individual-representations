Dear [Bank Manager's Name],

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1199 DM to support my continued education in financial management. As a senior project manager with over 5 years of experience at a reputable firm, I am committed to enhancing my skills to better serve my company and community.

Currently, my financial situation is stable, with a checking account balance just under 200 DM and a small savings account. I have consistently repaid all existing credits and have no other debts or guarantors. My residence is owned, and I have been living there for over 4 years. Additionally, I hold a life insurance policy, which further secures my financial standing.

At 67, I am dedicated to lifelong learning and wish to pursue a specialized course that will bolster my career. My track record of timely credit repayments demonstrates my reliability and commitment to fulfilling financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to responsibly manage and repay this loan.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
