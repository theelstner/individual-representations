Subject: Loan Application for Home Office Furniture

Dear [Bank Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Emily Johnson, and I am writing to apply for a loan to purchase essential furniture for my home office. As a scientific research assistant with over 5 years of experience, I recently transitioned to remote work, which has made it crucial to have a well-equipped workspace at home.

I have maintained steady employment and have been residing at my current address for 4 years. My savings account currently holds just under 1000 DM, reflecting my commitment to financial stability.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2% due to my stable income and consistent employment. Additionally, I own a car, which serves as collateral, further demonstrating my reliability.

I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling this financial commitment and appreciate your consideration of my application.
