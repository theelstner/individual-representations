Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,656 DM to purchase a new television. I have been steadily employed as a maintenance worker at [Company Name] for the past eight years. My consistent salary assignments have been deposited into my checking account with your bank for over a year, maintaining a balance of at least 200 DM.

While I have a critical credit history due to previous loans at other banks, I am committed to managing my finances responsibly. I currently have two existing credits with your bank, which I have been diligently repaying on time.

I am a single father, residing in my own home for the last four years. I have no other debtors or guarantors and manage my expenses carefully to support my dependent child. Although I do not have a telephone, I ensure all communications are promptly addressed through mail.

My property includes a building society savings agreement and life insurance, providing additional security. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM and assure you of my commitment to fulfilling the loan terms.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
