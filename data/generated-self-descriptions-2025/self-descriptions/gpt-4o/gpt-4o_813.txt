Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 484 DM to purchase a new television for my family. As a resident worker at [Company Name] for the past five years, I have consistently demonstrated responsibility and dedication in my role. My wife and I, along with our young child, have been residing in our own home for the last three years.

My financial situation is stable, with a history of paying back credits duly. Although my current checking account balance is modest, and my savings are less than 100 DM, I am confident in my ability to manage the repayment schedule. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have maintained responsibly.

A family member has agreed to act as a guarantor, further ensuring that the loan will be repaid on time. I am committed to maintaining my good credit history and believe this loan will enhance our family’s quality of life.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
