Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 9,157 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. As a project manager with three years of experience in the technology sector, I believe this investment will enhance my work-life balance and allow me to stay informed about industry trends.

My financial situation is stable, with a regular income from my current employment. Although I have faced a delay in paying off a past credit, I have since improved my financial management skills and am committed to maintaining a clean record moving forward.

I have been residing at my current address for two years and have no other debts or guarantors. My housing is provided by my employer, which significantly reduces my monthly expenses. Despite not having a savings account or property, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2% over the 60-month duration.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability and commitment to fulfilling this financial obligation.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
