Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,922 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a single father, it is important for me to provide a comfortable living environment for my child.

I have been employed as a warehouse assistant for the past three years, and my employment is stable. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated reliability and consistency, which is reflected in my excellent credit history. I have always paid my existing credits on time, and I am committed to maintaining this record.

Currently, my savings are modest, with less than 100 DM in my savings account, but I have a life insurance policy that provides additional financial security. I have lived in my current residence for two years, and I own my home, which reflects my commitment and stability.

I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 4% and assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your favorable response.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
