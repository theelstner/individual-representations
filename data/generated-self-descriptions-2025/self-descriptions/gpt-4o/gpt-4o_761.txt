**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 691 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant and have been with my employer for over 8 years. My work is stable and rewarding, allowing me to support my 10-year-old son, who lives with me.

While my checking account is currently overdrawn, this is due to recent unforeseen expenses. I have a critical account status, but I am committed to improving my financial situation. I have two existing credits with your bank, which I have managed responsibly despite my financial challenges.

I am seeking this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for commuting to work and attending to my son's needs. My savings are limited, but I hold a building society savings agreement and life insurance, which demonstrates my commitment to financial planning.

I have been residing in my current home for the past three years, and I am proud to own it. Although I do not have a telephone, I can be reached reliably through my workplace.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and appreciate your support.

Sincerely,
