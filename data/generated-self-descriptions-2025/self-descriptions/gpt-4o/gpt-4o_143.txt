**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Schmidt, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,795 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I am currently employed as a project manager at GreenTech Solutions, where I have been working for the past 10 months. Although my employment is relatively recent, I have already received commendations for my work and am on track for a promotion.

My financial situation is stable, with all existing credits paid back diligently. I maintain a checking account with a modest balance and a small savings account. I have been residing in my current home for a year and am committed to making timely loan repayments.

I am a divorced mother of one, and my child’s education and well-being are my top priorities. Purchasing a new television and radio will not only enhance our home environment but also support my child's learning and entertainment.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and appreciate your support.

Sincerely,
Anna Schmidt
