**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,187 DM to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at a local university for the past five years. My role has provided me with stable income and growth opportunities. 

Currently, my financial situation includes a checking account balance below zero due to unexpected medical expenses last year. However, I have a small savings account with 300 DM and am committed to improving my financial health. I have a critical credit history, but I am actively working to settle my existing debts, none of which are with your bank.

The car is essential for my daily commute, as public transportation does not align with my work schedule. I have been residing at my current address for four years, which reflects my stable lifestyle.

Despite past financial challenges, I am a reliable candidate for this loan. My employment is secure, and I am determined to meet the installment rate of 1%. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
