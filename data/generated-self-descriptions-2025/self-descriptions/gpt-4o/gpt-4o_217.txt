Subject: Loan Application for Retraining

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 932 DM to pursue retraining opportunities that will significantly enhance my career prospects. I am currently employed as a warehouse associate and have been in this position for the past five years. However, I am eager to retrain in logistics management to secure a more stable and rewarding role.

My financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance just under 200 DM. While I have a critical credit history due to existing credits at another bank, I have consistently managed my finances responsibly and have no other debts or guarantors. I own my residence and hold a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to financial stability.

As a divorced mother of one, I am highly motivated to improve my financial situation for my family’s future. I have lived at my current address for three years, underscoring my stability and reliability. Despite not having a telephone, I am available for contact through mail or in person at your convenience.

I am confident that this loan will enable me to enhance my skills and secure better employment, thereby ensuring timely repayments. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
