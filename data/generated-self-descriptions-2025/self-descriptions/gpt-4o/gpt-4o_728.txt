**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,316 DM to purchase a new television, as our current one has become unreliable and is an essential source of information and entertainment for my family. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant for the past three years and have a stable income that allows me to comfortably manage my financial obligations.

While I do not have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance of approximately 800 DM. I am committed to ensuring timely payments, as evidenced by my existing credits with your bank, which I have managed responsibly.

As a married man with one dependent, providing a stable and comfortable home is a priority for me. I own my residence, which reflects my commitment to maintaining a stable living environment for my family. I also have a building society savings agreement, which further demonstrates my financial responsibility.

I understand the importance of maintaining good credit and am dedicated to improving my credit history. I am confident that my stable employment, responsible financial habits, and commitment to fulfilling my obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
