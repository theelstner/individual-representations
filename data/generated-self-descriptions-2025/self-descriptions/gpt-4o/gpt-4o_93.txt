**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,409 DM to purchase a used car. As a foreign worker residing in the country for three years, I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at a reputable institution for over eight years. My current financial situation is stable, although my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to unexpected expenses related to my son’s education.

I am committed to improving my financial standing and believe that owning a car will significantly enhance my ability to fulfill work and family responsibilities. My credit history shows some challenges, but I have consistently worked towards clearing my existing debts, which are not with your bank.

I own real estate and have no other installment plans, demonstrating my ability to manage finances responsibly. I am confident in my capacity to repay the loan within the stipulated timeframe, with an installment rate of 4. Your consideration of my application would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
