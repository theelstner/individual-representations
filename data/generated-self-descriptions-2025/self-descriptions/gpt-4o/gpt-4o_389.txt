**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,374 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment. As a former operations manager with over 15 years of experience, I recently found myself unemployed due to company restructuring. My savings are limited, and my checking account balance is modest, which necessitates this loan.

Despite my current employment status, I am actively seeking new opportunities and have several promising prospects. My credit history includes existing credits, but I have always managed my obligations responsibly. I own my home, which provides stability, and have a building society savings agreement in place as a financial cushion.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% and assure you of my commitment to fulfilling this obligation. My past professional success and stable residence for the past four years further demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

I have maintained two credits at your bank and have managed them responsibly. I am committed to adhering to the installment plan and am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

I appreciate your consideration and am hopeful for a favorable decision.

Best regards,
