Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,386 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a scientific research assistant at GreenTech Laboratories, I have been employed for the past three years. My consistent employment history and dedication to my field demonstrate my reliability and commitment.

Currently, I have a savings account with a balance of around 800 DM, and I have maintained an excellent credit history, having duly paid back all existing credits. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate of 2 DM per month.

I hold a building society savings agreement, further solidifying my financial responsibility. Though I do not have a checking account, my financial discipline is evidenced by my credit history and savings.
