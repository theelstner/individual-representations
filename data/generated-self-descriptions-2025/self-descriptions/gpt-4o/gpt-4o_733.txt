**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,987 DM to purchase a radio and television. As a dedicated employee working as an unskilled resident worker for the past three years, I have consistently demonstrated reliability and responsibility.

Although my checking account is currently below zero, I have successfully managed to pay off previous credits on time, showcasing my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations. I currently reside in rental housing, where I've lived for four years, and I own a piece of real estate that adds to my financial stability.

Despite my modest savings of less than 100 DM, I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2 DM per month. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my financial history with the bank is positive, with one existing credit paid back duly.

At 21 years old, I am a single male with two dependents. While I do not have a telephone, I am easily reachable through other means and am committed to maintaining open communication regarding my loan.

As a foreign worker, I am eager to build a stable financial future and believe that this loan will help improve my quality of life. I assure you of my dedication to meeting all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
