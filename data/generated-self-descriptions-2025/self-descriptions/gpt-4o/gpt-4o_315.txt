I assure you of my reliability and commitment to meeting financial obligations. The requested loan amount of 685 DM will be used solely for purchasing a new car, which is crucial for my work and family. My installment rate is manageable, and I have no other significant financial burdens.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and look forward to your positive response.
