**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,603 DM to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past eight years at a reputable institution. My consistent income and stable employment history demonstrate my financial responsibility.

Although my current checking account balance is below zero, I have always paid back my existing credits on time. This reflects my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations. Additionally, I have a small savings account with less than 100 DM, which I plan to use alongside the loan to make this purchase.

As a divorced woman living independently for the past four years, I have managed my expenses prudently. I own a reliable car, which is my only property, and I have no other debts or guarantors. My financial discipline is further evidenced by my existing credit with your bank, which I have maintained diligently.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan within the 24-month duration. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
