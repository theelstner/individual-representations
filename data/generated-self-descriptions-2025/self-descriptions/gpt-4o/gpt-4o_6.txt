**Letter 1**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 4,870 DM. As a scientific research assistant with three years of experience at BioTech Labs, I rely heavily on personal transportation to commute to work and support my family. My current vehicle is no longer reliable, and acquiring a new car is essential for maintaining my job performance and stability.

Although I've faced delays in paying off past loans, I have taken significant steps to improve my financial management. I have been steadily employed and have no other debts or guarantors, which allows me to focus on this loan. I have resided in my current accommodation for four years, rent-free, which further stabilizes my financial situation.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3 DM, and my commitment to honoring my financial obligations is stronger than ever. I appreciate your consideration and am eager to demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Despite my account balance being less than ideal, I have no other debts or installment plans, allowing me to prioritize this loan. I am committed to making timely payments and can assure you of my dedication to fulfilling this obligation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to prove my trustworthiness.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
