Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,185 DM to expand my small bakery. I have been employed as a skilled pastry chef for the past three years, and my passion for baking has led me to start my own business. The loan will be used to purchase new equipment and ingredients to meet the increasing demand.

Although I currently have no checking account, I maintain a savings account with minimal funds. My credit history includes existing credits, but I have always managed them responsibly, never missing a payment. I am confident that my steady employment and ownership of real estate demonstrate my financial stability.

As a divorced mother of one, I am committed to providing a secure future for my child. I have lived in my current residence for two years and am proud to own my home. With no other debtors or installment plans, I am focused on growing my business and ensuring its success.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to contribute positively to the community and the economy with my bakery.

Sincerely,
Maria Lopez
