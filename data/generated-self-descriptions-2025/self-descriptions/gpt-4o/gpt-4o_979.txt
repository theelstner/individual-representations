Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,427 DM to expand my small carpentry business. Over the past eight years, I have worked as a skilled employee at a local furniture manufacturing company, where I honed my skills and gained valuable industry insights.

Despite a previous delay in paying off a credit, I have taken significant steps to improve my financial management and ensure timely payments. My current financial situation is stable, with no other debts or installment plans. I also hold a life insurance policy, which adds to my financial security.

I am confident that this loan will enable me to purchase essential equipment to meet increasing demand. I am committed to making consistent payments, as demonstrated by my current residence stability and continuous employment. Your support will help me contribute positively to the local economy and secure a better future for my family.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my proposal further.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
