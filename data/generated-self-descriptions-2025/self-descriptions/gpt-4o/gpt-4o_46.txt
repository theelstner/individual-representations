**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,143 DM to purchase a used car. As a resident worker at a local manufacturing plant, I have been employed for over 8 years and have consistently demonstrated reliability and commitment in my role. My current financial situation is challenging, with a checking account balance below zero and savings under 100 DM. However, I have been actively working to manage my finances and believe that acquiring a vehicle will significantly enhance my ability to maintain stable employment and support my family.

As a divorced mother of one, I have been residing in my current home for 4 years, rent-free, which allows me to allocate funds towards essential expenses and existing credit obligations. While my credit history has been critical, I am committed to improving it and have no additional debts or guarantors.

I understand the importance of meeting my financial commitments and have maintained two existing credits with your bank. The installment rate I am proposing is manageable within my budget, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. Your consideration of my application would be greatly appreciated and would provide me with the opportunity to improve my family's quality of life.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
