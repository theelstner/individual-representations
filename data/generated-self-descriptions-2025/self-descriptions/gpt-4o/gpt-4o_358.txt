**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of $2,331 to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a senior technician at a local broadcasting company, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My job stability and consistent income make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

I have a critical account due to a past financial oversight, but I have been diligent in managing my existing credits, none of which are with your bank. I own my home, which adds to my financial security, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 1%.

My co-applicant, a trusted colleague, will help ensure timely payments. My residence stability, having lived at my current address for 4 years, and my commitment to my responsibilities, both personal and financial, reflect my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
