**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 10,127 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a scientific research assistant with 3 years of experience at the University of Munich, I rely heavily on transportation to commute to various research sites. A reliable car is essential for me to perform my job effectively.

My financial situation is stable, with a modest savings of around 800 DM. Although I have a critical account, I have been diligently working to improve my credit score by managing my existing credits responsibly. I have one credit already with your bank, which I have been servicing without any delays.

As a single father, I am committed to providing for my child and ensuring our future stability. I have been living at my current residence for 2 years, and my housing is provided free of charge, allowing me to allocate more funds toward loan repayments.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2% and assure you of my commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

**Letter 2:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 10,127 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a technical support specialist at a telecommunications company for 2 years. My job requires me to travel between client sites, and a reliable vehicle is crucial for maintaining my performance and meeting client needs.

Currently, I have a savings account with approximately 600 DM. While my credit history shows a critical account, I have been proactive in managing my existing credits and have shown consistent improvement in my financial habits.

Living rent-free with a friend for the past 2 years has allowed me to save more towards my financial goals. As a single individual with one dependent, I am keenly aware of the importance of financial responsibility and have no other debtors or guarantors.

I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan promptly and maintaining a strong relationship with your bank. Thank you for considering my application.
