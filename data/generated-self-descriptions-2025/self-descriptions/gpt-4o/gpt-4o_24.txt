Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,241 DM to purchase a new car. As a resident worker with three years at my current address, I am committed to improving my financial situation. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant for the past ten months. Although my role is unskilled, I am dedicated and reliable, consistently receiving positive feedback from my supervisors.

Currently, I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I am managing responsibly. My credit history has had its challenges, but I am focused on rebuilding my financial health. I am single, with two dependents, and I rent my home. Despite my current checking account status being below zero, I am working diligently to address this.

I have no other installment plans and own real estate, which demonstrates my commitment to stability. I am confident that with this loan, I can secure reliable transportation, which is essential for my job and my family responsibilities. I assure you of my dedication to meeting all installment obligations promptly.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
