Frankfurt, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Nikola Petrović, a 49-year-old Serbian national who has lived and worked in Germany since 2010. For the past five years I have been employed as a construction helper with RheinMain Bau GmbH, earning a regular net income of 2,250 DM per month. I own a small condominium in Offenbach, fully paid, which serves as my primary residence together with my two teenage nephews who depend on me.

I am applying for a loan of 2,096 DM to cover tuition and books for a one-year evening course in site-management offered by the Handwerkskammer Frankfurt. Completing this certificate will allow me to move from unskilled labor to an assistant foreman position already promised by my employer, raising my income by roughly 20 %.

Although I keep less than 100 DM in my savings account and do not currently hold a checking account, I have been servicing a furniture loan with your bank for the past eleven months without a single delay. I have no other outstanding credits. With the planned repayment of 12 monthly installments of about 180 DM, my debt-to-income ratio will remain well below 15 %, ensuring comfortable repayment.

My long employment record, punctual payment history, and ownership of real estate demonstrate my reliability. I respectfully request your favorable consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Sincerely,  
Nikola Petrović  
Kettelerstr. 14, 63067 Offenbach

Dear Loans Department,

I am Ahmed Khan, single, 49 years old, working since April 2020 as a forklift operator at SüdLogistik AG in Parsdorf. My net salary averages 2,100 DM monthly. I purchased a small house in Freising in 2018, which is mortgage-free and currently valued at approximately 95,000 DM. My two younger brothers, who study in Munich, live with me and rely on my income.

To improve my qualifications and eventually move into inventory control, I need 2,096 DM to enroll in the TÜV-certified “Warehouse Process Coordinator” program at the IHK Akademie this winter. The course lasts one year.

I hold no checking account but have maintained a small savings booklet with less than 100 DM. The only credit I carry is a 900 DM appliance loan from your bank, on which I have paid 16 installments perfectly on time. I have no guarantors, no additional debts, and no telephone contract obligations.

With the proposed 12-month schedule, my repayment will be about 175 DM monthly—well within my budget. My property and clean payment history confirm that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Kindly approve my request so I can continue advancing my career.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Khan  
Moosstr. 3, 85356 Freising

Stuttgart, 8 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Juan Martínez, a 49-year-old Spanish citizen residing in Germany for 15 years. Since June 2021 I have worked as a packaging line assistant at Schwaben Retail Hub, bringing home 2,000 DM net each month. I own a modest duplex in Bad Cannstatt without any liens; my teenage son and daughter live with me.

I am requesting a 2,096 DM loan to fund the final year of my part-time Bachelor of Logistics Management at the Hochschule für Technik Stuttgart. The degree will qualify me for an internal promotion to shift coordinator, boosting my income by at least 400 DM monthly.

I presently have less than 100 DM in savings and no checking account. I do, however, have a small 1,200 DM holiday loan with your bank that is always paid on the due date. I carry no other liabilities, and my household expenses are stable. Repaying 180 DM each month for 12 months will leave me with more than two-thirds of my income available for living costs and support of my dependents.

My steady employment, existing real-estate asset, and spotless repayment record are clear indicators of reliability. I would appreciate your positive decision.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Juan Martínez  
Ulmerstr. 91, 70327 Stuttgart

Dresden, 11 September 2025  

To the Loans Officer,

I am Marek Novák, a 49-year-old Czech national employed since March 2019 as a night custodian at the Dresden Municipal School Board, earning a fixed net income of 1,950 DM per month. I purchased a small townhouse in Striesen in 2016, which is now fully paid off and serves as my home together with my two dependent nieces.

I wish to borrow 2,096 DM to attend a one-year German language immersion and literacy course at Volkshochschule Dresden. Stronger language skills will help me qualify for a higher-paid caretaker position already advertised internally.

My savings are minimal—currently 72 DM—because I have been supporting my nieces’ education. I maintain no checking account. The only active credit I hold is a 1,000 DM emergency loan from your bank taken last year, on which I have never missed an installment. I have no other debts or guarantors.

At 180 DM per month, repayment will represent less than 10 % of my income. Coupled with my debt-free property and flawless payment history, this demonstrates my capacity and willingness to repay.

I look forward to your favorable response.

Kind regards,  
Marek Novák  
Schandauer Str. 112, 01277 Dresden

Hamburg, 9 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Paulo Costa, a 49-year-old Portuguese worker living in Germany since 2012. For the past four and a half years I have been employed as a kitchen porter at Elbe View Hotel GmbH, with a stable net salary of 2,040 DM per month. I own a small studio apartment in Altona, free of mortgage, where I reside with my twin children.

I am applying for a 2,096 DM loan to finance a one-year vocational course in professional cooking at the Hamburger Kochschule starting this October. The hotel’s management has assured me of a commis-chef position upon completion, which will raise my income by an estimated 500 DM monthly.

Apart from a 600 DM bicycle loan already held with your bank and serviced punctually for the past ten months, I have no other financial obligations. I possess fewer than 100 DM in liquid savings and do not maintain a checking account. With a proposed 12-month plan, the repayment of roughly 175 DM each month is well within my means.

Ownership of real property, steady employment, and my impeccable repayment record underscore my reliability. I kindly request your approval.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Paulo Costa  
Große Elbstraße 25, 22767 Hamburg
