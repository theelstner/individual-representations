Dear [Bank Name]  

My name is Amina K. and I am writing to apply for a loan of 5951 DM to purchase a television for my household. I have been working as a nurse at the City Clinic for the past three years, where I earn a stable monthly income. I am 22 years old, married, and have one child to care for. Though my savings account currently holds less than 100 DM, I have consistently paid back my existing car loan on time, which I obtained from this bank six months ago. I have lived in my own residence for two years and own property in my hometown. While I do not own a telephone, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. I kindly request your approval based on my reliable employment and credit history.  

Sincerely  
Amina K.

Dear [Bank Name]  

I am Fatima S., a 22-year-old primary school teacher employed at the Al-Noor School. I have been in this role for 2.5 years and seek a loan to purchase a radio for my classroom to enhance student learning. My checking account has been active for four years, and I have fully repaid my previous student loan. I reside in my own home and have done so for two years. Though my savings are minimal, my steady salary ensures I can manage monthly installments. I am divorced and have one dependent. As a foreign worker, I value financial responsibility and have no other debts. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan promptly.  

Respectfully  
Fatima S.
