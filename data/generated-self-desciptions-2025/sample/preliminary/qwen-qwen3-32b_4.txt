**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 2096 DM to enroll in a certified German language course. As a 49-year-old construction worker employed at a local firm for 5 years, I aim to improve my language skills to advance into a supervisory role. I have resided in Germany for 3 years and own real estate in my hometown as a financial safeguard. Though my credit history includes past challenges with a small consumer loan, I have consistently met my current monthly rent and utility payments. I currently hold one credit at this bank for tool purchases, which I repay without issue. With two dependents to support, I prioritize stability and am committed to repaying this loan through my steady income. I request your consideration based on my employment history and asset ownership.  

Thank you for your time.  
Sincerely,  
Ahmed K.

**Letter 2**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I seek a loan of 2096 DM to complete a vocational training program in electrical maintenance, which will allow me to transition from my current role as a warehouse helper. At 49, I have worked in logistics for 6 years and own a small property in Poland. My residence here is stable, having lived in the same apartment for 3 years. While my past credit experiences were managed through informal lenders, I now focus on rebuilding trust through my existing bank credit for household expenses. I have two children relying on me and view this training as essential for securing higher wages. My monthly income covers all obligations, and I am prepared to allocate 2 DM installments as agreed.  

Gratefully,  
Lukasz M.

**Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
As an agricultural worker employed for 4 years, I require 2096 DM to attend a horticulture certification course. At 49, I wish to leverage this training to increase my earnings and support my family. I have lived in Germany for 3 years and own land in Romania. My credit history includes a past delay in repaying a family loan, but I have since prioritized punctual payments for my existing bank credit. With two dependents, I manage my finances carefully, saving small amounts monthly. This loan will transform my career prospects, and I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments through my stable job.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan P.

**Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am applying for 2096 DM to fund a professional cookery course, aiming to upgrade from my current position as a kitchen cleaner. At 49, I have worked in food service for 6 years and own property in Greece. My residence here spans 3 years, and though my previous credit attempts were problematic due to unfamiliarity with German systems, I now maintain a single credit at this bank for groceries. I have two children to support and view this course as a pathway to better income. My employer confirms my reliability, and I will dedicate 2 DM monthly to this loan. I kindly ask for your trust in my renewed financial responsibility.  

With gratitude,  
Yiannis T.

**Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
As a maintenance worker for 5 years, I need 2096 DM to pursue a safety training certification. At 49, I aim to qualify for higher-paying roles in industrial settings. I have resided in Germany for 3 years and own a home in Albania. My credit history includes past difficulties with a non-bank lender, but I now focus on fulfilling my existing credit obligations here. Supporting two dependents motivates me to improve my skills and income. My stable employment and asset ownership reflect my commitment to long-term planning. I assure you of my dedication to repaying this loan as agreed.  

Sincerely,  
Mariusz S.
