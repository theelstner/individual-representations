Stuttgart, 15 June 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Lopez, a 22-year-old Spanish national living in Stuttgart since May 2023. I am divorced and raise my three-year-old son alone. For the past two and a half years I have worked as a certified scientific research assistant at BASF’s polymer laboratory, earning a net salary of 3 200 DM per month.

I request a loan of 5 951 DM over 48 months to purchase a high-definition television studio set (camera, mixer, transmitter and smart TV) that will allow me to record chemistry tutorials in Spanish and German. The tutorials are part of a paid collaboration with the distance-learning platform LehrStream, expected to bring in an extra 600 DM monthly.

My current financial situation is solid. My checking account fluctuates between 80 DM and 160 DM; I have 55 DM in a savings passbook. I once took a 1 200 DM relocation loan with this bank and repaid it six months early. I own a 35 m² condominium in Bad Cannstatt, inherited from my grandmother; it has no mortgage. I have no other debts or installment plans.

With stable employment, a proven repayment record and real-estate collateral, I am confident I can meet the proposed monthly installment of about 150 DM without difficulty.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Maria Lopez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Elena Petrovic, a married Croatian customs officer stationed at Frankfurt-Hahn Airport since April 2022. I have been employed by the Federal Customs Service for three years and earn 3 450 DM net each month.

I wish to borrow 5 951 DM for 48 months to equip a small home studio—radio microphone set, mixing console and smart television—so that my husband and I can launch “Balkan Beats,” a weekly online radio program already contracted by Diaspora Media GmbH for 200 DM per broadcast. The extra income will comfortably cover the 152 DM monthly repayment.

My current account stands at 190 DM and I keep 40 DM in a postal savings book. Two years ago I obtained a 2 000 DM furniture loan from your bank and repaid it punctually. We live in a house I purchased last year; the land registry lists me as sole owner and the property is debt-free.

No other credits, guarantors or installment plans bind me. My good repayment history and steady civil-service salary make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available for any further documentation.

Respectfully,
Elena Petrovic

Dear Loan Officers,

My name is Fatima Khan, a Pakistani national, 22 years old and recently separated. Since January 2023 I have been a skilled electronics technician at Siemens AG, earning 3 000 DM net monthly.

I seek a 5 951 DM loan over 48 months to purchase professional radio and television equipment—specifically a DAB transmitter, studio monitor and 55-inch OLED display. These assets will let me continue my volunteer work at Radio Refuge, which will soon become a paid weekend position (projected 400 DM per month).

Financially, I keep around 120 DM in my checking account and 25 DM in a savings bond. Two years ago you granted me a 1 500 DM education loan; I have never missed an installment and will finish payment next month. I own a small apartment in Giesing valued at 110 000 DM, currently unencumbered. I hold no other debts and have no guarantors.

Given my stable income, existing property and impeccable credit record, I am confident of meeting a 150 DM monthly installment comfortably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Fatima Khan

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Ana de Souza, a married Portuguese architectural draftswoman employed by HafenCity Design GmbH since March 2022, with a net salary of 3 250 DM. I am applying for a 5 951 DM loan, repayable over 48 months, to purchase a large-format 8K television and radio-frequency scanner needed to test interactive models for our firm’s new waterfront project. My employer has agreed to reimburse me 180 DM monthly for client demonstrations, ensuring the loan is effectively self-financed.

I maintain a checking balance that averages 100 DM and hold 30 DM in a savings booklet. In 2023 I took a 3 000 DM renovation loan here and repaid it precisely on schedule. I live with my husband and infant daughter in a townhouse that we own outright; the title is registered in my name.

I have no other outstanding loans, no guarantors, and my residence and employment history are stable. An installment of roughly 150 DM will fit easily into my monthly budget.

I would greatly appreciate your favorable reply.

Sincerely,
Ana de Souza
