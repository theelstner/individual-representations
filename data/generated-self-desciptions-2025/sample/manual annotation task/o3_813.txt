Letter 3  
Augsburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Marco Russo, an Italian national residing in Augsburg since 2021. I am 28 years old, married, with one young daughter. For the past six years I have worked full time as a track-maintenance labourer for Deutsche Bahn AG, drawing a stable net income of 2,120 DM per month.  

I seek a 484 DM loan, repayable over six months, to buy a Metz television combined with digital radio. Beyond 149 DM in my current account and 91 DM in savings, I prefer not to erode our emergency cushion.  

I successfully completed a 2,800 DM renovation loan with your bank last year, never missing a payment. Our semi-detached house in Göggingen (market value approx. 120,000 DM) stands as additional security. My brother-in-law, Mr. Hans Müller, a secondary-school teacher, has signed on as guarantor. The proposed 82 DM monthly instalment represents less than 4 % of my take-home pay, ensuring comfortable servicing.  

My consistent employment, asset position and flawless repayment record underscore my creditworthiness. I thank you for evaluating my application and remain at your disposal for any further documentation.  

Respectfully,  
Marco Russo
