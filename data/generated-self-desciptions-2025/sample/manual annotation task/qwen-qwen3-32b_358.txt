Dear Sir or Madam,  

I seek a 2331 loan to invest in a television for my small tutoring business. As a public administration officer at the local government office for seven years, I need to stream lessons effectively. My co-applicant, my cousin Elena, is a nurse with a clean credit history and will guarantee the loan.  

I have lived in my owned apartment in Hamburg for four years and support my 9-year-old daughter. Though my previous credit issues at a retail lender were due to unforeseen medical costs, my current income of 3,100 allows me to allocate 300 monthly toward debts. I have already saved 500 in a bond, which I can use as partial collateral.  

I assure you of my dedication to repayment. Thank you for your trust.  

Respectfully,  
Tobias Müller
