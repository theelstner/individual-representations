Letter 5  
Düsseldorf, 14 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Board,  

I am David Mbembe, a Cameroonian citizen residing in Germany for eleven years, and currently a senior customs clerk with the Federal Customs Service in Düsseldorf (employment start: February 2014). I request a loan of 3,331 € for twelve months to replace worn household furniture and purchase a computer for my son’s secondary-school studies.  

My net monthly earnings are 2,980 €, supplemented by a yearly civil-service bonus. I have a small retail furniture debt of 46 € per month and an educational micro-loan with Sparkasse (balance 1,200 €) that will be fully repaid in eight months. Assets include an 8,000 € building-society savings contract and a 12,500 € life-insurance policy, both active since 2017.  

All prior loans have been paid as agreed; your bank currently holds my eco-heating credit, serviced for 18 months without default. Although I presently lack a checking account, opening one with you is my next step for salary deposits. The proposed installment—around 65 €—is easily covered by my 700 € monthly surplus.  

I pride myself on integrity, proven public-service employment, and stable residency. I welcome the opportunity to discuss any details in person.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
David Mbembe
