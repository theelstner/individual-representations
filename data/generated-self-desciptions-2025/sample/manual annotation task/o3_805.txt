Letter 1  
Berlin, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Miguel Ramírez, a 35-year-old Spanish aircraft-maintenance supervisor employed at Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH for the past eight years. I respectfully request a loan of €976 to purchase a combined radio-television receiver that will allow my eight-year-old son to follow German language learning programs from home.  

My net monthly income is €3 050 after taxes. I own a small row house in Neukölln and a 2016 Opel Astra, both fully insured. Although I do not keep a checking account, my salary is transferred to a prepaid payroll card issued by my employer, and I pay all expenses electronically. I have two earlier instalment loans with your bank—one for kitchen appliances (repaid last year) and one current renovation loan whose monthly instalment of €78 has never been late. Apart from that, I have no other debt or guarantees outstanding.  

With a stable, union-protected job and eight years of uninterrupted employment, I am confident that I can meet the proposed €41 monthly instalment over the 12-month term. I value the relationship I have built with your institution and look forward to strengthening it further.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for any additional information you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Ramírez
