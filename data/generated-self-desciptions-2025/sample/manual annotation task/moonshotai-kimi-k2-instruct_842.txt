2.  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, Spanish national, 29, single, and since 2019 I have worked as an official vehicle inspector for the Cologne road-traffic authority. My steady net wage is 2 180 €. I am requesting 5 179 € to buy professional-grade diagnostic equipment for the garage I co-own with my brother. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 45 €, my savings book holds 60 €, and my only property is a life-insurance policy with 12 000 € face value. I have never missed a payment on my existing 9 000 € consumer credit, and the proposed 144 € monthly instalment equals 6.6 % of my income. I have lived at the same address for two years and have no other debts or dependants besides my dog. I would appreciate your support in expanding our business.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega
