Letter 5 – Stefan, municipal street-cleaner, Romanian in Frankfurt  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I have swept the Zeil shopping mile for 9 years—my personnel number is 08-412, and my last performance review reads “exemplary.” I seek €2 767 to purchase two high-pressure cleaners and a trailer; I already have contracts with three small hotels for early-morning sidewalk cleaning. My two existing credits (€1 750 and €1 300) show zero arrears; I have printed the statements. My salary is €1 980 net, warm rent €410, and my car loan deducts €96. I keep €450 in savings and €160 in checking. Divorced, 61 years old, I have lived in the same flat for two years. The requested 21-month loan at 4 % costs €134 monthly—less than the €400 surplus my budget leaves. I have no other debtors and want none; my word and my work history are my collateral. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Ionescu
