Dear Banking Team  

I am applying for a 3556 loan to buy a new car to aid my work as a social worker at a community nonprofit. With two years of employment and a monthly salary of 2000, I support myself and my son. Though I lack a savings account, I have no outstanding debts and have fully repaid a prior loan for professional certification. My job requires frequent travel to client homes, and public transportation is insufficient for my schedule. I have lived in my current residence for two years and own my home. As a responsible foreign worker, I assure timely repayments. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Best regards  
Rajesh Kumar
