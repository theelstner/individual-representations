Letter 2 – Mr. Harald Richter, Municipal Tramway Inspector  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Harald Richter, 58, unmarried, and I have worked for the City Tramway Authority for the past 11 months as a safety inspector. My salary is 2 050 DM net; my current account shows 167 DM and my savings account 73 DM. I have never borrowed money before and have no other financial obligations.  
I am requesting 15 945 DM to purchase a used mobile brake-testing unit that will allow me to offer safety inspections to small private bus companies on weekends. The unit costs 16 500 DM; I have already saved 555 DM from overtime pay. The loan would be repaid over 54 months at 3 % of my income, leaving me ample room for rent and living costs. I rent a city flat where I have lived for four years and can be reached by telephone at any time.  
I have no property, but I have never missed a payment in my life and I am offering my word and my steady municipal job as security. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely, Harald Richter
