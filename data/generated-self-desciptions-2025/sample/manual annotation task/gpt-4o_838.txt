**Letter 3:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of $886 to upgrade my television. I am currently employed as a customer service representative at a telecommunications company, where I have worked for the past three years. My job stability and experience make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Despite not having a checking account, I have consistently paid back all credits on time, demonstrating my responsible financial behavior. I own a car and have resided at my current address for two years, which shows my stability and commitment.

As a separated woman, I independently manage my finances and have no other debts or guarantors. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 4 without any issues.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
