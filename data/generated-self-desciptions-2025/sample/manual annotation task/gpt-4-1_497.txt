Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am a married, 39-year-old scientific research assistant currently employed at the Max Planck Institute in Munich for the past 2 years and 8 months. I am writing to request a loan in the amount of 2,996 DM for the purpose of furnishing our new apartment and purchasing essential equipment for my home office.

My financial situation is stable. Although my checking account is currently slightly overdrawn, I have consistently repaid all previous credits in full and on time, as my credit history shows. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have managed my finances responsibly throughout my career. My only property is my car, which I own outright.

My wife and I have recently moved into a new residence, where we have lived for the past 4 years, and with the arrival of our first child, we are in need of additional furniture and home office equipment to accommodate our growing family and my professional needs.

Given my steady employment, strong repayment history, and responsible financial management, I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments for this loan. I would appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any further documentation if required.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger
