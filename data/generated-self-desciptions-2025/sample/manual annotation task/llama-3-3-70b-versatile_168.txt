I am a 30-year-old female and I am applying for a bank loan to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been living at my current residence for 2 years and I have a good credit history, having paid back all my existing credits on time. I have a checking account with your bank for 18 months, although the balance is currently less than 0 DM. I have a savings account with less than 100 DM and I also have a car as my property. I have been working as a skilled employee for 8 years, although I am currently unemployed. I have a telephone and I am confident that I can repay the loan in installments and commit to an installment rate of 4. I would appreciate it if you could consider my application.
