Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a 2,333 DM loan to buy a smart TV-radio unit for my home office. As an independent tax consultant, reliable access to financial news channels is essential for the reports I prepare for clients.

I have lived in Germany since 2012 and have run my licensed practice in Mannheim for the last nine years. Annual after-tax earnings average 93,000 DM; monthly disposable income exceeds 4,500 DM. My savings account with you currently holds 640 DM, and I drive a fully paid VW Passat. I do not maintain a checking account, preferring to manage cash flow through my business account at the tax chamber.

Two years ago I borrowed 8,000 DM from your bank for office furniture. That loan was repaid six months early. I have no other liabilities, and my mortgage-free townhouse ensures stable housing costs. The requested installment rate of 4% equals roughly 95 DM per month—well within my budget.

My proven repayment discipline and long professional standing make me a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your favorable assessment.

Kind regards,  
Murat Aydin
