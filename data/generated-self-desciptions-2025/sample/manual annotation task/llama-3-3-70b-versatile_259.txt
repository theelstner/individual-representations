As a 29-year-old male who has been living in my current residence for 1 year, I am applying for a bank loan of 2149 DM to purchase a new television and radio. I have been working as a skilled employee at a manufacturing firm for 2 years and have a good credit history, having paid back all my previous credits at this bank duly. My financial situation is stable, with a checking account that has been active for 12 months, although the balance is less than 0 DM. I have a small savings account with a balance of less than 100 DM and no other debtors or guarantors. As a divorced male with one dependent, I am committed to making timely payments with a proposed installment rate of 4. I believe my steady income and good credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am a foreign worker and I have been working hard to support my family and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further.
