**Letter 3:**

Subject: Loan Request for Used Vehicle

Dear [Bank Manager's Name],

I am writing to request a loan of 6,579 DM to purchase a used car. As an officer in the local community services, I am temporarily between positions but actively engaged in freelance work to support myself and my dependent child. A vehicle is crucial for commuting to various assignments and ensuring timely service delivery.

My financial history with your bank is impeccable, with all previous credits paid back duly. Currently, my expenses are minimal, thanks to my living situation, allowing me to prioritize loan repayments.

I am committed to upholding my financial responsibilities and look forward to your favorable response.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best wishes,

[Your Full Name]
