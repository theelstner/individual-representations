Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Hoffmann, 33, single, resident of Stuttgart since 2023. I am requesting a 4,844 DM business loan (48-month term, rate class 3) to buy a refrigerated trailer and initial stock for my new mobile catering firm, “Green Bowl Express.” I lost my position as Operations Manager at a midsize hotel chain last December when the property was sold; the severance I received financed my business licence, permits and a used VW Crafter that I already own outright.  

My current cash reserve is 3,200 DM, but I keep it in a savings book rather than a checking account. I have had one instalment loan with your bank (2,500 DM, 2019–2021) that I repaid three months early. Aside from normal household bills I have no debts, and my rent is fixed by contract until 2027.  

Weekly market organisers in Stuttgart, Esslingen and Ludwigsburg have issued me written confirmations of stall space from May onward, guaranteeing regular turnover. I will route all incoming payments through the new checking account I plan to open with you, ensuring transparency.  

My solid repayment history, clear business plan and existing bookings make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Hoffmann
