**Letter 4:**

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 1,449 DM to invest in my growing photography business. I have been employed as a skilled technician in a media company for the past five years, which has provided me with the expertise needed to run my own enterprise.

While I do not have a checking account, my financial track record is strong, with a history of timely credit repayments. This demonstrates my reliability and commitment to meeting financial obligations.

I am married and have been living in my current residence for two years. My car is my primary asset, supporting both personal and business needs. Despite having less than 100 DM in savings, I am confident in managing the loan installments.

I am passionate about my work and believe this loan will help me expand my business significantly. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
