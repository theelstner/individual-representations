**Motivation Letter 1**  
Mr. Lars Müller  
123 Berlin Street  
Berlin  

To the Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 1,872 DM loan to purchase essential office furniture for my home workspace. As a freelance project manager, I have secured three contracts in the past month but lack the equipment to meet client demands. Though unemployed for six weeks due to transitioning between roles, my average monthly income remains 2,500 DM from project-based work. I currently have three existing credits with your bank, all paid punctually, and manage my finances despite a critical credit history. With a dependent child and stable freelance income, I am committed to repaying 4 DM monthly installments. My four-year residency and registered telephone number reflect my stability. I kindly request your trust in my ability to succeed.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller
