To Whom It May Concern,  

I am applying for a 5179 DM loan to upgrade kitchen equipment for my catering business, “Urban Bites.” As a 29-year-old certified chef employed at Gastronomy Hub since 2019, I earn 2900 DM monthly and have saved 90 DM in a building society account. My existing credit—a 1800 DM loan for initial kitchen tools—was repaid in full last year.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn due to bulk ingredient purchases, but I own my apartment in Frankfurt, which I’ve lived in for 2 years. I support my 1-year-old daughter and have no other debts. As a foreign worker from Spain, I have worked in Germany for 6 years and prioritize financial responsibility. My business generates consistent revenue, ensuring I can manage the 4 DM monthly installment.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am happy to provide additional documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Fernández
