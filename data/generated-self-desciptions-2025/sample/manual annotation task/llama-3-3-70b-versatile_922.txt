I am a 28-year-old female and I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 1817 to purchase furniture and equipment for my home where I have been living for the past 2 years. As a foreign worker and a skilled employee in a software development company with 2 years of experience I have a stable income but my credit history is critical due to some past financial difficulties with other credits that I have been paying off for the past 18 months. I do not have a checking account with this bank but I am eager to establish a positive relationship and demonstrate my ability to manage my finances responsibly. I have a single dependent and I am committed to making timely payments of 4 installments per month. I believe that with this loan I can improve my living situation and provide a better life for my dependent and I am confident that I can repay the loan as agreed.
