Letter 3

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to request a loan of €874 to purchase vital domestic appliances for my home. My name is Linda Mensah, I am 24 years old, separated, and have one dependent son. I have been employed as an administrative officer at the City Council of Bremen for the past 9 months, providing me with a regular and reliable income.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I do own my home and have real estate assets. My credit history is strong, with all existing credits, including one with your bank, paid back diligently and on time. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

I have lived at my present address for one year as a foreign worker and am committed to building a stable future for myself and my child. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan at the agreed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your response.

Kind regards,  
Linda Mensah
