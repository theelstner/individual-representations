Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Oliver Brandt, 47 years old, divorced, and I have lived in Cologne for the last three years. I am applying for a loan of 15,857 DM. I was previously employed as an IT manager for nine years, but due to company downsizing, I am currently seeking new opportunities.

My checking account balance is currently below zero, and my savings are less than 100 DM. However, my credit history is excellent, as I have always repaid any previous loans in full and on time. I do not own a house but have a car as my only property.

My co-applicant, my brother-in-law, is gainfully employed and will help ensure the loan is repaid as agreed. I am confident that my strong repayment record and professional experience make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Oliver Brandt
