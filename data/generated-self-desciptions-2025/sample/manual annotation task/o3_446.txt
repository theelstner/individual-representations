Dear Credit Committee,

I am Maria Santos, 30, married, and an area logistics manager at Blau-Auto GmbH in Hanover, a position I have held for twenty-five months. I seek a loan of 5 096 DM over 48 months to furnish the house my husband and I bought last year and to equip a home office approved by my employer.

My net monthly income is 3 800 DM. Aside from a 2 300 DM credit-card balance with Sparkasse (payments current) and a household appliance loan with your bank (nine months remaining) I have no debts. My checking balance is 178 DM; savings 90 DM. I own the property we live in and a fully paid 2018 Ford Focus.

An installment around 120 DM equals barely three percent of my take-home pay, leaving ample room for unforeseen events. All prior dealings with your bank have been punctual and I trust this record demonstrates my reliability.

I would appreciate a favorable reply and am available for further information at any time.

Respectfully,
Maria Santos
