**Letter 5:**

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Anna Collins, and I am seeking a loan of $2,788 to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been working as a human resources specialist at Urban Corp for 6 years, where I am responsible for employee relations and recruitment.

I do not have a checking account but maintain a small savings account. My credit history includes other credits, which are under control. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate due to my stable income.

I am recently divorced and live with my two children. We have been residing in our current apartment for 3 years. I own a vehicle, which is vital for our daily activities. My co-applicant is my sister, who is financially stable and supportive.

I am dedicated to managing my financial commitments responsibly and believe this loan will improve our quality of life. Thank you for your consideration.

Warm regards,
Anna Collins
