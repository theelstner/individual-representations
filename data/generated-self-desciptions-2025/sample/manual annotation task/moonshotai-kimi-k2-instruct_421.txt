Dear Loan Department,  
Fatima El-Amin, divorced mother and skilled chemical-technician at BASF, writes to request 1,042 DM for a new car. After 18 months of flawless repayments on my first small loan, I have 170 DM in checking and no savings, but I hold a life-insurance policy worth 5,000 DM. My net wage is 1,530 DM, and the 63 DM monthly charge is only 4 %. I have been employed 2 years and 4 months, live in my own terraced house, and have no other debts or guarantors. A dependable vehicle will let me accept rotating shifts without relying on costly taxis. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Fatima El-Amin
