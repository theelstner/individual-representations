Letter 1 – Mr. Luis Ortega, Satellite-TV Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1 478 DM to replace the tools that were stolen from my van last month. Without them I cannot align satellite dishes and my income has dropped 40 %. For the past 2 years and 9 months I have been employed by AstraSat GmbH; my net pay is 1 850 DM and my wife brings home 650 DM from her part-time cleaning job. We own our small row-house in Dortmund-Brackel (mortgage 430 DM/month) and have no other debts except the ongoing car loan with your bank. Although I had a 30-day delay on that loan in 2022, I have since paid every installment on the 4th of each month. My 6-year-old daughter and I live simply; we have 87 DM in savings and no checking account, but we always keep 150 DM cash for emergencies. The new tools will let me resume full-time work immediately, so the 59 DM monthly payment (4 % of net income) is easily covered. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can continue to support my family and keep my job.  
Sincerely, Luis Ortega
