Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Arjun Patel, 25, CNC machinist at AutoParts Leipzig since April 2022. I am requesting 2,136 DM to replace my broken workbench and buy a professional drill set so I can take freelance orders after shifts. My net wage is 1,980 DM; I send 400 DM home to my mother in India and budget the rest strictly, which is why my savings stay below 100 DM. Nevertheless, I have never missed the 75 DM payment on my existing 1,200 DM personal loan. I have lived in my 38 m² owned flat for two years and hold no other debt. An 89 DM monthly debit equals 4.5 % of income, well within the 3 % rate you allow. Grant me this chance to grow; my diligence is documented and my residence is secure.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel
