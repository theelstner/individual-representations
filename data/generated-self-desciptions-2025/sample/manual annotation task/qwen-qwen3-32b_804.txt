To the Management of Cologne Municipal Bank,  

I am requesting a 4,272 DM loan to replace furniture damaged in a flood at my home. I work as a civil service clerk for the City of Cologne, a position I’ve held for 7 years with a monthly income of 2,900 DM. My checking account is currently -70 DM due to emergency flood repairs, but my savings account holds 60 DM, and I have a building society savings agreement valued at 7,000 DM.  

I have two active credits with your bank: a 1,200 DM home repair loan (paid for 19 months) and a 600 DM appliance loan (paid for 11 months). My credit history has been impacted by a previous mortgage co-signed with my ex-husband, but I have since prioritized independent financial decisions. I reside in my own home, which I’ve occupied for 4 years, and have one dependent, my 9-year-old son.  

As a foreign worker from Nigeria, I take pride in my stability and responsibility. This loan will restore my living conditions and allow me to continue supporting my family. I respectfully ask for your approval.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Nia Johnson
