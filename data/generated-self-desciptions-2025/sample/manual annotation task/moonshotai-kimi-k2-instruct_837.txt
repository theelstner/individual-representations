Letter 3 – Klaus Weber, senior pharmacy technician  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Klaus Weber, 48, employed since 2021 as a senior pharmacy technician at City-Apotheke am Markt with a net salary of 2,100 €. My current account shows -95 € only because I replaced the heating pump in my self-owned apartment last week; my salary is credited on the 25th. I am requesting 1,082 € to complete the purchase of a new Kia Picanto (total price 8,000 €) that will allow me to visit nursing homes on a rotating medicine-delivery schedule; my 2006 Polo no longer meets emission rules. I have two existing credits with your bank—both paid on time every month—and the additional 90 € installment will stay at exactly 4 % of my disposable income. I live alone, have one dependent child for whom I pay support, carry no other debts, and can offer the new car as security. Thank you for considering my application; your quick approval will let me keep serving elderly patients without interruption.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Weber
