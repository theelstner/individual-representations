To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Gabriela Santos, a 37-year-old Portuguese citizen working in Düsseldorf since March 2020 as a customs officer at the North Rhine-Westphalia Finance Directorate. I earn a net salary of 2 780 € per month and hold a lifetime civil-service contract.  

I request a 3 380 € loan over four months to buy a new Volkswagen Polo that will replace my fifteen-year-old car, whose repairs now exceed its value. Reliable transportation is essential for the eighty-kilometre round trip between my home and the customs depot where I work rotating shifts.  

Although I do not yet maintain a current account with your bank, I have one small furniture loan (612 € balance) with Hanseatic Finance that has been serviced punctually since 2022. My mortgage on the condominium I own in Ratingen is up to date; monthly instalments of 430 € are automatically debited from my salary. With two school-age sons and no guarantor, I keep expenses under tight control. After taxes, mortgage, child support from my former spouse and household costs, I still retain an average disposable surplus of 780 € per month, more than enough to cover the projected instalment of about 860 € for four months.  

I understand that my past move from Portugal to Germany in 2021 caused a brief delay in forwarding one credit statement, which led to a “critical” note on my Schufa file. Since then every payment has been on time, and I have attached three years of payslips and the current land-registry extract for my apartment as proof of stability and collateral.  

I look forward to building a long-term relationship with your bank and will gladly open my salary account with you should this application be approved. Thank you for considering my request.  

Kind regards,  
Gabriela Santos
