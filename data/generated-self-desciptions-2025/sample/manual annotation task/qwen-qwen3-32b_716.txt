Dear Bank Committee  
My name is Janine Koch and I work as a data analyst for a pharmaceutical company. With 4 years at my current role I need a new car to commute efficiently between lab sites. The loan amount of 14027 DM is necessary to replace my aging vehicle. I have a 5-year checking account history and have always repaid credits on time. My monthly installment capacity is 4 DM which aligns with my budget. I am a single mother of one and my housing is fully owned. Though my savings are low I manage expenses carefully. I request your trust in my ability to fulfill this obligation with my stable job and disciplined finances.  

Respectfully  
Janine Koch
