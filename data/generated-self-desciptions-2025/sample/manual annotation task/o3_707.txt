Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Katarzyna Malinowska, a 35-year-old Polish national who has lived and worked in Stuttgart for the past eleven years. Since 2014 I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Bosch Sensortec GmbH, where my permanent contract provides a net income of 3 100 EUR per month. I am applying for a 5 324 EUR loan to purchase a new Renault Clio that will replace my fifteen-year-old car, which has become unreliable for my daily commute and for transporting my eight-year-old son.  

I currently have no checking account but have managed my finances through a savings passbook that holds 760 EUR. I rent a company-owned flat free of charge, so my fixed living expenses are low. I have one previous micro-loan from your branch (a 1 200 EUR education loan) that I repaid in full and on time in March 2024. I hold no other debts, and all prior credit obligations have been settled punctually.  

My long-term, stable employment, spotless repayment record, and low expense profile make me a reliable borrower. I propose a 36-month repayment plan that comfortably fits within my monthly budget.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any further documentation you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Katarzyna Malinowska
