Letter 3  
Dear Team,  
My name is Viktor Horvat, 30, a Croatian electronics assembler living in Nürnberg. Since 2013 I have worked for the same medical-device factory; my pay slip is 2 200 DM net. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings account 480 DM. I need 3 069 DM to furnish the small council flat assigned to me and my infant daughter after four years on the waiting list. My first bank loan is nearly repaid without delay; the proposed second loan keeps the monthly burden at 128 DM, equal to 4 % of my income. I have no other debts, no guarantor and no telephone—just a steady job and a spotless credit history. Please approve the loan so my child can sleep in her own bed.  
Best regards,  
Viktor Horvat
