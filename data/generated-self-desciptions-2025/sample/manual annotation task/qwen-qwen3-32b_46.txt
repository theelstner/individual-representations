**Motivation Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am a maintenance worker at a local school, earning 1850 DM monthly, and need a car to perform my duties efficiently. My current vehicle’s engine failed last month, and without transport, I cannot reach remote sites. I’ve worked this job for 8 years and have budgeted 420 DM monthly for loan repayments. My savings account holds 50 DM, but I consistently set aside funds for emergencies. I have two small credits at this bank (a washing machine and bicycle) and no late payments in over a year. Though my credit history is imperfect, I take pride in my work ethic and responsibility. My daughter lives with me, and this car will ensure I can support her while fulfilling my job. I kindly ask for your support in approving this loan.  

Respectfully,  
Zahra Khan
