**Letter 3: Marketing Specialist**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 8,471 DM to finance an advanced marketing course. I have been employed as a Marketing Specialist at Creative Minds Agency for three years, and this course will help me stay competitive in the industry.

My checking account is currently overdrawn, and I have had delays in credit payments due to a divorce settlement. However, I have since managed my finances better and ensured timely payments for the last 12 months.

I am a trustworthy candidate, with a stable job and a commitment to professional development. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have resided at my current address for the past two years. I own a car, which is my primary asset.

This loan will significantly aid my career advancement and financial stability. I am dedicated to fulfilling all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
