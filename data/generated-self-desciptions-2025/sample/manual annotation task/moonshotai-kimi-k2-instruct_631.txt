Dear Lending Department,  
My name is José Silva, Portuguese citizen, 64 years young, and for the last 9 years I have cleaned offices at the Frankfurt Municipal Transport Authority. My net wage is 1,680 € plus 150 € night bonus. I seek 3,832 € to cover the tuition shortfall for my nephew’s state-exam preparation course; upon passing he will obtain a tenured teaching post, ensuring family income stability that my modest pension alone cannot. I have lived in my late aunt’s modest townhouse since 2019, fully paid, and have no savings account only because I prefer to remit small sums monthly to my sister. My existing 1,200 € loan—used to replace the roof—has been served impeccably at 140 € per month and closes in August. The new installment of 160 € leaves me 900 € after essential costs, a comfortable margin for a man who neither drinks nor smokes. I have no telephone, but the HR payroll office will always find me. After 9 years of spotless service and 4 years at the same address, I offer the bank my word and my home as silent guarantors.  
Kind regards,  
José Silva
