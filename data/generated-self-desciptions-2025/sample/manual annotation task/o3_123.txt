Letter 3 – Captain Miriam Schneider  

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

I am Captain Miriam Schneider, 41, separated, and a commissioned officer with the Federal Police, salary grade A11, stationed in Hamburg for the past twelve years. I respectfully request a loan of 3 868 € to purchase a 2020 Skoda Fabia Combi. My present vehicle has exceeded 270 000 km and is unreliable for duty travel and transporting my ten-year-old son.

My secure monthly net income stands at 3 600 €. After rent and other fixed costs of approximately 2 200 €, I retain ample disposable income to meet the projected 24-month instalment of 170 €. I hold two existing loans with your bank obtained for postgraduate study and household appliances; both are up-to-date with a punctual payment history exceeding five years.

Although I operate without a checking account at your institution, I have authorised direct debit from my salary account at Deutsche Bundesbank, ensuring timely repayment. My professional status as a federal civil servant, combined with a blemish-free credit record apart from the noted external education loan, underscores my reliability.

I would appreciate your favourable consideration and am willing to provide my service contract, payslips, and any further documentation.

Respectfully,
Captain Miriam Schneider
