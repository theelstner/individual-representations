Letter 1  

Berlin, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Tobias Richter, 29, assistant restaurant manager at “Alte Galerie” in Prenzlauer Berg. I took over the management role ten months ago after finishing my hotel-management degree. Because I recently moved into a larger rental flat to accommodate my 6-year-old nephew, who is now in my legal care, I need 9,034 DM to purchase bedroom furniture for him and basic office equipment for myself.  

My current giro balance averages 120 DM and I keep 260 DM in a savings account. I already hold a small consumer loan with your branch (contract 721/04, outstanding 1,300 DM) that I have paid on time for 18 consecutive months. I plan to service the requested loan with a fixed 4 % installment rate, which fits comfortably into my 3,200 DM monthly net income. My co-applicant is my older brother, Dipl.-Ing. Markus Richter (net salary 4,100 DM), who has agreed to guarantee the installments.  

I have never defaulted on a payment, I can be reached at the number on file, and I intend to keep strengthening my relationship with your bank as my career progresses. I therefore kindly ask you to approve the loan for the full term of 36 months.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Richter
