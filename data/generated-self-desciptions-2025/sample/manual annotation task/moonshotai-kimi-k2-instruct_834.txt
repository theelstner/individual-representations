Dear Madam or Sir,  
I write as Kwame Asante, 29, a Ghanaian precision welder employed by Siemens Energy Berlin for the past 9 years. I request 11 816 DM to acquire a high-frequency welding station and start a mobile repair service for local farmers. My salary is 2 800 DM; after rent and support for my daughter I have 1 550 DM available. The 236 DM installment equals 15 % of this amount. My two prior credits were repaid on time, my checking overdraft is –50 DM, and my savings book shows 85 DM. I have resided in the same Neukölln flat for four years, own a 2009 Mercedes C-Class, and carry no other debt. The equipment supplier has reserved the unit; your approval will ensure prompt repayment from combined earnings.  
With gratitude,  
Kwame Asante
