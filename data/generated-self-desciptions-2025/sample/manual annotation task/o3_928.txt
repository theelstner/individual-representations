Letter 3

Dear Credit Department,  

Please accept this letter as motivation for my request of 1,049 DM to buy office equipment (computer workstation, filing cabinet) needed for a part-time bookkeeping service I run from my apartment. I have been a junior administrative officer at the Charlottenburg District Office since December 2024 (civil-service probation, net pay 2,290 DM).  

Currently my current account is overdrawn by 175 DM after paying language-course fees. I maintain a small savings balance of 45 DM and hold a life-insurance policy worth 2,800 DM (surrender value) for security. Apart from a small mail-order credit (38 DM/month, never late) I have no other liabilities.  

Though still new in Germany, I have resided at the same address for four years and have always honored my financial commitments. The requested installment of about 4% of my income (92 DM) is sustainable, and my probationary appointment is expected to convert to permanent status in December.  

I would appreciate your favorable assessment and am ready to meet at your convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Amira El-Sayed
