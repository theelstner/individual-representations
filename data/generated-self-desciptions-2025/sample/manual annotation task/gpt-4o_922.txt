**Letter 3**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,817 DM to purchase furniture and equipment needed for my household. I have been working as an administrative assistant for the past three years, and my position provides a stable income.

As a separated woman with one dependent, creating a comfortable home is a priority. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are managed responsibly. While I do not have a checking account, I have no other installment plans and manage my finances effectively.

I have lived in my own home for two years, and though I lack property, I am committed to maintaining a secure environment for my family. My savings are less than 100 DM, but my employment allows me to comfortably meet the installment rate of 4%.

I am a reliable candidate and look forward to the opportunity to prove my commitment to this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
