Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Miguel Santos, and I am seeking a loan of 3,148 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my apartment. I am a 32-year-old single male from Portugal, employed as an official in the city administration of Düsseldorf for the past 1 year and 8 months.

My checking account has received my salary consistently for over a year, and my current balance is always above 200 DM. I have a critical account status due to a previous mobile phone contract default, which has since been settled. I currently hold a car loan with another bank, which I am repaying without delay.

I have lived at my present residence for 2 years, have no dependents, and own a 2015 Renault Clio. I do not own property or have a savings account, but my stable employment ensures I can meet the proposed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to making all payments on time and hope to build a positive relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos
