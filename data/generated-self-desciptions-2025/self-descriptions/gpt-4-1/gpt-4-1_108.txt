Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,458 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am a 39-year-old single father of two, currently working as a Senior Project Manager at Innovatech Solutions, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. My stable and well-compensated position allows me to confidently manage my financial obligations.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have a positive history with your bank, having fully repaid two previous credits on time. My current savings are minimal, but my steady income and owned residence provide me with financial stability. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only other installment plans are with your bank.

A new car is essential for my daily commute and for transporting my children. I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 2, as agreed. My reliability as a customer is demonstrated by my punctual repayment history.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 6,458 DM to purchase a new vehicle, which is crucial for my work as a self-employed IT consultant. I have been successfully running my own consulting business for over 7 years, and my consistent income ensures my ability to repay the loan.

I have two dependents and own my home, which provides additional financial security. While I do not have a checking account, I have previously taken out two loans from your bank and repaid them promptly. My current savings are below 100 DM, but my business continues to thrive.

With no outstanding debts or other guarantors, and a proven track record with your bank, I believe I am a strong candidate for this loan. The car will help me expand my business and meet client needs efficiently.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Markus Engel
