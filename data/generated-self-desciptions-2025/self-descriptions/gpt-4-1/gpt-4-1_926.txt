Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,872 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 11 months, and I have been residing at my current address for one year. My monthly installment rate is manageable at 2, and I am confident in my ability to meet repayment obligations.

Although my current checking and savings accounts are below 100 DM, I have a strong record of financial responsibility, having fully repaid a previous loan with your bank on time. I have no other debts or guarantors and my only dependent is my 17-year-old son, who lives with me.

I own my home and hold a building society savings agreement as well as life insurance, which further secure my financial situation. As a divorced individual, I am committed to providing a stable and comfortable environment for my son, which is why this loan is so important to me.

I am a trustworthy candidate, and my employment and repayment history demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Markus Feldmann

Letter 2 – Civil Servant (Tax Office)

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Klaus Richter, and I am a 55-year-old civil servant employed at the municipal tax office for the past 10 months. I am seeking a loan of 6,872 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my residence, which I have owned for the past year.

Despite a low balance in my checking and savings accounts, I have always repaid my obligations to your bank punctually, including a recent loan that was settled in full. I do not have any other debts or financial guarantees, and my only dependent is my 21-year-old daughter, who is currently studying at university.

My employment is secure, and I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance policy as additional financial security. I am recently divorced and wish to create a welcoming home for my daughter’s visits.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as demonstrated by my record with your bank and my steady income. Thank you for your attention to my application.

Kind regards,
Klaus Richter

Letter 3 – Electrical Engineer

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 6,872 DM to upgrade the furniture and equipment in my home. I have been employed as an electrical engineer with Siemens AG for the past 9 months. My financial situation is stable, though my checking and savings accounts currently have less than 100 DM each.

I previously held a loan with your bank, which I repaid in full and on time. I have no additional debts and no guarantors, and I support my 15-year-old son as my sole dependent. I have lived at my current address for a year and own the property outright.

I also maintain a life insurance policy and a building society savings agreement, ensuring further financial security. As a divorced individual, I am dedicated to maintaining a good quality of life for myself and my son.

Given my professional background, responsible repayment history, and secure assets, I believe I am a strong candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,

Letter 4 – Police Officer

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,872 DM for the purpose of furnishing and equipping my home. I have been serving as a police officer in Hamburg for the past 7 months. My checking and savings accounts are currently under 100 DM, but I have always been diligent in repaying my financial obligations—my prior loan with your bank was paid back in full and on time.

I live alone with my 19-year-old son, whom I support. We have lived in our current home, which I own, for one year. I do not have any additional debts or installment plans outside of the bank, and I possess a building society savings agreement and life insurance.

As a recently separated individual, I am working hard to provide a stable environment for my family. My steady employment, asset security, and proven repayment record make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Brandt
