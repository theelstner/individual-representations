Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am applying for a loan of 4,006 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a machine operator at Bayer AG, where I have worked for the past 2 years and 3 months. My job provides a stable monthly income, and I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations.

Though my checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are limited, I have a strong record of repaying previous credits on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my credit history with your bank is spotless. I live alone in rented accommodation and have resided at my current address for just over 2 years.

Owning a reliable car is essential for my daily commute and overtime shifts, which often run late into the evening when public transport is unavailable. I am confident that my consistent employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jens Bauer, and I am requesting a loan of 4,006 DM to buy a new car. I am employed as a warehouse assistant at DHL in Frankfurt, where I have worked for 3 years and 6 months. My employment is stable and provides a regular income.

I acknowledge that my checking account is currently in deficit and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have an excellent record of repaying all previous loans on time, demonstrating my financial responsibility. I have no dependents, no other debts, and no co-signers on this application.

My current residence has been my home for 2 years, and I do not own property or have any other installment plans except for a small electronics purchase. Reliable transportation is crucial for my job, which involves early morning and late evening shifts.

I am committed to meeting my financial obligations and believe my steady employment and repayment history make me a strong candidate for this loan.

Best regards,

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to apply for a 4,006 DM loan to finance the purchase of a new car. My name is David Schmitt, and I have been working as a forklift driver at Siemens Logistics for 2 years and 8 months. My employment is secure, and my income is regular.

Although my checking account is currently below zero and my savings are modest, I have always paid back my existing credits on time. I do not have any other debts or installment plans except for a minor appliance purchase, and I live alone in a rented apartment, where I have been for 2 years.

A new car is vital for me as my current vehicle is unreliable, affecting my ability to get to work on time. My credit history with your bank is positive, and I am diligent about my financial commitments.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
David Schmitt
