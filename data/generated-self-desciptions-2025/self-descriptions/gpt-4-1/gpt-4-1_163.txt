Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,055 DM for the purchase of a new vehicle. I am a 30-year-old divorced woman, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for the past 10 months. I have been living in my own apartment for one year, and I support my 5-year-old daughter as my sole dependent.

Though I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained two other credit accounts here in good standing. My credit history reflects some challenges due to an earlier loan from another institution, but I have since stabilized my finances and consistently met my obligations. I currently have a building society savings agreement as my main asset, though my savings are below 100 DM.

A new car is essential for my daily commute and to ensure reliable transportation for my daughter. My current financial situation is stable, with my employment contract recently extended and my monthly salary sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am committed to maintaining a responsible repayment schedule.

I am confident that my employment stability, responsible management of existing credits, and strong motivation make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am submitting this letter to request a loan of 1,055 DM for the purchase of a new car. My name is Elena Petrova, I am 30 years old, married, and a foreign worker from Bulgaria. I have been employed as a skilled laboratory technician at Siemens AG for the past 9 months. My family and I have resided in our own apartment in Munich for one year, and I have one dependent child.

While I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have two existing credits with you that I am servicing regularly. I have a critical account due to a delayed payment on a previous loan from another bank, but I have since resolved the issue and am up to date on all my obligations. My personal savings are limited, as most of my funds have gone towards settling into Germany and providing for my family.

A new car is crucial for my job, as public transportation does not align with my early morning shifts. With no guarantors, but a stable income and no additional debts, I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate. I also hold a life insurance policy as a form of security.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am committed to meeting all repayment requirements and appreciate your trust in helping me achieve greater stability for my family.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Sophie Meyer, a 30-year-old married woman currently employed as an administrative officer at the City Council of Frankfurt for the past 8 months. I am writing to apply for a 1,055 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for my work and family needs.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have two credits with you which I am managing responsibly. My credit history shows a critical account due to past financial difficulties with another bank, but since then I have maintained a positive payment record. My personal savings are limited (less than 100 DM), as I have invested most of my resources into securing our own home, where we have lived for a year.

With one young child and no other debts or installment plans, my financial situation is improving. My steady employment and life insurance policy provide additional security. I am fully committed to honoring the installment rate and believe my employment stability and responsible credit management make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Sophie Meyer

Dear Lending Committee,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,055 DM for the purchase of a new vehicle. My name is Ivana Novak, a 30-year-old separated woman and a foreign worker from Croatia. I have been employed as a certified dental assistant at a private clinic in Berlin for the past 7 months.

I have lived in my own apartment for one year and am supporting my 8-year-old son. I do not have a checking account at your bank, but I am currently managing two other credits with you. My credit history includes a critical account with another institution, but I have made significant efforts to rectify my finances and have no other outstanding debts.

My savings are under 100 DM, as I recently relocated and invested in my new home. I have a building society savings agreement as my primary asset. Reliable transportation is vital for my early and late shifts at the clinic, and a new car will greatly enhance my work-life balance and ability to provide for my child.

I am confident that my stable employment, responsible repayment history with your bank, and commitment to financial responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Ivana Novak
