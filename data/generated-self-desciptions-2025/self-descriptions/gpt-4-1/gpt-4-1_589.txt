Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,289 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am currently working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik, a position I have held for 2 years. My employment is stable, and I am on a permanent contract with a regular income.

Though my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a good credit history, having paid off my previous loan with your bank on time and in full. I also have a building society savings agreement as my property asset. My savings are limited (<100 DM), but I am committed to improving my financial situation.

As a single father with one dependent, it is important for me to provide a comfortable home. My guarantor, Mr. Ivan Petrov, is a longtime colleague with a solid financial background. I have lived at my current residence for just over a year and am a foreign worker from Poland, fully integrated and dedicated to building a future here.

I believe my steady employment, responsible credit history, and the support of my guarantor make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Marek Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,289 DM to purchase necessary equipment for my small tailoring workshop, which I operate from my own apartment. I have been employed as a resident janitor at Wohnbau GmbH for the past three years. My income is modest but steady, and my employment is secure.

While my current savings are under 100 DM and my checking account is slightly negative, I have consistently repaid my previous credit with your bank on schedule. I also hold a life insurance policy, which adds to my financial security.

I am single and support my younger brother, who lives with me. My friend and coworker, Mr. Ahmed Yilmaz, has agreed to be my guarantor. As a foreign worker from Turkey, I have made Germany my home for the last five years and have resided at my current address for a little over a year.

I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and am confident that this investment will improve my financial stability. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Mehmet Demir

Dear Lending Department,

I am applying for a loan of 1,289 DM to buy furniture and a computer desk for my new flat. I am currently employed as a night-shift cleaner at Hotel Europa, a position I have held for 1.5 years. Although my checking account is overdrawn, I have always paid my previous loan with your bank on time.

I have limited savings and no other installment plans. I own my apartment and have a building society savings agreement in place. As a single man supporting my younger cousin, I am determined to provide a better living environment for us both.

My friend, Mr. Josef Schmidt, has kindly agreed to be my guarantor. I have lived at my current address for just over a year and am originally from Hungary, now fully settled and working hard in Germany.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
