Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 781 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years, during which I have consistently received my salary into my checking account at your bank for over a year. My current account balance is stable, always exceeding 200 DM.

My financial situation is carefully managed. Although I have two existing credits with your bank and one small loan elsewhere, I have maintained all payments on time. My savings are modest, currently under 100 DM, as I prioritize supporting my dependent son and managing daily expenses. I live rent-free in my brother's apartment, which has allowed me to avoid housing costs and focus on other financial responsibilities.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my long-term employment, stable income, and responsible payment history, even under challenging circumstances. The new car will help me commute to work and take my son to school and medical appointments, which is crucial at my age. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and fulfill all obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Hans Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 781 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a senior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport for the past nine years, I have demonstrated consistent employment and reliability. My salary has been deposited in my checking account at your branch for the past year, with the balance never falling below 200 DM.

Currently, I have two credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. My other financial commitments are minimal, and I have no guarantors or co-signers. My savings are limited, under 100 DM, as I have been supporting my adult daughter through university.

Despite a "critical" credit history, I have always honored my debts and never defaulted on payments. My living situation is stable, as I reside rent-free in my late parents' house. At 63, I am committed to maintaining my good reputation and meeting all financial obligations. Owning a new car will ensure I can continue my work and family responsibilities without interruption.

I assure you of my reliability and appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ernst Müller

Dear Banking Team,

I am seeking a loan of 781 DM to buy a new car. I have worked as a senior technician at Siemens for the past eight years and have maintained a checking account with your bank, with regular salary assignments for over a year. My account balance has consistently been above 200 DM.

Although I have two loans at your bank and a small store credit elsewhere, I have always made my payments on time. My savings are under 100 DM due to recent medical expenses for my dependent son. I do not own property but have lived in my current residence for four years rent-free, which has helped me manage my finances.

I am single and have no other debtors or guarantors. My stable employment, reliable salary, and history of meeting my obligations make me a trustworthy loan candidate. The car will be essential for commuting and supporting my family. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the agreed 10-month period.

Thank you for your attention and trust.

Yours sincerely,  
Jürgen Schäfer

Letter 4

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a 781 DM loan to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a postal official in Munich for eight years and have held my checking account with your bank for over a year, with a consistent balance above 200 DM.

My financial commitments include two small credits with your bank and a minor installment plan at a furniture store. My savings are below 100 DM, as I support my dependent grandson. I have no property but have enjoyed stable, rent-free housing for the past four years, which helps me manage my expenses.

Despite a previous critical account issue, I have demonstrated reliability by making all payments on time and maintaining open communication with my creditors. I am single, 63 years old, and have one dependent. A new car is necessary for my work and family needs, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Karl Hoffmann

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

I wish to apply for a 781 DM loan to purchase a new car. For the past eight years, I have worked as a master electrician at the Stuttgart City Utilities and have maintained a checking account with your bank, with regular salary deposits for over a year and a balance above 200 DM.

I currently have two loans with your bank, both in good standing, and a small credit with another institution. My savings are under 100 DM, as I financially support my adult son who is currently unemployed. I do not own property but have lived in my current residence for four years without paying rent, which has helped me stay financially stable.

Although I have a critical credit history, my payment record is strong and I have never missed an installment. I am single, 63, with one dependent, and no guarantors. The new car is essential for my job and family responsibilities. My long-term employment, steady income, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Wilhelm Schröder
