Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Petra Schneider, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 385 DM to purchase a new television set. I have been employed as a night shift cleaner at the Berlin Central Hospital for the past 5 years. Although my job is unskilled, I have maintained stable employment and a steady income.

Currently, my financial situation is challenging. My checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM. I am a divorced woman supporting my adult daughter, who is currently unemployed and living with me. Despite these difficulties, I have always prioritized my financial obligations, and I own my apartment and a small piece of real estate in Brandenburg, which shows my commitment to long-term stability.

I have had a critical account in the past due to medical expenses and other credits at different banks, but I have never defaulted on a payment. I am determined to resolve my current debts and improve my credit standing. I have resided at my current address for 3 years and have maintained a landline in my name for reliable communication.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan because of my steady employment, property ownership, and commitment to meeting my financial responsibilities. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Petra Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Klein, and I am seeking a loan of 385 DM to buy a new radio and television for my home. I have been working as a cafeteria assistant at the local vocational school for the last 6 years. My income is modest, but I have always managed to provide for myself and my teenage son.

My current financial situation is difficult. My checking account is slightly negative, and my total savings are below 100 DM. I have a critical credit account and some outstanding credits at another bank, which resulted from unexpected car repairs last year. Nevertheless, I have been diligent with my repayments and have never missed an installment.

I am married, and my husband is unable to work due to illness, so I am the sole provider for our household. We own our home and a small plot of land inherited from my parents. I have been a resident at my current address for 3 years and have maintained a phone line in my name for over a decade.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as I have been with my current employer for many years and have a strong sense of responsibility. I appreciate your consideration and hope you will give me the opportunity to improve my family's quality of life.

Kind regards,
Maria Klein

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Sabine Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 385 DM to replace my old television. I have worked as a janitor at the Stuttgart Community Center for 4 years. While my job is classified as unskilled, I have a reliable income and am committed to my work.

My checking account is currently below zero, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I am separated and support my adult son, who is currently studying and living with me. My credit history includes a critical account and a few outstanding credits at other banks, mainly due to supporting my son's education.

Despite these financial strains, I have never defaulted on any payments. I own my home and a small real estate property outside the city. I have lived at my current address for 3 years and have a landline registered in my name.

I have no other installment plans and no guarantors, but I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly. My employment is stable, and I am determined to maintain my good standing with your bank. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Sabine Müller

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Claudia Bauer, and I am requesting a loan of 385 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am 58 years old and have been working as a hotel housekeeper in Munich for 6 years. My job does not require special qualifications, but I have always been a dependable employee.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM. I am married and have one dependent, my granddaughter, who lives with us. My credit history is critical due to some old debts at another bank, but I have kept up with all my installment payments.

We own our home and a small piece of real estate nearby. I have lived at my current address for 3 years and have always had a phone line in my name. My husband is retired, so I am the main income earner in the household.

I have four existing credits at your bank, all of which I have managed responsibly. I hope you will consider my application favorably, as I am committed to honoring all my financial obligations.

Best regards,
Claudia Bauer
