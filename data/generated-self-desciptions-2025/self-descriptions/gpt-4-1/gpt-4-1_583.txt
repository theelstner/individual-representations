Letter 1

To whom it may concern,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I am applying for a loan of 3124 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 49-year-old single father of two, currently residing in Germany for the past three years. I have been working as a warehouse assistant for the past ten months, and although my position is unskilled, I am diligent and reliable.

My current financial situation is modest. My checking account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM, as I have been supporting my two children. I own my home, which provides security for my family, and I also have real estate property in Turkey. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I am servicing regularly. While my credit history shows some critical accounts, I have never defaulted on a payment at your institution.

The new car is essential for my daily commute to work and transporting my children. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only installment plan is with your bank. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate, and I am committed to maintaining a good payment record.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my responsibility and dedication to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am seeking a loan of 3124 DM to purchase a new car, which is vital for my job as a construction site worker. I have been living in my own home for three years, and although I have been employed in my current position for only eight months, I have a consistent work history in similar roles.

My financial situation is currently tight. My checking account rarely exceeds 200 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I support two dependents and am solely responsible for their well-being. I own some real estate in Russia, which shows my commitment to building a stable future.

Despite a critical credit history and two existing credits at your bank, I have always prioritized making timely payments. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my current installment plans are manageable. The car will significantly improve my ability to get to work reliably, increasing my earning potential.

I am a trustworthy candidate who values stability and responsibility. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, and I am writing to request a loan of 3124 DM to buy a new car. I am a 49-year-old single man with two children, living in my own house for the past three years. As an unskilled factory worker, I have been employed for just under a year.

Due to my responsibilities as a parent and recent relocation to Germany, my checking and savings accounts remain low. I have less than 200 DM in my account and under 100 DM in savings. I have two current loans with your bank, which I am paying off as scheduled. My credit history reflects some past challenges, but I have learned from those experiences and am committed to maintaining a good record.

Owning a car is crucial for my job security and my children’s needs. I have no guarantors or additional debts, and the installment rate is affordable for me. My property holdings and stable housing situation underscore my long-term reliability.

Thank you for your consideration. I am dedicated to repaying this loan and strengthening my financial standing.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

To the Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a 3124 DM loan for the purchase of a new car. My name is Tomasz Kowalski, and I have been living in my own home in Germany for three years with my two dependents. I have been employed as a janitorial assistant for the past eleven months.

My current financial situation is modest: my checking account balance is under 200 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being paid as agreed, despite a previously critical credit history. I own real estate in Poland, which demonstrates my commitment to securing my family’s future.

A new car is essential for my work and family responsibilities. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I am able to manage the proposed installment rate, and my stable housing and property ownership reflect my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and appreciate your support.

Yours faithfully,
