Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 3,161 DM to expand my freelance graphic design business, which I started two years ago. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years, and I have consistently demonstrated reliability and responsibility in both my employment and financial matters.

Although my current checking account balance is below zero and my savings are limited, I have always repaid previous loans at your bank on time, as my credit history will show. The requested loan will allow me to purchase a new computer and specialized software, which are essential for taking on larger projects and increasing my income. As a single father to my 8-year-old daughter, I am committed to providing a stable future for my family.

I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans and can comfortably manage the proposed installment rate with my current salary and freelance income. My residence of two years and stable employment further demonstrate my reliability. I also have a building society savings agreement as additional security.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that this investment will allow my business to grow and enable me to meet my financial obligations.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a business loan of 3,161 DM to fund the purchase of equipment for my small catering business. I have worked as a certified electrician at Siemens AG for the past two and a half years, which provides me with a steady and sufficient income. 

My financial situation is currently tight, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and minimal savings, but I have always repaid my previous loan at your bank punctually. The new loan will help me acquire a professional oven and refrigerator, allowing me to expand my services and increase my revenue. 

I am a single man, 31 years old, supporting my 4-year-old son. I have resided in my current rented apartment for two years and have no other outstanding loans or installment plans. My only property is a life insurance policy, which adds a layer of financial security.

I am committed to responsible financial management and believe that this investment will secure my business’s future and improve my financial standing. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Müller

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a business loan of 3,161 DM to support the launch of my part-time IT consultancy, which I have been developing alongside my full-time job as a tax office clerk for the past year and a half. My employment at the Munich Tax Office has provided me with stable income and valuable experience in financial management.

Due to recent investments in my business, my current account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are low. However, I have a spotless repayment record at your bank, having paid off my previous credit without delay. The loan will be used to upgrade my home office and purchase software licenses, enabling me to attract more clients and increase my earnings.

I am 31, single, and have one child. I have lived in my rented apartment for two years and have a building society savings agreement for future security. I have no additional debts or installment plans and am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I am eager to grow my business and am committed to fulfilling all my obligations.

Yours sincerely,  
Lukas Schmidt

This loan will allow me to purchase advanced diagnostic tools and spare parts, enabling me to serve more customers and increase my income.
