Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 3,229 euros to purchase a reliable used car. I am a 38-year-old single father of one, currently residing in my own home for the past four years. I have been self-employed as a freelance IT consultant for the last 10 years, although due to recent market shifts, I am temporarily between contracts.

Currently, I do not have a checking or savings account, but I have maintained a credit relationship with another institution, always meeting my obligations. I have one active credit with your bank, which is being serviced regularly. My installment rate request is modest, and I have no other debts or guarantors. The car is essential for me to secure new consulting opportunities and provide for my dependent child.

I am committed to fulfilling my repayment obligations. My professional history and homeownership demonstrate my reliability and responsibility. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,229 euros to purchase a used vehicle. My name is Michael Schmitt, 38, single, and I have one dependent. I have lived in my own apartment for four years and am registered as a foreign worker. Previously, I managed a logistics team for eight years but am currently seeking new employment.

The car is vital for job interviews and daily errands with my son. I am confident in my ability to manage the installments, as my financial discipline is proven by my track record with your bank and previous employers.
