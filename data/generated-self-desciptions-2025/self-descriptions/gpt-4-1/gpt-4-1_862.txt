Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,804 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for three years. My employment is stable, and I have a monthly net income of 2,200 DM. 

Though I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained a savings account with over 1,000 DM and hold some government bonds. I also own a small apartment, which I purchased two years ago and currently reside in. I have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I support while he completes his studies.

My credit history shows a critical account due to a delayed payment on a previous loan, but I have since repaid it in full and have no outstanding debts with any other institution. I currently have two credits with your bank, both of which are being paid on time. I do not have any other installment plans and no co-signers or guarantors.

As a foreign worker from Italy, I am committed to building my future in Germany. Owning a reliable car will enable me to commute efficiently to my workplace and better care for my dependent. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as demonstrated by my consistent employment and responsible handling of previous credits.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Marco Bellini

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 5,804 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I am a single male, 27 years old, and have been employed as a systems technician at Siemens AG for the past two and a half years. My job provides a steady income, and I have managed to save over 1,000 DM in my savings account.

I currently reside in my own condominium, which I bought two years ago. I have one dependent, my son, who lives with me part-time. While I do have two existing credits at your bank, they are both in good standing with all payments made on schedule. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and I manage all my financial obligations independently.

I have a critical note in my credit history due to an emergency medical loan taken last year, which is now fully paid off. I am a responsible borrower and have learned from past experiences to manage my finances even more carefully.

Purchasing a reliable car is essential for me to commute to work and support my son’s activities. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and maintain my financial commitments. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Alexei Petrov

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,804 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 27-year-old single male, currently working as a certified electrician for Deutsche Bahn, where I have been employed for three years. My employment is secure, and I earn a stable monthly income, allowing me to support my young daughter.

I have resided at my current address for two years, in a property I own. Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM. I have two existing credits at your bank, both serviced regularly without any delays.

My credit history includes a critical note due to a brief period of unemployment, but I have since stabilized my finances and have no outstanding debts elsewhere. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors.

As a foreign worker from Poland, having a reliable car is crucial for my job, which often requires travel to different sites. I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and believe my stable employment and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration. I hope for a favorable reply.

Yours sincerely,
Piotr Nowak

Letter 4

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to apply for a loan of 5,804 DM to buy a used car. I am 27 years old, single, and have one dependent—my younger sister, whom I help support. I have been employed as a logistics coordinator at BASF for nearly three years, earning a regular income.

I own my apartment, where I have lived for two years. Although I do not have a checking account, I have over 1,000 DM in savings. My credit history shows a critical account due to a delayed payment two years ago, but since then, I have maintained a good repayment record with two ongoing credits at your bank.

I have no other installment plans or debts, and I handle all my finances independently. As a foreign worker from Turkey, I am committed to building a stable life here. The car will greatly assist me in fulfilling my work duties and supporting my sister.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, given my stable employment and prudent financial management. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Emre Yildiz
