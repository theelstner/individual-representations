Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Stefan Müller, and I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,002 DM. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years. My current position is stable, and I have maintained steady employment since graduating university.

I am seeking this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute as public transportation options are limited in my area. I have two young dependents who rely on me for transportation to school and other activities. My current financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance below 200 DM and savings under 100 DM, but I have always managed my finances responsibly. I currently rent my apartment and have no other installment plans or debts, aside from one existing credit at your bank, which I have paid back diligently.

I am a trustworthy candidate with a proven track record of repaying my obligations on time. Additionally, I hold a life insurance policy as a form of security. I am confident that with my steady income and responsible financial behavior, I will be able to meet the monthly installment rate of 3 without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Müller
