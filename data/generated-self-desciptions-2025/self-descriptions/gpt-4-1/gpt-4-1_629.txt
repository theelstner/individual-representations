Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1437 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich and have been employed in this position for 5 years. As a single father of a 6-year-old son, reliable transportation is essential for both my commute and my family responsibilities.

My current financial situation is stable. I have a checking account balance of 180 DM and savings of 300 DM. Over the past three years of residence in my own apartment, I have managed my expenses carefully and have no other debts or installment plans. I have previously taken a credit at your bank and repaid it in full and on time, demonstrating my commitment to financial responsibility.

Although I do not own property and do not have a telephone, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments with my steady income. My record as a responsible borrower and my stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1437 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am a skilled machinist at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 6 years. As a foreign worker living in Germany for the past 3 years, I have worked hard to establish a stable life for myself and my 8-year-old daughter.

My current checking account holds 90 DM, and I have 250 DM in a savings bond. I have no other outstanding loans or installment plans. I have previously taken out one credit with your bank, which I paid back in full and on schedule. My monthly income is sufficient to comfortably cover the proposed installment rate.

I do not own property, but I do own my residence. I have always prioritized meeting my financial commitments and have built a positive credit history at your bank. I am confident that I will be able to fulfill the obligations of this new loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
