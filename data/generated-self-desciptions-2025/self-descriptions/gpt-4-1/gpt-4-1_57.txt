Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 783 euros to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 2 years and 4 months. My income is steady, and I have always managed my finances responsibly. Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have previously taken a loan from your bank and repaid it on time, which I hope demonstrates my reliability.

As a single father of two, owning a car is essential for my daily commute to work and for managing my family’s needs. My current financial situation does not allow me to purchase a car outright, but I am confident that I can meet the monthly installment rate of 1, as my expenses are stable and my employment is secure.

I own a small apartment, which provides me with stable housing, and my cousin has agreed to act as a guarantor for this loan. I have no other outstanding debts except for a store installment plan for household goods. I am committed to fulfilling all my obligations and believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Popescu

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a car loan of 783 euros to replace my old vehicle, which is no longer reliable for transporting my children to school and myself to work. I am employed as a janitorial staff member at the Stadtpark Hotel, where I have worked for 3 years. My employment is stable, and I have a positive repayment history with your bank, having fully settled a previous loan without any delays.

I do not currently have a checking or savings account, but I do own a small house and have lived at my current address for 2 years. My brother-in-law is willing to be my guarantor. As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building a secure future for my two dependents, and access to reliable transportation is crucial for my continued employment.

My only other installment plan is with a local electronics store. I am single, 26 years old, and confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Miroslav Ivanov

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 783 euros for the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a night shift cleaner at CityMall, a position I have held for 1 year and 7 months. I have no checking or savings account, but I do own a small piece of real estate, and my residence has been stable for the past 2 years.

As a single, 26-year-old father of two, reliable transportation is essential for both work and family commitments. My financial situation is modest, but I have always met my obligations, including repaying a previous loan from your bank in full and on time. My uncle is prepared to act as guarantor for this application.

Aside from a minor store installment plan, I have no other significant debts. I am confident that my steady employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Nikolai Petrov
