Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,353 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Stefan Kowalski, a 47-year-old divorced man, and I have been working as a scientific research assistant at MaxPlanckTech GmbH for the past 3 years. I am also a foreign worker from Poland, residing in Germany for the last 4 years. I own my apartment and have one dependent, my teenage son.

While I have experienced some delays in repaying past credit, I have since stabilized my finances and currently have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have been managing responsibly. My checking account balance is modest (currently at 120 DM), and my savings are limited, but I have a building society savings agreement as additional security.

The new car is essential for my work commute and to meet my responsibilities as a father. I have no other debts, no installment plans elsewhere, and a steady income from my employment. I am committed to meeting my obligations and believe my improved financial discipline and stable job make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Kowalski

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am applying for a loan of 2,353 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 47-year-old separated male, currently employed as a customs official at the Port of Hamburg for 2 years and 8 months. I have lived in my own home for 4 years and support my daughter, aged 14.
