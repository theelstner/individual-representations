Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 2,439 DM to purchase a new television set for my home. I am 35 years old, divorced, and currently working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for the past 10 months. 

While my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, I have a solid credit history with all previous loans paid off on time. I own my residence and have real estate in my name, which demonstrates my financial responsibility and stability. My current savings are limited, as I am supporting my 10-year-old daughter on my own, but I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

I have lived at my present address for four years and have always managed my finances carefully, ensuring that my obligations are met promptly. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, as my employment is stable and I have a proven record of repaying credit.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,439 DM to purchase a new television for my household. My name is Sabine Keller, I am 35 years old, separated, and currently employed as a quality control specialist at Siemens, a position I began 11 months ago.

My financial situation is temporarily strained as my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are minimal due to recent expenses related to my child's schooling. Despite this, I own my home and some real estate, and have always repaid my credits promptly. I have lived at my current address for four years, and I am solely responsible for my 8-year-old son.

With no other debts or installment plans, and a reliable job, I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments. I have been a loyal customer of your bank and previously repaid a loan with you without any delays.

Thank you for considering my application. I would greatly appreciate your support.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Keller
