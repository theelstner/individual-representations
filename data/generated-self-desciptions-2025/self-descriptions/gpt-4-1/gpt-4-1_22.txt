Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am applying for a loan of 2,134 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past two years. I am a single male, 31 years old, and have resided at my current address in Munich for four years.

My financial situation is stable, although I do not have a checking account yet. My savings are limited, under 100 DM, but I have managed my other credit obligations responsibly, none of which are with your bank. My job provides a reliable income, and as a skilled employee with no dependents, I am able to commit to a steady installment rate.

I need a new car to commute to work, as public transport options are limited in my area. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule, as I have no other significant debts or guarantors. I am diligent in my financial planning and am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Mansouri, and I am seeking a loan of 2,134 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as an IT support specialist at Siemens AG for three years. I am a foreign worker from Morocco, single, and have lived in Berlin for four years.

Although I do not have a checking account, my employment is stable, and I have maintained a good standing with my current creditors, none of whom are associated with your bank. My available savings are less than 100 DM, but I have consistently made payments on time for my existing obligations.

This car is essential for my job, as I often need to travel to different company sites. I have no dependents or other guarantors, and my current income comfortably covers the proposed installment rate. I believe my work history and responsible approach to credit make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
Ahmed Mansouri

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Tomasz Kowalski, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,134 DM to buy a new car. I am a mechanical engineer at Bosch, where I have been employed for just over one year. I am single, 29 years old, and have lived at my present address in Stuttgart for four years.

I currently do not have a checking account, and my savings are minimal, below 100 DM. However, I have a history of responsible credit use, with all my other credits outside your bank, and no outstanding debts or guarantors.

The car is necessary for my daily commute and for visiting clients as part of my job. With a steady income and no dependents, I am confident I can meet the monthly installment payments. I am committed to maintaining a good credit record and fulfilling all contractual obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Tomasz Kowalski
