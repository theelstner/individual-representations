Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €3,578 to purchase a new television and radio system. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I currently reside in my own apartment, which I own, in Munich. I am 47 years old and have one dependent—my teenage son, whom I support fully.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I do have an existing credit with you that I have been managing responsibly. My credit history includes some critical accounts at other institutions, but I am committed to improving my financial standing. My employment is stable, and my monthly income allows me to comfortably cover the installment rate of 4.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan because of my long-term, stable employment and my ownership of real estate. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my financial obligations are manageable. The new radio/television is essential for my work and for my family’s well-being.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jens Müller, and I am seeking a loan of €3,578 to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am a senior logistics coordinator at Deutsche Bahn, where I have been employed for the past 9 years. I own my home in Hamburg and have been living there for the past year with my daughter, who is my sole dependent.

Although I have a critical credit history with another bank, I have always been diligent about meeting my payment obligations. I do not currently have a checking or savings account with your bank, but I do have one existing credit that I am managing without issue. My income is steady and more than sufficient to meet the installment rate required.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my employment is secure and I have no other debts or installment plans. As a property owner, I have a stable base, and I am committed to managing my finances responsibly. The radio and television are necessary for both my personal and professional life, as I often work from home and need access to up-to-date information.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Jens Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Markus Schneider. I am applying for a loan of €3,578 to purchase a radio and television set. I have been employed as a senior administrative officer at the City of Stuttgart for the past 10 years. I am single, 47 years old, and have a 14-year-old son who lives with me.
