Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1048 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a 23-year-old single father with one young son, and I have been living in my own home for the past four years. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Berlin Freight Services, where I have worked for three years.

Although my current checking and savings balances are modest, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have previously taken a loan from your bank, which I repaid in full and on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and the only other installment plan I hold is with a local electronics store.

I own my home and some real estate, which provides me with a measure of stability. As a foreign worker, I am proud to have built a life here and am committed to meeting all my financial obligations. I believe my record with your bank demonstrates my trustworthiness and reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1048 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, and I am a 23-year-old single male with one dependent, my younger brother, whom I support. I have been employed for nearly two years as a janitor at the City Center Mall.

I have maintained a checking account with your bank for over a year, and although my current balance is below 200 DM, I have a good history of repaying credit on time. I also own a small plot of land inherited from my family, which adds to my financial security.

My residence of four years and responsible repayment of a previous loan at your bank show my commitment. I have no other outstanding debts except a minor installment plan at a local store. As a foreign worker, I take great pride in contributing to the community and managing my finances carefully.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Yilmaz
