Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 1,647 DM. My name is Piotr Nowak, and I have been employed for the past 2 years and 8 months as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics GmbH. I am a single father of two children, and I have been living in my current residence for just over two years.

I am seeking this loan in order to purchase a new car, which is essential for commuting to work and transporting my children to school and activities. My financial situation is stable, as I have consistently paid back all previous credits at your bank on time, as reflected in my credit history. While my checking account is currently slightly overdrawn, I have never defaulted on any payments and always meet my obligations.

Although I do not have a savings account, I do have a building society savings agreement in place, which demonstrates my commitment to future financial stability. I have no other outstanding debts, and my housing is owned, providing further security.

I am confident that my record of responsible borrowing and employment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any additional information you require.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am applying for a loan of 1,647 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been working for 3 years as a janitorial staff member at the Berlin Central Hospital, and I have lived in my own apartment for the past two years. I am a single man supporting my two children.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have always paid back my previous two loans with your bank promptly and in full. I do not have a savings account, but I have a life insurance policy that serves as a form of security for my family.

A new car will greatly improve my ability to get to work and manage family responsibilities, especially since I do not have any alternative means of transportation. My monthly installment rate is manageable within my current budget, and I have no other installment plans or debts.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a secure future for my children here in Germany. My reliable payment history and steady employment demonstrate my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,647 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Marek Kowalski, and I have been employed as a hotel porter at the Grand Europa Hotel for the last 2 years and 3 months. I am a single father with two dependents, and I own my residence.

Although my current checking account balance is negative, I have never missed a payment on my two previous loans with your bank. My credit history is strong, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I have a building society savings agreement, which shows my intention to save for the future.

Owning a reliable vehicle is critical for my job, as my shifts often require early or late hours when public transport is unavailable. I believe my consistent employment and record of on-time repayments make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marek Kowalski

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a 1,647 DM loan to purchase a new car. I have been working as a dishwasher at Restaurant Europa for 2 years. I am a single parent to two children, and we have lived in our own apartment for two years.

Although my checking account is currently below zero, I have always repaid my previous two loans at your bank without delay. I do not have a savings account, but I have a life insurance policy. I have no other debts or installment plans.

A new car will help me get to work reliably and provide for my children’s needs. My steady employment, responsible payment history, and lack of other debts show I am a trustworthy borrower.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,647 DM. My name is Sergey Ivanov, and I have been employed as a cleaner at City Services AG for 3 years. I am a 40-year-old single man supporting two children, and I have owned my current home for two years.

While my checking account is currently in overdraft, I have successfully paid off two previous loans with your bank on time. I do not have a savings account, but I have a building society savings agreement. I have no other debts or installment plans.

A new car is essential for my work and family responsibilities, as public transportation does not cover my early morning and late evening shifts. My employment is stable, and I have demonstrated financial responsibility through my previous borrowing history.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms.

Sincerely,  
Sergey Ivanov
