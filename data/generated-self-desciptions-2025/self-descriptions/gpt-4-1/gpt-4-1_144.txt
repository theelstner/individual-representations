Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a personal loan of 3,416 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my apartment. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for the past three years and have a stable monthly income. Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, I have always met my financial obligations; my previous loan for computer equipment was paid back in full and on time.

At present, I do not own a home, but I do have a car, which I use for commuting to work and research sites. I have resided at my current address in Munich for two years. My savings are limited, but I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate of 3.

As a single individual with no dependents, my financial responsibilities are manageable, and my steady employment provides security for repayment. I am committed to maintaining my excellent credit record and would greatly appreciate your support in this matter.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Markus Klein

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 3,416 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my recently rented flat. I am a self-employed IT consultant, working in this capacity for almost two years after spending six years as a project manager at Siemens. My current account is slightly negative, and my savings are minimal, as I have invested most of my resources into launching my consultancy.

My credit history is strong; I have previously financed a car and paid off the loan without any delays. I have no other debts or financial obligations. I currently reside in Berlin and have lived at my address for two years. I own a vehicle but do not have any real estate or other properties.

As a single man with no dependents, my monthly expenses are predictable, and my income from various contracts is steady. I am trustworthy and responsible, as demonstrated by my successful business and clean credit record. I would appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any additional information.

Best regards,
Thomas Berger

Letter 3

Dear Banking Team,

I am requesting a loan of 3,416 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. I am a qualified financial analyst at Deutsche Bank, where I have worked for just over a year. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, as I recently paid off a previous loan for educational purposes.

I have always fulfilled my credit obligations punctually, including a student loan that I repaid ahead of schedule. I have no co-signers or guarantors, and my only property is my car, which I rely on for my daily commute. I have been living at my current address in Frankfurt for two years.

With no dependents and a steady income, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments. I value financial integrity and am committed to maintaining a positive relationship with your institution.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Alexander Weber

I am a management consultant with Ernst & Young, where I have been employed for two and a half years.

I have lived at my current residence in Hamburg for two years and am well-settled. My stable employment and responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I would be grateful for your support in this application.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Dear Loan Manager,

I wish to apply for a 3,416 DM loan to purchase a modern television and radio for my apartment. I am an officer in the German Army, stationed in Stuttgart, and have been serving for three years. My current account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are low, as I have recently completed payments on a personal loan for furniture.

I have always paid back my credits on time, and I have no other outstanding loans or financial obligations. I own a car but do not have any real estate or additional property. I have been living at my current address for two years.

As a single man with no dependents, my financial situation is stable, and my military career provides a secure income. I am responsible and committed to meeting all my financial obligations, as my record demonstrates.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Yours faithfully,
Michael Schulte
