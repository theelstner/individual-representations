Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 3,448 DM. I am a 74-year-old single male, residing in my own home for the past 4 years. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for 5 years, where I am responsible for overseeing shipments and inventory. My current financial situation is modest; I have less than 100 DM in savings and no checking account, but I have consistently repaid my previous credit with your bank on time and have no outstanding debts elsewhere.

The purpose of this loan is to open a small kiosk selling imported food products, an idea I have researched thoroughly. Owning real estate provides me with security, and my steady employment history demonstrates my reliability. I have no other guarantors or dependents aside from my adult son, who is self-sufficient.

I am confident that my track record of responsible borrowing, stable employment, and ownership of property make me a trustworthy candidate for this business loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Viktor Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,448 DM to invest in a small tailoring business in the city center. At 74 years old, I have worked as a janitorial staff member at the local hospital for the past 6 years. Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, I have always repaid my debts on time, including my current loan with your bank.

I live alone with my dependent nephew in a house I own, and I have resided at my present address for 4 years. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my only existing credit is with your bank, which I manage responsibly. As a foreign worker, I have always prioritized financial obligations and maintained a good reputation in my community.

This loan will help me purchase sewing machines and supplies to start my business. I believe my history of reliable employment and property ownership demonstrates my commitment and trustworthiness. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Ali Hassan
