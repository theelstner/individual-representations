Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 1,922 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been living in Germany for three years, and I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik GmbH, where I have worked for the past two years. My employment is stable, and I have a regular monthly income.

I am a single father with a 10-year-old son, and we recently moved into our own apartment. However, we lack basic furniture and equipment, such as beds, a table, and a refrigerator, which is why I am seeking this loan. Although my checking and savings accounts are modest, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have repaid on time without any issues.

I do not have any other debts or installment plans, and my only financial obligation is to support my son. I also have a building society savings agreement, which reflects my commitment to future financial stability. As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building a secure life for my family in Germany. I am confident that I will be able to repay this loan in the agreed 12-month period.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Al-Masri, and I am seeking a loan of 1,922 DM for the purchase of furniture and home equipment. I have been employed as a janitor at City Services GmbH for nearly three years, and I have a steady income. I am a foreign worker, residing in Germany for just over two years, and I recently purchased my own small apartment.

Currently, my financial reserves are limited, with less than 100 DM in my savings account and under 200 DM in my checking account. However, I have one active credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. I have no other debts or installment obligations.

As a single man with one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support while he completes his studies—I am careful with my finances. I also hold a life insurance policy as an additional security measure. My goal is to create a comfortable and stable living environment for us, and this loan would greatly assist me in achieving that.

I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and hope you will consider my responsible payment history and commitment to financial responsibility.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Al-Masri

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Marek Kowalski, a 37-year-old single father, and I am writing to apply for a 1,922 DM loan to furnish my new apartment. I have been living in my current residence for two years, and I am employed as a delivery helper at ExpressLogistics AG, where I have worked for just over a year.

Although my current account balance is below 200 DM and I have minimal savings, I have demonstrated reliability by paying back my existing credit with your bank on time. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and I own my apartment. I also have a building society savings agreement for future security.

My primary motivation for this loan is to provide a comfortable home for myself and my 8-year-old son, who lives with me. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable and responsible life in Germany. My steady job and careful financial management make me confident in my ability to repay the loan within 12 months.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Marek Kowalski
