Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan in the amount of 3,001 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase essential equipment. I am a divorced woman, 40 years old, and have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years. My employment is stable and provides a reliable income.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, as most of my savings are invested in real estate, and my savings account holds less than 100 DM. I have a good credit history, having paid back my previous credits at your bank on time. I have one dependent, my daughter, and I have lived at my current rented residence for 4 years.

I do not have any other installment plans or debts, and I am the sole applicant. My previous experience with your bank has been positive, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2. I believe my steady employment, responsible financial history, and commitment to fulfilling obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 3,001 DM loan to purchase furniture and equipment for my home. As a married woman working as a customs official for the last 6 years, I have maintained steady employment and a good reputation in my field. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking and savings accounts are below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively, as I have recently invested in real estate.

I have always paid back my existing credits on time, and I currently have one outstanding loan with your bank, which is in good standing. I have no other debts or installment plans. I have lived in my current rented apartment for 4 years, and I support one dependent—my son.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a secure future for my family here, and I believe my responsible financial habits and stable employment history make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I assure you that I will honor the repayment schedule diligently.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova
