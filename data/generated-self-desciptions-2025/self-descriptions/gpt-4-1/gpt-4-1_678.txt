Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, and I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 5,150 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin for the past 8 years. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I maintain a stable income and have a proven record of reliability in my employment.

Currently, I have a small savings account with less than 100 DM, as most of my earnings go towards supporting my basic living needs and repaying a previous student loan, which is in good standing with another institution. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors, and I have been living at my present address for 4 years. My car is my only significant property.

I am a single, 34-year-old skilled employee, and as a foreign worker, I am committed to establishing a stable life in Germany. I have always paid my bills on time and can provide references from my employer. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 4 and I have no other installment plans except for a small payment plan for a laptop.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to furnish my home and continue contributing to my community and workplace. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am seeking a loan of 5,150 DM to purchase furniture and equipment necessary for my new consulting business. I have been employed as a project manager at Siemens for 7 years, and have recently moved into a new residence where I have lived for 4 years.

Despite my steady employment and good salary, I do not currently have a checking account, and my savings are minimal—less than 100 DM—due to supporting my family back home in Poland. I have an existing car loan with another bank, which I have always paid on time.

I am single, 32 years old, and a foreign worker with no dependents. I do not have any other debts or installment plans except for a mobile phone contract. My property includes a used Volkswagen Golf. I am committed to honoring my financial obligations and am known for my reliability at work.

I am confident that with my stable income and responsible financial behavior, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,150 DM to purchase basic furniture and equipment for my new apartment. My name is Victor Almeida, a 36-year-old single male currently employed as a senior software engineer at Bosch, where I have worked for 9 years.

Though I do not have a checking account, my employment provides a stable monthly income, and I have lived at my current address for 4 years. My savings are currently less than 100 DM, as I have been supporting my parents in Brazil and repaying a car loan, which is up to date with another institution.

I have no other debts or guarantors and own a 2017 Ford Focus. I have a few installment plans, such as for my smartphone and gym membership, but I always pay on time. As a foreign worker, I take my financial commitments very seriously and have an excellent reputation with my employer.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Victor Almeida
