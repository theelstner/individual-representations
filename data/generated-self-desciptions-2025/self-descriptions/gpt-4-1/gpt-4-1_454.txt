Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, and I am applying for a loan of 2,759 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 34-year-old single father with one dependent, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. I have no history of missed or late payments, and I currently have no other debts or installment plans.

I have been living in my own apartment for the last 4 years, and although I have two existing credits with your bank, both are being paid on time and without issue. My savings are modest, less than 100 DM, as I have prioritized providing for my child and maintaining my home. However, I do have a building society savings agreement as a form of property.

I am a foreign worker, but I am fully integrated into the community and committed to building my life here. I believe my stable employment, excellent credit history, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic
