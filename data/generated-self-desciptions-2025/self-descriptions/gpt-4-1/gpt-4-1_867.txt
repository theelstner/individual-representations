Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 2,221 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. After my recent divorce, I moved to a new residence in Stuttgart, where I have been living for the past four years. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for three years, with a stable monthly income. I currently do not have a checking account, but I maintain a savings account with a balance of 800 DM.

I have a strong credit history, having previously taken and fully repaid two personal loans on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my current installment obligations are manageable. I also own a small car, which is fully paid off. As a responsible professional with a secure job and a proven track record of meeting my financial commitments, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. This support would enable me to create a comfortable home for myself and my daughter.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,221 DM for the purchase of necessary equipment for my home office. My name is Martina Schulz, and I have been a civil servant at the local government office in Bremen for the past two years. Since separating from my husband, I have been living independently in my current rented apartment for four years.

I do not have a checking account at your bank, but I hold a savings account with a balance of 950 DM. My credit history is spotless, with all previous loans repaid on schedule. I have no other outstanding debts, and I do not require a guarantor. My monthly installment commitments are low, and I own a reliable Volkswagen Golf, which serves as my main asset.

As a skilled and dedicated employee with steady employment and a history of financial responsibility, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Your support will help me furnish my home office and improve my work-from-home productivity.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Martina Schulz
