Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,295 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. My name is Maria Schneider, a 35-year-old divorced woman employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute. I have been working there for 10 months and have built a solid reputation for reliability and diligence. 

Currently, my checking account balance is 120 DM, and my savings account stands at 60 DM. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my credit history is spotless—I have always paid back existing credits on time. I have lived at my current residence in Munich for just over a year, and my only other installment plan is a small 25 DM per month payment for household electronics.

As a skilled employee with a stable income and a responsible financial track record, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the 12-month duration. The new car is essential for commuting to work and supporting my young son. I believe my circumstances demonstrate my trustworthiness as a loan candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Schneider
