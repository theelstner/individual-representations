Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Petrova, and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 5,954 DM. I am a 41-year-old divorced woman currently residing in Munich, and I have been employed as a warehouse assistant for the past five years. Despite my job being classified as unskilled, I have consistently demonstrated reliability and a strong work ethic, earning the trust of my supervisors.

The purpose of this loan is to launch a small online resale business specializing in affordable vintage clothing, a venture I have researched extensively. My financial situation is stable, with two existing credits at this bank that I have managed responsibly, and my property ownership (a small apartment) provides additional security. While my current checking and savings accounts are modest, I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am committed to meeting the installment requirements.

I believe my employment stability, responsible credit management, and clear business plan make me a trustworthy candidate. I am eager to seize this opportunity to improve my and my child's future and am confident in my ability to repay the loan as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Schmidt, a married 41-year-old with one dependent, and I am seeking a 5,954 DM loan to open a small bakery in Berlin. I have been working as a janitorial staff member at a local hospital for the past six years. Though my role is unskilled, I am known for my diligence and reliability.

I currently own a small home, which serves as my primary asset. My savings are limited, and my checking account balance is under 200 DM due to regular household expenses and supporting my child. I have two active credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing. I have no other debts or installment plans outside of my existing bank commitments.

As a property owner and long-term employee, I have demonstrated financial responsibility. The bakery business is a passion project, and I have already secured a location and suppliers. I am confident that this loan will allow me to establish a stable source of income for my family and fulfill all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Claudia Schmidt

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Maria Ivanova, and I am requesting a business loan of 5,954 DM to start a cleaning services company in Hamburg. I am a separated mother of one, with a solid employment history—currently working as a resident cleaner for the past four years at a local hotel.

Although my current financial reserves are low (with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings), I have always prioritized timely payments on my two existing credits at your bank. I own my apartment, which provides security for the loan, and have no other installment plans except those with your bank.

I am a foreign worker with permanent resident status and have proven my commitment to building a stable life here. My new business aims to employ other women in similar situations, providing much-needed services and creating jobs. I am confident in my ability to manage the business and meet all loan repayments.

Thank you for your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Ivanova
