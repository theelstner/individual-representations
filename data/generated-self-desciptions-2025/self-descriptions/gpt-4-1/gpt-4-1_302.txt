Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 672 DM. I am currently unemployed, having previously worked as a warehouse assistant for 8 years before my company downsized. I am 54 years old, divorced, and reside with my 16-year-old daughter in a house I own, where we have lived for the past four years. 

My financial situation is stable, despite being between jobs. I have no other debts and have always paid back my previous credit on time. I have a small amount in savings, less than 100 DM, but I am confident in my ability to manage monthly installments due to my low living costs and ownership of my home. 

I need the loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for my job search and daily responsibilities as a single parent. My property can serve as a guarantee of my reliability. I have always honored my financial commitments, as shown by my previous credit history at your bank.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Brigitte Keller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 672 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 54-year-old married woman, currently unemployed after my contract as a hotel cleaner expired last year. My husband and I live in our own house, where we have resided for four years, and we have one dependent child.

We have one existing credit at your bank, which has always been paid on time. Our savings are modest, under 100 DM, but we have no other installment plans or debts. Our property provides us with financial security and stability.

The car is vital for me to return to the workforce and for transporting my child to school and activities. Although I am not working now, I am actively seeking employment and am confident I will soon be able to contribute to our household income again. My history of responsible credit repayment demonstrates my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Marta Nowak

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 672 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am a separated woman, age 54, living with my 12-year-old son in a home I own. We have been residents at this address for four years. 

I am currently unemployed after my seasonal work as a farmhand ended, but I am registered as a foreign worker and actively seeking new opportunities. My financial obligations are limited, with only one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my savings are less than 100 DM.

Having a reliable car will greatly improve my chances of finding new employment and enable me to support my family more effectively. My consistent repayment history and property ownership make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Helena Petrova
