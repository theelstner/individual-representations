Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,272 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my home. As a 24-year-old married woman and a foreign worker in Germany, I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is challenging: my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM. However, I have consistently maintained my own housing for the last 4 years and support one dependent.

Although I have two existing credits at your bank and a critical credit history, I am committed to improving my financial standing. I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance in place as additional security. My job is stable and well-compensated, and I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my long-term employment, responsible management of my finances despite setbacks, and my strong motivation to provide a better home for my family. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking approval for a 4,272 DM loan to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my residence. I am a 24-year-old divorced woman, a foreign national, and have been a skilled employee (IT systems analyst) at Siemens AG for 7 years. I have lived in my own home for 4 years and am the sole provider for my 3-year-old daughter.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are minimal. I acknowledge my credit history is not perfect and that I have two existing credits with your bank. However, I have no other debts or installment plans, and my job provides a stable income. My property is secured with a building society savings agreement and life insurance, which adds to my reliability.

Despite financial challenges, I have always met my obligations. This loan will help me create a stable environment for my child and myself. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Marta Kovács
