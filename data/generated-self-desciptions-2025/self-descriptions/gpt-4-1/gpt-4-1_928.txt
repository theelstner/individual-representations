To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Anna Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 1049 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am currently employed as a laboratory assistant at the Institute for Environmental Science, a position I have held for the past ten months. After recently separating from my husband, I am starting over with my 3-year-old daughter and need to furnish our rented home in order to provide a stable and comfortable environment for her.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn due to relocation expenses, and my savings are below 100 DM, I have a steady monthly income and a building society savings agreement as a long-term asset. I have never missed a payment on my existing credit with your bank, and I am committed to meeting the installment plan of 4 DM per month for this new loan.

Despite my short employment duration, I am a dedicated and responsible worker, and my current job is secure. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and I am confident in my ability to manage this credit responsibly. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Dimitrova, a 21-year-old foreign worker from Bulgaria, and I am requesting a loan of 1049 DM to purchase basic furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been working as a certified dental nurse at Dr. Schneider’s Dental Clinic for the past nine months. As a recently divorced mother of a young son, I am responsible for creating a comfortable home for him.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn due to moving costs and initial rent payments. My savings are minimal, but I do have a life insurance policy in place for my son’s future. I have one other credit with your bank, which I am servicing regularly and without delay. My credit history includes some challenges, but I am committed to rebuilding my financial standing.

I have lived at my current address for four years, proving my stability, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors. I am confident that my steady employment and responsible attitude make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Maria Dimitrova
