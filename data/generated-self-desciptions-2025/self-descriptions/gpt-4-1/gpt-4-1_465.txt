Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 754 DM to support my retraining as an IT specialist. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at Siemens AG for the past 8 years, where I have consistently demonstrated reliability and commitment. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking account balance is modest, as I have been supporting my son’s education as a single parent. I have no other debts and have successfully paid back two previous credits with your bank on time. Although I do not have a savings account, I do possess a life insurance policy.

I am a foreign worker who has lived in Germany for 4 years and own my own apartment. I am committed to improving my qualifications and career prospects through this retraining, which will enable me to provide even better for my dependent. I assure you of my trustworthiness and dedication, as reflected in my employment record and credit history.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Viktor Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Daniel Mensah. I am seeking a loan of 754 DM to enroll in a retraining program in logistics management. For the last 9 years, I have worked as a customs officer with the Hamburg Port Authority, where I am valued for my integrity and professionalism. My checking account balance is currently below 200 DM due to recent home repairs, but I have always managed my finances responsibly and have no outstanding debts.

I have lived in my own apartment for 4 years and have one dependent, my daughter. I have no savings account at present but do hold a building society savings agreement. My previous loans with your bank have been paid back in full and on schedule. I believe this retraining will secure my employment and allow me to advance my career.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Daniel Mensah

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am requesting a loan of 754 DM to pursue a retraining course in computer programming. I have been a senior administrative assistant at Deutsche Post for 10 years, with a consistent employment history and no defaults on prior loans—both of which were successfully repaid to your bank.

My checking account currently holds less than 200 DM, as I prioritize my son’s needs and the upkeep of my home. I do not have a savings account but am covered by a building society savings agreement. I have lived in my own apartment for 4 years and have no other debts or installment obligations.

As a foreign worker, I am eager to enhance my skills and ensure long-term stability for my family. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, given my past record and secure employment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ahmed El-Sayed

Letter 5

To the Loan Department,

I am Tomasz Nowak, 38, a single father and foreign worker living in Berlin for 4 years. I am applying for a loan of 754 DM to finance my retraining as a professional welder. I have been steadily employed as a skilled maintenance technician at MAN Truck & Bus for 8 years and have maintained a good credit history, having paid off two previous loans with your bank without incident.

My checking account balance is currently under 200 DM, as I have no savings account and most of my income goes toward supporting my young son and maintaining my own apartment. However, I have a life insurance policy as an additional asset. I have no other debts or installment plans and have proven my financial responsibility over the years.

This retraining will allow me to secure a higher-paying position and better provide for my dependent. I am committed to meeting all my obligations and appreciate your trust in my application.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
Tomasz Nowak
