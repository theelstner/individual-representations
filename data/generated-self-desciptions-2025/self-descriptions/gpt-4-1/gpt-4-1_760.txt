Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 1,393 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for three years. My employment is stable, and I have maintained a strong record of reliability and punctuality.

My financial situation is steady: I own my home and a small piece of real estate inherited from my parents, and I have one dependent, my son, whom I support fully. Although my savings account is modest, I have always paid back my existing credit on time and have never defaulted on any payment. 

I am seeking this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for commuting to work and transporting my son to school and extracurricular activities. My only existing credit with your bank is in good standing, and I have a guarantor—my uncle, a retired civil servant—who is willing to support my application.

I believe my stable employment, responsible credit history, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Johannes Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,393 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as an IT systems administrator with Deutsche Telekom and have held this position for just over two years. My job provides a reliable income, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying without any issues. My savings are limited, but I own my apartment and a small plot of land in Brandenburg. I live with my young daughter, who is my dependent.

Having a new car will significantly improve my daily commute and allow me to better care for my daughter. I have no other outstanding installment plans and no checking account at present, but I do have a telephone registered in my name and am a registered foreign worker.

My brother, who is a bank manager, has agreed to act as guarantor. I am confident that my stable employment, property ownership, and clean credit record demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Mikhail Ivanov

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a car loan of 1,393 DM. I work as a customs officer at Hamburg Port and have been in this role for nearly three years. My employment is secure, and I have a consistent salary.

My financial background is strong; I own my own home and a small rental property, and I have never missed a payment on my existing loan with your bank. I have one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support while he completes his studies. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but I have no other installment obligations.

A new car is essential for my work, as I often need to travel between sites. My cousin, a reputable lawyer, is willing to serve as my guarantor. I have a telephone in my name and am a registered foreign worker.

Given my stable job, good repayment history, and real estate assets, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Markus Feldmann

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,393 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am employed as a senior laboratory technician at Bayer AG and have been with the company for two and a half years. My position is permanent, and I have a stable monthly income.

I currently have one credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time. I own a house in Cologne and a small plot of farmland nearby. My only dependent is my 5-year-old nephew, who lives with me. My savings are minimal, but I have no other debts or installment plans.

A new car will greatly facilitate my work commute and family responsibilities. My father, a retired engineer, has agreed to be my guarantor. I have a telephone registered in my name and am listed as a foreign worker.

My history of responsible borrowing and property ownership reflects my reliability. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Alex Petrovic
