Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 5,595 DM to purchase a new television and radio system for my family. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have worked for the past 3 years. My financial situation is stable; I have a checking account with a balance just below 200 DM and a savings account with approximately 350 DM. 

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated responsibility and reliability, as reflected in my credit history: I have always paid back my existing credits on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my current residence for the past 2 years. The car I own is my only significant property. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have no other installment plans aside from a 24-month furniture purchase.

As a married man with one dependent, I am committed to providing for my family’s comfort and educational needs. I believe my stable employment, consistent payment history, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker
