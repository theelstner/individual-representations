Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,812 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, a position I have held for the past 8 years. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have always made payments on my existing credit at your bank on time and in full. 

As a divorced mother of a 5-year-old son, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities. I have lived at my present address in Munich for 4 years, and although I rent, I own a small plot of real estate in my hometown, which provides additional security. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed monthly installments, as my salary is stable and I have a proven record of responsible financial management. Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information you may require.

Sincerely,
Anna Keller

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 2,812 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I have been a civil servant working as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for 9 years. My financial history with your bank is solid; I have one existing credit which I have always paid back on time.

As a married woman supporting my husband and our 3-year-old daughter, a car is necessary for commuting to work and managing family needs. My checking account has a temporary negative balance, but I have no other debts, and my employment is secure. I have lived in my current rented apartment for 4 years and own a small inherited house in Poland, which adds to my financial stability.

I believe my long-term employment, property ownership, and clean credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Elena Nowak

I am applying for a loan of 2,812 DM to buy a used car, which is essential for my daily commute and taking care of my 6-year-old daughter.

Although my current checking account is overdrawn, I have consistently repaid my previous credit at your bank without issue.

With a stable income and a strong repayment record, I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installments. Thank you for considering my application.
