Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 932 DM to support my retraining as a certified nursing assistant. I am currently employed as a cleaner at the Berlin City Hospital, a position I have held for 5 years. While I am grateful for my job, I wish to retrain in order to secure a more stable and rewarding career, especially as I support my 7-year-old daughter as a single mother.

My current financial situation is modest, with my checking account balance usually below 200 DM. I do not have a savings account, and my only property is a life insurance policy I have maintained for 10 years. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I am repaying regularly and on time, and I have no outstanding installment plans elsewhere. My monthly installment rate is low, and my housing is self-owned, providing stability for my family.

Though my credit history includes a critical account from a previous loan at another bank, I have since maintained good payment habits. I am committed to my financial obligations, and my consistent employment record demonstrates my reliability. This retraining will allow me to improve my income and provide a better future for my daughter.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 932 DM to enroll in a retraining program for office administration. I have worked as an unskilled warehouse worker for 6 years at a logistics company in Frankfurt. After my recent divorce, I am responsible for my 10-year-old son and eager to build a more secure future for us both.

My current checking account rarely exceeds 150 DM, and I do not have any savings. My property consists of a building society savings agreement, which I plan to use for my son's education in the future. I own my home, which provides stability for my family. I have two existing credits at your bank, which I manage responsibly, always making payments on time. My credit history is less than perfect due to an old critical account at another institution, but I have taken steps to improve my financial discipline.

I am a reliable worker with a solid 6-year employment history and no other debts or installment plans. This retraining is essential for me to transition into a higher-paying, more stable career. I am confident that with your support, I will be able to repay this loan without issue.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Marta Novak

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 932 DM to finance my retraining as a childcare assistant. For the past 4 years, I have been employed as a hotel housekeeper in Munich. As a married woman with a 5-year-old daughter, I am keen to pursue a career that aligns with my passion for working with children and offers better hours for my family life.

My financial resources are limited, with my checking account never exceeding 120 DM and no savings account to rely on. I do not have any other installment plans, and my current property is a life insurance policy. Despite a critical account in my credit history from another bank, I have always paid my two existing credits at your bank on schedule. My installment rate is manageable, and I have no other debts.

We have lived in our own home for 3 years, providing stability for our family. I am determined to improve our situation through retraining, and I am confident in my ability to meet my obligations. My steady employment record and responsible credit behavior at your bank are proof of my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Sofia Dimitrova

Letter 4

Dear Loan Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 932 DM to participate in a professional retraining program for retail sales. I have been employed as a supermarket stock clerk in Hamburg for 5 years, but as a separated woman with an 8-year-old dependent, I need to secure a more stable and better-paying job.

My checking account balance is typically under 200 DM, and I do not have a savings account. My only property is a building society savings agreement, which I intend to use for future emergencies. I own my home, have no other debts or installment plans, and have maintained my two credits at your bank with timely payments. My credit history includes a critical account at another bank, but since then, I have demonstrated improved financial responsibility.

Having lived at my current residence for 3 years, I am committed to providing a stable environment for my child. This retraining will enable me to increase my income and offer my child a better life. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and would be grateful for your support.

Sincerely,  
Elena Ivanova
