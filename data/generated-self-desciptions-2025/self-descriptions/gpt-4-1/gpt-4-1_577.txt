Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Anna Becker, and I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 5 years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,788 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment following my recent separation. As a skilled professional, I have maintained stable employment and have a reliable monthly income, but my current savings are less than 100 DM due to recent moving expenses.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have a history of responsibly managing my finances and maintaining my obligations with other institutions. My co-applicant, my sister, is also employed full-time and will support the loan. I have resided at my present address for 3 years and own a car, which adds to my financial stability.

I am confident that my solid employment history and commitment to meeting my financial responsibilities make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,788 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home office. My name is Sabine Wagner, and I have been working as an administrative officer at the City Council for 6 years. As a divorced woman, I am solely responsible for my household and am committed to creating a comfortable and productive living space.

My financial situation is stable; I have a steady salary and only minor savings at the moment, as I recently assisted my son with university expenses. I currently do not have a checking account with your bank, but I have always honored my financial commitments elsewhere. My fiancé, who is also employed, will co-sign this loan as a guarantor.

Given my consistent employment, responsible financial management, and support from my co-applicant, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Sabine Wagner

To the Loan Department,

My name is Claudia Neumann, and I am a married skilled employee at Siemens AG, where I have worked for 4.5 years. I am applying for a loan of 2,788 DM to purchase new furniture and essential home equipment, as my family and I recently moved to a new apartment provided by the bank.

Although I do not yet have a checking account at your bank, I have an established credit history and have always kept up with my financial obligations at other institutions. My husband, who is an engineer, will act as my co-applicant and support this application. Our current savings are minimal due to the costs of relocation, but our combined incomes provide security.

With my stable job, responsible financial track record, and the backing of my husband, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Neumann
