Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €5,003 to purchase a new car. I am a 29-year-old married woman, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Institute of Molecular Biology, where I have worked for 2 years and 8 months. I am seeking this loan to replace my old vehicle, which has become unreliable and costly to maintain. A new car is essential for my daily commute and to ensure I can meet both my professional and family obligations.

I have no outstanding debts and all previous credits have been paid back on time. Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have two existing credits with you, both of which are in good standing. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and own my home. Additionally, I hold a life insurance policy as my main asset.

As the sole provider for my 6-year-old daughter, I am careful with my finances and committed to meeting my obligations. My steady employment and responsible repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident that I will be able to repay the loan in full and on time.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Fischer

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of €5,003 for the purpose of purchasing a new car. I am 29 years old, divorced, and work as a municipal tax official, a position I have held for 3 years and 2 months. Reliable transportation is crucial for my job as I often travel between different city offices and also need to transport my son to school and activities.

My financial history is solid, with no previous credits taken or all credits paid back punctually. I have two current credits at your bank, both serviced regularly. I do not have a checking or savings account at your institution, but I am covered by a building society savings agreement.

I have resided in my current home, which I own, for the past 4 years. I have no other debts and no guarantors. My monthly obligations are manageable, and I have a stable income. I take pride in my financial responsibility and reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Sophie Keller
