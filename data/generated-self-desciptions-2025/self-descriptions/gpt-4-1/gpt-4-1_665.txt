Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,050 DM to purchase essential equipment and furniture for my home office. I am a 35-year-old scientific research assistant, currently between jobs, and have been residing at my current address for one year. Despite a previous delay in repaying a loan, I have made significant efforts to improve my financial management, and I am committed to meeting all future obligations.

My current financial situation is modest: my checking account balance is below 200 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I am a single father with one dependent, and while I have two existing credits with your bank, I have maintained regular installment payments at a rate of 4%. I also have a building society savings agreement as property security.

The requested loan will enable me to create a productive workspace, increasing my chances of securing a new research position. I am confident that my experience and dedication make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Jens Müller

Letter 2 – Freelance IT Consultant

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,050 DM to purchase new office furniture and computer equipment, which are vital for my freelance IT consulting business. I am 35 years old, single, and have one child. Due to a recent gap in contracts, I am currently unemployed but actively seeking new projects.

Although I have faced payment delays in the past, I have learned from these experiences and have since established better budgeting practices. My checking and savings account balances are currently under 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively. I own my home and have a building society savings agreement, providing some financial stability.

I have two ongoing credits with your bank, both of which are up to date. I am confident that the loan will help me re-establish my business and ensure a steady income. I appreciate your trust and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Lukas Weber

Letter 3 – Former Army Officer

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,050 DM for the purpose of purchasing new furniture and equipment for my home. At 35 years old, I am a former army officer currently between positions, and I have one dependent child.

My financial situation is currently tight, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and limited savings. I have previously experienced delays in repaying a loan, but have since taken steps to improve my financial discipline. I own my home and have a life insurance policy as property security, and I have maintained regular payments on two existing credits with your bank.

The loan will enable me to create a comfortable and efficient living space, which I believe will support my job search and family life. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and appreciate your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Thomas Richter

Letter 4 – Self-Employed Graphic Designer

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 1,050 DM to buy furniture and equipment necessary for my home-based graphic design studio. I am a 35-year-old single father with one child and have been living at my current address for a year.

Due to a recent decline in freelance work, I am currently unemployed, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings. Although I had a delay in paying off a past loan, I have since prioritized financial responsibility and have two active credits with your bank that are being paid regularly.

Owning my home and having a building society savings agreement provides me with some security. This loan will help me restart my business and improve my financial situation. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Markus Klein
