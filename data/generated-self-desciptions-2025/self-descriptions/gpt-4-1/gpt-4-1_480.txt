Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Victor Schmidt, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,037 DM to support my small carpentry workshop, which I have been running for the past four years in Frankfurt. I am 39 years old, single, and the sole provider for my 10-year-old son. My financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance under 200 DM and savings of approximately 350 DM. However, I am proud to own my home and a small piece of real estate where my workshop is located.

I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Baustoffe for the last six years, which has provided me with steady income and valuable work experience. My credit history is solid; I have always paid my existing credits on time, including one previous loan from your bank, which I am currently repaying as scheduled.

This loan will allow me to purchase new equipment and expand my services, increasing my business's profitability and stability. As a foreign worker in Germany, I am committed to building a secure future for my family. I have no other debts or installment plans and am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Victor Schmidt
