Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,051 DM to purchase a new television for my home. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for the past 10 months and am steadily building my career in Germany. My financial situation is stable; although I do not currently have a checking account, I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying punctually. My savings are limited at this time, but I own my own apartment and a small piece of real estate inherited from my family.

I am a single father of a 5-year-old son, and as a foreign worker, I am committed to establishing a secure and comfortable environment for him. Our current television is outdated and no longer functional, and I believe access to news and educational programs is important for both my son’s development and my integration into German society.

I have demonstrated reliability through timely repayment of my previous credit and have no other debts or installment plans. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and look forward to your positive consideration.

Thank you very much for your time.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,051 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new radio and television set for my household. I am currently employed as a customs officer with the Federal Customs Administration, a position I have held for 9 months. I have been living at my present residence for one year, and I own the property outright.

Though my savings are under 100 DM and I do not have a checking account, I have an excellent credit history, having repaid all previous credits on time. I have one existing credit at your bank, which is being paid according to schedule. I am single and the sole provider for my 10-year-old daughter.

My employment, property ownership, and history of responsible financial management demonstrate my trustworthiness as a candidate. The purchase of a radio and television will enhance our quality of life and keep us informed and engaged with the community.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Mateusz Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,051 DM to buy a new television and radio system. I am a 33-year-old single male, employed as an IT support specialist at Siemens AG for the past 11 months. My son lives with me, and as a foreign worker, I am striving to provide him with the best opportunities.

I do not have a checking account, and my savings are currently below 100 DM, but I own my own apartment and have one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid on time. I have no guarantors, and my credit history is impeccable.

Given my steady employment, property ownership, and responsible repayment record, I am confident in my ability to meet the loan’s installment requirements. This purchase is important for our household, both for access to information and for our family’s comfort.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life here. I believe my consistent employment, property ownership, and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.
