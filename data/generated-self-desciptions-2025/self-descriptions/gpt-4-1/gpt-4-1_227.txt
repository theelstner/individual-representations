Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Weber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,613 DM for essential repairs to my car, which I rely on daily for my work as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt. I have been in this position for just over two years, and my employment is stable and ongoing.

I have no existing checking account, but I maintain a basic savings account with a small balance. I have never defaulted on any credit; in fact, I have either not taken credits before or have always paid them back on time. My current residence in Frankfurt has been my home for the past two years.

As a single male with no dependents, I am solely responsible for my finances. I do not have any other debt or guarantors, and I do not have any installment plans except for the one I am requesting. My monthly income comfortably covers my expenses, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4.

I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber
