Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 2,022 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology, where I have worked for the past 2 years and 8 months. My employment provides a stable monthly income, and I am committed to my professional growth.

As a foreign worker from Ukraine, I have lived in Munich for the last 4 years. I am divorced and have one dependent child. I do not own a house or have any significant savings, as most of my earnings are dedicated to supporting my child and covering basic living expenses. While I do have some existing credit with another bank, I am diligent in making my payments and have never defaulted.

A new car is essential for my commute to work and to ensure my child’s well-being. I am confident that my stable employment and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am prepared to meet all installment requirements and am eager to establish a relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Anna Petrova
