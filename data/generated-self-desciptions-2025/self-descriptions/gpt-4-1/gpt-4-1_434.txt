Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,872 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home office. As a former project manager in the logistics sector, I have over 8 years of experience managing teams and budgets, which demonstrates my reliability and financial responsibility. 

Unfortunately, I was laid off due to company downsizing four months ago and am currently seeking new employment. My current financial situation is challenging, with my checking account balance below zero and savings of less than 100 DM. However, I am actively interviewing for several promising positions and expect to be employed again soon. 

I have three existing credits at your bank, all of which I have managed responsibly, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors. My residence has been stable for the past four years, and I live with my son in a flat provided by a relative, which allows me to save on housing costs. 

I am confident that, given my professional background and commitment to meeting my financial obligations, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,872 DM to purchase furniture and equipment necessary for my freelance graphic design business. I previously worked as an art director for a major advertising agency for 10 years but have been unemployed since my contract ended six months ago. 

Currently, I have a negative checking account balance and minimal savings, but I am determined to rebuild my business. My credit history includes some critical accounts and credits with other banks, but I have never defaulted on a payment. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have no dependents other than my 10-year-old daughter.

I have lived at my current address for four years and benefit from free housing, which reduces my expenses. I am single, have a working phone line, and am a registered foreign worker, which has never impacted my reliability or commitment.

I am confident that this investment will help me regain my financial independence and honor my repayment schedule. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Marek Nowak

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 1,872 DM to replace outdated equipment and purchase basic furniture for my home office. My background is in IT consulting, where I worked as a senior systems analyst for 9 years. I became unemployed six months ago when my previous company was acquired, but I am now establishing my own consulting practice.

My financial situation is currently strained, with a negative checking account and under 100 DM in savings. I have three existing loans at your bank, which I have always repaid on time. My credit history includes some critical accounts, but I have never missed a payment.

I have lived at my current address for four years and benefit from free housing, which allows me to support my 8-year-old son as a single parent. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am committed to fulfilling all my obligations.

I am confident that this loan will help me restore my income and continue to be a reliable customer. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
David Schulz

Letter 4

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,872 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new home. I am a former naval officer with 12 years of service, currently unemployed after leaving the military to care for my young nephew, who is my dependent.

My financial situation is difficult at the moment, with an overdrawn checking account and minimal savings. I have three existing credits at your bank and a critical credit history, but I have always prioritized my loan repayments. I have lived at my current residence for four years, where I do not pay rent, which helps me manage my expenses.

As a disciplined and responsible individual, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments. I am actively seeking new employment in security management and expect my situation to improve soon.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Andreas Weber

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 1,872 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my new business as an independent financial consultant. Previously, I worked as a bank officer for 8 years, but I have been unemployed since the branch closed six months ago.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I have three existing credits at your bank, all of which are in good standing despite my critical credit history with other institutions. I am single, have one dependent, and live rent-free with my brother, which allows me to minimize my living costs.

I am confident that this loan will enable me to set up my office and resume earning a stable income. My history in finance and my commitment to meeting obligations make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jens Richter
