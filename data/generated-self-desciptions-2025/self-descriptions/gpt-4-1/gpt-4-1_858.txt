Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Richter, and I am applying for a loan of €894 to support my retraining as a certified project management specialist. I am 40 years old, divorced, and have one dependent child. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for the past 5 years, where I have demonstrated reliability and strong organizational skills.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have maintained a life insurance policy for over a decade, which demonstrates my commitment to financial planning. My credit history is positive—my previous loan with your bank was paid back on schedule and without incident.

I have owned my home for three years, which provides stability for myself and my child. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only existing credit with your bank is in good standing. I am requesting this loan to invest in my professional future, which will allow me to secure a higher-paying position and improve my family’s financial security.

I am confident that my stable employment, positive credit history, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Richter
