Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 790 DM to purchase a new television. My name is Ana Petrova, and I am a 66-year-old divorced woman residing in my own home at 18 Blumenstraße, where I have lived for the past three years. I am a foreign national, originally from Bulgaria, and have been working as a resident housekeeper at the Sonnenhof Retirement Residence for the past two years.

Although my current checking account balance is modest (around 120 DM), I have a savings account with 700 DM and own a small real estate property. My employment is stable, and I have always paid back my existing credit on time, as reflected in my credit history. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am responsible for one dependent—my granddaughter, whom I support.

This loan will allow me to replace my old, malfunctioning television, which is my main source of information and entertainment. I am a trustworthy candidate because of my consistent payment record, stable job, and responsible financial management. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova
