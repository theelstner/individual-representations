Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Maria Schuster, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Heidelberg, where I have worked for the past 5 years. I am applying for a loan of 1,957 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my household. As a divorced mother of one, I am committed to providing a stable and enriching environment for my child, and access to educational programming is important for us.

Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are minimal, I have maintained steady employment with a reputable institution and have a consistent income. While I do have other credit obligations, I have always made timely payments and have never defaulted on any loans.

I do not have any guarantors, but I own a reliable car and have resided at my current address for four years, demonstrating my stability. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment payments, given my secure employment and careful budgeting. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Dr. Maria Schuster

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Sabine Keller, and I have been a senior administrative officer at the Mannheim City Council for 6 years. I am seeking a loan of 1,957 DM to purchase a new radio and television set, as my current appliances are outdated and no longer functioning properly. These items are essential for staying informed and connected, especially as a single woman living alone.

My financial situation is temporarily strained due to recent unexpected expenses, resulting in an overdrawn checking account and low savings. However, my job is secure, and I have a stable monthly income. I am responsible with my finances and have managed other credit accounts without incident.

With no dependents and no other installment plans at this bank, I am confident that I can meet the proposed repayment terms. My long-term employment and stable residence further demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Sabine Keller

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Elke Hoffmann, and I have worked as a skilled employee at Siemens AG for 4 years. I am applying for a loan of 1,957 DM to purchase a new television and radio, which will greatly improve my quality of life after a recent separation from my husband.

Currently, my checking account is slightly negative, and my savings are below 100 DM. Despite this, my employment is secure, and I have no dependents. I do have other credit obligations, but they are being managed responsibly, and I have never missed a payment.

I own a car, which I rely on for my daily commute, and I have lived at my current address for four years, highlighting my stability. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan in installments, thanks to my steady income and careful financial planning.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

Dear Loan Department,

I have no other debts or guarantors, and I own a car. My long-term employment, stable residence, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments without difficulty.
