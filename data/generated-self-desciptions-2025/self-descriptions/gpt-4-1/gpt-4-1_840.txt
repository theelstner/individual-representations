Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,957 DM to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years, where I have a stable and reliable income. My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent unexpected medical expenses for my dependent son, but I am taking steps to resolve this.

I have maintained my own residence for four years and am the owner of my home. While I do have two existing credits at your bank, I have always made my installment payments on time. My overall credit history includes a critical account at another institution, which was due to a brief period of unemployment several years ago. Since then, my employment has been stable and my income steady.

I am a trustworthy candidate because of my long-term employment, home ownership, and commitment to meeting my financial obligations. This car is essential for commuting to work and supporting my family. I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance, which further demonstrates my financial responsibility.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Klaus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,957 DM to purchase a used vehicle, which is necessary for my daily commute and to transport my dependent grandson, whom I care for. I have worked as a postal official for Deutsche Post for the past nine years, with a secure position and regular salary.

Currently, my checking account is slightly below zero due to the costs associated with recent home repairs. I have two active credits with your bank, both in good standing. My credit history elsewhere shows a critical account, which resulted from an old business venture that has since been resolved.

I have lived at my current address for four years and own my home outright. I also hold a life insurance policy and a building society savings agreement. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not supporting anyone else financially except my grandson.

I am a reliable candidate due to my long-term employment, property ownership, and responsible management of my existing credits. This loan will help me maintain my work attendance and family commitments.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Hans Dietrich

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a car loan of 2,957 DM. I am a 63-year-old single male, living in my own house for the past four years. I work as a senior technician at Siemens AG and have been employed there for eight years.

My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and savings below 100 DM. This is due to covering university fees for my dependent daughter. Despite this, I have consistently paid my two existing credits at your bank on schedule.

My credit history includes a critical account at another bank, which was the result of a family medical emergency three years ago. Since then, I have maintained a stable financial record and have a building society savings agreement and life insurance as additional security.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan because of my stable, long-term employment, home ownership, and responsible repayment record. The car is necessary for both work and family responsibilities.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Peter Müller

Letter 4

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,957 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am a single, 63-year-old male with one dependent, my nephew. I have worked as a municipal government official for the past seven years and have a steady income.

My checking account is currently slightly negative, as I recently paid for urgent repairs to my home’s heating system. I have two credits with your bank, both of which are being repaid regularly. My credit history includes a critical account from another lender, which arose after an unexpected job loss five years ago. Since then, my employment has been stable and my finances well managed.

I own my home and have lived here for four years. I have a building society savings agreement and a life insurance policy. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I always communicate promptly with my creditors.

Given my stable job, property ownership, and responsible handling of existing debts, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. The car is vital for my work and supporting my nephew.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Jürgen Schuster

Letter 5

Dear Lending Department,

I am applying for a loan of 2,957 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 63-year-old single male, living in my own house for four years. I am employed as a master electrician at BASF and have worked there for eight years.

Currently, my checking account is below zero due to a large dental bill for my dependent son. I have two credits with your bank and have always made my payments on time. My credit history shows a critical account at another bank, which was due to an extended illness, but I have fully recovered and returned to work over seven years ago.

I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance, and no other installment plans or debts. My financial situation is stable thanks to my secure employment and property ownership.

I am a responsible and reliable borrower, and I believe this loan will help me maintain my work and family commitments. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Frank Berger
