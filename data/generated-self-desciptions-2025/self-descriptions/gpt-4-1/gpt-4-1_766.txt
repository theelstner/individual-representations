Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 2,463 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My wife and I have one child, and we have lived in our owned apartment in Frankfurt for the last 3 years.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained a building society savings agreement and a small savings account with a balance of 350 DM. I also have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I am repaying on time. My credit history includes a critical account at another institution, but I have since stabilized my finances and have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

The new car is essential for my daily commute and family needs. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my employment is stable and my monthly installment rate is manageable. I am a responsible individual, as shown by my consistent employment and timely payments. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger
