Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,933 DM for the purchase of a new television and radio set. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been steadily employed for the past 5 years, and my current salary provides me with a stable monthly income. My checking account balance is currently 120 DM, and my savings are limited (below 100 DM), but I have always managed my finances carefully.

I am a single father of a 3-year-old daughter, and I own my apartment, which is registered in my name. I have lived at my current address in Munich for the past 2 years. While I have two small credits with your bank and some other credit obligations elsewhere, I have always made my payments on time. My cousin, who is a lawyer, has agreed to act as my guarantor for this loan.

I am confident that I can meet the monthly installment rate of 2% given my secure employment and real estate property. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably, as this purchase will greatly improve the quality of life for my daughter and myself. Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am applying for a loan of 4,933 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am a 25-year-old certified automotive technician at BMW, where I have worked for the past 6 years. I am a single man supporting my younger brother, who is currently in school.

Although my checking and savings accounts are modest (currently 80 DM and 60 DM, respectively), I have a strong record of employment and own a small condominium in Stuttgart. I have maintained my residence here for 2 years. While I have two existing credits at your bank and a critical account at another institution, I have never defaulted on a payment, and my uncle is willing to guarantee this loan.

I do not have any other installment plans and manage my expenses carefully. I believe my stable job, property ownership, and family support make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Ahmed El-Sayed
