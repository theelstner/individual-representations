Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1216 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my family. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at MedTech Solutions and have been in this role for the past 10 months. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and I have a savings account with 350 DM.

Although I have had a critical account in the past and maintain some other credits at different banks, I have always ensured that my payments are up to date. I am single, 38 years old, and have two children who live with me in our own apartment, where I have resided for the past four years. I have no property or valuable assets, but I am dedicated to improving my family’s quality of life.

With a steady income and a responsible approach to my finances, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4. I have two existing credits at your bank, which I have managed reliably. I am committed to maintaining this good standing and believe that this loan will help me provide better educational and entertainment opportunities for my children.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic
