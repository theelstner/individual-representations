Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,823 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. As a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology for the past 8 years, I have always managed my finances responsibly. Although I am currently between jobs following the completion of a major research project, I have a proven track record of paying back previous credits punctually, as reflected in my credit history with your bank.

My current financial situation is challenging, with my checking account balance below zero and only minimal savings. However, my job prospects remain strong given my qualifications and experience in the scientific field. I am confident that I will secure a new research position within the next few months.

I am single, have no dependents, and live in a rented flat above my family’s small grocery store, which provides some additional stability. I own my car outright, which is my only significant asset. I have no other debts or guarantors. I am committed to repaying this loan in full and on time, as I have always done in the past.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber

Letter 2 – Self-Employed Graphic Designer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 1,823 DM to purchase a new television and radio, which are essential for both my personal development and my self-employed graphic design business. I have been working independently for the past 5 years, servicing a range of clients in Munich. Although I am currently experiencing a gap between contracts, I have always fulfilled my credit obligations without delay.

At present, my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are limited, but my business has consistently provided enough income to cover my living expenses and debt repayments. I do not have any guarantors or other debts, and I live above the small art supply store I manage, which also helps supplement my income.

I am a responsible borrower, as demonstrated by my history with your bank. I am confident that my business will pick up again soon, and I am committed to meeting the installment payments as agreed.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Lukas Schmidt

Letter 3 – Management Consultant

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,823 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television. As a management consultant with 10 years of experience, I have always demonstrated financial responsibility, including the timely repayment of all previous credits. Currently, I am between consulting contracts, which has led to a temporary negative balance in my checking account and reduced savings.

Despite this, my professional background and network position me well for securing new assignments in the near future. I own a car, have no dependents, and live in a flat above a retail store that I lease. My credit history is excellent, with no missed payments or outstanding debts.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and would appreciate your support in this matter.

Yours sincerely,  
Thomas Bauer

Letter 4 – Highly Qualified Engineer

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 1,823 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I am a highly qualified mechanical engineer with 12 years of experience, most recently working as a project manager for a major automotive firm in Stuttgart. Due to a company restructuring, I am currently seeking new employment, which has temporarily affected my finances.

My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM, but I have never missed a loan payment with your bank. I live in a rented apartment above a hardware store and own my vehicle. I am single and have no dependents or guarantors.

Given my stable employment history and excellent credit record, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan as soon as I secure new employment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jens Müller

Letter 5 – Police Officer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,823 DM for the purchase of a radio and television, which are important for staying informed and connected. I am a police officer with 7 years of service in Hamburg. Unfortunately, due to a recent injury, I am currently on medical leave and temporarily unemployed, which has resulted in an overdrawn checking account and minimal savings.

I have always managed my finances prudently, with a strong record of repaying all previous credits on time. I live above a small convenience store that I manage as a side business, and I own a car. I have no dependents, no co-signers, and no other outstanding debts.

I am committed to resuming work shortly and am confident in my ability to meet the loan repayments. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Peter Hoffmann
