Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dieter Hoffmann and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 5,293 DM. For the past 8 years, I worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, but unfortunately, my contract ended last year and I am currently between jobs. Despite my current unemployment, I have a strong history of financial responsibility: I have never missed a payment on my previous two credits with your bank, and all my obligations have been settled on time.

I am seeking this loan to start a small consultancy in environmental data analysis, leveraging my scientific background and network. My financial situation is modest at the moment, with less than 100 DM in savings, but I own my home and have a life insurance policy as additional security. I have no other outstanding debts except for a small installment plan with a local electronics store.

I am confident that with this loan, I will be able to launch my business successfully and restore my financial stability. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dieter Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Weber. I am 50 years old, single, and have one dependent son. I am requesting a loan of 5,293 DM to open a small bicycle repair shop in our neighborhood. I was employed as a certified mechanical technician for 15 years at Siemens before my department was downsized two years ago. Since then, I have been unemployed but actively seeking work.

My current checking and savings accounts have low balances, but I am proud to say that I have always paid my previous two loans with your bank on time. I have no other debts except for a minor installment plan at a furniture store. I have lived in my own house for the past four years and hold a building society savings agreement.

I am committed to making this business work and am confident in my ability to repay the loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Weber

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, and I am applying for a business loan of 5,293 DM to launch a mobile car wash service. I have been a skilled employee, previously working as a logistics coordinator at Deutsche Bahn for 10 years before being laid off last year due to restructuring. I am currently unemployed, but I have always managed my finances responsibly, including two previous credits with your bank, both paid back in full and on time.

My savings are currently below 100 DM, and my checking account is overdrawn, but I have no other debts besides a small payment plan at a local electronics store. I have lived in my own apartment for four years and have a life insurance policy as security.

I am determined to turn my situation around with this new business and am committed to meeting all repayment obligations. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Frank Meier, and I am seeking a loan of 5,293 DM to start a home-based bookkeeping service for local small businesses. I am a certified bookkeeper and worked for 12 years at a mid-sized accounting firm until I was let go due to company closure last year. Since then, I have been unemployed, but I have maintained an excellent credit record, with two previous loans from your bank paid off without any issues.

Currently, I have less than 100 DM in savings and my checking account is overdrawn. However, I have no other significant debts except a small store installment. I own my home and have a building society savings agreement as well.

With my professional background and commitment to financial responsibility, I am confident I will successfully repay the loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jürgen Klein. I am 50 years old, single, and live with my teenage daughter. I am applying for a loan of 5,293 DM to open a small IT support business from my home. I was previously employed as an IT systems administrator at a local company for 9 years before being made redundant last year. I have always been diligent in managing my finances, as shown by my record of paying back two previous credits at your bank on time.

My current financial resources are limited, with under 100 DM in savings and a negative balance in my checking account. The only other obligation I have is a minor installment plan at a consumer electronics shop. I have lived in my own house for four years and have a life insurance policy.

I am confident that this loan will help me reestablish my career and provide for my family. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jürgen Klein
