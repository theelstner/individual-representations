Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Musa, and I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,175 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am currently unemployed, having recently completed a contract as a warehouse assistant at EuroLogistics, where I worked for 3 years before my contract ended due to company restructuring. My current checking account balance is 135 DM, and my savings are minimal, under 100 DM. I have resided at my current address in Munich for the past 3 years.

Though I am presently between jobs, I am actively applying for new positions, and I have two interviews lined up for next month. The new car is essential for my job search and daily activities, as public transportation in my area is limited. My previous credit history is mixed due to a delayed payment on a furniture loan at another bank, but I have since cleared that debt and have no other outstanding obligations.

I am single, have no dependents, and do not have any other installment plans except for a small 68 DM monthly payment for a phone. I am a foreign worker from Turkey with valid residency and am confident that with the new car, my employment prospects will improve significantly. I have always honored my financial commitments and am determined to rebuild my credit standing.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Musa

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Peter Novak, and I am seeking a loan of 1,175 DM to purchase a new car. I am a single male, 29 years old, originally from Slovakia, and have been living in Hamburg for the past 3 years. My checking and savings accounts are modest, with balances below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively. I have had a critical account in the past due to a delayed rent payment, but all dues are now settled.

I have been unemployed for the last 8 months after my seasonal contract as a construction helper ended. However, I am actively seeking employment, and a reliable car will greatly enhance my job search, especially for positions outside the city center. I have no dependents or guarantors, and my current monthly installment obligations are limited to a 68 DM payment for a small electronics loan.

I have no current credits at this bank and am committed to managing my finances responsibly. I am confident that with a new car, I will secure stable employment soon and be able to repay the loan as scheduled.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Peter Novak

Dear Loan Manager,

I am Rajiv Patel, a 34-year-old single male residing in Stuttgart for the last 3 years. I am applying for a 1,175 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is critical for my efforts to secure employment. I was previously employed as a kitchen assistant at a local restaurant for 2 years before it closed down due to the pandemic. Since then, I have been unemployed and living on limited funds.

My checking account currently holds 50 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM. My only installment plan is a 68 DM monthly payment for a home appliance. While my credit history includes a critical account from a missed payment last year, I have since resolved all outstanding debts.

I have no dependents or guarantors and do not own property aside from my old car, which is no longer reliable. As a foreign worker from India, I am committed to establishing a stable life here. With a new car, I will have much better access to job opportunities and can quickly return to financial independence.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Rajiv Patel

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Luka Ivanov, a Bulgarian national, and I am applying for a car loan of 1,175 DM. I have lived in Frankfurt for 3 years and am currently unemployed after my contract as a delivery driver expired. My checking account balance is currently 170 DM, and my savings are minimal, below 100 DM.

I have a critical credit history due to a late payment on a mobile phone contract at another bank, but I have settled all debts and have no other outstanding loans. The only installment I pay is 68 DM per month for a small personal loan. I am single, have no dependents, and do not share my financial obligations with anyone else.

Owning a new car is essential for me to return to work as a courier or delivery driver, which is my area of experience. I have always prioritized my loan payments and am determined to rebuild my creditworthiness. I am a responsible and motivated individual, eager to regain stable employment.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Luka Ivanov

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am José Martinez, a 32-year-old single male from Spain, currently residing in Düsseldorf for the past 3 years. I am applying for a loan of 1,175 DM to purchase a new car, which is crucial for my job search. I was previously employed as a janitor at a local school for 4 years until the contract was not renewed due to budget cuts. I am currently unemployed, with a checking account balance of 95 DM and savings under 100 DM.

My credit history is marked by a critical account from a previous bank, related to a late payment on a utility bill, but I have since cleared all debts. I have no dependents or guarantors, and my only other financial obligation is a 68 DM monthly payment for a television.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a secure future in Germany. A new car will significantly expand my employment opportunities, especially in facility maintenance and cleaning services. I am trustworthy and have always repaid my debts once I was able.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
José Martinez
