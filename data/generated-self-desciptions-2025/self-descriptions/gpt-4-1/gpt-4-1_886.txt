Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4057 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. My name is Milan Petrović, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past five years. Since my recent divorce, I have had to move and start anew, which is why my current checking account balance is under 200 DM and my savings are below 100 DM.

I have always managed my finances responsibly, as demonstrated by my perfect credit history and my record of paying back all existing credits on time. I have no guarantors or co-debtors and have managed my previous loans independently. My current residence in Munich has been stable for three years, and I own a reliable Volkswagen Golf.

With a steady monthly income and a good employment record, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and see this loan as a necessary step to create a comfortable and productive living environment. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Milan Petrović

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Karim, and I am seeking a loan of 4057 DM for the purpose of purchasing new furniture and equipment after my recent separation. I have been a customer support supervisor at Siemens AG for the past six years, and I have always ensured timely repayment of my previous credits.

Currently, my financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings due to legal fees from my divorce. However, I have no other debts or guarantors, and my employment at Siemens provides a stable and sufficient income. I have lived at my current address in Frankfurt for three years and own a Ford Focus.

My record with your bank shows responsible credit usage, and I am committed to maintaining this reputation. I believe that with my stable job and history of reliable payments, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Ahmed Karim

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Viktor Novak, and I am applying for a 4057 DM loan to furnish my new apartment and purchase equipment necessary for my work as a systems analyst at Deutsche Telekom, where I have been employed for four years. Following my separation, I have had to start over financially, which is why my account and savings are currently quite low.

Despite these challenges, I have maintained an excellent credit history, always repaying previous loans on time. I have no co-signers or additional debts, and I have resided at my current address in Hamburg for three years. I own a reliable Opel Astra and have no housing commitments beyond my current rent.

My steady income and track record with your bank make me confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment plan. I am committed to upholding my financial obligations and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,
Viktor Novak
