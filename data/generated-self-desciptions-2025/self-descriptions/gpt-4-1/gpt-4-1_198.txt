Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Alvarez, and I am applying for a loan of 1,382 DM to purchase a new television for my home. As a scientific research assistant at the local university, I have been employed for 2.5 years and am currently working on a long-term project in renewable energy. I am divorced and living alone, recently relocated for my job, and have been residing at my current address for just over a year.

Although I do not have a checking account and my credit history includes a critical account from a previous bank, I have learned from my past financial mistakes and am fully committed to responsible financial management. My monthly installment rate is low, and I do not have any other installment plans except for a small furniture purchase. My only asset is my car, which I use to commute to work.

I am a skilled employee with a stable income and no dependents, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. I have included my employment contract and recent pay slips as proof of my reliability. I respectfully ask you to consider my application and give me the opportunity to improve my living situation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Petra Schmidt, and I am seeking a loan of 1,382 DM to buy a radio and television set for my new apartment. I have been a government administrative official for three years and am married, supporting my family as the primary earner. We recently moved to this city for my job, and I have been living at my current address for about 14 months.

I do not currently hold a checking account, and my credit history includes an outstanding credit at another bank, which is being paid off regularly. I have no savings, but I do own a small car. My current installment obligations are manageable, and I do not have any guarantors or other debts.

As a foreign worker, I am determined to build a stable life here. I have a permanent contract, a fixed income, and a responsible track record at my workplace. I am confident that I can meet the repayment schedule and would be grateful for the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Petra Schmidt

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,382 DM for the purchase of a television and radio. My name is Anna Ivanova, and I am a married foreign worker employed as a skilled technician at Siemens for the past 1.5 years. My family and I have recently moved into a new home, and we are in need of basic appliances.

I am aware that my credit history shows a critical account at another institution, but I am in the process of resolving these issues and have been making consistent payments. I have no checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, but I do own a reliable car and have no other significant debts.

I am committed to rebuilding my financial standing and providing a good life for my family. My steady employment, low installment rate, and lack of dependents make me a responsible candidate. I hope you will give me the chance to prove my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Anna Ivanova
