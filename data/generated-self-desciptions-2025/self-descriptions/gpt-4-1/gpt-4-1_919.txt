Letter 1 – From a Retired Army Officer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 14,896 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 68-year-old retired army officer, currently residing in my own home for the past four years. I have been employed as a consultant for a security firm for the last eight years since my retirement from active service.

My financial situation is stable. While my checking and savings accounts currently show balances under 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have always maintained an excellent credit history. I have previously taken out one loan with your bank and paid it back promptly, as I take my financial obligations very seriously.

A new car is essential for me to continue supporting my dependent grandson, whom I care for full time. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no installment plans outside the bank. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate, as my pension and consulting income are steady.

I would appreciate your consideration of my application. I have always demonstrated responsibility and reliability and believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for your attention.

Sincerely,
Karl Becker

Letter 2 – From a Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 14,896 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am a single male, 68 years old, and have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the last nine years. I have lived in my own apartment for four years.

Although my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have a solid credit record, having paid off all previous loans on time. I currently have one outstanding credit with your bank, which is being paid regularly.

The car is necessary for my daily commute to the research center and to support my dependent nephew, who lives with me. My income is stable, and my employment is secure, allowing me to comfortably afford the installment rate requested.

I believe my long-standing employment and history of responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I would greatly appreciate your favorable consideration.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Best regards,
Dr. Hans Müller

Letter 3 – From a Self-Employed IT Consultant

Dear Banking Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 14,896 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 68-year-old self-employed IT consultant with over eight years in the field, and I have lived in my own house for the last four years.

My current account balances are modest (below 0 DM in checking, under 100 DM in savings), but I have an impeccable credit history, having always repaid my loans on time. I currently have one existing credit with your bank, which is being serviced without issue.

Owning a reliable car is crucial for my business, as I frequently travel to client sites and support my adult son, who is disabled and relies on me for transportation. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my income is sufficient to cover the requested installment rate.

I am confident that my track record, stable business, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Jürgen Schmidt

A new car is vital for both my work and family commitments. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my income as a bank manager is steady and reliable.
