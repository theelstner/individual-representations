Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,028 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for the past five years. My employment is stable, and I have a regular monthly income.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained two other credits here, both of which are in good standing. My current financial situation is modest, with savings of less than 100 DM and no additional installment plans. I live in my own apartment, which I acquired two years ago, and I am committed to maintaining a stable and responsible lifestyle for myself and my young daughter.

I understand my credit history shows some critical accounts with other institutions, but I have always met my obligations at your bank and am determined to improve my financial standing. I am confident that, with your support, I can furnish my home appropriately and continue to meet all repayment terms reliably.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marius Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Victor Schmidt, and I am seeking a loan of 2,028 DM to purchase equipment needed for my small carpentry workshop at home. I have been employed as an assembly line worker at RheinMetall for nearly six years, providing me with a steady income.

I am a single father to my son and have lived in my own flat for two years. Although I do not currently have a checking account at your bank, I do have two existing credits here, both of which I have managed responsibly. My savings are limited, but I hold a life insurance policy as my main asset.

While my credit history includes some critical accounts elsewhere, I have always honored my commitments with your institution. I am confident that I will be able to repay this loan on time, as my employment and housing situation are both stable.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,  
Victor Schmidt

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,028 DM to purchase basic furniture for my new apartment. My name is Ahmed Hassan, and I am a machine operator at Bavaria Textiles, where I have been employed for four and a half years.

As a single father with one dependent, my financial resources are stretched, and my savings are under 100 DM. I do not have a checking account but have two current loans at your bank, both in good order. I have no guarantors or other installment plans and live in my own apartment, which I have occupied for two years.

My credit history shows some difficulties with accounts at other banks, but I have always prioritized my obligations with your institution. With this loan, I will be able to create a comfortable home for my child and myself, and I am confident in my ability to manage the repayments.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Lending Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 2,028 DM to purchase new equipment for my home-based tailoring business. My name is Jan Kowalski, and I have worked as an unskilled resident laborer at Berlin Metro Maintenance for just over five years.

I currently reside in my own apartment and have one child to support. Although I do not have a checking account, I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I pay regularly. My savings are limited, but I do hold a building society savings agreement as my primary asset.

Despite a challenging credit history with other institutions, I have consistently met my obligations with your bank. I am committed to continuing this record and believe this loan will help me to increase my income and provide a better life for my child.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Jan Kowalski
