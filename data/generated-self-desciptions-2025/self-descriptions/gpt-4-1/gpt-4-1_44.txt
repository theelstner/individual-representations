Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,204 DM to cover urgent repairs needed on my home, which I own outright. I am a 44-year-old single father of two, working as a warehouse loader at Schenker Logistics for the past three years. My current income allows me to meet my daily expenses, but I have limited savings—less than 100 DM in my account—and my checking account balance is also under 200 DM.

In the past, I have experienced delays in repaying credit, primarily due to medical expenses for my children. However, I have since stabilized my finances and have not taken on any new debts outside of my existing credit with your bank. I have been living at my current residence for four years and have always paid my housing-related bills on time.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and have a steady job with a reputable company. I believe this loan will help me maintain the value of my property and provide a safe environment for my family. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Andreas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 6,204 DM to fund essential repairs to my property. I have been employed as a janitor at the Berlin City School District for nearly two years, and while my job provides stability, my earnings only cover basic needs for myself and my two children. My savings are minimal, with less than 100 DM in my account.

Previously, I had a delay in settling a credit payment due to a temporary loss of employment, but since then, I have maintained regular payments on my existing loan with your institution. I have no other debts or guarantors and have lived at my current address for four years.

As a property owner, I understand the importance of maintaining my home, not just for myself but for my dependents. I am confident that with your support, I can manage the installment rate and improve my family's living conditions. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Jürgen Weber

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 6,204 DM to address urgent repairs needed on my residential property. I am a 44-year-old single male, working as a night security guard at the Leipzig Industrial Park for the past year and a half. My current financial situation is modest; I have less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings.

I acknowledge there was a delay in my credit repayment history, which occurred during a difficult period when I was supporting my children alone. Since then, I have taken steps to improve my financial management and have kept up with my existing credit payments at your bank.

I own my home and have resided there for four years, which provides stability for my family. I have no additional debts or financial commitments and am dedicated to meeting my repayment obligations. I would greatly appreciate your support in granting this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Markus Richter

Letter 4

Dear Banking Committee,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,204 DM to make necessary repairs on my house. I am employed as a delivery driver for Müller & Sohn, a position I have held for three years. I am a single father with two children and have lived in my own home for four years.

My financial resources are limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am managing responsibly after having previously experienced a delay in repayment due to unforeseen family expenses.

Despite my unskilled employment status, I am a reliable and responsible individual, with a stable job and no outstanding debts beyond my current credit. I am confident that I can adhere to the proposed installment rate and repay the loan in full. Your assistance would help me secure my family’s home for the future.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Stefan Bauer

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

I am seeking approval for a loan of 6,204 DM to cover urgent repair costs for my residence. I am 44 years old, single, and the father of two dependents. I have been working as a building maintenance assistant at the Dresden Community Housing Authority for nearly two years. My income is steady, but my current account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM.

I have had a delay in my credit history, which resulted from a period of unemployment two years ago. Since securing my current job, I have made all payments on my existing credit with your bank on time and have no other installment plans or debts.

I have lived in my home for four years and am committed to maintaining it for my family. With a stable job, a fixed address, and a clear plan for repayment, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Peter Schneider
