Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,333 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Aleksandar Petrović, and I am a 43-year-old single father of two children. I have been residing at my current address for two years and own a small apartment in the city, which serves as my primary property.

Until last year, I worked as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, where I was employed for eight years before my contract ended. While I am currently unemployed, I am actively seeking new employment and have several promising interviews scheduled in the coming weeks. My previous employment demonstrates my reliability and commitment.

I have two existing credits with your bank, which I have sometimes struggled to repay on time due to my recent job loss. However, I am determined to meet all my obligations and have been in regular contact with your loan officers regarding my situation. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only dependents are my two children. I am currently living rent-free with a relative, which allows me to focus my resources on repaying my debts.

The car is essential for me to increase my mobility and expand my job search beyond public transport routes, which are limited in my area. I am confident that with a new job, I will be able to meet the installment rate without difficulty. My property ownership and long-term commitment to your bank further assure my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss this further and provide any additional documentation you may require.

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrović

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is David Mensah, and I am applying for a loan of 1,333 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. As a skilled welder with over ten years of experience, I unfortunately lost my job at the Stuttgart Shipyards last year due to company downsizing. Since then, I have been actively seeking new employment while supporting my two children as a single parent.

Although my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, I do own a small piece of real estate in my hometown, which provides some financial stability. I have lived at my current residence for two years, where I benefit from free housing provided by my brother.

I acknowledge that I have had delays in paying off previous loans, primarily due to my recent unemployment. However, I have always communicated openly with your bank and made partial payments whenever possible. I am committed to honoring all my debts and am working hard to secure new employment.

The new car is essential for commuting to potential job opportunities, especially as public transportation is unreliable in my area. With a steady job, I am confident I will be able to meet the monthly installments. I have no other debts, and my only dependents are my two children.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available to provide further information if needed.

Best regards,  
David Mensah

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,333 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am a 43-year-old single father of two, currently residing in Munich. I previously worked as an administrative official at the local government office for nine years, but I have been unemployed for the past year following department restructuring.

I have two existing credits with your bank, and while I have faced some delays in payment due to my unemployment, I have always made efforts to stay in contact and fulfill my obligations as best I can. I currently live rent-free with my aunt, allowing me to focus my limited resources on supporting my children and repaying my debts. My checking and savings accounts are currently low, but I do own a small condominium, which demonstrates my financial responsibility and stability.

The new car will be vital for me to attend job interviews, transport my children, and potentially accept job offers that require commuting. I am committed to finding new employment soon, and I am confident that I will be able to make the required installment payments once my situation improves.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am ready to provide any additional documents and discuss my application further.

Yours sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jean-Paul Koffi, a 43-year-old single male with two children. I am applying for a loan of 1,333 DM to purchase a new car, which is crucial for my job search and family responsibilities. I have a background as a skilled mechanical engineer, having worked for eight years at Siemens AG before being laid off last year due to restructuring.

I own a modest real estate property, which I believe adds to my credibility as a loan candidate. I have lived at my current address for two years, enjoying free accommodation provided by my cousin. My financial situation is currently challenging, with my checking account below zero and limited savings, but I am actively seeking new employment and have several applications pending.

While I have had some delays in repaying existing credits with your bank, these were unavoidable due to my recent unemployment. However, I have always prioritized communication with your bank and made partial payments whenever possible. I have no other debts or installment plans.

A new car will greatly enhance my ability to find and maintain a new job, especially as a foreign worker needing to reach various job sites. I am confident that my skills and determination will enable me to secure employment and meet all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Jean-Paul Koffi

Dear Loan Committee,

I am writing to apply for a 1,333 DM loan for the purchase of a new car. My name is Marco Rossi, a 43-year-old single father of two children. I was employed as an IT support specialist at a Frankfurt-based company for nine years, but have been unemployed for the past year due to the company's closure.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are low, but I do own a small house in the suburbs, which I believe provides some security for this loan. I have lived at my current residence for two years, where I do not pay rent thanks to a family arrangement. I have two existing credits with your bank, and although I have experienced delays in repayment, I have always worked to resolve these issues directly with your staff.

The new car is essential for expanding my job search and securing employment, as public transportation options are limited in my area. I am confident that once I am employed again, I will be able to make the installment payments without issue. I have no other debts, and my only dependents are my children.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide further details or references upon request.

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi
