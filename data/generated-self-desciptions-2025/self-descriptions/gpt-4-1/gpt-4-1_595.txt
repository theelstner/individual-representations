Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,718 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Anna Becker, a 20-year-old resident of Berlin, and I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik GmbH for the past 2 years. I am recently divorced and have one young child who lives with me. My current checking account balance is modest, under 200 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM.

Despite my limited savings, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back on time and in full every month. I have no other debts or installment plans and my only financial obligations are my rent and regular household expenses. I have a building society savings agreement, which further demonstrates my commitment to financial planning.

A new car is essential for me to commute to work and transport my child safely. I am confident that my steady employment, reliable payment history, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by telephone for any additional information you may require.

Kind regards,

Anna Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Müller, and I am applying for a 2,718 DM loan to finance the purchase of a new car. I am 20 years old, married, and living in Hamburg with my husband and our 2-year-old daughter. I have been working as a cleaning staff member at Nordstadt Hotel for 3 years, and my employment is stable.

Currently, my checking account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are minimal. However, I have a good credit history with your bank, having repaid my previous loan without any delays or issues. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only current credit is with your institution.

I have lived at my present address for 4 years and pay rent regularly. I also hold a life insurance policy, which provides some financial security for my family. The new car is necessary for my daily commute and to ensure my daughter can be safely transported to daycare.

I am confident that my reliable payment record, stable employment, and commitment to my financial obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am happy to discuss my application further by phone.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Sabine Müller
