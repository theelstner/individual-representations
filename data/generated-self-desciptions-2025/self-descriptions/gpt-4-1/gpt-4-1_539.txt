Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Weber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,612 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 37-year-old married woman, living with my 12-year-old son in our own apartment in Stuttgart. I have been employed as a laboratory research assistant at BioMedica GmbH for the past 8 years, and I am proud of my stable professional track record.

Currently, my checking account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM due to recent necessary expenses. I do have a life insurance policy, which provides additional security. While I have an existing credit elsewhere, I have always met my obligations, even during financially challenging times, and I maintain one small credit with your bank in good standing.

I am seeking this loan to replace worn-out furniture and to purchase a computer for my son’s schooling. I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate, as my income is steady and I have no other installment plans or debts. My good standing as a loyal customer, responsible financial behavior, and long-term employment make me a trustworthy candidate. I would be grateful for your consideration.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Sabine Braun, and I am applying for a loan of 3,612 DM to furnish my home with essential equipment. I am a 37-year-old divorced mother, residing in my own house in Mannheim for the past 4 years. I am employed as a senior administrative officer at the local city council, a position I have held for 9 years.

Although I have a critical account at another bank, I have never defaulted on any payments, and my credit with your bank is current. My checking and savings balances are low at the moment due to unexpected medical expenses for my daughter, but my employment is secure, and I have a building society savings agreement as additional collateral.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and I live responsibly within my means. My stable job, ownership of my home, and my consistent payment history make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I assure you of my commitment to meet all repayment terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Sabine Braun

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Martina Koch, a 37-year-old separated woman living in my own apartment in Düsseldorf for 4 years with my teenage son. I am currently a technical supervisor at Siemens AG, where I have worked for 8 years. I am seeking a loan of 3,612 DM to replace furniture and purchase necessary home office equipment.

My financial situation is currently tight, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, as I recently covered major home repairs. I do have a life insurance policy as an asset, and I am up to date on my one existing loan with your bank, despite having a critical account at another institution.

I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, and my employment is stable and well-compensated. I am dedicated to providing a comfortable home for my son and am confident in my ability to manage the proposed repayments responsibly. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Martina Koch
