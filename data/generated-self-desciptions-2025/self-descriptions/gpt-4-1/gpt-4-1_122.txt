Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,835 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my household. I am currently employed as a laboratory technician at Bayer AG, where I have worked for the past three years. Despite a temporary negative balance in my checking account, I have consistently managed my finances responsibly, as demonstrated by my successful repayment of two previous loans with your bank.

As a divorced woman with a young daughter, I strive to provide a stable and enriching environment for my family. My current residence, which I own, is equipped with real estate property that further supports my financial reliability. I have no other outstanding debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and my only dependent is my daughter.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3, as my stable employment and prudent budgeting allow for this expense. My financial history with your bank shows that I am a trustworthy candidate who honors her commitments. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,835 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. As a married foreign worker registered under my own name, I have been employed as a mid-level administrative official at the Stuttgart City Hall for nearly two years. My current financial situation is stable; I own my home and have no other debts or installment plans.

While my checking account is temporarily overdrawn, I have always repaid my existing credits at your bank on time and in full. My only dependent is my son, and I strive to provide him with educational and cultural resources at home, which is why this purchase is so important to me.

Given my consistent employment, ownership of real estate, and positive credit history, I am confident in my ability to make regular payments. I kindly ask you to consider my application and trust that my record demonstrates my reliability.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,  
Marta Nowak

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1,835 DM to upgrade my household with a new radio and television. I have been employed as a customer service specialist at Deutsche Telekom for the past three years. My checking account is currently below zero due to some recent unexpected expenses, but I have always paid back my credits with your bank promptly.

As a separated woman with a five-year-old child, I am solely responsible for my family’s well-being. I own my home and have no other installment plans or debts. My only asset is the real estate I possess, and I maintain a modest savings account.

Given my employment stability, positive repayment history, and responsible handling of my existing credits, I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and hope for a favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Keller
