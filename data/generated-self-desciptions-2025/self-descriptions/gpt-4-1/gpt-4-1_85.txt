Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Brigitte Schneider, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,755 DM. I have been working as a cleaning supervisor at the Berlin Municipal Hospital for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is challenging: my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, mainly due to recent medical expenses for my daughter, who is my only dependent.

Despite these setbacks, I have consistently met all my previous credit obligations with your bank, and I currently have one active credit, which I am repaying diligently. I am fortunate to own my home and a small piece of real estate inherited from my parents, which provides me with stability. My ex-husband, who is also my guarantor, is supporting me in this application.

I am seeking this loan to cover essential home repairs and to ensure a safe environment for my family. I am committed to meeting the installment rate and have always demonstrated reliability in my financial dealings. I believe my long-term employment, home ownership, and responsible payment history make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Brigitte Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Braun, and I am requesting a loan of 1,755 DM. I have been employed as a warehouse worker at the Dresden Freight Company for 9 years. I am married and have one child. My current account balance is negative due to unexpected car repairs, and my savings are minimal, under 100 DM.

I have always repaid my previous loans on time, and I currently have one credit with your bank, which I am managing responsibly. I have lived at my current address for four years, and I own my home and a small rental property, which provides additional security.

My husband is listed as my guarantor for this loan. I need these funds to pay for necessary dental treatment for myself and my son, as well as to cover some overdue utility bills. My long tenure at my job, my property ownership, and my clean credit history demonstrate my reliability and trustworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Maria Braun

Dear Bank Manager,

I am Gisela Hoffmann, a 58-year-old divorced woman, applying for a loan of 1,755 DM. I have worked as an unskilled kitchen assistant at a local school cafeteria for 8 years. My financial position is currently strained—my checking account is overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, mostly due to supporting my son through university.

I have always repaid my loans on time and have one existing credit with your bank, which is up to date. I own my residence and a small plot of land, providing me with some security. My sister has agreed to be my guarantor for this application.

I require this loan to make urgent repairs to the heating system in my house before winter. My long employment, stable residence, and history of responsible credit management make me confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Gisela Hoffmann
