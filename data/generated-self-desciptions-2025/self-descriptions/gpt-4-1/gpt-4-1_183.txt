Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a business loan of 4,455 DM to expand my small consulting firm, Becker Solutions. After working as a management consultant for eight years, I started my own company two years ago, and I have seen steady growth since. Currently, I am seeking to purchase additional office equipment and invest in marketing to reach new clients.

My current financial situation is somewhat constrained, as I have a checking account balance under 200 DM and savings below 100 DM. While I have experienced a delay in repaying a previous credit, I have since taken steps to improve my budgeting and have not missed any payments in the past year. I own my home and have real estate property as collateral, which demonstrates my commitment and stability.

I am a divorced father of one, and supporting my child is a top priority. I have two ongoing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. My employment as a management consultant has been stable for three years, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2%. I have a registered telephone and am easily reachable for any questions.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to honoring my financial obligations and believe this loan will help my business and family thrive.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Michael Schubert, a 30-year-old self-employed architect with two years of residence at my current address. I am requesting a loan of 4,455 DM to invest in specialized design software and to cover initial costs for a new commercial project I have secured.

Although my current account and savings are modest (both under 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively), I have always prioritized investing in my business. I acknowledge a previous delay in credit repayment, caused by a temporary downturn in client payments last year. Since then, I have maintained regular payments on my two existing credits with your bank.

I own my home and a small plot of land, which reflects my long-term planning and responsibility. As a divorced father with one dependent, I am determined to provide a stable future for my child. My professional reputation is solid, and my business is registered and growing.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that this loan will enable me to increase my business revenue and meet all repayment terms.

Best regards,  
Michael Schubert

Dear Credit Committee,

I am writing to apply for a 4,455 DM business loan to expand my private tutoring business. My name is Andreas Müller, and I have been a scientific research assistant for three years before transitioning to self-employment in educational services.

My financial reserves are currently limited, with a checking account below 200 DM and less than 100 DM in savings. I did experience a delay in repaying a previous loan due to unexpected family medical expenses, but I have since caught up and have maintained prompt payments on my two existing loans with your bank.

I am a 30-year-old divorced father of one, and I own both my residence and a small piece of real estate. I have no co-signers or guarantors but have a consistent income and a solid business plan for using the funds to purchase educational materials and expand my client base.

I believe my professional background, property ownership, and commitment to supporting my family make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Müller

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Stefan Richter, and I am a 30-year-old officer in a local logistics company. I am seeking a loan of 4,455 DM to open a small delivery service, which will allow me to supplement my income and support my 7-year-old daughter, who lives with me following my separation.

I have held my current position for two years and have resided at my present address for the same duration. My financial situation is currently tight, with a checking account and savings both under 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively. I did have a delay in repaying a loan last year due to an emergency, but I have since established a reliable payment record.

I own my home and a parcel of real estate, and I have two active credits with your bank, both managed responsibly. I have no additional debts or guarantors, and my installment rate is manageable.

I am committed to building a better future for my family and am confident this loan will help me achieve that goal. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Stefan Richter

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Dirk Weber, a highly qualified employee in the IT sector, and I am applying for a 4,455 DM business loan to launch a freelance web development service. I have been steadily employed for three years and have two years of residence at my current address.

Although my current account and savings are below 200 DM and 100 DM, I have invested most of my earnings into acquiring real estate and supporting my dependent son after my divorce. I have two credits with your bank, and while I once experienced a delay in repayment during a period of unemployment, I have since reestablished my financial stability.

I own my home, have a registered telephone, and am listed as a foreign worker under my name. My experience in IT and commitment to my clients have prepared me well for this new venture, and I am confident in my ability to meet all loan obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dirk Weber
