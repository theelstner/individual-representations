Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,842 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for the past 9 months. My employment is stable and offers good prospects for the future.

Although my current checking and savings account balances are low, this is due to recent relocation expenses and the cost of supporting my daughter after my divorce. I have always managed my finances responsibly, and my credit history reflects that all previous loans have been paid back promptly and in full.

A new car is essential for my daily commute and for taking my daughter to school and activities. I have no other debts or guarantors and have resided at my current address for 4 years, demonstrating my stability. I am confident that my steady employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Sabine Weiss, and I am seeking a loan of 1,842 DM to purchase a new car. I am a separated woman working as a skilled laboratory technician at BASF for the past 10 months. My employment is permanent, and I have a good standing with my employer.

My current financial reserves are limited due to legal expenses from my separation and moving costs. Nevertheless, my credit history is spotless, with all previous loans repaid on time. I have no other debts, and my only financial obligation is my monthly rent.

A new car is vital for my work schedule, as public transport is unreliable in my area. I have lived at my current address for 4 years, and I have always managed my financial responsibilities diligently. I am confident that my responsible financial management and secure job make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Weiss
