Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for an education loan of 12,612 DM to support my pursuit of a professional certification in Data Analytics at the Technical University of Munich. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for three years. 

My financial situation is stable, though modest. My checking account typically holds between 100 and 150 DM, and I have a small savings account of 300 DM. I do not own property, but I am fortunate to live rent-free in my uncle’s apartment. I have two dependents—my twin sons, aged 10. 

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always repaid on time. I have no other debts or installment plans. My credit history reflects my commitment to meeting my financial obligations. I am a responsible and dedicated individual, as shown by my steady employment and my care for my family.

This loan will allow me to further my education, improve my career prospects, and better support my children. I am confident that I will be able to repay the loan reliably, as I have done in the past.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Michael Hoffmann, and I am seeking a loan of 12,612 DM to finance my enrollment in a part-time MBA program at the University of Frankfurt. I have been working as a logistics supervisor at Deutsche Bahn for almost two years and am eager to advance in my career.

I keep a modest balance in my checking account, usually around 180 DM, and have 250 DM in a savings account. I have no property, but I reside rent-free in my parents’ house, which allows me to save more of my income. I am a single father of two teenagers.

My previous credit with your bank has been managed responsibly, with all payments made punctually. I have no other loans or installment plans, nor do I have any guarantors or co-debtors. My employment is stable, and I have been living at my current address for four years.

I am committed to personal and professional growth. Investing in my education will help me secure a better future for my family. I am trustworthy, financially responsible, and have demonstrated reliability in managing my existing credit.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Michael Hoffmann
