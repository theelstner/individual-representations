Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 4,526 DM. I am a 74-year-old single male and have been self-employed as the owner of a small accounting consultancy for the past three years. I own my own home and have real estate valued at 120,000 DM. I have lived at my current address for two years and am the sole provider for my adult son, who is currently finishing university.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I do have an existing credit with you, which I have been servicing reliably for the past 24 months. My credit history includes some critical accounts at other institutions, but I have maintained consistent payments and am committed to resolving all outstanding obligations.

The purpose of this loan is to upgrade my office equipment and expand my consultancy services to include digital bookkeeping, which will help me attract new clients and increase my revenue. My current savings are under 100 DM, but my steady income and property ownership demonstrate my financial stability. I have no other installment plans and am not supporting any other debtors.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and would be grateful for your support in helping my business grow. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Heinz Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Karl Schmidt, and I am seeking a loan of 4,526 DM for business purposes. I am a retired naval officer who has spent the last two years running a small import-export business. I have been employed in this capacity for three years. I am single, 74 years old, and have lived at my current residence for two years, which I own outright.

While I do not currently have a checking account at your institution, I do have a credit account with you that I have managed responsibly. My financial situation is stable; I have real estate assets and no other installment plans or co-debtors. My savings are limited, but my business has steady monthly revenue, and I am supporting my grandson who lives with me.

The purpose of this loan is to purchase a refrigerated delivery van, which will allow me to expand my product range and increase my business’s competitiveness. I am trustworthy and reliable, with a long history of leadership and responsibility. I respectfully request your consideration for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,  
Karl Schmidt

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a business loan of 4,526 DM. My name is Dr. Friedrich Bauer, and I am a highly qualified scientific research consultant. After a successful academic career, I started my own research advisory firm three years ago. I am 74 years old, single, and have one dependent—my daughter, who is a single mother.

I have resided at my current address for two years and own both my home and a small plot of real estate. My credit history includes some critical accounts at other banks, but I have always met my obligations with your institution. My current savings are modest, but my business is experiencing growth and requires investment in new laboratory equipment.

I believe my proven record of responsibility, property ownership, and professional reputation make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I have no other installment plans and am fully dedicated to repaying this loan as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Friedrich Bauer

Dear Bank Manager,

I have managed a small real estate agency for the past three years and have resided at my current property, which I own, for two years.

This loan is intended to finance marketing initiatives to attract new clients and modernize my agency’s operations. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but my real estate holdings and consistent business income support my financial stability. I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours faithfully,  
Hans Weber
