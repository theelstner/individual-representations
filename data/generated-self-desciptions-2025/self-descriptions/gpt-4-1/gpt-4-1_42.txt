Letter 1: Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,333 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for the past 8 years, and my current contract is ongoing. My financial situation is stable; I have a savings account with 700 DM and have never defaulted on any previous credit. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and I have always paid my existing credits on time.

I am currently single and have resided at my current address for the last 2 years. I do not own property, but I do have a car. My housing is financed through the bank, and I have only one existing credit with your institution, which is in good standing. As someone who values responsibility and financial integrity, I assure you that I will meet all repayment obligations. The new television and radio will enhance my quality of life and support my ongoing research, as I often need to keep up with scientific broadcasts and educational programs.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my stable employment, reliable credit history, and prudent financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Sincerely,
Dr. Markus Feldmann
