Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,299 DM to purchase a new television. My name is Markus Klein, and I am a 35-year-old single male currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. 

I have always managed my finances responsibly. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have a savings account with a balance of 700 DM. My credit history is excellent, with all previous loans paid back promptly and in full. I have no other debts or guarantors and have lived at my current residence for 4 years.

The television will be an important addition to my home, both for relaxation and staying informed about current events. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for considering my application.
