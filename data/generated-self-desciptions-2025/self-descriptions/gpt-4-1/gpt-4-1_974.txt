Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 1193 DM to purchase a new car. I am 29 years old, divorced, and have been living in my current rented apartment for four years. I am a foreign national who moved to Germany for better opportunities and am currently seeking employment after my contract as a warehouse assistant ended six months ago.

Although my present checking and savings accounts have less than 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have always repaid my previous two loans at your bank on time and in full. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. My co-applicant, my sister Irina, is employed full-time as a nurse and will support this application.

A new car is essential for me to expand my job search radius, including areas not well-served by public transport. I am committed to repaying the loan as I have demonstrated in the past and will prioritize this responsibility. I believe my track record with your bank and my determination to secure employment make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Amina Yusuf. I am a 29-year-old married woman living in Germany for the past five years, with my husband as my co-applicant. After being laid off from my position as a hotel cleaner eight months ago, I am currently unemployed and actively looking for new work. We have one young child.

Despite my current financial challenges, I have successfully repaid two previous loans from your bank without any issues. My checking account currently has a negative balance, and our savings are under 100 DM, but we are managing our expenses carefully. We live in a rented apartment and do not own any property.

We are applying for this loan to purchase a new car, which is crucial for me to access more job opportunities and to help with our family’s daily needs. My husband has a steady job as a delivery driver and will help ensure the loan is repaid on time. Our strong repayment history and determination to improve our situation make us reliable candidates for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Amina Yusuf

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Marta Silva. I am 29 years old, separated, and have lived at my current address for four years. I am originally from Brazil and have been in Germany for six years. I am currently unemployed after my seasonal job as a fruit picker ended, but I am actively applying for positions in retail and hospitality.

I have one dependent, my young son, and no property or telephone. My co-applicant, my cousin Ana, works as a chef and is supporting this loan request. Although my bank balance is below zero and my savings are minimal, I have always paid back my two previous loans at your bank on time.

A new car will greatly increase my chances of finding stable work, as many positions require reliable transportation. I have no other debts or installment plans. My responsible history with your bank and my co-applicant’s stable income make us trustworthy candidates.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marta Silva

Dear Loan Department,

I am Sofia Ivanova, a 29-year-old married woman with one child. I have been residing at my current rental for four years since relocating to Germany from Bulgaria. My husband, who is employed as a construction worker, is my co-applicant for this loan.

After losing my job as a cleaning staff member at a local school last year, I have been searching for new employment opportunities. Our checking and savings accounts are currently very limited, but we have managed to keep up with all our past loan repayments at your bank without any delays.

We are seeking a loan of 1193 DM to buy a new car, which is essential for both job hunting and daily family needs, as public transportation is limited in our area. We have no other installment plans or debts. Our history of responsible borrowing and my husband’s steady income make us reliable candidates for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Sofia Ivanova
