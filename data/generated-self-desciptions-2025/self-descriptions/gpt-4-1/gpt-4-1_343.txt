Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,599 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been employed as a laboratory technician at Bayer AG for 5 years, and my current contract is permanent. Although my checking and savings accounts currently have balances below 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have always managed my finances responsibly and have paid back all previous loans on time.

As a recently divorced woman, I am starting over and need to furnish my residence and purchase necessary appliances. I have no other debts or guarantors and have lived at my current address for 4 years. My only property is a reliable Opel Corsa, which I use for commuting to work. I pay rent for my apartment and have no additional installment plans except for a small payment plan for a washing machine, which is nearly complete.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. My steady employment, clean credit history, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate. I would be grateful for your support as I work to establish a comfortable and stable home environment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Katrin Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,599 DM to purchase much-needed equipment for my small home tailoring business, which I run alongside my job as a cashier at Edeka, where I have been employed for 6 years. My financial situation is currently tight, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and minimal savings, but I have a proven record of repaying previous credits without any issues.

As a married woman supporting my family, it is important to me to improve our living conditions and increase my income potential. I have no other debts or co-signers, have lived at my current address for 4 years, and own a modest Volkswagen Polo. I pay rent for our apartment and have only one remaining installment plan for a refrigerator, which will be finished in 6 months.

With my stable employment and careful budgeting, I am confident I can meet the monthly installment rate. My responsible credit history and commitment to supporting my family demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Sabine Fischer

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 3,599 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase essential household equipment. I have been working as a school secretary at the local comprehensive school for 5 years. Unfortunately, my current checking account is overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM, but I have always paid back my credits promptly and have no other debts.

As a married woman, I am moving into a new rented apartment with my husband, and we urgently need furniture and appliances. We have no guarantors and have lived at our current residence for 4 years. Our only asset is a family car, a Renault Clio, which is essential for our daily needs. We have one ongoing installment plan for a sofa, which will be repaid within the year.

Given my steady employment, responsible credit history, and strong commitment to financial obligations, I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anja Becker
