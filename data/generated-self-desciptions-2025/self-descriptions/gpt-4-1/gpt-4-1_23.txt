Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jan Novak, and I am applying for a loan of 2,647 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my household. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years, and I am proud to say that my employment is stable and my income reliable.

I am currently renting an apartment in Berlin, where I have lived for the last three years. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn, I maintain a savings account with a balance of 750 DM. I have always managed my finances responsibly and have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been paying off diligently and without delay.

As a single father of two children, I strive to provide them with educational and cultural resources, and access to television and radio is essential for their learning and development. I do not have any guarantors or other debts, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments of this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information if needed and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Jan Novak
