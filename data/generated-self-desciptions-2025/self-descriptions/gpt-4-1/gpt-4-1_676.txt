Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Saleh, and I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 2,580 DM. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for the past 10 months. I am seeking this loan to help me start a small grocery shop in my neighborhood, which I believe will serve the growing local community well.

Although I have experienced delays in repaying credit in the past, I have since taken measures to better manage my finances. I currently have one existing credit with your bank, which I am repaying diligently. My savings account holds 700 DM, and I own a small apartment building, which provides me with a stable place to live.

As a single father of two, I am committed to providing a better future for my children. I have lived at my current address for two years and have no other debts or guarantors. I am a foreign worker, but I am fully integrated and dedicated to building a stable life here.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate, as I have shown responsibility in repaying my current credit and managing my property. I am confident that my business will succeed and enable me to meet all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Saleh

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a business loan of 2,580 DM to expand my small repair service. I have been working as a janitor at a local school for 8 months, and in my spare time, I have been offering basic home repair services to neighbors. The loan will help me purchase essential tools and materials to formalize and grow my business.

I acknowledge that my credit history includes a delay in repayment from two years ago, but since then, I have taken steps to ensure timely payments, including setting up automatic deductions for my current credit with your bank. I currently have 900 DM in my savings account and own a small plot of land, which I use for additional income through seasonal farming.

I have two dependents and am committed to providing for them. Although I do not have a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly since the previous delay, and my current residence of two years offers stability. I have no other debts and no guarantors.

I am confident that with your support, I can make my business a success and fulfill my repayment obligations. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Ivan Petrov

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Luis Rodríguez, and I am seeking a loan of 2,580 DM to open a small café in my neighborhood. I have been working as a dishwasher at Café Europa for the past 11 months. I have saved 800 DM and own a small house, which I acquired after years of hard work.

I am a single father with two children and have lived at my current address for two years. Although my credit history shows a delay in payment, I have since prioritized my financial commitments and have a current loan with your bank, which I am repaying on schedule.

I have no other debts, and my only installment plan is with your bank. I am a foreign worker but have built a good reputation in my community. I believe my café will fill a gap in the local market and provide for my family.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to honoring my financial obligations and believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan.

Sincerely,
Luis Rodríguez

My credit history includes a late payment from last year, but since then, I have made every effort to pay my current bank credit on time. I have 600 DM in my savings account and own a small apartment, which gives me a stable living situation.

I am a single parent with two children, and I have lived at my present address for two years. I do not have any other debts or guarantors. As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building a better life for my family and am confident that my business idea will succeed.

I am trustworthy and responsible, as demonstrated by my commitment to my current repayment plan. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,580 DM to start a small landscaping business. My name is Samuel Mensah, and I have been employed as a groundskeeper at the city park for the past 7 months. This experience has inspired me to start my own venture, serving residential clients in the area.

My financial situation is stable, with 850 DM in savings and ownership of a small duplex. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am repaying regularly. While I had a delay in repaying credit in the past, I have learned from this and now carefully manage my finances.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, property ownership, and improved financial management. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Samuel Mensah
