Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Stefan Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 2,246 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. Despite my stable employment and steady income, I recently encountered unexpected expenses related to my dependent son's education, which have temporarily left my checking and savings accounts below 0 and 100 DM, respectively.

I currently have two credits with your bank, both of which I am managing responsibly, and I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. I own my home, have lived at my present address for three years, and hold a life insurance policy as additional security. Although my credit history reflects some difficulties, I have always maintained my commitments and am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate of 3.

I am a single father, 60 years old, and a foreign worker who has contributed consistently to the community. I kindly ask you to consider my application, as this loan will allow me to improve my living conditions and continue supporting my dependent.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am writing to request a loan of 2,246 DM for the purchase of new equipment for my home office. I have worked as a customs official at Frankfurt Airport for 9 years, demonstrating reliability and commitment in my profession. Due to a series of medical bills last year, my current account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are minimal.

I am a single man, 60 years old, with one dependent daughter. I have no co-signers or guarantors, and my only obligations are two small credits already with your bank, both of which I am servicing punctually. I own my residence and have maintained a building society savings agreement as additional security. While my credit history is not perfect, I have always repaid my debts and maintained my financial obligations.

The requested loan will enable me to upgrade my work environment, supporting both my continued employment and my family. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate and appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrov

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, a 60-year-old single man residing in Stuttgart for the past three years. I have one dependent, my nephew, who lives with me. I am employed as a skilled maintenance technician at Bosch, a position I have held for over 7 years. Unfortunately, I faced a financial setback after supporting my nephew through a medical emergency, resulting in an overdrawn account and minimal savings.

I have two active credits with your bank, both in good standing, and no additional debts or guarantors. I own my apartment and have a life insurance policy. My credit history shows some difficulties, but I have consistently honored my payment plans and am diligent with my finances.

This loan will allow me to purchase essential furniture and equipment, improving our living standards. I am committed to the agreed installment rate of 3 and am eager to demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Marek Nowak, and I am requesting a loan of 2,246 DM to replace old furniture and buy necessary equipment for my home. I have been a senior administrative officer at the University of Munich for 10 years. As a foreign worker supporting my grandson, unexpected family costs have depleted my savings and left my checking account temporarily negative.

I am single, 60 years old, and have lived at my current address for three years. I have no guarantors or other debts, and my two credits with your bank are up to date. My assets include a building society savings agreement. Although my credit history is not flawless, I have always repaid my obligations and am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate.

Your support will help me maintain a comfortable and functional home. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak
