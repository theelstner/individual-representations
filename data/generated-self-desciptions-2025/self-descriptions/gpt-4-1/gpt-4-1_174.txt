Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,064 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home and small consulting business. I am a 34-year-old divorced woman, and I have been self-employed as a freelance project manager for the past five years. However, due to a recent contract ending unexpectedly, I am currently unemployed and actively seeking new opportunities.

My current financial situation is challenging. I have less than 200 DM in my checking account and no significant savings, but I do own my home and have a life insurance policy. I have had one delay in paying off a previous loan, which was due to unforeseen medical expenses for my child, who is my sole dependent. Since then, I have managed my finances responsibly and have been making timely payments on my existing credit with your bank.

I am confident that with this loan, I can furnish my home office to restart my consulting business, which has previously provided me with a stable income. I have always valued my relationship with your bank and am committed to fulfilling my obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,064 DM for the purpose of purchasing new equipment for my home-based scientific research work. I am a 34-year-old married woman with one child, and I have been unemployed for six months after my research contract at the university was not renewed due to funding cuts.

Currently, my financial reserves are low, with less than 100 DM in my savings and checking accounts. I own my apartment and have a building society savings agreement as my only property asset. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying regularly except for a short delay last year caused by my husband’s temporary illness.

Despite my recent unemployment, I am highly qualified, with eight years of experience as a scientific research assistant. I am actively applying for new positions and freelance opportunities. This loan will enable me to replace outdated equipment, increasing my chances of securing new contracts and stabilizing my finances.

Thank you for your consideration. I assure you of my commitment to meeting all repayment obligations.

Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Eva Schneider

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 2,064 DM to purchase furniture and necessary equipment for my small legal practice, which I am currently re-establishing after a period of unemployment. I am a 34-year-old separated woman, with one dependent child, and have lived at my current residence for two years.

My current financial situation is tight, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and no significant savings. I do, however, own my home and have a life insurance policy. I have one outstanding credit with your bank, which experienced a delayed payment last year due to a gap between contracts.

As a qualified legal officer with over ten years of experience, I am confident in my ability to regain stable employment and income. The requested loan will allow me to purchase critical items for my office, enabling me to relaunch my practice and ensure financial stability for my family. I have always strived to meet my financial obligations and will continue to do so.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Sophie Müller

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Maria Weber, and I am seeking a loan of 2,064 DM to buy essential furniture and equipment for my home, which I recently purchased after my divorce. I am 34 years old, have one dependent, and have lived at my current address for two years.

I am currently unemployed, having previously held a management position at a local retail company for six years. My checking and savings accounts have less than 200 DM combined, but I have a building society savings agreement and own my home. I have one existing loan with your bank, which had a delayed payment last year due to my divorce settlement. Since then, I have paid all installments on time.

With this loan, I will be able to create a stable and comfortable home environment for myself and my child, and better focus on finding new employment. I am committed to meeting all financial obligations and maintaining a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Weber

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,064 DM to purchase equipment necessary to start a home-based accounting business. I am a 34-year-old married woman with one child, currently unemployed after my previous employer closed down.

My financial situation is modest, with less than 100 DM in both my checking and savings accounts. I have lived in my own home for two years and hold a life insurance policy.

I am a certified accountant with nine years of experience and am confident that with this investment, I can quickly re-establish my income. I have no other debts or installment plans and am determined to honor all my commitments to your institution.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
