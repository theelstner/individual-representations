Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,819 DM to fund my pursuit of a part-time Master’s degree in Business Administration at the University of Munich. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been steadily employed for the past three years and have demonstrated reliability and commitment in both my professional and personal responsibilities.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, my financial record is solid, with all previous credits paid back on time. I have minimal savings, as most of my income supports my dependent son and covers daily expenses. I reside with my parents, which allows me to save on housing costs.

My goal is to further my education to advance my career and provide a better future for my family. I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly and am confident in my ability to repay this loan through my stable employment and careful budgeting.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information you may require.

Sincerely,
Andreas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Schmitt, and I am applying for a loan of 1,819 DM to enroll in a professional certification course in IT management. I have been working as an administrative officer at the City Council of Stuttgart for nearly two years. My employment is secure, and I have a consistent income.

I am a single father supporting my 10-year-old daughter, and while I do not have a checking account or significant savings, I am proud to say that I have always paid back my previous loans on time. I do not own property but live rent-free with my brother, which helps me manage my finances effectively.

The additional qualification will enable me to seek a promotion and increase my earning potential. I am diligent and responsible, both at work and in managing my finances, and I am confident that I can meet the repayment schedule without difficulty.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Peter Schmitt

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,819 DM for the purpose of continuing my education in mechanical engineering through a specialized evening program. I am currently employed as a skilled technician at Siemens AG and have held this position for just over a year.

Although I have limited savings and do not possess a checking account, I have maintained a flawless credit history, always repaying my debts on schedule. I support my teenage son and live rent-free in my uncle’s home, which allows me to allocate more funds toward my education and family needs.

This course will significantly enhance my technical skills and career prospects. I am committed to my personal and professional growth and have demonstrated reliability in fulfilling my financial obligations. I am confident I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Dear Bank Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 1,819 DM to cover tuition and materials for a three-year advanced accounting program. For the past 18 months, I have been employed as a mid-level accountant at a regional insurance firm. My employment is stable, and I have a regular income.

I am a single parent to my 8-year-old son. While I do not have a checking account or substantial savings, I have consistently managed my previous loans responsibly, never missing a payment. I live in my family’s home without paying rent, which helps me manage my expenses.

This educational investment will allow me to secure a higher position within my company. I am organized, reliable, and fully committed to repaying this loan. I appreciate your consideration and am available for further discussion if needed.

Yours sincerely,
Thomas Klein

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Stefan Wolf, and I am applying for a loan of 1,819 DM to attend a series of continuing education workshops in logistics management. I have been a logistics coordinator at Deutsche Bahn for nearly three years and have maintained a good employment record.

As a single man with one dependent, I have limited financial resources and no checking account, but my credit history is impeccable, with all previous debts repaid on time. I live with my parents and thus do not pay for housing, which allows me to focus on supporting my child and professional development.

This loan will enable me to improve my qualifications and secure better opportunities within my company. I am responsible and financially disciplined, and I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan as agreed.

Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,
Stefan Wolf
