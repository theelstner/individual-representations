Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 958 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Jan Novak, and I am a 47-year-old single father of two children. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 6 years, and I have been living at my current address for 3 years. I am a foreign worker from Poland, but I have been residing in Germany for over a decade and have invested in real estate here.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, below 200 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM. While I have two existing credits with your bank and a critical credit history due to a delayed payment with another institution, I have since been consistent with my repayments. My employment is stable and I have no other installment plans or outstanding debts. I am requesting this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for commuting to work and supporting my children’s needs.

I am a trustworthy candidate because I own my home, have real estate assets, and have demonstrated stable employment. I am committed to meeting all installment payments on time. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jan Novak

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Mehmet Kaya, and I am applying for a loan of 958 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a single, 47-year-old resident worker with 8 years of experience as a janitor at the local school. I currently reside in my own home, which I have owned for three years. I am a Turkish citizen, working in Germany, and support two children.

Although my current account balance is under 200 DM and my savings are less than 100 DM, my steady employment and property ownership demonstrate my financial responsibility. My credit history includes some difficulties with another lender, but I have always honored my commitments to your bank, where I have two existing credits in good standing.

A new car will enable me to maintain my job and provide for my family, as public transportation is unreliable in my area. I have no guarantors or other debt obligations, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Mehmet Kaya

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 958 DM to purchase a new vehicle. My name is Viktor Ivanov, a 47-year-old single male residing in Germany for over 10 years. I work as a construction laborer and have held my current position for the past 5 years. I have two children who depend on me, and I am the sole provider for my family.

Currently, my checking account and savings are both below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively. I own my home and have some real estate holdings, which provide stability. My credit history includes a critical account with another bank, but I have maintained a good record with your institution, with two active loans that I am servicing without issue.

I require a new car to ensure reliable transportation for work and to meet my family’s needs. I have no other installment plans or debts, and I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and dedication make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov
