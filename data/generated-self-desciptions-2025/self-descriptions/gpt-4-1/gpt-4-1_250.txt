Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 1925 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 26-year-old single male, currently working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 2 years and 7 months. 

My financial situation is stable: my checking account has maintained a balance above 200 DM, and my salary has been regularly deposited for over a year. Although my savings are limited, with less than 100 DM in my savings account, I have a strong track record of repaying loans — I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have managed diligently and paid back on time. 

I own my own home, with real estate in my name, and have lived at my current address for 2 years. I have no other installment plans or debts, and no guarantors are involved. As a responsible employee and property owner, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. This loan would allow me to furnish my home and provide a better living environment for myself and my dependent younger brother.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan reliably over the next 24 months.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1925 DM to purchase equipment necessary for my home office, as I have recently started working remotely as a civil engineer with Siemens AG. I have been with the company for 3 years and 2 months, and my salary has been consistently credited to my checking account for the past year.

My financial record is solid. I have previously taken out a credit with your bank, which I repaid in full and on time. I currently have no outstanding debts or installment plans elsewhere. Although my savings are modest (less than 100 DM), I own my residence, a small apartment in Munich, and have real estate property as collateral.

As a 26-year-old single male, I support my younger cousin, who lives with me. I have lived at my current address for 2 years. I am a foreign worker from Croatia, but my long-term employment and property ownership in Germany reflect my stability and commitment.

I assure you of my reliability and look forward to your favorable consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Ivan Horvat

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1925 DM to purchase furniture and household appliances for my new apartment. I am a 26-year-old single male and have been employed as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for 1 year and 5 months. My salary is regularly deposited into my checking account, which always maintains a balance above 200 DM.

I have previously borrowed from your bank and fully repaid my existing credit without any delays. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I own my own home, which I acquired last year. My savings are under 100 DM, but my overall financial situation is stable, as I have no other financial obligations.

I have lived at my current residence for 2 years, and I am responsible for the care of my younger nephew. As a property owner with a steady job and a clean credit history, I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate over the next 24 months.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to honoring my repayment schedule.

Best regards,
Emre Yilmaz

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1925 DM to purchase essential equipment for my apartment.

Dear Loan Department,

I would like to apply for a loan of 1925 DM to buy new furniture and necessary equipment for my residence. I am a 26-year-old single male, employed as a laboratory technician at BASF for 2 years and 3 months. My salary has been consistently assigned to my checking account for over a year, which has never dropped below 200 DM.

My credit history is impeccable. I have one existing loan with your bank, which I have repaid promptly and in full. I own my home, a small townhouse in Ludwigshafen, and have lived there for 2 years. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My savings are under 100 DM, but I have no other financial burdens.

I am responsible for my teenage cousin, who lives with me. As a foreign worker from Poland, I have made Germany my home and am committed to maintaining my good financial standing. I am confident that I can meet the monthly repayments over the 24-month term.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Marek Nowak
