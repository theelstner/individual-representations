Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Weber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,972 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 5 years. My current financial situation is stable; I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time, and I have no other debts or installment plans. My savings are minimal, under 100 DM, as I have been supporting my 4-year-old son since my separation.

Although I do not have a checking account, I maintain a building society savings agreement and have always managed my finances responsibly. My current residence has been my home for the past 4 years, and I pay rent promptly every month. I am committed to maintaining a good credit relationship and assure you of my reliability and dedication to meeting my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Weber
