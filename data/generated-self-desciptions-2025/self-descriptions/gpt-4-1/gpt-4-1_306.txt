Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 10,127 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for three years. My financial situation is stable: I have a savings account with a balance of 700 DM and a single existing credit, which is in good standing, though not with your bank. I do not own property, but I have been residing at my current address for two years and benefit from free housing provided by my employer.

As a single father to my 10-year-old son, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities. My current vehicle is unreliable, and a new car will ensure I can meet my professional obligations and care for my child effectively.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained my existing credit responsibly. I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate, and I have no other debts or guarantors. My long-term employment, stable living situation, and dedication to my work make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 10,127 DM to purchase a new car. As a foreign worker from Poland, I have been employed as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for the past two years. My income is steady, and I have a savings account with 600 DM. I currently have one other credit, which is being serviced punctually, though not at your institution.

I have no property but live rent-free in a company-provided apartment. I do not have a checking account with your bank, but I have maintained my financial commitments and have no outstanding debts or guarantors. My son, aged 13, depends on me, and reliable transportation is crucial for both my commute and his school activities.

Given my stable employment, consistent residency, and responsible credit behavior, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan. I am committed to making all payments on time and look forward to the opportunity to work with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Marek Nowak

Letter 3

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 10,127 DM to buy a new car, which is essential for my job as a senior laboratory technician at Siemens, where I have been employed for nearly four years. I currently have a savings account with 800 DM and one existing credit (not with your bank), which is up to date.

I am single with a 9-year-old son and have been living at my current address for two years, with free housing provided by my employer. I do not own any property. Reliable transport is necessary for my shift work, and public transport is not an option during late hours.

Despite not having a checking account at your bank, I have a solid record of managing my finances responsibly. My steady employment, responsible credit history, and family obligations make me a dependable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further questions.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Zielinski

Dear Bank Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 10,127 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been working as an IT support specialist at BASF for three years. My savings account currently holds 900 DM, and I have one existing credit with another bank, which I am paying regularly.

As a foreign worker, I have lived at my current residence for two years, with free accommodation provided as part of my employment package. I am a single father to a 12-year-old son. Reliable transportation is crucial for both my daily commute and my son's activities.

Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, my employment is stable, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate and fulfill all obligations of the loan.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Mihail Ivanov

Letter 5

Dear Loan Committee,

I am writing to request a loan of 10,127 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. I am a foreign worker from Turkey, employed as a skilled machinist at BMW for the past two and a half years. I have a savings account with 500 DM and one active credit with a different bank, which I am servicing without issue.

I am single, supporting my 11-year-old son, and have been living rent-free at my current address for two years. I do not own property, nor do I have a checking account with your institution. I have no co-signers or additional debts.

A new car is essential for my work schedule and family needs, as public transportation does not cover my shift times. My stable job, consistent residency, and history of responsible credit management reflect my reliability and commitment.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am available to discuss my application further at your convenience.

Sincerely,  
Ahmet Demir
