Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,611 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich for the past 8 years, where I have maintained a stable and satisfactory position. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I am repaying on time and in full. My financial situation is stable, with my main asset being the house I own in which I have lived for the past 3 years.

My savings are limited at the moment, as I have been investing in my child’s education and supporting my family, but my consistent employment and reliable income ensure that I am capable of meeting the installment payments. My wife will be my co-applicant, further strengthening our application. I understand that my credit history includes some critical accounts elsewhere, but I have always honored my commitments at your institution.

I am committed to managing my finances responsibly and believe that this purchase will improve my family’s quality of life. I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide further documentation if required.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Dr. Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 2,611 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my household. I have worked as a customs official at the city port for the past 10 years, providing me with a steady income. My wife will act as co-applicant on this loan. Though I do not have a checking account, I have two other credits with your bank, both in good standing.

My current financial situation is modest, with savings under 100 DM, as I have recently covered some medical expenses for my son. Nonetheless, I own my home and have been residing there for 3 years. My employment is secure, and I have no other installment plans outside of those with your bank.

As a foreign worker who has integrated into the community, I am committed to fulfilling my obligations. I have always made timely payments and am confident in my ability to do so for this loan as well.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Marek Nowak

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 2,611 DM to purchase a television for my family. I have been employed as a senior electrician at Siemens AG for 9 years. While I do not currently hold a checking account, I have two active credits with your bank, both of which are up to date.

My property—a house which I own and where I have lived for 3 years—serves as my primary asset. My savings are currently below 100 DM due to recent home renovations. My wife, who is also employed, will be my co-applicant. Our combined incomes provide a secure basis for regular installment payments.

Despite a challenging credit history with other lenders, I have always been a reliable client at your bank. I am committed to maintaining this trust and meeting my financial obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic
