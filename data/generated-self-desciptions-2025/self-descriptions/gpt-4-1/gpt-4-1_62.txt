Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Schneider, and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,391 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past three years. My wife and I live in our own home, and we have a two-year-old daughter. 

The purpose of this loan is to help me launch a small home-based consulting business in environmental data analysis, an area in which I have considerable expertise. My current checking account balance is modest (around 150 DM), and my savings are below 100 DM, as most of my income is dedicated to supporting my family and our home. 

I have a strong credit history, having paid back my existing credit at your bank on time and in full. I own a small piece of real estate in Dresden, which provides stability and security. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am diligent with my financial obligations. 

Given my steady employment, responsible financial management, and clear business plan, I am confident I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to making all repayments on time and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Markus Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am seeking a loan of 1,391 DM to expand my small woodworking business. I am 27 years old, married, and a proud father of a three-year-old son. I have been employed as a skilled machine technician at Siemens for two years and have owned my home in Leipzig for just over a year.

My financial situation is stable, with a checking account balance under 200 DM and minimal savings, as I have recently invested in my property and my son’s education. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time. I have no other debts or obligations.

I am requesting this loan to purchase new equipment that will allow me to take on larger contracts and increase my business’s profitability. I am responsible and careful with my finances, as demonstrated by my credit history and my commitment to supporting my family.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that with your support, my business will thrive, and I will fulfill all loan obligations punctually.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker
