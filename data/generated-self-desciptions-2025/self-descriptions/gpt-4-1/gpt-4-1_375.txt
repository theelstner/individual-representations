Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Peter Klein, and I am writing to apply for a car loan of €13,756 to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a Senior Research Analyst at the German Aerospace Center for the past 8 years. As a single father supporting my son, reliable transportation is crucial for both my work and family obligations.

Although I do not currently hold a checking or savings account, I have maintained my employment and residence for several years, demonstrating my stability. My only other credit is a small education loan from another institution, which I have been repaying regularly. I do not own any property and live rent-free in a family-owned apartment.

I am committed to responsible financial management and have consistently honored my financial commitments. My long tenure at a reputable institution and my steady income assure you of my ability to meet the installment payments. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,  
Peter Klein
