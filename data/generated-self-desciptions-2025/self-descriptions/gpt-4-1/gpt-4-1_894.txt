Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,171 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Jens Müller, I am 38 years old, and I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Berlin Logistics GmbH for the past three years. I am a single father with one dependent son, and we have been living in our own apartment in Berlin for the last four years.

My current financial situation is somewhat strained, as my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM. I have two existing credits at your bank, which I have been repaying regularly, and I have a building society savings agreement as my property asset. I also have other credits with a different bank, but I am managing all my payments diligently.

The reason I am applying for this loan is that my current vehicle broke down beyond repair, and I need a reliable car to commute to work and take my son to school. I am confident that with my steady employment and responsible payment history, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The new car will not only secure my employment but also improve our quality of life.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jens Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am requesting a loan of 2,171 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am 38 years old and have been employed as a janitor at City Residential Services for nearly two years. I own my apartment, where I have lived for four years, and I am a single man supporting my young daughter.

Currently, my financial situation is tight, as my checking account is in the negative and my savings are minimal. I do have two active credits with your bank and a small life insurance policy. I also have a critical account status due to past difficulties, but I have never missed an installment on my existing loans, including those from another bank.

Having a reliable car is essential for my job, which often requires early morning and late evening shifts when public transport is unavailable. I am committed to fulfilling all my financial obligations, and my consistent employment and responsible repayment record demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a 2,171 DM loan to purchase a new car. My name is Michael Scholz, a 38-year-old single father residing in my own home in Leipzig for four years. I am currently employed as a hospital porter at St. Georg Hospital, where I have worked for just over a year.

My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM. I have two existing credits with your bank and a building society savings agreement. My credit history includes a critical account and some credits at other banks, but I have always prioritized my loan repayments.

A new car is necessary for me to maintain punctuality at work and to care for my son, as public transportation does not cover our schedule. I am confident that my steady employment, history of loan repayment, and property ownership make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Michael Scholz

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Erik Wagner, and I am seeking a loan of 2,171 DM to buy a new car. I am 38 years old, single, and have one child. I have lived in my own apartment in Hamburg for four years and am employed as a sanitation worker at Nordstadt Services, where I have worked for almost three years.

My financial situation is currently under pressure, with my checking account below zero and less than 100 DM in savings. I have two existing loans with your bank and a building society savings contract. My credit history is marked as critical due to previous financial challenges, but I have always met my installment obligations, including those from another bank.

A reliable car is vital for my job, which requires travel to various sites across the city. I am dedicated to my work and my family, and my payment history reflects my responsibility. I am confident in my ability to meet the new loan’s terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Erik Wagner
