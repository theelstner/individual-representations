Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 674 DM to purchase a new television for my family. As a scientific research assistant at the local university, I have been employed for the past 5 years, and my contract is stable. I am currently 20 years old, married, and have one child. I have been living at my current address for just over a year, and we own our home, which gives us a stable living situation.

My financial situation is modest; my checking account is currently overdrawn, but I have 250 DM in a building society savings agreement. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid back on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and no guarantors.

I am a responsible borrower, as demonstrated by my timely repayments and my commitment to supporting my family. This loan would allow us to purchase a television, which is important for both entertainment and educational purposes for my child. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Mihail Petrescu

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 674 DM to buy a new radio and television set for my household. I am a 20-year-old married man with one dependent, working as a customs official for the past 6 years. My employment is secure, and I take pride in my reliability at work.

Though my checking account is currently in the negative, I have 400 DM saved in a life insurance policy. I have already paid off a previous credit with your bank on schedule, which I believe demonstrates my trustworthiness. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

Having recently moved into our own home, I want to make sure my family has access to news and entertainment. I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate of 4, given my steady income and history of responsible financial management.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Andrej Novak

To Whom It May Concern,

I am submitting this letter as part of my application for a 674 DM loan to purchase a radio and television. I am 20 years old, married, and have a young child. I have been working as a skilled electrical technician at Siemens for 4 years, and my employment is stable and ongoing.

While my current account is slightly overdrawn, I maintain 150 DM in a building society savings plan. I have a history of responsible credit use, having paid back my only previous loan with your bank on time and in full. I have no other debts or installment commitments.

We have recently moved into our own house, and a radio/television is an essential household item for us. My financial discipline, stable employment, and previous positive credit history make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jürgen Schneider

We have been living in our own house for a year, and providing my family with access to information and entertainment is important to me. My stable job, history of reliable repayments, and modest savings show that I am a trustworthy borrower.
