Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,966 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for nine months. My employment is stable, and I have every intention of remaining with the institute for the foreseeable future.

My current financial situation is modest. My checking account balance is 120 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I do not have any other debts, and my previous credit commitments have all been paid back on time and in full. I have resided at my present address for three years and have no dependents.

Owning a reliable car is essential for my daily commute and field research trips. I have carefully calculated the installment rate at 2, which fits comfortably within my monthly budget. I believe my consistent credit history and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Martin Schulte

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 7,966 DM to purchase a used vehicle, which is crucial for my work as a logistics coordinator at Schenker AG. I began my current position ten months ago after completing a technical diploma, and it has provided me with a reliable income.

My finances are currently limited, with under 200 DM in my checking account and less than 100 DM in savings. I have no other outstanding debts or financial obligations, and my previous credit was repaid promptly. I have lived at my current residence for three years.

Reliable transportation is essential for my job, as I often need to visit client sites and manage supply chains in person. I have chosen an affordable installment rate and have no other installment plans that could interfere with repayment. My stable employment and responsible financial behavior make me a dependable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Peter Hoffmann
