Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jan Kowalski, and I am applying for a loan of 3,149 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am 22 years old, originally from Poland, and have been living in Germany for the past year. I currently work as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute, a position I started ten months ago. My employment is stable, and I have a contract for the next two years.

Although my current checking account balance is below zero and my savings are limited, I have a solid credit history. I have previously taken a loan from your bank and have paid it back diligently and on time. I have no other debts or guarantors and am not supporting anyone else financially except my younger brother, who lives with me.

I reside for free in university housing, which allows me to manage my monthly expenses effectively. I am committed to repaying this loan on schedule, as I have demonstrated with my previous credit. I believe my responsible financial behavior and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jan Kowalski

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, a 22-year-old Turkish national working as an IT support specialist at Siemens AG since August last year. I am writing to request a loan of 3,149 DM to purchase necessary furniture and a laptop for my home office. As I recently moved to Munich for this job, I currently have minimal savings and my checking account is in overdraft.

I have one previous credit with your bank, which I repaid fully and on time. My financial obligations are limited, with no other debts or installment plans besides this application. I live rent-free in a family-owned apartment, which helps me keep my monthly costs low. I also support my younger sister, who is studying in Germany.

Given my steady employment, excellent credit repayment history, and low living expenses, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,149 DM to furnish my new residence and purchase some work equipment. My name is Luis Fernandez, I am 22 years old and have been employed as a junior civil servant at the Stuttgart City Administration for the past eleven months. I moved to Germany from Spain last year and have since worked hard to establish myself.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM, as my move required significant initial expenses. I have no property or other significant assets. However, I have previously taken a credit from your bank, which I repaid in full and on time, demonstrating my reliability.

I live rent-free in a relative’s home and have only one dependent, my younger cousin, whom I support. My stable income and history of responsible credit management make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Luis Fernandez

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, a 22-year-old Bulgarian citizen, and I am requesting a loan of 3,149 DM for purchasing furniture and essential equipment for my apartment. I have been employed as a skilled machinist at BMW in Leipzig for the past nine months. I moved to Germany last year and have since worked diligently to build my life here.

Due to my recent relocation and the costs involved, my checking and savings accounts are currently below zero and 100 DM, respectively. However, I have maintained an excellent credit record, with my previous loan at your bank fully repaid and no other outstanding debts.

I live for free in a company-provided apartment and am responsible for my younger brother, who lives with me. My job security, history of timely repayments, and low living expenses ensure I can manage the proposed installments without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrov
