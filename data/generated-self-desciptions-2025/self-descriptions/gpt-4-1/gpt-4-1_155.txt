Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 7,758 DM to purchase a used car. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years, and I am currently renting an apartment in Berlin, where I have lived for four years with my young daughter.

I am seeking this loan to replace my current vehicle, which has become unreliable and is essential for my daily commute and transporting my child. My financial situation is stable: I have a savings account with over 1,500 DM and have maintained my existing credit responsibly. Although my checking account balance is modest, I have no other outstanding installment plans and only one existing credit at this bank.

As a divorced woman, I am solely responsible for my dependent, and I take my financial obligations very seriously. My long-term employment and consistent payment history demonstrate my reliability. I am confident that I can manage the installment rate without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am writing to request a car loan of 7,758 DM. I am a foreign worker from Bulgaria, currently employed as a certified medical technician at Charité Hospital in Berlin for the past nine years. I have one child and have been living in my current rented apartment for four years.

My need for a dependable used car arises from my shift work and the necessity to commute at odd hours, often when public transport is unavailable. My savings exceed 1,200 DM, and I have always managed my finances responsibly, despite having a critical account history due to a previous loan at another bank, which is now in good standing.

I have no guarantors or other debts and only one existing credit at your bank. My employment is stable, and I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations. I hope my consistent work record and responsible financial management assure you of my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Elena Petrova

While my credit history includes a critical account, I have no other installment plans, and my current installment rate is manageable. I am confident in my ability to meet repayment terms due to my stable employment and careful budgeting.

Kind regards,
