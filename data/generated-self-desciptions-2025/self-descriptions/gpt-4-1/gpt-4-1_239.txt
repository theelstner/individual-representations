Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,767 DM. I am currently employed as a warehouse supervisor at Müller Logistics, where I have worked diligently for the past 8 years. My financial record is solid: I have always repaid my previous credits on time, demonstrating my reliability and commitment.

I am seeking this loan to expand my small auto parts reselling business, which I started two years ago. My current checking account balance is modest (around 150 DM), and I have savings of 350 DM. While I am divorced and supporting my son, I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. I have lived at my current address for 2 years and own a used Opel Astra, which serves as my main asset.

My regular salary and prudent spending habits ensure I can meet the monthly installment rate of 4. I am confident that this investment will help my business grow and allow me to repay the loan comfortably. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Jürgen Hoffmann
