Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,622 DM to support the expansion of my small electronics repair shop, "TechFix," located in central Stuttgart. I have been employed as a certified electronics technician for the past three years and have successfully managed my business operations during this time. 

My current financial situation is stable: I have a checking account balance of 180 DM and savings of 250 DM. I have no outstanding debts or other financial obligations. I have a history of responsible borrowing, having repaid all previous credits on time, including a recent equipment loan from your bank. 

The purpose of this loan is to purchase additional diagnostic equipment and hire a part-time assistant, which will allow me to increase my service capacity and revenue. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 4, as my business has shown consistent growth over the past two years.

I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my current residence for four years. I own a reliable car, which I use for business purposes. I am reachable by telephone at all times and am committed to upholding my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Thomas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Müller, and I am seeking a business loan of 2,622 DM to invest in my freelance graphic design business. I have been a scientific research assistant at the local university for two years and have built a side business designing materials for academic conferences and startups.

Currently, my checking account holds 120 DM, and I have 320 DM in a savings account. I have no other debts and have always paid back any previous loans on schedule, including a student loan I repaid in full last year. 

The funds from this loan will be used to upgrade my computer and design software, enabling me to take on more clients and increase my income. My current monthly income comfortably covers the proposed installment rate, and I have a proven record of financial responsibility.

I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my current address for four years. I do not have other installment plans and own a car, which is my main asset. My employment is stable, and I am committed to making timely payments.

Thank you for your consideration. I am confident I will be a reliable borrower.

Best regards,
Jens Müller
