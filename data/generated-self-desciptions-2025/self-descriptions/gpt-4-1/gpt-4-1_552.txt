Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 996 euros to cover essential repairs to my home. I am a 23-year-old divorced woman, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past five years. Though I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I own my own home and have resided there for the past four years.

My financial situation is stable: I have a steady monthly income from my employment, and I have no guarantors or other debt obligations outside of two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have been paying diligently. I have one dependent, my young son, and I am committed to providing him with a safe and well-maintained home. While my credit history includes some critical accounts, I have made significant progress in managing my finances responsibly.

As a foreign worker in Germany, I understand the importance of building trust with financial institutions. I am committed to meeting all my repayment obligations, as demonstrated by my track record with your bank. I would be grateful for the opportunity to continue improving my home and my family's quality of life with your support.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovacs

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrescu, and I am seeking a loan of 996 euros to fund urgent repairs to my property. I am a 23-year-old married woman, and I have worked as a customs officer at the Frankfurt Airport for nearly six years. I have lived in my own home for four years, and I have one child.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have managed my finances prudently and do not have any other installment plans or guarantors. My current credit history reflects past challenges, but I have consistently met my obligations on two credits I hold with your bank. My salary is reliable, and my employment is secure.

The repairs are necessary to maintain the safety and value of my property. I am committed to fulfilling the installment rate of 4, and I am confident in my ability to manage this responsibility. As a foreign worker, I am eager to continue building my creditworthiness and relationship with your institution.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Elena Petrescu

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 996 euros to finance essential repairs to my house. My name is Sofiya Ivanova, a separated woman of 23, and I have been working as a registered nurse at St. Joseph's Hospital for four and a half years. I have been living in my own residence for four years and have a young daughter who depends on me.

I am committed to making timely payments and maintaining a positive relationship with your bank. This loan will help ensure my home remains a safe place for my family. I appreciate your consideration and trust in my ability to repay.

Sincerely,
Sofiya Ivanova
