Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a personal loan in the amount of 2,892 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 8 years, and my salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account with your bank for over a year. 

As a divorced father with one dependent, I am currently living in a company-provided apartment, which allows me to save on housing costs. My credit history with your bank is excellent; I have previously taken out a loan with you and have made all payments promptly and in full. I currently have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

Although my savings are modest, I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan. My stable employment, history of responsible repayment, and ongoing relationship with your bank make me a trustworthy candidate. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Peter Novak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,892 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment after my recent separation. I am a 51-year-old electrician, employed at Siemens AG for the past 10 years. My salary has been reliably paid into my account at your bank for more than a year.

I have one dependent, my teenage son, who lives with me part-time. My credit history is clean, with all past loans repaid on schedule. I do not own property but have stable, cost-free housing provided through my employer.

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am servicing without issue. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but my steady income and responsible financial history ensure I can meet the installment rate of 3. I am committed to honoring all financial obligations and would appreciate your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Miroslav Petrovic

As a divorced foreign worker living in Germany, I am grateful for the free accommodation provided by my employer. I have one dependent child, and I am solely responsible for his care. My previous credit from your bank was paid off ahead of schedule, and I currently have no other debts.

Though my savings are limited, I have demonstrated financial responsibility and stability throughout my career. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan and will continue to prioritize timely repayments.
