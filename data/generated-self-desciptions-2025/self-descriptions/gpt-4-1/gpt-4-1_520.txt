Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger and I am applying for a loan of 1,203 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I have been living at my current residence in Stuttgart for 2 years. I am a single father with one dependent, and I own my home.

My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have a building society savings agreement with a balance of 300 DM. I have always paid back my existing credits on time, and I have one active credit with your bank, which is being paid regularly. I do not have any other debts or installment plans.

Reliable transportation is essential for my work, as I often need to visit partner universities and laboratories across the region. My current car has become unreliable and costly to maintain, making a new vehicle necessary for my professional commitments and my responsibilities as a parent.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, given my stable employment, steady income, and responsible financial history. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you very much for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,203 DM to purchase a new car. I have worked as a customs officer at the Frankfurt Airport for the past 9 years. I currently own my apartment, where I have resided for 2 years, and I live with my teenage son.

My checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent medical expenses for my son, but I have 450 DM in a life insurance savings policy. I have never missed a loan payment, and I currently have one credit with your bank, which is up to date. I have no other debts or installment plans.

A new car will enable me to reliably commute to work, especially during early and late shifts when public transportation is unavailable. My financial situation is stable, and my employment is secure.

I am committed to meeting my financial obligations and have a proven record of doing so. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Markus Klein

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Jens Hoffmann, and I am seeking a loan of 1,203 DM to buy a new car. I have been a logistics supervisor at Schenker AG for 8 years and have lived in my own house in Hannover for 2 years with my son.

Although my checking account is currently negative, I have 200 DM in a building society savings agreement. I have always paid back my previous credits on time and have one active credit with your bank, which is in good standing. I have no other debts or installment plans.

My current car broke down beyond repair last month, and I urgently need a new vehicle to manage both my work responsibilities and my son’s school commute. My job is stable, and I have a steady income.

I am responsible and have a long-standing relationship with your bank. I hope you will support me in this important purchase.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jens Hoffmann
