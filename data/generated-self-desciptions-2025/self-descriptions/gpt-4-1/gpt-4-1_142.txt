Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 709 DM to purchase a new car. I have maintained my checking account with your bank for over a year, with an average balance consistently above 200 DM, and I have diligently paid off a previous credit with you. 

Until recently, I worked as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, but I am currently seeking new employment. My wife and I own our home, and I also have a savings account with over 1,000 DM. We have one young child, and a reliable car is essential for both my job search and family needs.

My financial record reflects responsibility—no overdue debts, and all prior obligations met on time. I have no other installment plans or debts, and my property provides additional security. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment rate of 2 DM per month without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Uwe Schneider, and I am applying for a loan of 709 DM to purchase a new car. I have been a client at your bank for more than a year, with regular salary deposits into my checking account. My previous credit with your institution was fully repaid on schedule.

I was employed as a construction laborer at BauTeam GmbH until three months ago, and I am currently looking for new work. As a widower with a six-year-old son, reliable transportation is crucial for attending job interviews and managing daily responsibilities. My savings account holds over 1,000 DM, and I own my home, which gives me a stable financial foundation.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and my credit history is clean. I am confident that my property and savings, along with my repayment record, make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Uwe Schneider

My name is Peter Lange, and I am requesting a loan of 709 DM to purchase a new vehicle. For the past year, I have maintained a checking account with your bank, always with a balance above 200 DM and regular salary assignments. My previous credit with you was repaid promptly.

Despite my current employment status, I have managed my finances responsibly, with no outstanding debts or additional installment plans. I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 2 DM per month and am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
