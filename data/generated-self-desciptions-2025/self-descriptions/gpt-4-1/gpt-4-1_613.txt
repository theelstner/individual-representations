Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1240 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a cleaning assistant at St. Mary’s Hospital for the past 8 years and have lived at my current residence for 4 years. As a divorced mother of two, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and my children’s needs.

My current checking account has consistently maintained a balance above 200 DM, and my salary has been deposited there for over a year. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. I have no other debts or installment plans. My savings account currently holds 250 DM.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan due to my stable employment and careful financial management. My housing is provided free of charge by my employer, reducing my monthly expenses. I am committed to maintaining my good credit history and fulfilling my obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Novak
