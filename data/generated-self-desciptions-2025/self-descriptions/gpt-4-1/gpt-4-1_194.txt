Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 3,915 DM to support the expansion of my small electronics repair shop in Düsseldorf. I have been steadily employed as a scientific research assistant at a local university for the past 2 years, and I have successfully managed my personal finances, with all previous credits paid back on time. My current checking account balance is modest (approximately 150 DM), and my savings are below 100 DM, as I have reinvested most of my earnings into my business.

This loan will allow me to purchase essential new equipment and hire an additional technician, which will significantly increase my shop’s capacity and revenue. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my installment rate is well within my means. I have resided at my current address for 2 years, and I own a reliable car that I use for business purposes.

As a single, skilled employee and a foreign worker, I am committed to building a successful future here. My consistent employment history and responsible credit record demonstrate my reliability. I am confident that I will meet all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am seeking a business loan of 3,915 DM to launch a mobile food cart in Frankfurt. I have been employed for 3 years as a certified auto mechanic at a reputable workshop, which has provided me with valuable customer service and management experience. My checking account currently holds about 80 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM, as I have invested in preliminary business expenses.

My credit history is positive, with all previous obligations paid in full and on time. I have been living in my current apartment for 2 years, and I own a small van, which will be used for the food cart business. I have no other loans or installment plans except for a manageable 36-month payment on some essential kitchen equipment.

As a single male and a foreign worker, I am motivated to contribute to the local community and create job opportunities. My steady employment, responsible financial behavior, and clear business plan make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Tomasz Nowak
