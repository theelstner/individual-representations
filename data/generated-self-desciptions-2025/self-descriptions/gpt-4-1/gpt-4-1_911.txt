Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,195 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently working as a hotel housekeeping supervisor, a position I have held for three years. My present financial situation is stable: although my checking account balance is below 200 DM, I have consistently paid back all my existing credits on time. I have no savings account at this time, but I own a small apartment where I reside with my 10-year-old daughter.

As a divorced woman and sole provider, reliable transportation is crucial for both my work and my family. My current car has become unreliable, and a new vehicle will ensure I can continue to fulfill my job responsibilities and care for my daughter. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and I have been residing at my current address for two years.

My history with your bank is positive; I have one existing credit that I have managed responsibly. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and would be grateful for your support in helping me secure a new car for my family’s needs.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Novak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,195 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at EuroLogistics GmbH for nearly two years. My checking account balance is currently modest, but I have always paid my previous credit with your bank on time and in full.

As a married woman with one dependent, I am the primary driver in our household. My husband works irregular hours, so a reliable car is essential for commuting and managing our family’s daily needs. We own our home, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

Although I do not have a savings account, I am diligent in managing my finances, as demonstrated by my clean credit history and responsible repayment record. I have lived at my current residence for two years, and our only property is our family home.

I am committed to meeting the loan installment requirements and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,  
Miriam Stein

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Lucia Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 3,195 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a cleaning staff member at a local hospital for just over a year. While my current checking account balance is less than 200 DM and I do not have a savings account, I have never missed a payment on my existing credit with your bank.

As a separated woman and mother to a 7-year-old son, dependable transportation is vital to maintain my job and provide for my family. I own a small apartment and have lived there for two years. There are no other debts or installment plans in my name, and I have no guarantors.

Despite my status as an unskilled worker and foreign resident, I have demonstrated financial reliability and a strong work ethic. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and would be grateful for your support in helping me secure a new vehicle.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Lucia Petrova

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to apply for a 3,195 DM loan to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a cafeteria assistant at the local community college, a position I have held for almost three years. My checking account balance is modest, and I do not have a savings account, but I have always repaid my previous credit with your bank on time.

As a married woman with one child, my family depends on me for transportation to school and work. Our home is owned, and I have lived here for the past two years. There are no other debts or installment plans in my name, and I have never required a guarantor.

Although I am classified as an unskilled worker, I am a responsible borrower with a proven record of meeting financial obligations. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments for this loan and hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,  
Sabine Bauer
