Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,919 DM to purchase essential furniture for my new apartment. As a scientific research assistant with 5 years of employment at the Max Planck Institute, I have a stable income and a reputable position. My current financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings, as I recently moved to Germany and have been supporting myself while settling in.

Although I have a critical account and other credits at different banks due to my recent relocation, I have always maintained timely payments and can provide references from my previous bank. I am single, have no dependents, and my only significant asset is my car. I have been living at my current address for 3 years and am committed to building my life here.

I am confident in my ability to manage the installment payments, as my steady employment and lack of other financial obligations ensure a reliable repayment plan. I am trustworthy, responsible, and eager to establish a positive banking relationship with you.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Al-Masri, and I am applying for a 1,919 DM loan to purchase equipment necessary for my work as an electrical engineer. For the past 6 years, I have been employed at Siemens AG, where I have built a solid reputation for reliability and professionalism.

Due to recent expenses related to moving and setting up a new home, my current account balance is under 200 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I am a single foreign worker, and while I have an existing credit at another bank, I have never missed a payment. My car is my primary asset, and I have been renting my current apartment for 3 years.

I have no guarantors or dependents, and my installment rate is manageable within my current budget. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and maintaining my excellent credit record. I hope to demonstrate my reliability and look forward to a positive response.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Al-Masri

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,919 DM to buy furniture for my new residence. I am a skilled employee working as a logistics coordinator at DHL, with over 4 years of continuous employment. My financial reserves are currently low, with less than 200 DM in my account and minimal savings, as I have recently relocated for work.

I do have other credits, but not at your bank, and my payment history is strong despite a previously critical account status. I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my present address for 3 years. My only property is my car, which I use for commuting.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my income is stable and my expenses are carefully managed. I seek this loan to improve my living conditions and demonstrate my trustworthiness as a customer.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Lucas Schmidt

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,919 DM to furnish my new apartment. I am a foreign worker from Poland, employed as a technical specialist at Bosch for the past 5 years. My current account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are limited, as I have recently moved to Germany and covered all associated costs myself.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as I have a stable job and no other major financial commitments. I am committed to building a strong credit history with your bank and hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time.

Yours sincerely,
