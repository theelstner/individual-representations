Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,965 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. My name is Thomas Becker, and I am a 32-year-old single male currently working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute. I have been employed in this position for 10 months and have a stable monthly income. 

My financial situation is modest. My checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, as I have recently moved to Munich for work and had to cover relocation expenses. However, I have a strong credit history, having always repaid previous loans on time. I do not have any other debts or guarantors. 

I have been living at my current address for three years and own a car, which I use for commuting. My job security is high, and I am committed to fulfilling my obligations. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments, as my employment is stable and my expenses are carefully managed. 

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Schneider, and I am requesting a loan of 3,965 DM to purchase a high-quality radio and television for my new apartment. I am a 29-year-old single male employed as a junior civil servant at the City Administration Office in Hamburg, a position I have held for the past 8 months. 

Currently, my financial resources are limited. My checking account is slightly below zero, and my savings are minimal, as I have been supporting my younger brother through university. Despite this, I have always repaid my existing credits promptly and have maintained a good credit record. 

I have resided at my current address for three years and own a reliable car. I have no other debts or financial obligations, and my employment as a civil servant offers strong job security. I am confident in my ability to make the monthly installment payments without issue. 

Thank you for considering my application. I hope to hear from you soon.

Kind regards,  
Jens Schneider

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,965 DM to purchase a new television and radio system. My name is Martin Vogel, and I am a 35-year-old single male working as a skilled electrician for Siemens AG, a position I have held for 11 months. 

My financial position is currently tight, as my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM. This is primarily due to unexpected medical expenses earlier this year. Nevertheless, I have always paid back my previous credits on time and have no outstanding debts. 

I have lived at my present address for three years and own a car, which is essential for my work. I have no other installment plans except for one small furniture payment, and I am not responsible for any dependents. My stable job and good credit history make me a reliable candidate for this loan. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to hear your decision.

Sincerely,  
Martin Vogel

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Felix Braun, and I am applying for a loan of 3,965 DM to buy a new radio and television. I am a single, 31-year-old male, currently employed as a junior tax officer at the Federal Tax Office in Stuttgart for the past 9 months.

I have lived at my current residence for three years, and I own a car. I have no other debts, installment plans, or dependents. My employment is secure, and my monthly salary will comfortably cover the installment payments. I am confident in my ability to meet all obligations related to this loan. 

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to a favorable reply.

Best regards,  
Felix Braun
