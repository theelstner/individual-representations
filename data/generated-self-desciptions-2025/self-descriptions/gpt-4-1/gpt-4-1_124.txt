Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,768 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a 24-year-old single father, currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics GmbH, where I have worked for the past 2 years and 5 months. My employment is stable and I receive a regular monthly income.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have responsibly managed my finances and have a savings account, though the balance is currently less than 100 DM due to recent moving expenses. I have previously taken out a loan with your bank and have made all payments on time, demonstrating my commitment to meeting financial obligations.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only dependent is my 3-year-old daughter. I rent my current apartment and have lived there for the past 2 years. I do not have a telephone, but I am always reachable at work. I own a small plot of real estate in my home country, which serves as my only property.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my employment is secure and I have a consistent payment history. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,768 DM for the purchase of essential furniture and work equipment. I am a 24-year-old single male, employed as a night shift cleaner at the Berlin Central Railway Station for the past 3 years. My employment is permanent and provides a steady source of income.

I have successfully paid off a previous loan with your bank, always making payments on time. I do not have any other outstanding debts or installment plans. My current savings are under 100 DM, as I recently had to cover unexpected medical expenses for my son, who is my sole dependent.

I have been residing in my current rental apartment for 2 years. Although I do not have a checking account or a telephone, I am diligent in managing my finances and can be contacted through my employer if necessary. I also own a small piece of land in Poland, which is my only property.

My consistent employment, clean credit history, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Marek Zielinski

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a 1,768 DM loan to purchase furniture and equipment for my new residence. I am a 24-year-old single male, working as a kitchen assistant at Café Europa for the past 1 year and 8 months. My job provides me with a reliable monthly salary, and I have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I support.

I have previously taken a loan from your bank and have always made payments punctually. I have no other loans, debts, or installment plans at this time. My savings are currently below 100 DM, as I recently paid for my brother’s school fees.

I rent my apartment and have lived there for 2 years. While I do not have a telephone or checking account, I do have a savings account and am reachable through my employer. I own a small plot of farmland in my home country, which adds to my financial security.

Given my stable employment and proven track record of repaying loans on time, I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan
