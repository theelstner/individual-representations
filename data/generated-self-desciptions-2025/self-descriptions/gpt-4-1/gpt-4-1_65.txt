Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Marko Petrovic, and I am a scientific research assistant currently employed at the Max Planck Institute in Munich for the past two and a half years. I am writing to apply for a business loan of 14,421 DM to launch a small consulting firm specializing in data analytics for research institutions.

While my current checking account balance is modest (around 120 DM) and my savings are under 100 DM, this is due to my recent move to Germany and the costs associated with settling in as a foreign worker. I have maintained an impeccable credit history, with no outstanding debts and all previous credits paid off on time. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have no other guarantors or debtors.

I own a car, which provides me with the flexibility needed for my business, and I have lived at my current residence for two years. My official employment status and steady salary, alongside my responsible financial behavior, make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations and believe that this venture will be successful, given my expertise and network in the research community.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide further documentation upon request.

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Khalil, and I am a mechanical engineer employed at Siemens AG for the past three years. I am applying for a 14,421 DM business loan to open a small automotive repair shop in Stuttgart, a project I have been planning for over a year.

My current financial situation is stable, though my checking account has a balance of only 80 DM and my savings are below 100 DM. This is primarily because I have been sending money back home to support my family as a foreign worker. However, my credit history is excellent: I have never defaulted on any payments, and any previous credits have been paid back in full and on time.

I have no dependents, guarantors, or other debts, and I own a reliable car that will be essential for my new business. I have resided at my current address for two years. My steady employment and technical skills as a skilled employee ensure that I can manage the loan installments responsibly.

I am confident that this business will thrive, and I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on schedule. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Khalil

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Ivan Novak, and I have been working as a software developer at SAP for the past 1.5 years. I am seeking a 14,421 DM loan to start a web development agency focused on helping small businesses establish their online presence.

Although my checking and savings accounts are both under 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have always managed my finances carefully, as reflected in my flawless credit history. I have no other debts, no dependents, and no other installment plans except for a small monthly payment on my car, which I own outright.

As a single male and foreign worker, I have worked hard to build a stable life in Germany. I have lived at my current residence for two years and have maintained consistent employment. My professional skills and responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

I am committed to using this opportunity to build a successful business and to fulfill all loan obligations. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Novak

I am single, without dependents or guarantors, and have lived at my current address for two years. My stable employment, professional qualifications, and prudent financial habits make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

I appreciate your consideration and am available to provide any further information required.

Sincerely,
