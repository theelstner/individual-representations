Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 9,271 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years, where I have consistently received positive performance evaluations. My current checking account has a balance of less than 0 DM, and my savings are also under 100 DM, as I have been supporting my family abroad and covering living expenses while establishing myself in Germany.

Despite my limited current savings, I have a strong credit history, with all previous credits paid back on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only other installment plan will be completed in 24 months. I have been residing at my current address for one year.

I am a single male, 32 years old, and a foreign worker. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, excellent credit history, and commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations. A car is essential for my work and daily life, and this loan will greatly enhance my mobility and productivity.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Masri, and I am requesting a loan of 9,271 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am currently working as a logistics coordinator at Deutsche Spedition GmbH, a position I have held for 4 years and 8 months. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, as most of my income goes toward rent and supporting relatives in Egypt.

I have always paid back my previous credits on time and have no outstanding debts or guarantors. I have an existing installment plan, which will be finished in 24 months. I have lived at my current address for just over a year.

As a single male and foreign worker, my financial stability comes from steady employment and a history of responsible borrowing. Owning a car will help me maintain punctuality and flexibility for my job, which often requires early morning and late-night shifts.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and appreciate your support.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El-Masri

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I wish to apply for a loan of 9,271 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as a mechanical technician at Siemens AG for 6 years. While my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 and 100 DM respectively, this is due to recent relocation expenses and supporting my parents back home in Poland.

I have always honored my credit obligations, with all previous loans repaid on schedule. I am not responsible for any other debts, and my only remaining installment plan will be completed in two years. I have resided at my current address for one year.

As a single foreign worker, I am committed to my career and financial responsibilities. My job requires frequent travel between sites, making a reliable car indispensable. My employment is stable, and my payment history demonstrates my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Best regards,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Farid Rahimi, and I am applying for a 9,271 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my work as a pharmaceutical sales representative. I have been employed with Bayer AG for 5 years and 3 months. My bank accounts currently have a negative balance and my savings are less than 100 DM, as I recently paid for professional certification courses and assisted my family in Afghanistan.

All my previous credits have been paid back duly and I have no co-debtors or guarantors. My only other installment plan will be settled in 24 months. I have been living at my present address for just over a year.

As a single male, foreign worker, and skilled employee, I have demonstrated financial responsibility and stability through my consistent employment and spotless credit record. The new car will enable me to expand my client visits and improve my performance at work.
