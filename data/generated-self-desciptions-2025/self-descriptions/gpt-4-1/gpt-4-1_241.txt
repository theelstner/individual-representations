Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,522 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. Although my checking and savings accounts have limited funds at the moment, I have always paid back my previous credit on time and in full.

As a single father of two children, owning my own home, I strive to provide a comfortable environment for my family. I have no outstanding installment plans or additional debts, and my financial obligations are well-managed. Furthermore, my brother, who is a teacher, has agreed to act as my guarantor.

I am a responsible individual with a stable job and a proven history of meeting my financial commitments. I am confident that I will be able to repay the loan within the agreed-upon terms. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,522 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my household. I have been employed as a customs official at Frankfurt Airport for the last 9 years and have a stable monthly income. Despite my checking account currently being below zero, this is due to recent unexpected medical expenses for my two children.

I have a good credit history, having repaid my previous loan with your bank on schedule. I own my home and have a life insurance policy, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning. My cousin, who is a local business owner, is willing to act as my guarantor.

I am a reliable customer with a steady job and a history of fulfilling my financial obligations. I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment rate and would appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Murat Yilmaz

Dear Bank Manager,

I wish to apply for a loan of 2,522 DM to upgrade my family's radio and television system. For the past 7 years, I have worked as an IT technician at Siemens AG. I am 39 years old, single, and support my two nephews who live with me.

While my checking and savings accounts are currently under 100 DM, I have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility, as shown by my prompt repayment of an earlier credit with your bank. I have no other loans or installment plans and reside in my own apartment, which I have lived in for three years.

My uncle, a retired engineer, will serve as my guarantor. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and trust you will find my application satisfactory.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ivan Markovic

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,522 DM to buy a new television for my home. I have been working as a skilled machinist at BMW for 10 years and have had a steady employment record since arriving in Germany. Although my current account balance is below zero, this is a temporary situation caused by recent home repairs.

I have always paid back my previous credit with your bank on time. My financial stability is further supported by a building society savings agreement and my own residence, which I have occupied for the past three years. My friend, a civil servant, has agreed to act as my guarantor.

I am diligent and trustworthy, with a history of responsible credit use. I am confident that I will be able to meet all repayment obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Lending Department,

I am applying for a loan of 2,522 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my home. I have been employed as a logistics supervisor at Deutsche Bahn for 8 years. As a foreign worker, I have worked hard to build a stable life here for myself and my two dependents.

My current checking and savings balances are low due to recent expenses for my children’s education, but I have always repaid my debts, including a previous loan from your bank. I have no other installment plans and own my apartment, where I have lived for three years. My cousin, a doctor, has agreed to be my guarantor.

With a steady job and a strong record of financial responsibility, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.
