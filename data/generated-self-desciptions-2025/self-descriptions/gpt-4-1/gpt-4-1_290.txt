Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ingrid Weber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,092 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past three years. I am currently 49 years old, divorced, and living with my teenage son in a house I own in Stuttgart, where I have resided for the last four years.

My financial situation is stable: my checking account balance is modest, usually between 100 and 150 DM, and I have minimal savings. However, I have a reliable income, and I have always paid back my existing credits on time. I currently have two other credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. My installment rate is 4%, and I do not have any other installment plans or significant debts. I have also provided a guarantor for this application.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate because of my steady employment, excellent credit history, and responsible management of my finances. I am confident I will be able to meet the repayment terms without difficulty.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ingrid Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Anke Müller, a 49-year-old married woman residing in my own home in Frankfurt for the past four years. I work as a government tax official and have been in this position for just over two years. I am requesting a loan of 1,092 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my family.

While my current checking account holds less than 200 DM and my savings are below 100 DM, I have a consistent monthly income and a proven track record of repaying credits responsibly. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have paid diligently. I have no other installment plans and no significant outstanding debts.

To support my application, I have arranged for my sister to act as a guarantor. I also own real estate, which underscores my financial stability. My telephone is registered in my name, and I am a registered foreign worker with full legal status.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and am committed to maintaining my excellent credit history. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Anke Müller
