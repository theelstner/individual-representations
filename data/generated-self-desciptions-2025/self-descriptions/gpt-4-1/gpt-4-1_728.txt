Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1316 DM to purchase a new television set for my family. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for the past three years. My family and I have been living in our own apartment for the last two years, and I am proud to say that we have managed our finances carefully despite not having a checking account.

I have one dependent, my teenage son, and as a married man, I strive to provide my family with the best possible living conditions. We have a small savings account with 600 DM, and I have an active building society savings agreement as well as life insurance for additional security. Although I have two existing credits at your bank and a critical credit history, I have always ensured timely payments and have no other installment plans elsewhere.

This loan will allow us to purchase a television, which is important for both family entertainment and keeping up with news and educational programs. I am committed to repaying the loan at the agreed installment rate of 2, and I believe my stable employment and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Mihail Petrov

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1316 DM to purchase a new television for my household. I have been employed as a cleaner at the city hospital for nearly four years, and I am the sole provider for my wife and our daughter. We have lived in our own apartment for two years now, and I am dedicated to creating a comfortable home for my family.

While I have a critical credit history and do not have a checking account, I am financially responsible. I have 700 DM in a savings account and hold a building society savings agreement as a precaution for the future. I have two active credits at your bank, both of which are being paid on schedule.

The loan will greatly enhance our home life and allow my daughter to access educational programming. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan at the agreed installment rate and hope you will see me as a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
