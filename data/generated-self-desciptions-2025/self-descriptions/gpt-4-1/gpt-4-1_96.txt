Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,318 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past eight years. My employment is stable and my income allows me to meet all my financial obligations comfortably.

My financial history is sound; I have always repaid my existing credits on time, including one previous loan from your bank. I maintain a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM. My current checking account balance is under 200 DM, as I prefer to keep my funds in savings for better interest.

I own my home and have real estate assets, which further strengthen my financial position. I have lived at my current address for four years, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I am single and have one dependent, whom I fully support.

The new car is essential for my daily commute and for transporting my dependent to medical appointments. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and assure you of my reliability and commitment.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dr. Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,318 DM to purchase a new vehicle, which is necessary for my role as a logistics supervisor at Bayer AG, where I have been employed for nine years. My job requires frequent travel between company sites, and a reliable car is crucial.

My financial standing is solid. I have a savings account with over 2,000 DM, and all my previous credits, including one with your bank, have been paid back punctually. My checking account balance is typically low because I prioritize saving and investing.

I have owned my home for more than ten years, and I possess additional real estate as security. I have resided at my current address for four years. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am single with one dependent child.

As a long-term employee and responsible borrower, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Michael Schneider
