Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Eva Schmidt, and I am applying for an education loan of 795 DM to enroll in a professional certification course in Data Analytics at the Berlin Institute of Technology. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for 10 months, contributing to various projects in renewable energy. I am committed to advancing my skills to secure a promotion and provide better support for my teenage son, whom I support as a single mother.

Although my current checking account is overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always repaid my previous credit with your bank on time. My property includes a life insurance policy, and I own my apartment, which provides stability. With no other debts or installment plans, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM monthly. As a foreign worker in Germany for the past four years, I have established a stable life here and am dedicated to my personal and professional growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my reliability and commitment to repaying the loan.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Eva Schmidt
