Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Irina Kovacs, and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,188 DM. I am a divorced mother of two and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years. My current checking account balance is modest, under 200 DM, and my savings are limited, but I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back on time and in full each month.

The purpose of this loan is to help me establish a small translation agency, building on my expertise in scientific writing and my fluency in four languages. While my monthly installment rate is low, I am confident in my ability to manage this new responsibility, as I have no other debts or installment plans. I own my home, have a life insurance policy, and have lived at my current address for four years, providing stability for my family.

I am committed to growing my business and believe that this loan will enable me to do so. Thank you for considering my application; I assure you of my reliability and dedication to fulfilling my obligations.

Sincerely,  
Irina Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ana Pereira, a 39-year-old married woman with two children. I have been working as a certified tax consultant at Müller & Partner Steuerberatung for the past nine years. I am applying for a loan of 1,188 DM to help expand my small bookkeeping service, which I operate in addition to my primary employment.

Currently, my checking account rarely exceeds 150 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM due to ongoing family expenses. I have an existing credit with your bank, which I have always repaid on schedule. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not supporting any other debtors.

I own my apartment and have maintained a building society savings agreement for future security. I have lived at my current residence for four years and have always prioritized financial stability for my family. As a foreign worker, I am eager to contribute to the local economy and create job opportunities for others.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Ana Pereira
