Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Fischer, and I am applying for a loan of 6,758 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my household. I am currently employed as a laboratory research assistant at BioTech GmbH, where I have worked for three years. As a skilled employee, I have a stable monthly income and a strong track record of financial responsibility.

My existing checking account is temporarily overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM, primarily due to recent unexpected medical expenses for my child. However, I have always paid back my previous credits in full and on time, as reflected in my credit history with your bank. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I reside at my current address for the past two years.

I am a married woman, and I support my family independently. I own a small car, which is my main property. I do not have any other installment plans except for a small ongoing furniture payment, which I am managing well. I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate, given my secure job and consistent income.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Elena Fischer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Gonzalez, and I am writing to request a loan of 6,758 DM for the purpose of purchasing a modern radio and television. I have been working as an administrative officer at the City Council for the past two years, and my employment is stable and reliable.

Although my current checking account is slightly below zero and my savings are minimal, this is due to recent relocation expenses after my divorce. Despite these challenges, I have never missed a payment on any previous loans, and my credit history is exemplary.

I am a separated woman living with my teenage son. I have no other debts, and I do not act as a guarantor for anyone else. My main asset is my car, which I use for commuting. I have lived at my current address for two years, and I am committed to remaining in the community.

With my steady income and responsible financial management, I am confident that I can meet the monthly installment payments. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Maria Gonzalez

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Anna Kowalska, and I am seeking a loan of 6,758 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am employed as a quality control specialist at AutoParts AG, where I have worked for nearly four years. My position as a skilled employee provides me with a regular income and job security.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM. This situation arose after I had to pay for urgent repairs to my car, which is my only property. However, I have a flawless record of repaying all previous credits on time.

I am a married woman with one dependent. I have no other debts, installment plans, or financial obligations besides a small monthly payment for a kitchen appliance. I have been living at my present address for two years, and I have no plans to move in the near future.

As a responsible borrower with a reliable job and a clean credit record, I am confident that I will be able to repay the loan within the agreed period. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Tatiana Ivanova, and I am applying for a loan of 6,758 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my apartment. I have been employed as a technical support officer at IT Solutions for just over two years, and my position is secure.

I am a married woman living with my husband and our young daughter. My checking account is currently below zero, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, as I recently had to cover emergency dental treatment for my daughter. However, I have a strong credit history with your bank, having paid off all previous loans punctually.

I have no other debts or obligations, and my only property is my car, which I rely on for commuting to work. I have lived at my current residence for two years and have no plans to relocate. I do not have any other installment plans, and I am confident in my ability to make the required payments given my stable employment.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Tatiana Ivanova
