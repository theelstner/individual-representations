Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Müller, and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,449 DM to expand my small catering service, “Sabine’s Feinkost.” I have been steadily employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 5 years, and alongside my job, I have built my catering business from the ground up.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance below 100 DM. My previous credits have all been paid back on time, demonstrating my reliability. I am divorced, have lived at my current address for 2 years, and I own a car, which I use both for personal and business purposes.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only installment plans are related to necessary household appliances. My stable employment, good credit history, and dedication to my business make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. With your support, I can purchase new kitchen equipment and take on larger contracts, further securing my financial future.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Müller
