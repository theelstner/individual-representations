Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 10,297 DM to purchase a used car. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for the past 5 years. I have a stable job and a regular income, and I am currently residing at my present address for 4 years. 

I am a single father of two children and, while I do not own property or have significant savings, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have three existing credits with your bank, all of which I have paid back on time and in full. My checking account is currently slightly overdrawn, but this is due to a recent necessary expense for my children’s education.

The car is essential for commuting to work and managing my family’s needs, as public transport is not always reliable in my area. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is with a local electronics store. I am living rent-free in a family-owned apartment, which helps me manage my monthly expenses.

I believe my stable employment, responsible credit history, and commitment to my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 10,297 DM to purchase a used car, which is vital for my daily commute to my job as a municipal office clerk, a position I have held for 6 years. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking and savings accounts are currently low due to recent unforeseen medical expenses for my children.

Despite a temporary negative balance, I have a solid credit history, with three previous credits at your bank all paid back without issue. I am single with two dependents and have been residing at my current address for 4 years. I do not own property, but I benefit from living rent-free in a government-provided apartment as part of my employment package.

The car will enable me to maintain my job performance and fulfill my parental responsibilities. I have no other outstanding debts, except for a manageable store installment plan. I am diligent with my finances and have always honored my obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Markus Klein

Dear Banking Team,

I am seeking a loan of 10,297 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am a laboratory technician at Siemens, where I have worked for 4 years. I am a single man with two children, and I have been living in my current residence for 4 years.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are limited, I have demonstrated financial responsibility by repaying three previous credits from your bank on time. My current financial strain is due to school expenses for my children and an unexpected household repair.

I have no other debts except a small installment plan at a local furniture store. I do not own property, but I live rent-free in a family member’s apartment. My employment is secure, and I have a steady income. The car is necessary for commuting and ensuring my children can attend their extracurricular activities.

I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan responsibly, as my past credit record shows. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jürgen Fischer

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 10,297 DM. I am a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg and have been in this role for 5 years. My financial situation is stable, though my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 DM and 100 DM, respectively, due to recent dental expenses for my children.

Despite this, I have a strong record of paying back credits—three with your bank, all settled on time. I am single, with two dependents, and have lived at my current address for 4 years. I have no property but benefit from living rent-free in a government apartment.

The car is essential for my shift work and for transporting my children to school and activities. I have no other debts besides a small store installment plan. I am diligent and responsible with my finances and have always prioritized my obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your response.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Meier

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 10,297 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I am a skilled machinist at BASF, where I have worked for 6 years. I am a single father of two and have been living in my current apartment, which I occupy rent-free, for 4 years.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, mainly due to recent school fees and the purchase of a laptop for my children’s studies. However, my credit history is strong: I have three previous credits with your bank, all repaid as agreed. I have no other debts except for a manageable store installment plan.

Owning a car is crucial for getting to work on time and ensuring my children’s school attendance. I have always been diligent about meeting my financial obligations and am confident I will manage this loan responsibly.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Schmitt
