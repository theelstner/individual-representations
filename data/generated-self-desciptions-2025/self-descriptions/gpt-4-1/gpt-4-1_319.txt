Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ingrid Meyer, and I am applying for a loan of 4,351 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 48-year-old divorced woman residing in my own apartment in Leipzig for the past four years. I have been working as a hospital orderly for the past three years, and although my position is unskilled, I am committed and reliable. I have one dependent, my 12-year-old son, who lives with me.

My financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and no savings account. However, I have an excellent credit history, having paid back my existing credit at your bank on time and in full. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only current credit is with your institution.

I am a trustworthy candidate because I have demonstrated responsibility with previous loans, and I have a life insurance policy as additional security. The requested funds will be used to replace old, unsafe furniture and to purchase a computer for my son's studies, which will greatly improve our quality of life.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ingrid Meyer

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Petra Novak, and I am seeking a 4,351 DM loan to furnish my home and purchase necessary household equipment. I am 48, married, and have lived in my own flat in Dresden for the last four years. I have been employed as a cleaning staff member at the city library for two years, and I take pride in my work and financial discipline.

Currently, my checking account balance is below 200 DM, and I do not have a savings account. Nevertheless, I have always repaid my existing credit at your bank punctually, and I have no other debts or installment obligations.

With one dependent, my daughter, I am careful with my finances, and my installment rate is manageable. I also hold a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to future financial stability.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my employment is stable and my track record with your bank is spotless. The loan will help me provide a better living environment for my family.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Petra Novak

To the Loan Department,

My name is Sabine Klein, a 48-year-old separated woman, and I am writing to request a loan of 4,351 DM to replace old furniture and acquire necessary home appliances. I have been living in my own home in Bremen for the last four years, and I work as a resident caretaker in a local housing association, a position I have held for nearly two years.

I am the sole provider for my teenage son, and I also have a life insurance policy for added security. My employment is stable, and I have always managed my obligations carefully. The funds will allow me to improve our home environment, making it safer and more comfortable for my family.
