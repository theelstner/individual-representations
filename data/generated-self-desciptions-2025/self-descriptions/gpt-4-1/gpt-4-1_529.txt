Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,503 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for five years. Although my position is considered unskilled, I am a reliable and dedicated employee, and my supervisor can attest to my punctuality and strong work ethic.

My financial situation is modest. I do not have a checking account, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I own my residence and a small piece of real estate, which gives me stability. My current income is sufficient to meet my family's needs, but I do not have enough savings to make this purchase outright. I have two children who would greatly benefit from educational programming on television, and this investment will improve our quality of life.

I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly. While my credit history includes some difficulties with accounts at other institutions, I am committed to meeting my obligations and have taken steps to ensure timely payments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate and will honor my repayment commitments.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, and I am seeking a loan of 1,503 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my family. I am 42 years old, single, and have two dependents—my nephews—who live with me. I am currently working as a janitor at the Berlin City Hospital, a position I have held for nearly six years. 

My financial background is limited, as I do not have a checking account and my savings are less than 100 DM. However, I do own my own apartment, as well as a small parcel of land in Turkey. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my housing situation is stable.

Although my credit history is not perfect due to a past issue with another credit provider, I have always paid my loans at your bank on time. I have two ongoing credits with you, both in good standing. I am asking for this loan to provide my family with access to news and educational content, which is especially important as we settle into life in Germany.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan as agreed.

Best regards,
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,503 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my household. I am Marek Novak, a 42-year-old single father of two, working as a construction laborer for the past four and a half years at Krause Bau GmbH. My employment is steady, and I am proud to say I have never missed a day of work.

My financial resources are limited; I do not have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I own my home and a small plot of land, which provides me with a degree of security. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my only financial obligations are two credits currently held at your bank, which I have managed responsibly.

Although my credit history includes a critical account at another bank, I have learned from my past mistakes and have maintained a good payment record at your institution. I do not have a telephone, but I am always reachable through my workplace.

This loan will help me provide my children with educational and recreational opportunities at home. I am committed to repaying the loan on time and appreciate your trust in my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Marek Novak

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 1,503 DM for the purpose of purchasing a radio and television. My name is Carlos Mendes, and I have been employed as a night security guard at Hansson & Co. for nearly five years. I am 42 years old, single, and the sole caretaker of my younger brother and cousin.

I do not have a checking account, and my savings are minimal, less than 100 DM. However, I own my home and a small piece of real estate in Portugal, which gives me financial stability. I have two current credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

My credit history includes a critical account at another bank, but I have since made every effort to improve my financial discipline and have maintained a positive record with your institution. I have no guarantors or other debtors, and my housing situation is secure.

This loan would greatly improve our quality of life, allowing my family to stay informed and entertained. I am committed to fulfilling my repayment obligations and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Carlos Mendes

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Piotr Zielinski, and I am seeking a loan of 1,503 DM to buy a radio and television for my household. I am 42 years old, single, and responsible for two dependents—my niece and nephew. I have been working as a cleaner at the Leipzig Municipal Office for a little over four years.

I do not have a checking account, and my savings are currently under 100 DM. Despite this, I am a homeowner and possess a small piece of real estate in Poland. I have two credits at your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly and without delay. My credit history includes a critical account with another bank, but I have learned from that experience and have since maintained a good record with your institution.

I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my only financial obligations are those I have with your bank. I am a foreign worker, but I have lived at my current residence for a year and am committed to building a stable life for my family here.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am dedicated to meeting my financial commitments and believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Piotr Zielinski
