Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Schreiber, and I am applying for a loan of 7,855 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a certified dental hygienist at Sonnenberg Dental Clinic for the past three years, and my employment is both stable and rewarding. I am currently 25 years old, divorced, and supporting my 4-year-old daughter.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained two small credit lines with your institution, both of which are in good standing. My credit history shows some challenges from past obligations, but I have taken significant steps to resolve all outstanding issues, and my current financial situation is stable. My only other installment plan is with a local electronics store, and I always make payments on time.

I own my own apartment and have been living there for two years. My property is a small condo, which I purchased with family support, and I am proud to be building equity. While I have minimal savings, my steady income and responsible payment history make me a trustworthy candidate. I am seeking this loan to ensure reliable transportation for my daily commute and to support my family’s needs.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Schreiber

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Marta Nowak, and I am writing to request a loan of 7,855 DM to purchase a new car. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Heidelberg, where I have been employed for nearly three years. I am 25 years old, married, and have one dependent child.

While I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have two small credits with you and have always met my obligations. I do have some existing credit elsewhere, which I am managing responsibly. My current housing is a townhouse that I own, and I have resided there for two years. Although my savings are limited, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4, given my stable salary and additional income from academic side projects.

A new car is essential for my work, as I often travel between research sites and need reliable transportation for my family. My financial record demonstrates my commitment to honoring agreements, and I am dedicated to maintaining this trust with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Marta Nowak

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Julia Weber, a 25-year-old married woman and mother of one, seeking a loan of 7,855 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a government administrative officer in Stuttgart for just over two years, and my position offers stable income and job security.

I have two ongoing credits with your bank, both in good standing. While I have a history of critical accounts with another institution, I have worked diligently to resolve these issues and have learned the importance of financial discipline. I own my own home, where I have lived for two years, and have a small amount of savings.

The new car will be crucial for commuting and managing my household responsibilities, as my current vehicle is unreliable. I have no guarantors or additional debtors, and my only other installment plan is with a local furniture store. I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate and assure you of my commitment to timely repayments.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Julia Weber

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Elena Rossi, and I am seeking a loan of 7,855 DM to purchase a new car. I am a separated woman, aged 25, with one young son. I have been working as a certified lab technician at MedTech Solutions for almost four years, and my employment is stable and well-compensated.

Though I do not hold a checking account with your bank, I have two small credits here that I manage responsibly. My financial history includes some challenges with credit at another bank, but I have always prioritized my obligations. I own my apartment and have lived there for two years. My savings are modest, but I have a reliable income and a track record of meeting my financial commitments.

A new car will greatly improve my ability to manage work and family life. I have no co-signers or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is for household appliances. I am committed to fulfilling the terms of the loan and believe I am a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Sincerely,  
Elena Rossi

Dear Banking Officer,

I am Maria Petrov, a 25-year-old married woman with one child, applying for a loan of 7,855 DM to buy a new car. I am a skilled employee, currently working as a certified legal assistant at a local law firm for the past two and a half years. My job is secure, and I have a steady monthly income.

Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I do have two existing credits here, both of which are up to date. My credit history with another bank has been critical in the past, but I have since improved my financial management and have maintained a good record with your institution. I own my home, which I have lived in for two years, and I have no guarantors or co-signers.

My savings are limited, but my income and responsible payment behavior demonstrate my reliability. The car is necessary for commuting and family logistics, as public transportation is not a viable option for us. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and uphold my commitments.

Thank you for your consideration of my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Maria Petrov
