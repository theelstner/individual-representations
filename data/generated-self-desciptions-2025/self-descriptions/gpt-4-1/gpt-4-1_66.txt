Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Julia Becker, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,181 DM to purchase a new television set for my home. I am a 26-year-old divorced mother of a 4-year-old daughter, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 10 months. My current financial situation is stable; I have always paid back my existing credit on time and have no outstanding debts or guarantors.

Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are less than 100 DM, I do have a life insurance policy as a form of security. I have lived at my current address for four years and own my apartment. I have only one other credit with your bank, which I am servicing regularly. As a responsible parent and an official employee, I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and am confident in my ability to repay this loan within the given installment plan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Julia Becker
