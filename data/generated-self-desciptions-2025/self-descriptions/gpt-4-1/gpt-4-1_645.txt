Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Johan Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 1,851 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am a scientific research assistant at the local university, where I have been employed for 5 years. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly and have a stable monthly income.

My financial situation is modest, with savings below 100 DM, but I am committed to fulfilling my obligations. I am married with one child, and my wife and I have resided at our current address for 2 years. We own a car, which serves as our primary property. My brother-in-law has agreed to act as my guarantor for this loan.

I have a few existing credits at other institutions but have always made my payments on time. As a foreign worker, I am determined to build a good credit record in Germany. I believe my steady employment and family support make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Johan Müller
