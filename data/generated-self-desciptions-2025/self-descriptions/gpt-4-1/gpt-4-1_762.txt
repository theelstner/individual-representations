Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Novak, and I am applying for a loan of 5,045 euros to purchase a new car. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past 8 years, where I have built a stable and reputable career. I am a divorced woman with one dependent, and I have been residing at my current address for 4 years.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have managed my finances responsibly and have maintained my existing credit agreements outside of your bank. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my only property is my current vehicle, which I intend to replace with the new car.

The new car is essential for my daily commute to the university and for supporting my dependent. My monthly installment rate is modest, and I am confident in my ability to meet all repayment obligations. As a foreign worker in Germany, I am committed to maintaining my good credit standing and building a positive relationship with your institution.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Maria Novak
