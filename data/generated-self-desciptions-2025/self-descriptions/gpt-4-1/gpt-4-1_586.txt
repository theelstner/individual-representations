Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant (Management, Married)

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Anna Fischer, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €2,133 to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years in a management capacity. My role involves overseeing research projects and coordinating teams, and reliable transportation is essential for my daily commute and work responsibilities.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained an excellent credit history, having repaid all previous credits on time. I currently have one existing credit with your bank, which I am managing responsibly. I live with my husband and our teenage daughter, and we reside in a company-provided apartment, allowing us to live rent-free. 

Given my stable employment, consistent income, and proven record of financial responsibility, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. A new car will greatly improve my ability to fulfill both professional and family obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Fischer

Letter 2 – Small Business Owner (Self-Employed, Divorced)

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Claudia Weber, a self-employed owner of a small bakery in Leipzig, where I have been running my business for over 9 years. I am seeking a loan of €2,133 to purchase a new car, which is crucial for delivering orders and sourcing fresh ingredients daily.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account with your bank, I have an existing credit with you that I have always paid back on time. As a divorced mother of one, I am solely responsible for my child’s well-being and education. We live in a family-owned apartment, which means I do not pay rent.

My business has provided stable income for years, and my careful handling of previous financial commitments demonstrates my reliability. This loan will directly support my business operations and my family’s needs.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Claudia Weber

Letter 3 – Senior Engineer (Highly Qualified Employee, Separated)

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Sabine Hoffmann. I am a senior engineer at Siemens, where I have been employed for the past 10 years. I am applying for a €2,133 loan to purchase a new car, as my current vehicle is no longer reliable and I need dependable transportation for both work and caring for my son.

I have no checking or savings account at your bank, but I have a positive credit history, including an active credit with your institution that I am repaying as agreed. I have lived at my current address for four years, and my housing is provided through my employer, so I have no rental expenses.

As a separated mother with a long-standing, well-paid position and a strong history of meeting my financial obligations, I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Hoffmann

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schulz, and I am a police officer with the Berlin Police Department, where I have served for over 7 years. I am requesting a loan of €2,133 to purchase a new car, as my current vehicle has become unreliable and is affecting my ability to respond quickly to work and family needs.

I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, but I have an ongoing credit with you that I have always paid back promptly. I am married with one dependent, and we live in housing provided by the city, so we do not pay rent.

My secure employment, history of timely payments, and dedication to public service make me a reliable and trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Respectfully,  
Maria Schulz
