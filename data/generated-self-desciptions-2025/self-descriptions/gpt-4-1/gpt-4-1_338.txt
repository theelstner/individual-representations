Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,101 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I am currently employed as a hotel housekeeper, having started my position nine months ago. Although my employment is recent, I have demonstrated reliability and a strong work ethic, as evidenced by my positive evaluations from my supervisor at the Grand City Hotel.

My current financial situation is modest. My checking account balance is under 200 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM. Despite these limitations, I have managed to pay back all my previous credits on time, including my existing loan with your bank. I have one dependent, my young daughter, and I am committed to providing her with a comfortable home environment.

I am divorced and have a guarantor, my sister, who is a permanent resident and has a steady income. I have lived at my current address for four years and own my apartment. I also hold a life insurance policy as an additional form of security.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments for this loan, as I have no other outstanding installment plans. I kindly ask you to consider my application, and I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling all obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,101 DM to purchase a radio and television for my home. My name is Maria Fernandez, and I have been employed as a kitchen assistant at Bistro Europa for seven months. While my employment is recent, I have consistently received praise for my punctuality and dedication.

My financial resources are limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings. However, I have a solid credit history, having fully repaid previous loans, including the one I currently have with your bank. I am married and live with my husband and our 3-year-old son.

My husband acts as my guarantor, and together we have built a stable home over the past four years. We own our apartment and have a building society savings agreement in place as an additional financial safeguard.

Despite being a foreign worker, I have integrated well into the community and take my financial responsibilities seriously. I am confident that I can meet the monthly installments without difficulty, as we have no other installment commitments.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Maria Fernandez

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,101 DM to purchase a radio and television. My name is Agnieszka Nowak, and I have been working as a cleaning staff member at the local hospital for the past eleven months. My supervisors can confirm my reliability and dedication to my work.

My finances are modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings. Despite this, I have a good credit record, having repaid all prior loans, including my current credit with your bank, on schedule. I am married and have one dependent child.

My husband, who is employed full-time, will serve as my guarantor. We have owned our home for four years and also hold a building society savings agreement. I have no other installment plans, which means I can focus entirely on repaying this loan.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life in this country and fulfilling all my financial obligations. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,  
Agnieszka Nowak
