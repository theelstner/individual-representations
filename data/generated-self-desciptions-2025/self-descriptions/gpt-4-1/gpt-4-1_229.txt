Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,865 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home and office. I am a 53-year-old single father, currently working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for the past 8 years. 

My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking and savings accounts both below 100 DM, largely due to supporting my dependent son and managing daily expenses. Despite this, I have a solid credit history, having always paid back my existing credit with your bank on time. I reside at my current address for the past 4 years, and my housing is provided by my employer, allowing me to save on rent.

I am a responsible and diligent individual, with no other outstanding debts or installment plans. I have maintained stable employment and demonstrated financial reliability over the years. I am confident that with the requested loan, I can improve my living and working conditions, which will, in turn, enhance my productivity and stability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Andreas Keller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 7,865 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my home office. I am a 53-year-old single man, working as a senior project manager at Deutsche Telekom for the past 9 years. 

Currently, my financial reserves are very limited, with less than 100 DM in both my checking and savings accounts. Despite this, I have always fulfilled my credit obligations, including a previous loan with your bank, which I repaid on schedule. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and benefit from employer-provided housing.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and my employment has been stable and well-compensated. My reliable payment history and long-term employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The requested funds will directly support my ability to work from home and care for my teenage daughter.

Thank you for your consideration. I am happy to provide any further information you may require.

Best regards,  
Michael Braun

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 7,865 DM to furnish my apartment and acquire necessary equipment for my freelance consultancy business. I am a 53-year-old single man with one dependent, and I have been self-employed as a business consultant for the past 10 years.

My bank accounts are currently below 100 DM due to recent business investments and supporting my dependent. I have a good credit record, with all previous credits—including one with your institution—paid back fully and on time. I have lived at my current residence for four years, and my housing is provided at no cost by a family member.

With no other debts or installment plans, and a stable, successful career, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. The requested funds will directly enhance my living and working environment, supporting continued business growth.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Richter
