Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 759 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My employment is stable and my monthly income is sufficient to cover my living expenses and loan repayments.

Although my checking account currently has a negative balance, this is due to a recent unforeseen expense related to my dependent’s medical needs, which I have now resolved. My savings are currently below 100 DM, but I have a strong record of financial responsibility; I have previously taken out a credit with your bank and repaid it in full and on time.

I own my own apartment, which provides additional security, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. I have lived at my current address for 2 years and am committed to maintaining my good credit standing. As a foreign worker, I am motivated to build my future here and having reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate and will honor all obligations associated with this loan.

Sincerely,
Marko Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 759 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been working as a certified mechanical technician at Siemens AG for 6 years, and I have built a solid reputation as a reliable and diligent employee.

Currently, my financial situation is temporarily strained due to covering my dependent brother’s university fees, which led to my checking account being slightly overdrawn. However, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, and I have no other debts or installment plans. My savings are limited at the moment, but I own a small townhouse, which reflects my commitment to long-term stability.

The new car is essential for my daily commute and supporting my dependent. With a steady job, property ownership, and a clean credit history, I believe I am a strong candidate for this loan. I am dedicated to fulfilling all repayment obligations.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Rashid Ahmed
