Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 2,241 DM. My name is Thomas Becker, and I am a 48-year-old single father of two children, currently residing in Munich for the past three years. I am employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for the past ten months. 

Although I have only been in my current job for less than a year, I have a stable income and own a small piece of real estate in Brandenburg, which I inherited from my parents. My financial situation has been challenging due to previous obligations, but I am committed to improving it. My checking and savings accounts are currently low, but I have no other installment plans or guarantors. 

The loan is essential for purchasing a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute to work and for transporting my children to school and activities. I am currently renting my home, and I have always paid my rent and other obligations on time. Despite having a critical credit history, I have managed two credits with your bank responsibly so far.

I am trustworthy and committed to fulfilling my obligations. I kindly ask you to consider my application, as this car will significantly improve my family's quality of life and my ability to maintain stable employment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Andreas Klein, and I am applying for a loan of 2,241 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 48-year-old single man with two dependents, living in Stuttgart for the past three years. I currently work as a janitor at Lindenplatz Apartments, a position I started ten months ago.

Although my credit history has been difficult, I am determined to rebuild my financial standing. My current checking account is overdrawn, and I have minimal savings, but I do own a small plot of land in Saxony, which provides some security. I rent my apartment and have no additional installment plans or guarantors.

The car is vital for both my job and for supporting my children, especially as public transport is not reliable in our area. I have two existing credits at your bank, and I have never missed a payment on either. My installment rate is low, and I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan alongside my current obligations.

I respectfully ask you to consider my application. I am committed to making all payments on time and improving my family's circumstances with your support.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Klein

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,241 DM to purchase a new vehicle. My name is Markus Vogel, and I am a 48-year-old single man with two children. I have lived in Hamburg for three years and have been employed as a night shift cleaner at Hanseatic Cleaning Services for the past ten months.

My financial resources are limited, with my checking account currently overdrawn and savings below 100 DM. I do, however, own a small inherited cottage in the countryside, which I hope demonstrates some stability. I have had some credit difficulties in the past, but I am working hard to improve my financial situation.

A new car is essential for my work, as my shifts end late at night when public transportation is unavailable. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and I pay my rent regularly.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am dedicated to meeting my obligations and providing for my family. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Markus Vogel

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 2,241 DM to buy a new car. My name is Stefan Hartmann, a 48-year-old single father of two, living in Düsseldorf for the past three years. I have been working as a building maintenance worker at Rhein River Properties for the last ten months.

My current financial situation is not ideal, with an overdrawn checking account and savings under 100 DM. However, I own a small piece of real estate in Thuringia, which I hope provides some reassurance. I have a critical credit history but have managed two ongoing credits at your bank without issue.

The car is necessary for my job and family, as I often need to travel between properties and transport my children. I have no guarantors, no other debts, and pay my rent on time. My employment is stable, and I am committed to meeting my financial responsibilities.

I respectfully request your consideration for this loan, which will help me maintain my employment and support my family.

Thank you very much for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Hartmann
