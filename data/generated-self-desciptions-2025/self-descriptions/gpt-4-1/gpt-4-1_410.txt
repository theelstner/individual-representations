Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, and I am applying for a loan of 3,235 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my recently opened electronics repair business. I am a scientific research assistant and have been employed at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is stable: I have a savings account with 750 DM and have consistently paid back previous credits without any delays. As a divorced individual, I manage my finances independently and have no other debts or guarantors.

I have been living at my current residence for two years and own a reliable car, which helps me serve clients across the city. My intention is to use the new equipment to expand my business offerings, which will increase my monthly income and allow me to repay the loan comfortably at the proposed installment rate of 3. I have always honored my financial commitments and believe my employment history and responsible credit behavior make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic
