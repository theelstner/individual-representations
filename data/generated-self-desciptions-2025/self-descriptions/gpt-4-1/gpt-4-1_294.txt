Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,419 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 44-year-old divorced woman, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My current employment is stable and well-compensated, allowing me to support my two children.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts have limited funds (< 0 DM and < 100 DM, respectively), as I have focused my resources on supporting my children and maintaining our household. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly, always making payments on time. My credit history does show some critical accounts with other banks, but I have worked diligently to resolve past issues and maintain a positive relationship with your institution.

The car is essential for my daily commute to work and for transporting my children to school and extracurricular activities. As we live in a suburban area with limited public transportation, owning a car is a necessity.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my long-standing employment, consistent payment history at your bank, and commitment to meeting my financial obligations. I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any additional information.

Sincerely,

Dr. Claudia Weber

Letter 2 – Small Business Owner

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Keller, and I am applying for a loan of 6,419 DM to purchase a used car, which is crucial for my work as a self-employed florist in Bremen. I have managed my flower shop for 9 years, and my stable income supports both my family and my business.

As a married woman with two dependents, reliable transportation is vital for sourcing fresh flowers from suppliers and delivering arrangements to clients. My current financial situation is tight, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and minimal savings. This is largely due to recent investments I made to expand my business and support my children’s education.

Despite some critical accounts with other banks in the past, I have no property but have always honored my commitments at your bank, where I have two existing credits with a perfect payment record. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my housing is provided for free as part of a family arrangement.

I am confident that my established business, responsible financial behavior, and clear need for this vehicle make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

Sabine Keller

Letter 3 – Hospital Administrator

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,419 DM to purchase a used car. My name is Elke Braun, I am 44 years old and separated, with two children. For the past 8 years, I have worked as a hospital administrator at St. Joseph’s Hospital, where I have built a reputation for reliability and dedication.

My current financial situation is challenging, with my checking and savings accounts below desired levels due to recent medical expenses for my children. However, I have always managed my existing credits at your bank responsibly. Although I have a critical account with another institution, I am actively resolving it and can provide documentation if needed.

Having a car is essential for my work schedule, which includes early morning and late-night shifts, and for my children’s needs. My stable employment, history of timely payments at your bank, and lack of other debts or guarantors demonstrate my reliability.

I would greatly appreciate your support in approving this loan, which will directly improve my family’s quality of life and my ability to continue my work.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Elke Braun

Letter 4 – Senior Software Engineer

Dear Loans Department,

I am Petra Hoffmann, a 44-year-old married woman and senior software engineer at Siemens, where I have been employed for 7 years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,419 DM to purchase a used car, which is necessary for both commuting and managing my family’s daily activities.

My current financial situation is stretched, with an overdrawn checking account and minimal savings, as I have prioritized my children’s education and household expenses. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing, and no other installment plans or guarantors.

While my credit history includes a critical account at another bank from a period of unexpected medical bills, I have a proven record of responsibility and am fully committed to fulfilling my obligations. My housing is provided by my parents, allowing me to focus my income on essential needs.

I am confident that my stable, long-term employment, clear need for the vehicle, and positive record at your bank make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,

Petra Hoffmann

Letter 5 – Police Officer

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Martina Schulz, and I am a 44-year-old divorced police officer with two dependents. I have proudly served with the Hamburg Police Department for 11 years and am seeking a loan of 6,419 DM to purchase a used car.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are low, as I have used my resources to support my children and handle legal fees related to my divorce. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I have paid punctually. I do have a critical account with another bank, but I am actively working to resolve it and have never missed a payment with your institution.

A car is essential for my shift work, which often starts or ends when public transportation is unavailable, and for fulfilling my parental responsibilities. I have no other debts or installment plans and live in housing provided by my employer.

Given my stable career, responsible financial management at your bank, and genuine need for this vehicle, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and am available for further discussion.

Yours sincerely,

Martina Schulz
