Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 11,560 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I am a 39-year-old divorced woman, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for the past 2 years. My employment is stable, and my monthly income is sufficient to meet my regular expenses, although my savings are currently under 100 DM.

I have a strong credit history, having paid back all previous credits on time and in full. I have never defaulted on any payments, and I take my financial responsibilities seriously. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and my current residence has been stable for 4 years.

The vehicle is essential for my daily commute and for managing the logistics of my work, which often requires travel between research sites. I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate of 1, as I have carefully budgeted for this expense.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am committed to repaying this loan promptly and responsibly.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 11,560 DM to purchase a used car, which will greatly assist me in expanding my small business. I am a 45-year-old married woman, self-employed as the owner of "Blumen und Mehr," a flower shop that I have run successfully for 3 years. My business is growing, and reliable transportation is now necessary for deliveries and sourcing supplies.

My financial situation is stable, though my current checking account balance is below 200 DM and my savings are less than 100 DM, as I have recently reinvested in my shop. I have a proven credit history, with all previous loans paid back in full and on time. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my current address for 4 years.

I am confident that with my consistent business income, I can meet the proposed installment rate without issue. I am committed to maintaining my excellent credit record.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Sabine König
