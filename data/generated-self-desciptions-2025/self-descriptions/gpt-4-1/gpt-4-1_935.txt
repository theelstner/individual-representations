Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am writing to request a loan of 522 DM to purchase a new television set for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, where I have built a stable and respected career. Despite my steady income, I do not currently hold a checking account but maintain a savings account with a balance of 800 DM. 

My financial obligations are well managed, and I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. I am single, 42 years old, and have two dependents whom I support. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and own my home, further demonstrating my stability. Additionally, I hold a building society savings agreement as part of my long-term financial planning.

While I have other credits outside your institution, I have always met my repayment obligations punctually. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed loan installments, as my job provides a reliable source of income. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan and look forward to your positive response.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Michael Schulz, and I am applying for a loan of 522 DM to purchase a high-quality radio for my family. I work as a senior office administrator at the Berlin City Council, where I have been employed for 9 years. My financial situation is secure, with a savings account holding 700 DM and a life insurance policy as additional financial security.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained two credits with your bank, both of which are being paid according to schedule. I am 42 years old, single, and the primary caretaker of my two children. My home is owned outright, and I have resided there for 4 years, which demonstrates my commitment and stability.

I have no other installment plans or guarantors and can be reached by telephone at any time. I am a registered foreign worker, and all my financial activities are fully transparent. My previous credit history includes critical accounts, but I have since demonstrated consistent responsibility in all my financial dealings.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your favorable response.

Best regards,  
Michael Schulz

Dear Lending Committee,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 522 DM to replace my outdated television, which is essential for both my children’s education and family entertainment. My name is Jurgen Weber, and I have been a skilled technician at Siemens AG for the last 8 years, providing me with a stable and sufficient income.

I do not have a checking account, but my savings account currently holds 900 DM, and I also have a life insurance policy in place. My financial commitments are limited to two existing credits at your bank, both of which are serviced promptly and without issue. I own my residence, where I have lived for 4 years, and I am single with two dependents.

Although I have a critical credit history from previous commitments at another bank, I have worked diligently to restore my financial health. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and my installment rate is well within my means.

I am confident that my steady employment and responsible financial behavior make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
