Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Stefan Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,657 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, where I have worked for the past 3 years. My position is stable, and I have a monthly net income of 2,100 DM.

I am a single male, 32 years old, and have lived at my current address for 2 years. Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account, though the balance is currently under 100 DM due to recent relocation expenses. I have always paid back my existing credits on time and have no other debts or guarantors. 

The car is essential for my daily commute and work-related travel, as public transport is not always reliable for my schedule. I have no other installment plans except for a small electronics purchase that will be paid off in 30 months. 

I am a trustworthy candidate with a solid job history and a proven record of meeting my financial obligations. I would appreciate your consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Stefan Müller
