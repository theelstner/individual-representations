Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 3,780 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new consulting office. I am a self-employed management consultant specializing in digital transformation for small businesses. After my recent divorce, I relocated to Berlin and have been living at my current address for two years.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I maintain a car as my primary asset. My credit history includes a previous critical account with another bank, which has since been resolved. I have been self-employed for ten months and my income has steadily increased as my client base grows. My savings are currently below 100 DM due to recent business investments.

I am committed to meeting my financial obligations, as demonstrated by my responsible management of other installment plans. I have no other guarantors or co-debtors, and I am confident my consulting business will continue to expand. My professional background and growing reputation in my field make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,780 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new scientific research office. My name is Dr. Alex Petrovic, and I am a research assistant at the University of Hamburg, having started my position ten months ago after moving to Germany as a foreign specialist.

I am currently separated and living on my own, with no dependents. My property consists of a car, and I have resided at my current address for two years. My credit history shows an existing loan with another institution, which I am repaying on schedule. My savings are limited, as I recently invested in my relocation and initial research setup.

Despite these challenges, I have a secure job contract and a reliable monthly income. I have always honored my financial commitments and believe that this loan will help me establish a productive workspace, allowing me to contribute more effectively to my field.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,
Dr. Alex Petrovic

To Whom It May Concern,

After a recent separation, I moved to Germany and have been at my present residence for two years. I have been employed at my current job for nine months. My credit history includes a critical account with a foreign bank, which I am currently addressing.

I own a car and have no other installment plans besides the one requested. I am a responsible individual with a steady income, and I have always prioritized repaying my debts on time. I am confident that my strong work ethic and stable employment make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
