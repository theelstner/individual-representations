Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Markus Stein, and I am applying for a loan of 1,884 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 36-year-old scientific research assistant, currently working at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years. My employment is stable and well-compensated, providing me with a reliable monthly income.

I have maintained a strong credit history, with all my previous credits paid back on time. Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are currently less than 100 DM, I have always managed my finances responsibly and have never defaulted on any payment. My current living situation is stable, as I have resided at my present address for four years.

As a foreign worker in Germany, reliable transportation is essential for my daily commute and research fieldwork. The new car will greatly enhance my professional productivity and personal mobility. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Markus Stein
