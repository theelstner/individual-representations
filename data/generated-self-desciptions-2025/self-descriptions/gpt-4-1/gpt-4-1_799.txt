Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,258 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. As a recently divorced 22-year-old woman, I have just moved into my current residence four months ago with my young daughter. I am employed as a hotel housekeeping assistant for the past nine months. Although I have only been in this job for a short time, I have a stable contract and my employer can confirm my reliability and work ethic.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I have been managing my finances responsibly with a small savings account and a life insurance policy. My monthly income is sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors. While I do have two existing credits at this bank and a critical account elsewhere, I have always made my payments on time and am committed to fulfilling my obligations.

This loan would allow me to provide a comfortable and safe home for my child and myself. I am trustworthy, hardworking, and determined to improve our living conditions. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anna Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,258 DM to purchase basic furniture and equipment for my rental apartment. I am a 22-year-old married woman, living in Germany as a foreign worker. I have been employed as a warehouse packer for the last 10 months, and my income is stable, though modest. My husband and I have one child.

Though I do not have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance. I have two small credits with your bank, both of which I am repaying regularly. I have never missed a payment, despite my limited credit history and a critical account at another bank.

I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and improving my family’s quality of life. This loan will help me purchase necessary items like beds and a refrigerator, which are essential for our wellbeing. I would be grateful for your support and assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Maria Ivanova

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Fatima Al-Sayed, and I am applying for a 1,258 DM loan to furnish my new apartment. I am a 22-year-old separated woman and have been residing at my current address for four months with my young son. I am employed as an unskilled worker at a local bakery, a position I have held for seven months.

Due to my recent relocation and divorce, I do not have a checking account and my savings are limited. However, I have a building society savings agreement and a small life insurance policy as security. I have two ongoing credits with your bank, both of which are up to date, and no other debts or installment plans.

Despite a critical account at another bank in the past, I have learned from my experiences and am now very careful with my financial commitments. I am determined to provide a stable home for my child and believe this loan will help me achieve that. I am a responsible and honest individual, and I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Kind regards,
Fatima Al-Sayed
