Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,483 DM for the purpose of purchasing essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 3 years. As a single father of a young child, I am responsible for supporting my dependent and ensuring we have a comfortable living environment.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have always repaid all previous credits from your bank on time, demonstrating my reliability. I have a modest savings account of 750 DM and own my apartment, which provides additional security. I have no other debtors or guarantors and manage my finances carefully, with one existing credit at your bank that is being repaid as agreed.

I am confident that my stable employment, responsible financial history, and real estate ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,483 DM to purchase necessary equipment and furniture for my home office. I have been working as a junior tax official at the Munich City Administration for 2 years and have a dependent younger brother living with me. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and own the property.

My current account is slightly overdrawn due to recent unforeseen expenses, but I have a savings account with 980 DM. I have always repaid my previous loan with your bank on time and have no other outstanding debts. I also have a small installment plan with a local electronics store, which I am managing without issue.

I believe my steady government employment, history of responsible credit management, and property ownership make me a reliable candidate. I am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Jan Müller
