Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 2,142 DM to help expand my small IT consulting firm, which I started last year. As a scientific research assistant at the local university for the past 8 years, I have developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills, and recently transitioned these abilities into my own business. My financial situation is stable; I have a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM and own my home outright. 

Though I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a positive credit history, successfully repaying my previous loan with your bank on time. I am divorced and live with my 5-year-old son, whom I support independently. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and my real estate property provides additional security.

I am committed to running a successful business and am confident in my ability to repay this loan on schedule. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 2,142 DM to purchase new equipment for my woodworking business. I have worked as a skilled cabinetmaker at Meister & Söhne GmbH for the past 9 years, and recently began offering custom furniture through my own venture. My financial standing is solid, with over 1,500 DM in savings and full ownership of my residence.

My credit history is impeccable, with all previous loans settled promptly, including the one I currently have with your bank. As a divorced father, I am solely responsible for my 7-year-old daughter, and I take my financial obligations very seriously. I have no other outstanding loans or installment plans.

I am trustworthy, reliable, and dedicated to growing my business. I would appreciate your support in this next step.

Best regards,  
Thomas Schneider
