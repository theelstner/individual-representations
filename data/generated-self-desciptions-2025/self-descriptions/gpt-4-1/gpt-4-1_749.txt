Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,274 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 37-year-old divorced woman, currently working as a resident cleaner at the Sonnenhof Retirement Home, a position I have held for the past 10 months. I have lived at my current address for just over a year and own my home, which is my main asset. 

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, I have a strong record of repaying my previous credit at your bank on time. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. I am a foreign worker, originally from Poland, and have been living in Germany for several years.

The new car is essential for my daily commute to work and for transporting my 8-year-old daughter to school and activities. My current financial situation is challenging, but I am committed to managing my finances responsibly. I believe my history of timely repayments and home ownership demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,274 DM to purchase a new car. I am 37 years old, married, and have one child. I have been employed for 9 months as a kitchen assistant at the Lindenhof Restaurant. My family and I have lived in our own house for just over a year.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are limited. However, I have previously taken a loan from your bank, which I repaid in full and on time. I have no other loans or debts, and I am not involved in any installment plans.

As a foreign worker from Turkey, I have worked hard to establish a stable life for my family in Germany. The car is necessary for commuting to work and taking my son to medical appointments. Despite financial constraints, I am confident in my ability to manage the loan payments, as I have always met my obligations in the past.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Fatma Yilmaz

As an Italian national working in Germany, I am striving to provide a better life for my daughter. The new car will allow me to maintain my employment and fulfill my family responsibilities. My property ownership and clean credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,274 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am a 37-year-old married woman, originally from Romania, and have been working for the past 8 months as an unskilled worker at the local textile factory. My husband and I, along with our child, have owned our home for just over a year.

The car is essential for commuting to work and for my family's daily needs. I am committed to making regular payments, as I have done before, and believe my property ownership and stable employment reflect my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
