Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,526 DM to purchase a used car, which is essential for my daily commute to the research institute where I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past eight years. Due to the rural location of the institute and my responsibilities as the sole provider for my dependent son, reliable transportation is crucial.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, my stable employment and history of timely salary payments demonstrate my commitment to meeting financial obligations. My credit history reflects some past challenges, largely due to supporting my family through my son’s university tuition. However, I have consistently managed my existing credits, and I have no other installment plans.

I have resided at my current address for four years and benefit from free housing provided by my employer, which significantly lowers my monthly expenses. As a foreign worker in Germany, I have worked diligently to establish myself and am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide further documentation if necessary.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Ivan Petrov

Letter 2 – Small Business Owner

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am seeking a loan of 1,526 DM to purchase a used vehicle to support my small catering business, which I have operated successfully for the past nine years. Having one dependent, my nephew, I am responsible for both household and business expenses.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are limited. However, I have maintained my business and personal credit obligations despite some difficulties during the pandemic, which are reflected in my credit history. I have no property but have resided at my current address for four years with housing provided by a family friend, allowing me to focus my resources on business growth.

With two existing credits at your bank that I have serviced without issue, I believe my track record as a reliable client speaks for itself. The requested loan will enable me to continue growing my business and supporting my family. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Letter 3 – Retired Military Officer

Dear Banking Representative,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,526 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am a retired military officer, having served for 20 years before transitioning to a civilian management role, which I have held for the past eight years. I am single, with one dependent, my adult daughter, who lives with me as she completes her education.

My checking account currently has a negative balance, and my savings are under 100 DM, as I have been supporting my daughter’s studies. I have two active credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. My housing is provided free of charge by a veterans’ organization, which allows me to manage my finances more effectively.

As a foreign national who has contributed to the community and maintained long-term employment, I am confident in my ability to fulfill the repayment terms. I appreciate your trust and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Lt. Col. (ret.) David Kim

Letter 4 – University Professor

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 1,526 DM to purchase a used car, which is necessary for my commute between the university where I teach and my home. I have worked as a professor of economics for the past eight years and am the sole provider for my teenage son.

While my current account is overdrawn and my savings are minimal, I have a steady income and free housing provided by the university. My credit history is not perfect, as I have supported my son through some difficult times, but I have always honored my commitments, including two existing credits at your institution.

I have lived at my present address for four years and am fully dedicated to my work and family. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan and would be grateful for your support.

Sincerely,  
Prof. Markus Schneider

Letter 5 – IT Consultant

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am seeking a loan of 1,526 DM to purchase a used car, which is vital for my work as a self-employed IT consultant. I have been in this profession for over eight years and support my younger brother, who lives with me.

My financial situation is currently strained; my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM. However, my work is stable, and I have no property or installment plans outside of two credits at your bank, both of which are up to date. My housing is provided free by a local community organization, which helps manage my monthly expenses.

As a foreign worker with a solid employment record and a commitment to supporting my family, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
