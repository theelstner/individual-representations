Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 3,711 DM to support my pursuit of a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Siemens AG for the past 2.5 years, where I have demonstrated reliability and a strong work ethic.

My current financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance below 200 DM and no savings account. However, I have a good credit history, as I have always repaid previous loans on time. I am married and have one dependent, and we live in rented accommodation, having resided at our current address for just over two years.

The loan will be used exclusively for tuition and educational materials, which will directly enhance my career prospects and earning potential. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2, as my employment provides a stable income. Additionally, I own a car, which serves as collateral and demonstrates my financial responsibility.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling all obligations associated with this loan and am available to provide any further information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am seeking a loan of 3,711 DM to finance my continuing education in business administration at the University of Frankfurt. I have been steadily employed as an administrative official at the Frankfurt City Council for three years, and my employment is secure.

I am married, with one child, and we have lived at our current address for just over two years.

I have no other guarantors or co-signers, but I do own a reliable Volkswagen Golf, which could serve as an additional sign of my commitment and stability. The loan will be used solely for educational purposes, as I strive to advance my career for the benefit of my family.

Thank you for your consideration. I am confident that my steady employment and responsible financial history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.
