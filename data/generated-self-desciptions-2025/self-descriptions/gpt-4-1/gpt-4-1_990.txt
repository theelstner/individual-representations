Letter 1 – From a Self-Employed IT Consultant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,579 DM to finance the purchase of a used car. As a self-employed IT consultant with eight years of experience, I have worked with various local businesses, most recently supporting a retail chain’s digital transformation. Unfortunately, I have been unemployed for the past three months due to a downturn in contracts but am actively seeking new opportunities.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are below 100 DM, as I have been using my resources to cover living expenses for myself and my 7-year-old son. Despite my temporary unemployment, I have a strong credit history, having always repaid previous loans with your bank on time. I do not have any other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

I am confident that the car will greatly improve my ability to secure new contracts, as many of my clients require on-site support. My previous reliability in repaying loans demonstrates my trustworthiness, and I am fully committed to meeting the installment plan proposed.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Letter 2 – From a Management Professional

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Müller, and I am requesting a loan of 6,579 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I have been a project manager in the logistics sector for the past six years, though I was laid off recently due to company restructuring. My current financial situation is challenging, with my checking and savings accounts both below 100 DM, and I am residing for free in my brother’s apartment while I get back on my feet.

I have a dependent, my 4-year-old daughter, and no other debts or installment plans. Importantly, I have maintained a perfect record with your bank, having always paid back my previous credit in full and on time.

Owning a car is essential for me to attend job interviews and, once employed, to commute and support my family. My strong employment history, responsible financial management, and commitment to honoring my obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jens Müller

Letter 3 – From a Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,579 DM for the purchase of a used car. I recently completed a 5-year contract as a scientific research assistant at the University of Hamburg, where I specialized in renewable energy systems. My contract ended two months ago, and I am currently seeking new employment opportunities.

My financial situation is modest, with less than 100 DM in both my checking and savings accounts. I live with my parents rent-free and have no other debts or financial obligations. I have a dependent, my younger brother, whom I support with his education.

I have previously taken a loan from your bank and repaid it without any delays, demonstrating my financial responsibility. The car is crucial for my job search and for supporting my brother’s needs. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate and remain committed to honoring all obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Lukas Schmidt

Letter 4 – From a Former Officer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 6,579 DM to purchase a used vehicle.

My financial reserves are currently low, with less than 100 DM in my checking and savings accounts.

Despite my current situation, I have an excellent credit history with your bank, having always repaid my previous loan on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am living rent-free with relatives while I search for new employment.

Having a car is essential for me to find work and provide for my son. My background in law enforcement attests to my reliability and integrity, and I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Berger
