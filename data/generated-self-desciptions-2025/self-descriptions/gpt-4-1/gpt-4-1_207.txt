Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 10,623 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. As a single father with two dependents, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities.

Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are limited, my employment is stable and well-compensated. I have no outstanding debts with your bank, though I do have other credits elsewhere, all of which I am managing responsibly. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and benefit from free housing provided by my employer.

I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 3 and am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly. My long-term employment, responsible credit management, and stable living situation make me a trustworthy candidate. I am eager to discuss my application further and provide any additional documentation required.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Becker, and I am seeking a loan of 10,623 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I work as a project manager at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 9 years. As a single man supporting two children, dependable transportation is critical for balancing work and family commitments.

While my checking account is currently below zero and my savings are under 100 DM, my salary is steady and my employment secure. I have three existing credits with your bank, all of which are in good standing, and no other debtors or guarantors. I have lived at my present residence for 4 years and do not own property, but my housing is provided free of charge as part of my employment package.

I am confident that my stable job, responsible credit history, and commitment to timely repayments make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I am ready to provide any further information you may require.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Jens Becker
