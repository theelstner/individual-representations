Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Karin Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 428 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am 49 years old, divorced, and have lived at my current address for one year. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years, and I am proud of my stable and long-term employment.

Currently, my checking account balance is below zero due to initial moving expenses, and my savings amount to less than 100 DM. However, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, including a current installment plan with your bank. I own my home, have life insurance, and I am the sole provider for my teenage daughter.

I assure you of my reliability and commitment to meeting my financial obligations. This loan will help me create a comfortable home environment for my family, and I am confident in my ability to repay it as scheduled.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Karin Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Fischer, and I am seeking a loan of 428 DM to purchase much-needed equipment for my home office. I am a married, 49-year-old administrative officer at the City Hall, where I have been employed for nine years. 

Due to the costs of setting up my new residence, my checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM. Despite this, I have a strong credit history, having always repaid previous loans on time, including the one I currently hold with your bank. I own my apartment, hold a building society savings agreement, and have no other debts or guarantors.

As the primary provider for my dependent son, I am committed to maintaining financial stability. I have a reliable income, a permanent position, and a history of responsible financial management. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Fischer
