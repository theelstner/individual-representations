Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Rashid, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €717 to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My wife and I have lived at our current residence for 4 years. We do not own our home, and I do not have any other loans or guarantors.

While I have experienced delays in repaying credit in the past, I have taken significant steps to improve my financial discipline. I now use reminders and budgeting apps to ensure timely payments. My monthly income is stable, and I am confident I can meet the installment rate of 4% as proposed. Although I do not have a checking or savings account at the moment, my consistent employment and responsibility as a skilled professional demonstrate my reliability.

The car is essential for my daily commute and family responsibilities. I assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate, and this loan will greatly enhance my ability to support my family and maintain my job performance.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Rashid

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, a married father of two, currently employed as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for over 9 years. I am seeking a loan of €717 to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute and family needs.

Although I have had a delay in paying off a previous debt, I have since cleared that balance and learned from the experience. I currently have no other debts, and my employment is permanent and stable. I have lived at my present address for 4 years and have no property of my own except for a used vehicle that I intend to replace.

Without a checking or savings account, I manage my finances in cash but am now looking to formalize my banking relationship. My steady income and long-term employment as a skilled official demonstrate my reliability. I am committed to making all payments on time and believe I am a suitable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Tomasz Nowak
