Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,880 DM to purchase a new television for my household. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 6 years. My wife and I live with our young son in our own home, and I am proud to say that I have maintained steady employment throughout my career.

While my current checking and savings accounts have modest balances due to recent home maintenance expenses and my ongoing support for my family, I have a building society savings agreement in place and a solid employment history. I have managed existing credits responsibly, though I understand my history is not perfect. My current liabilities are well-managed, with no additional installment plans beyond those reported.

I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations, as demonstrated by my professional stability and long-term planning. I believe this loan will improve our family's quality of life and help us stay connected to educational and cultural programming.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may require.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Feldmann

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,880 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my household. As a self-employed IT consultant with 5 years of experience running my own business, I have built a reliable client base and steady income. My wife and I have one child, and we recently purchased our own home in Munich.

Although my checking and savings accounts are currently low due to recent investments in my business, I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations. I hold a life insurance policy as a form of security and have no other guarantors or installment plans.

I am a responsible borrower with two small credits at your bank, which I am repaying on schedule. I understand the importance of maintaining a good credit standing and am committed to fulfilling all terms of this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,880 DM to replace our outdated radio and television set. I am a highly qualified employee at Siemens AG, where I have worked in the engineering division for 6 years. My wife and I live with our 8-year-old son in our own apartment, which we purchased last year.

Our checking and savings balances are currently below 100 DM, as we recently paid for necessary home repairs. I have a life insurance policy and no other installment plans. I have managed previous credits responsibly and have two ongoing credits at your bank, which are in good standing.

I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations and believe that my stable employment and responsible financial history make me a trustworthy candidate. This loan will greatly enhance our family’s quality of life.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
