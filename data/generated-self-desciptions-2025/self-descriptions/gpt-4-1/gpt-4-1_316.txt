Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,494 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik GmbH, where I have been working for 9 months. My salary has been regularly deposited into my checking account, which has maintained a balance of at least 200 DM for over a year.

I am a single father of two children, and reliable transportation is essential for me to commute to work and take care of my family’s needs. I have previously taken out a loan with your bank and have always made payments on time, as reflected in my positive credit history. I own my apartment and have lived at my current address for two years.

Though I do not have a savings account, my property provides financial stability. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate for this loan. I am committed to maintaining my good record with your bank and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Peter Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,494 DM to purchase a new vehicle, which is necessary for my daily commute to my job as a maintenance worker at the city’s public housing authority. I have been with my employer for 7 months and have consistently received my salary through my checking account at your bank for over a year.

I am 29 years old, single, and the sole provider for my two young dependents. I own my home, and my only outstanding credit is with your institution, which I have been servicing punctually. I have no other debts or installment plans.

Although I do not currently hold a savings account, my ownership of real estate demonstrates my financial responsibility. I believe my steady employment and clean credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Andreas Weber

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1,494 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. As a construction laborer at Bauer & Söhne, where I have been employed for the past 10 months, I rely on public transport, which is becoming increasingly unreliable for my work schedule and family needs.

I have two children, whom I support as a single parent. My checking account has a consistent salary assignment and has maintained a balance above 200 DM for more than a year. I own my residence and have lived there for two years.

I have previously taken a loan from your bank, which I have repaid without issue. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. While I do not have a savings account, my real estate holdings provide financial security. I am committed to meeting the installment payments and maintaining my good credit standing.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Michael Hartmann

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,494 DM to purchase a new car. I am a cleaning staff member at Sonnenblick Seniorenheim and have been with the company for 8 months. My salary is deposited directly into my checking account, which has maintained a balance above 200 DM for the past year.

As a single man with two dependents, reliable transportation is crucial for both my work and family responsibilities. I currently own my home and have resided there for two years. My previous loan with your bank was paid off on time, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

Although I do not have a savings account, my property ownership and punctual payment history demonstrate my reliability. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and would appreciate your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Thomas Braun
