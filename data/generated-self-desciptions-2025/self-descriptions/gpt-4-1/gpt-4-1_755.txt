Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schneider, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,771 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the local university, where I have worked for the past 5 years. Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained credit with another institution and have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations.

As a divorced mother of two, I am the sole provider for my family. My savings are limited, but I own a reliable car that I use for commuting to work. My current residence has been my home for the last two years, and I am committed to staying in this community. I do not have any other outstanding debts or guarantors.

My employment is stable, and I have a consistent income that comfortably covers my monthly expenses, including the proposed loan installment rate. I believe that with my steady job, responsible financial habits, and personal integrity, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Schneider
