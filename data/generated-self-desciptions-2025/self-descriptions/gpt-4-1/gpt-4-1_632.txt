Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,660 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 3 years. My current financial situation is somewhat constrained, as my checking account is slightly overdrawn and I have minimal savings (less than 100 DM). Despite this, I have always managed my finances responsibly, and I have a solid credit history, having repaid all previous loans on time.

As a divorced woman with one dependent child, I am committed to providing a stable and enriching environment for my family. The television would serve both as a source of information and educational value for my child. I have lived at my current residence in Munich for 4 years, and own a small car as my primary property.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my stable employment, reliable payment history, and commitment to fulfilling my obligations. Thank you very much for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 3,660 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my apartment. I am currently working as a municipal office administrator in Stuttgart, where I have been employed for 2.5 years. My checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM, but I have successfully repaid all previous credits without any delays.

As a married woman with two teenage children, I want to ensure that my family has access to quality news and entertainment, especially as we spend more time together at home. We have lived at our current address for 4 years and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans besides this application.

Given my stable job, consistent credit history, and responsible financial management, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Keller

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,660 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television, as our old set is no longer functioning. I have been employed as a skilled technician at Siemens AG for 3 years. Although my current checking account balance is negative and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always fulfilled my previous credit obligations promptly and in full.

I am a separated woman with one dependent, and I have lived at my current residence in Frankfurt for the past 4 years. I own a reliable used car, which is my main asset. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am diligent in managing my finances despite some recent challenges.

My stable employment, long-term residence, and proven creditworthiness make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I would be grateful for your support in helping me improve my family’s quality of life.

Sincerely,  
Monika Weber
