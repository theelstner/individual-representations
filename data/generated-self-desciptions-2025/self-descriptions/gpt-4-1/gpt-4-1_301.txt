Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,745 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for five years. My current financial situation is stable: I maintain a checking account with a balance just below 200 DM and have over 1,000 DM in savings bonds. 

Although I have a critical account on record and an existing credit with another bank, I have always honored my financial commitments. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is for a small electronics purchase. I have been living at my current residence for two years and own a car. 

As a skilled professional, I take my obligations seriously and am committed to repaying this loan within the agreed 21-month term. My steady employment, prudent savings, and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Letter 2 – IT Systems Analyst

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 2,745 DM to furnish my apartment and acquire necessary home office equipment. I work as an IT systems analyst at Siemens AG and have been with the company for six years. My checking account balance is currently under 200 DM, but I have maintained savings of over 1,000 DM for emergencies.

While I have a critical account from a previous credit elsewhere, I have consistently made all payments on time. I live alone, have no dependents, and do not share financial obligations with anyone else. I have resided at my current address for two years and own a reliable vehicle.

With a stable job, a proven track record of employment, and responsible financial management, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. I hope you will see me as a reliable applicant.

Kind regards,  
Alexei Novak
