Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Michael Tan, and I am a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past eight years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,614 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and fieldwork assignments.

Although I do not have a current checking account at your bank, I have maintained a consistent employment record and have never defaulted on any of my existing loans, which are held with another institution. My current financial situation is stable, with a monthly salary that comfortably covers my living expenses and existing installment plans. I currently rent a small apartment and have minimal savings, as I have been investing in my professional development.

As a foreign worker, I understand the importance of building trust and reliability. My steady employment, responsible financial management, and commitment to my work make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and honor the terms of the loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Michael Tan

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Khan, and I have been working as a senior project manager at Siemens AG for the past nine years. I am seeking a loan of 6,614 DM to purchase a new car, which is critical for both my professional and personal mobility.

Currently, I do not have a checking account with your bank, but I have maintained credit relationships with other financial institutions and have a solid repayment history, despite a previously critical account due to a temporary relocation overseas. My employment is secure, and I have no dependents, allowing me to allocate a significant portion of my income toward loan repayments. My savings are limited, as I have been supporting family members abroad.

I believe my long-standing employment, transparent financial history, and responsible attitude toward debt make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I am committed to meeting the agreed installment rate and maintaining open communication with your bank.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 6,614 DM. My name is Jan Novak, and I am a self-employed IT consultant with over seven years of experience, currently residing in Munich for the past four years.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank and my current savings are under 100 DM, I have managed several installment plans with other banks without any defaults. As a foreign worker, I have established a strong reputation among my clients for reliability and professionalism. Owning a new car will allow me to expand my client base and improve my business operations.

Despite a critical account in my credit history, I have learned valuable lessons in financial management and have since ensured all obligations are met on time. I am confident that my stable income and disciplined approach make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Best regards,  
Jan Novak
