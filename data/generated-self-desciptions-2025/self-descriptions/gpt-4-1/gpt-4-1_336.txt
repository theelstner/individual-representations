Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 4,110 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment. I am a 23-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. I have been residing at my current rented apartment for 4 years and support my two younger brothers, who are my dependents.

Although my current checking account balance is below zero and my savings are less than 100 DM, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have never missed a payment on my two existing credits at your bank, and I have no other debts or guarantors. My employment is stable, and I have a steady monthly income, which allows me to comfortably meet the proposed installment rate of 3.

I am committed to fulfilling all my financial obligations and believe that this loan will greatly improve my living and working conditions. I assure you of my trustworthiness and dedication to repaying the loan on time.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Arman R.
