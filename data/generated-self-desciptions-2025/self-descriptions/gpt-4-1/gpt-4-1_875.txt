Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of €874 to purchase essential domestic appliances for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Hamburg, a position I have held for the past 8 months. My employment provides a stable monthly income, and I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate of 4.

As a 24-year-old divorced woman with one dependent, I am focused on creating a comfortable and functional living environment for my child and myself. I currently own my home and have real estate property, but I do not have a checking or savings account at this time. However, I have maintained a positive credit history, with all existing credits paid back on time. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am repaying reliably.

I am a foreign worker who has resided at my current address for one year. I have no other debtors or guarantors, nor do I have any other installment plans. I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and believe my track record demonstrates my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller
