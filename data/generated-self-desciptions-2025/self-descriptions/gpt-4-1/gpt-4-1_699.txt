Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Fernandez, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 926 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am a 38-year-old married woman, recently residing in this city for the past two years. I am currently unemployed, having previously worked as a hotel receptionist for eight years before my recent relocation. 

My financial situation is modest; I do not have a checking account or significant savings, with less than 100 DM in my savings account. However, I do hold an active life insurance policy, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. My current housing is owned, and I have one dependent child.

I am applying for this loan because a reliable car is essential for me to seek new employment opportunities and provide for my family. Although my credit history is not perfect, I have consistently met my obligations on my existing credit at your bank and have no other outstanding installment plans or guarantors.

I understand that my situation may seem challenging, but I am committed to repaying this loan and improving my financial standing. I believe that with your support, I can regain stable employment and become a valuable customer of your bank.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Fernandez

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Ivanova. I am a 38-year-old divorced woman and a foreign worker who has been living at my current address for two years. I am seeking a loan of 926 DM to purchase a new car, which I need to commute to job interviews and potential employment.

Currently, I am unemployed, but I have a strong work history as a warehouse assistant for nine years in my home country before moving here. My financial resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings and no checking account. However, I am the sole owner of my home and have a building society savings agreement, reflecting my efforts to plan for the future despite difficult circumstances.

I have one child to support and am fully responsible for her well-being. My credit history has had its challenges, but I have always prioritized my loan repayments, including my existing credit at your bank.

I am confident that with a new car, I will be able to expand my job search and secure employment soon. I am committed to repaying this loan and building a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Elena Ivanova

To the Loan Department,

My name is Amina Diallo, and I am applying for a car loan of 926 DM. As a separated woman aged 38, I have lived in my own home for two years with my young son. I am currently unemployed, having previously worked as a skilled seamstress for seven years before my recent layoff.

Sincerely,
