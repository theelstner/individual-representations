Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,138 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for three years. My current financial situation is challenging; my checking account is overdrawn and I have less than 100 DM in savings. However, I am committed to meeting my financial obligations and have consistently made timely payments on my two existing loans with your bank.

As a single father, I am responsible for my young son, and providing a comfortable home environment is very important to me. I own my apartment and have resided here for four years, ensuring stable housing for my family. Although my job is classified as unskilled, I have demonstrated reliability and a strong work ethic, earning the trust of my employer.

I understand that my credit history includes accounts with other banks, but I have never defaulted on any payments. I am confident that I can manage the installment rate of 4 and honor all repayment terms. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,138 DM to purchase a new radio and television set, which are necessary for both my personal development and to help my young dependent keep up with educational programs. I have been working as a janitor at Berlin Residential Services for two years and, while my income is modest, I have maintained stable employment and housing for the past four years.

Despite my checking account currently being overdrawn and limited savings, I have demonstrated responsibility in managing two existing loans with your institution. My property ownership provides additional security and demonstrates my commitment to long-term stability in Germany as a foreign worker.

Though my credit history includes a critical account, I have learned from past mistakes and am determined to improve my financial standing. I am single, with no other debts or guarantors, and am focused on providing for my dependent. I assure you of my commitment to making all payments as scheduled.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Jan Kowalski

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 1,138 DM to purchase a television, which will greatly enhance the quality of life for my child and me. As a single, 25-year-old foreign worker, I have worked as a delivery assistant at EuroGrocer for nearly four years. My current financial situation is tight, with an overdrawn checking account and minimal savings, but I have managed my existing two credits at your bank responsibly.

I own my apartment and have lived here for four years, ensuring a stable home for my dependent. While my employment is unskilled, I have always prioritized fulfilling my financial commitments. I do not have any additional debts or installment plans, and my only dependent is my child.

Although my credit history is not perfect, I am making every effort to improve it. I am confident that my employment and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for your time.
