Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,122 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller & Söhne Logistics, where I have been working for three years. My position provides a stable, if modest, monthly income, and I am committed to improving my financial situation for the benefit of my two children, who live with me.

While my current checking account is overdrawn, this is a temporary situation due to recent unexpected expenses related to my children’s schooling. I have a small amount of savings, less than 100 DM, but I do own a share in my family’s real estate, which provides some financial security. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I am repaying regularly and on time.

I am single and have been living at my current rented residence for two years. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My previous credit history reflects some challenges, but I have always made efforts to meet my obligations and am confident in my ability to continue doing so. The new car will enable me to commute to work more reliably and support my family better.

I am a responsible and dedicated individual, and I assure you that I will honor the terms of this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jens Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Richter, and I am applying for a loan of 2,122 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a janitorial staff member at the Berlin City Hospital for just over two years. My job is secure, and my income, while not high, is steady.

Currently, my checking account is in the negative due to a recent emergency repair on my rental apartment. I have minimal savings, but I do have a partial ownership in a property inherited from my parents, which I consider a sign of my long-term stability. I am a single father of two, striving to provide them with a better life.

I have two ongoing credits with your bank, both of which are being paid on schedule. Despite some critical notes in my credit history, I have learned from past mistakes and have demonstrated improved financial discipline. I do not have any other outstanding debts or installment plans.

Acquiring a new car will greatly improve my ability to fulfill my work and family responsibilities. I am committed to meeting my repayment obligations and would appreciate your support.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Richter

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 2,122 DM to finance the purchase of a new car, which is essential for my daily commute to my job as a night shift security guard at Schmidt & Partner Security Services, where I have been employed for nearly three years.

My current financial situation is challenging, as my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I own a portion of a family property in Brandenburg, which adds to my financial reliability. I am single, have two dependents, and have been residing at my current rented apartment for two years.

I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly. While my credit history includes some critical entries from previous hardships, I have demonstrated consistent improvement and responsibility. I have no other debts or installment plans.

The new car will ensure I can maintain my employment and continue supporting my children. I am dedicated to fulfilling my financial commitments and am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,122 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a construction laborer at Bauer Bauunternehmen for almost four years. My employment provides a steady income, and I am the sole provider for my two children.

Currently, my checking account is negative, primarily due to recent expenses for my children’s healthcare. My savings are under 100 DM, but I do hold a share in family-owned real estate, which serves as a financial backup. I am single and have lived in my rented apartment for two years.

I have two active credits with your bank, and I have been diligent in making regular payments. Although my credit history is not perfect, I have taken steps to improve my financial discipline. I have no additional debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

A new car is vital for my work and family commitments. I am responsible and committed to repaying this loan in full and on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
