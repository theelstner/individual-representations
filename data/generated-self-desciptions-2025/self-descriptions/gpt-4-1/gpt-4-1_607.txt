Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,828 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home and office. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 2 years. I am 22 years old, single, and have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I support while he completes his studies.

My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have a savings balance of 650 DM. I have previously taken out a credit with your bank, which I repaid in full and on time. I have no other debts and no guarantors. My only ongoing installment plan is with a local electronics store.

I own my residence and also possess real estate, which further secures my financial standing. I believe my stable employment, history of responsible credit management, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The new furniture and equipment will improve my productivity at work and the comfort of my home, directly contributing to my continued professional success.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time to provide further information.

Sincerely,

Andreas Schmitt

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 2,828 DM loan to purchase new furniture and computer equipment for my apartment. I am a junior IT specialist at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 3 years. At 22 years old, I am single and the primary supporter of my younger sister.

Although my checking account is currently negative, I have 720 DM in my savings account. I have always paid back my previous credit with your bank on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only installment plan is with Möbelhaus Kraus for a previous furniture purchase.

I own my home and a small plot of land, which underscores my financial responsibility. My steady job and history of timely repayments show my reliability as a borrower. The requested funds will allow me to furnish my home office, which is essential for my work-from-home arrangements.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.

Best regards,

Michael Bauer
