Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 1,381 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 35-year-old divorced mother of one, originally from Hungary, and have been living in Bremen for the past two years. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years, and my employment is stable and long-term.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to recent unexpected expenses, but I have no other outstanding debts, and my credit history is impeccable—I have always repaid my previous loan at your bank on time. I do not have a savings account, but I do possess a life insurance policy, which adds to my financial security.

Owning a reliable car is essential for my job and for taking my son to school and activities. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 4% given my steady income and responsible financial management. I hope you will consider my application favorably, as this car will greatly improve both my professional and family life.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Elena Kovacs

Dear Credit Department,

Owning a car will not only help with my daily commute but also support my son’s extracurricular activities. My job is permanent, and my income is sufficient to cover the monthly installment rate. I have no other debts or guarantors and own my home, which further ensures my stability.
