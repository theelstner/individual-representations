Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 14,027 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for 5 years. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and my savings are limited to 80 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back diligently and on time.

The need for a new car has become pressing, as my previous vehicle is no longer reliable for commuting between research sites and caring for my young daughter. As a single father, reliable transportation is essential to fulfill both my professional and personal responsibilities.

Despite limited savings, my steady employment and consistent repayment record demonstrate my financial responsibility. My monthly salary is sufficient to cover the installment rate of 4, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I have been living in my own apartment for 2 years, and I am committed to maintaining my good credit standing.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 14,027 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Michael Schuster, and I am a self-employed graphic designer, operating my own business for the past 4 years. My checking account currently holds 75 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid on time.

A new car is necessary to expand my business, as I need to travel to clients throughout the region. My business income is stable and growing, and I have no other debts or financial obligations besides supporting my 3-year-old son.

I have demonstrated my trustworthiness through my punctual credit repayments and my commitment to my business. My residence of 2 years is owned, and I am registered as a foreign worker but have established a reliable financial record in Germany.

I appreciate your consideration and am confident that I can fulfill the loan obligations. Thank you for your time.

Best regards,  
Michael Schuster
