Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 12,204 DM over a period of 48 months. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 2.5 years. I am seeking this loan to establish a small laboratory equipment supply company, leveraging my expertise and network within the research community.

My financial situation is stable, although my current checking account balance is modest, typically ranging between 100 and 150 DM. I do not have a savings account at present, as I have been investing in preparatory work for my business. Importantly, I have never taken out a loan before, and my credit history is impeccable, with all previous obligations paid promptly.

I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my current address for just over two years. I own a reliable car, which supports my mobility for business development. I have no other debts or guarantors and am fully committed to this venture.

Given my professional background, responsible financial behavior, and clear business plan, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident that I will be able to meet all repayment obligations on time.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Michael Weber

Letter 2 – Restaurant Manager

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 12,204 DM loan to open a small bistro in the city center. I am currently a restaurant manager at Café Linden for the past three years and have gained extensive experience in hospitality management and customer service.

My checking account balance currently stands at around 170 DM, as I have been using most of my earnings to support my business plan. I have never defaulted on any payments or taken out previous credits, as reflected in my clean credit history.

I live alone, have no dependents, and have resided at my current address for two years. I have no savings account but own a used delivery van, which will be essential for my business operations. My current installment obligations are manageable, and I have no other loans or guarantors.

As a self-employed professional with a proven track record in the industry, I am confident in my ability to make this business a success and repay the loan in full. My commitment and financial discipline make me a reliable candidate for your support.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Andreas Schmitt
