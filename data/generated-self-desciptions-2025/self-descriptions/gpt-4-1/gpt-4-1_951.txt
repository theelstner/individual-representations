Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,621 DM to purchase a new television set for my apartment. I am a single male, 36 years old, working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My employment has been stable and rewarding, with a steady income that comfortably covers my monthly expenses.

I have always been diligent in managing my financial obligations. I have existing credits that I have paid back in full and on time, demonstrating my reliability and sense of responsibility. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance of 420 DM and own a reliable car.

I have lived at my current address for four years, and my installment rate for the requested loan will be manageable within my budget. I have no other debts, dependents, or guarantors, and my official employment status ensures a consistent income. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response and am happy to provide any further information if required.

Sincerely,
