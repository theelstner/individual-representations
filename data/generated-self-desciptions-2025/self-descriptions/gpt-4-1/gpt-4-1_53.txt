Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, and I am writing to apply for a car loan of 5,965 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I am currently employed as a senior logistics manager at EuroTrans GmbH, where I have worked for the past 8 years. As a foreign worker from Serbia, I have established myself in Germany over the last two years, and my role requires frequent travel between regional offices.

My financial situation is stable, but my savings are limited, with less than 100 DM in my savings account. My checking account balance is also below 200 DM, as I am supporting family back home and investing in my professional development. While I have experienced a delay in repaying a previous credit, I have since taken significant steps to improve my financial discipline and have maintained timely payments on all current obligations.

I am seeking this loan to purchase a used car, which is essential for my job and will help me improve my efficiency and reliability at work. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am responsible for my own credit. My employment is secure, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 5,965 DM to purchase a used car, which is crucial for my work as a project manager at TechnoBuild AG. I have been employed with the company for 7 years, overseeing construction sites across the region. My role demands frequent travel, and a personal vehicle is essential.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts have minimal balances, as I recently relocated and furnished my new apartment. My credit history does show a delay in repayment from three years ago, which was due to an unexpected family emergency. Since then, I have consistently met all my financial obligations and have no outstanding debts.

I live alone, have no dependents, and have managed my own finances responsibly since moving to this city two years ago. I am a single male, 35 years old, and a foreign worker from Poland. My employment is stable, and I have a strong record of professional achievement.

I assure you of my reliability and commitment to repaying the loan. Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,
Marek Nowak

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, and I am seeking a loan of 5,965 DM to purchase a used car. I am a self-employed IT consultant with over 9 years of experience, currently serving clients across several cities. Reliable transportation is vital for my business, and public transport has proven insufficient for my needs.

Though my current account and savings are below 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, I maintain a steady income from my consultancy. I did have a delay in paying off a previous credit four years ago, which occurred during a challenging period of business restructuring. I have since rebuilt my credit standing and have not missed a payment since.

I have no other debts, and I am solely responsible for my credit at your bank. I have resided in my current apartment for two years and am committed to staying in this community. I am a single male, 38 years old, and a foreign worker from Egypt.

I believe my professional track record and improved financial discipline make me a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Best regards,
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,965 DM to buy a used car for commuting to my workplace. My name is Ivan Dimitrov, and I am a senior engineer at GreenPower Solutions, where I have been employed for 8 years. My current residence is two years old, and I have no other installment plans or debts.

Due to supporting my family abroad, my checking and savings accounts are both under 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively. Although I had a delay in credit repayment in the past, I have since demonstrated financial responsibility and have no outstanding debts.

As a single male, 36 years old, and a foreign worker from Bulgaria, I am solely responsible for my finances. My position is secure, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. A car is essential for my work, and this investment will directly support my continued employment and productivity.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ivan Dimitrov

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a 5,965 DM loan to purchase a used vehicle. My name is Samuel Mensah, and I am a financial analyst at Allianz Versicherung, where I have worked for 10 years. My job requires frequent travel to client sites, and reliable transportation is necessary for me to perform my duties effectively.

Currently, my checking and savings balances are low due to recent expenses related to professional certification courses. While my credit history shows a delayed payment from five years ago, this was an isolated incident during a period of family medical issues. Since then, I have maintained a perfect repayment record.

I live alone, have no dependents, and am a single male, 40 years old, originally from Ghana. I have lived at my current address for two years and have managed all my own credits at your bank.

My stable employment and commitment to financial responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Samuel Mensah
