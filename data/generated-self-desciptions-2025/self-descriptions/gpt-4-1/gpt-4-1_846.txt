Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,422 DM for the purpose of purchasing new furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and well-regarded.

Although I do not have a checking account at this time, I have maintained a good credit history, having paid back all existing credits on time. I own my residence and have lived here for 4 years. I am also the holder of a life insurance policy, which adds to my financial security.

As a single father of two children, I am committed to providing a comfortable home for my family. My savings are currently under 100 DM, as I have recently invested in my children’s education. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my only other installment plans are with the bank.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my stable employment, responsible credit history, and commitment to meeting my financial obligations. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 3,422 DM to purchase essential equipment for my home office. I have been employed as a civil service administrator at the City Council for 9 years, and I take pride in my stable and reliable employment.

My credit history is strong, with all previous loans repaid promptly. I do not have a checking account, but my financial discipline is reflected in my consistent payment record. I own my home, where I have lived for 4 years, and I have a building society savings agreement in place as an additional asset.

As a single man supporting two dependents, I am careful with my finances. My current savings are below 100 DM, as I have allocated most of my resources toward my children’s well-being. I have no co-signers or other debtors, and my only other installment commitments are with this bank, where I have three active credits, all in good standing.

I am confident that my employment stability, responsible borrowing history, and personal commitment to financial obligations make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 3,422 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my household. I am a production supervisor at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 7 years. My position provides me with a steady and sufficient income.

I have no checking account at the moment, but I have always managed my finances prudently. My credit history is excellent, with all previous loans fully repaid on time. I have lived in my own home for the past 4 years and hold a life insurance policy as additional security.

As a single father of two, I strive to maintain a stable and nurturing environment for my children. My savings are currently less than 100 DM due to recent household expenses. I have no other debts outside of three credits at your bank, all of which are up to date.

Given my long-term employment, strong credit record, and sense of personal responsibility, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Michael Schuster
