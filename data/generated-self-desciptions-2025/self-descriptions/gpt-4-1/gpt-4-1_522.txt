Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Petrov, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,507 DM to cover urgent repairs to my apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the local university, where I have been employed for the past eight years. My position is stable and I have a steady monthly income.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I have maintained two credits with your bank over the past two years, both of which I have serviced reliably. My savings are modest, under 100 DM, as I support my 12-year-old son as a single father and send remittances to my family abroad. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my residence has been stable for four years.

Although my credit history includes critical accounts with other banks, I am committed to meeting my obligations. My housing is provided for free by my employer, which helps keep my expenses low. I am a foreign worker, but I have integrated well into the community and take my financial responsibilities seriously.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan as agreed and appreciate your trust.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,507 DM for essential repairs to my car, which I need to commute to my job as a customs officer at the city port. I have been in this position for seven years, and my employment is secure.

As a single man with one dependent, my financial resources are limited, with savings below 100 DM. I have no checking account but have maintained two existing credits with your bank for the past two years without default. My housing is provided by my employer, and I do not have any other installment plans or debts.

My credit history includes a critical account with another bank, which was due to a temporary illness two years ago. I have since stabilized my finances and have been punctual with all my payments. I have lived at my current address for four years and am committed to my responsibilities as a foreign worker.

I am trustworthy and dedicated, and I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan on schedule. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

I have been employed as a skilled electrician at the local power company for the past nine years. My job is stable and my income covers my living expenses, though I have minimal savings.

I have resided at my current address for four years, and my housing is provided free of charge by my employer. I am a single father supporting my teenage daughter. I do not have a checking account, but I have two existing credits with your institution, which I have always paid on time.

While my credit history with another bank is not perfect, I have demonstrated responsibility with my obligations at your bank. I have no other debts or guarantors. As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building a good life for my family and take my financial commitments seriously.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and hope to continue my relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,

Dear Banking Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 5,507 DM to finance necessary repairs to my home appliances. My name is Ivan Dimitrov, and I have worked as an administrative official in the city hall for the past eight years. My employment is secure and provides a regular income.

I currently do not hold a checking account and have less than 100 DM in savings, as I support my son and cover living costs as a single parent. My residence has been stable for four years, and I live rent-free in a municipal apartment. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

Although I have a critical account with another bank, I have learned from past mistakes and have maintained a positive record with your institution. I have no other debts or installment plans. As a foreign worker, I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and contributing positively to the community.

I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and value your trust.

Best regards,  
Ivan Dimitrov
