Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,433 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am 25 years old, married, and have one dependent child. I have been working as a laboratory research assistant at the Dresden Institute of Technology for the past two years. 

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM. I am also repaying two small credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly. My credit history includes a critical account, but that was due to unforeseen medical expenses last year which have since been resolved. I have no other installment plans or co-debtors, and my only property is a life insurance policy.

I have been living at my current rented residence for three years, and have consistently paid my rent on time. As a skilled employee with a stable position and a building society savings agreement, I am committed to improving my financial standing. This loan will help me create a comfortable home for my child and myself, allowing me to focus on my career and family. 

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my dedication to meeting all repayment obligations.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktoria Schmidt. I am a 25-year-old skilled office administrator, divorced, and a mother to a five-year-old son. I have been employed at Müller & Partners Legal Services for three years and have a stable monthly income. I am seeking a loan of 1,433 DM to purchase much-needed furniture and a computer for my home, which will greatly improve our living situation and support my ability to work from home when needed.

Although my checking account currently has a negative balance and my savings are minimal, I have always prioritized my financial responsibilities. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are up-to-date. My credit history shows some past issues due to a previous divorce settlement, but I have since maintained a good repayment record.

I have lived at my current address for three years, have no other installment plans, and all my property is tied up in a building society savings agreement. I pay rent and have no telephone line at present, but I am diligent about my obligations and have no other debts or guarantors.

I am confident that my stable employment and responsible attitude make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Viktoria Schmidt

To whom it may concern,

My name is Anja Novak. I am 25 years old, separated, and have a young daughter. I have been a skilled employee at Siemens AG in Leipzig for almost four years. I am applying for a loan of 1,433 DM to purchase basic furniture and a washing machine, as I recently moved into a new apartment after my separation.

My current financial situation is challenging, with an overdrawn checking account and savings below 100 DM. Despite this, I have maintained two credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing. My credit history includes a critical account, which was the result of transitional difficulties after my separation, but I have since regained financial stability.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or co-signers. I have lived in my rented flat for three years, and my only property is a life insurance policy. As a foreign worker, I am determined to build a secure future for my daughter and myself.

I am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations and am grateful for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Anja Novak

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Maria Sanchez, and I am a 25-year-old married woman with one child. I have been employed as a customs official in Hamburg for just over three years. I am writing to request a loan of 1,433 DM to purchase furniture and a home computer, which are essential for my family’s well-being and my job-related needs.

I currently rent my home and have lived here for three years. My checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I have managed without any missed payments. My credit history reflects a critical account, but this was due to temporary unemployment last year, which has since been resolved. My only property is a building society savings agreement.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and there are no guarantors involved. As a responsible employee and devoted mother, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule.

Thank you for considering my loan application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Sanchez

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Fatima Yilmaz, I am 25 years old, divorced, and support my six-year-old son. For the past two years, I have worked as a skilled accounting clerk at Bayer GmbH in Cologne. I am applying for a loan of 1,433 DM to purchase essential furniture and a refrigerator for our home, as our current circumstances are quite modest.

My checking account is currently negative, and my savings are limited to less than 100 DM. I have two existing loans with your bank, both of which are being repaid as agreed. While my credit history shows a critical account, this was a result of financial strain following my divorce, but I have since stabilized my situation.

I have rented my apartment for three years, have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and my only asset is a life insurance policy. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a secure and stable life for my child.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am dedicated to fulfilling all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Fatima Yilmaz
