Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Novak, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €1,169 to purchase a new television set. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 2 years and 7 months. I am 29 years old, single, and have one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have two existing credits with your institution that I have consistently paid on time. My credit history reflects some challenges with other lenders in the past, but I have since stabilized my finances. My current income is steady, and I own my apartment, which gives me a strong base of financial security. I also have a life insurance policy as an additional asset.

I am committed to meeting my financial obligations, as demonstrated by my employment stability and responsible management of my existing credits. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Peter Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Alexander Schulz, and I am seeking a loan of €1,169 to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. I am a customer service specialist at Deutsche Telekom, a position I have held for just over 3 years. I live alone with my 6-year-old daughter, whom I support as my dependent.

I do not currently have a checking or savings account with your bank, but I have two active loans here, both of which are in good standing. While my credit history includes a critical account with another lender, I have taken steps to resolve past issues and have maintained a perfect payment record with your bank.

My stable employment and ownership of my residence give me confidence in my ability to repay this loan. I also have a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Kind regards,
Alexander Schulz
