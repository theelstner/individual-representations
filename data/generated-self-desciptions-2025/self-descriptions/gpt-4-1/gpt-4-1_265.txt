Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,748 DM to support my ongoing education. My name is Marta Ivanova, and I have been working as a hospital orderly at St. Agnes Hospital for the past 8 years. As a divorced woman of 57 with one dependent, I am determined to improve my qualifications and secure better employment prospects by enrolling in a vocational nursing course.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained three credit accounts with your bank for the past year, all of which are in good standing despite my critical credit history elsewhere. My financial situation is modest: I have less than 100 DM in savings and no property, but my housing is provided by my employer, which helps me keep my living expenses low.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2, as I have consistently managed my other installment plans. My long-term employment and stable residence for the past four years reflect my reliability. I am committed to using this loan responsibly to further my education and improve my family’s future.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marta Ivanova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Fatima Ouedraogo, and I am applying for a loan of 2,748 DM to fund my studies in business administration at the local technical college. I am a married woman, 57 years old, and have lived at my current address for four years. I have worked as a cafeteria assistant at Central Market for 9 years, and I am also a foreign worker.

I have no checking account, and my savings are below 100 DM. While my credit history includes some critical accounts with other lenders, my three credits at your bank have always been paid on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my housing is provided by my employer, so I pay no rent.

I am dedicated to improving my situation through education, and I have shown stability through my long employment and responsible payment history with your bank. I believe this investment in my education will allow me to provide better for my dependent and contribute more to my community.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Fatima Ouedraogo

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Liliya Petrescu, and I am seeking a loan of 2,748 DM to attend a certified caregiver training program. At 57, I am separated and support my adult son who is unable to work. I have been employed as a janitorial staff member at Sunrise Apartments for 8 years.

Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, I have demonstrated my reliability by maintaining three current credits with your bank, all serviced regularly. My credit history is not perfect due to past financial struggles, but I have no current delinquencies or guarantors.

My employer provides my housing, which alleviates a significant financial burden. I have lived at my present address for four years and have always fulfilled my obligations. I am confident that further education will allow me to improve my income and stability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Liliya Petrescu
