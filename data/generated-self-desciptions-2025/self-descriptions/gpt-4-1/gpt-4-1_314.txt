Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 3,749 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for the past 9 months. My monthly salary has been deposited into my checking account with your bank for over a year, and my account balance consistently exceeds 200 DM.

As a divorced woman with one dependent child, I am focused on providing a stable and comfortable environment for my family. I have previously taken out two small credits with your bank, both of which I repaid in full and on time. My savings are currently below 100 DM, as I have recently moved into a new apartment after my separation and purchased a used car for essential commuting.

I have no other debts or guarantors and have lived at my present address for four years. I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate of 2%, given my steady employment and responsible financial history. I kindly ask you to consider my application, as this support will greatly improve our living situation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martina Schmidt, and I am writing to request a loan of 3,749 DM for the purpose of buying essential equipment and furniture for my new home. I have been employed as an administrative officer at the City Council for the past 10 months, and my salary has been regularly deposited into my checking account with your institution for over a year.

Following my recent separation, I have been working hard to establish a stable household for myself and my two children. I have previously taken out and repaid a consumer loan with your bank, and my credit history is positive. At present, my savings are under 100 DM, as I have used most of my resources to secure our current residence, where we have lived for four years.

I own a small car, which is necessary for commuting to work and supporting my family. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My employment is secure, and I am dedicated to meeting all financial obligations. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,  
Martina Schmidt

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,749 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my household. My name is Sabine Krause, and I have been working as a certified dental technician for the past 11 months. My salary is paid directly into my checking account at your bank, which I have maintained in good standing with a consistent balance above 200 DM for over a year.

As a married woman with one dependent, I am committed to creating a comfortable home for my family. I have always repaid my previous credits on time, demonstrating my financial reliability. Currently, I have less than 100 DM in savings, as I recently invested in a used car to facilitate my commute to work.

I have no co-signers, and I am not responsible for any other installment plans except for a minor electronics purchase, which will be fully paid off in 26 months. We have lived at our current address for four years, and I have no other outstanding debts. I am confident in my ability to make the monthly payments, thanks to my stable job and responsible budgeting.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Sabine Krause
