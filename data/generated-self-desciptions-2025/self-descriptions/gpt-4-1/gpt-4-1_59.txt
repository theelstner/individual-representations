Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 9,566 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am a married woman, aged 35, working as a scientific research assistant at the Institute of Environmental Studies, where I have been employed for three years. My current financial situation is stable, with a regular income and no other significant debts apart from a small store credit that I manage responsibly.

I do not currently have a checking account, but I have maintained a savings account with a balance below 100 DM due to my commitment to supporting my family and investing in my career. I have lived at my current residence for two years, and I own a reliable car as my main property. My employment and residence history reflect my stability and dedication.

I am requesting this loan to enhance my family's access to information and entertainment, which is particularly important for my children’s education. I am confident in my ability to make the installment payments on time, as I have a strong record of managing my finances and repaying my obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Sabine Müller, and I am a divorced female, currently employed as a legal secretary at a local law firm for the past two and a half years. I am seeking a loan of 9,566 DM to purchase a modern radio and television set for my apartment above the store I manage.

My credit history includes a store credit, which I am repaying on schedule. I have lived in my current residence for two years and have no dependents or guarantors.
