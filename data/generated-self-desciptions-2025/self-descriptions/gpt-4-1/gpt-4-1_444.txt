Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a personal loan of 2,629 DM from your bank. I am a 34-year-old single male, currently working as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich, where I have been employed for the past three years. My present residence in Munich has been stable for three years, and I am a foreign worker from Italy, fully integrated into the local community.

The purpose of this loan is to cover unexpected medical expenses for my elderly parents back home, as well as minor home repairs in my apartment. My current financial situation is modest, with my checking account balance below 200 DM and my savings at less than 100 DM. I have previously encountered a delay in paying off a small loan, which was due to a temporary employment gap. However, I have since maintained a steady income and have no other debts or guarantors involved.

Despite my limited savings, my regular monthly salary, responsible employment history, and long-term residence demonstrate my reliability. I have always prioritized my financial obligations and have learned from past mistakes. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2 and fulfill all repayment terms.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Luca Romano

Letter 2 – Retail Store Supervisor

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am seeking a loan of 2,629 DM to support the purchase of a used car, which is essential for my daily commute to my workplace as a retail store supervisor. I have held this position for the past two years at a large department store in Frankfurt.

As a single, 29-year-old foreign worker from Poland, I have lived at my current address for three years. My financial situation is currently tight, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings. I have no other outstanding loans or guarantors and reside in bank-provided housing.

While I did experience a delay in repaying a previous loan during a difficult period last year, my employment has since stabilized. I have taken steps to improve my financial management and am now confident in my ability to handle the proposed monthly installments.

With a steady job, responsible attitude, and clear purpose for the loan, I am a trustworthy candidate. This loan will help me maintain job security and improve my quality of life. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Thomas Berger
