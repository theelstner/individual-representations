Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anna Schreiber, and I am applying for a loan of 1,131 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. After my recent divorce, I moved to a new residence in Stuttgart and have been living here for 2 years. I am currently unemployed, having previously worked as a scientific research assistant for 8 years at the University of Stuttgart. I have always managed my finances responsibly; all my previous credits have been repaid on time, which is reflected in my clean credit history.  

Although my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 and 100 DM respectively, I have no other debts or guarantors. The loan will help me furnish my apartment and support my efforts to re-enter the workforce. I am confident that my professional background and history of financial responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Schreiber

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Petra Becker, and I am seeking a loan of 1,131 DM to purchase necessary equipment and furniture for my home. As a recently separated mother of one, I have been living in my current apartment in Leipzig for 2 years. I have always worked as a skilled employee, most recently as an administrative officer at a local insurance agency for 10 years before being laid off last year.  

Despite my current unemployment status, I have a proven record of repaying all previous credits on time, with no outstanding debts. My checking and savings accounts are currently low, but I am actively seeking new employment and am confident in my ability to resume regular payments. I own my car, which adds to my financial stability, and have no other installment plans or obligations.  

I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan in a timely manner.  

Best regards,  
Petra Becker

Dear Bank Manager,  

I am Maria Hoffmann, a 39-year-old married woman residing in Frankfurt for the past 2 years. I am applying for a loan of 1,131 DM to buy furniture and some equipment for my family’s new apartment. After being laid off from my position as a technical officer at Siemens, I have been unemployed for 18 months but continue to look for new opportunities.  

Throughout my career, I have maintained a strong credit history, having paid off all previous loans as agreed. My checking and savings accounts currently have limited funds due to the recent move and family expenses. However, I have no outstanding debts, and my husband and I own a car, which is our only property.  

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly, as I have demonstrated reliability in all my previous financial dealings. Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours sincerely,  
Maria Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  

My name is Sabine Müller. I am a divorced woman living in Munich for the past 2 years, and I am applying for a loan of 1,131 DM to purchase necessary home furniture and equipment. I previously worked as a logistics coordinator for 9 years at DHL until my recent unemployment. Despite my current situation, I have always met my financial obligations, with all previous credits paid back on time.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM, but I have no other debts or guarantors. I have no housing obligations, and the only property I own is my car. The installment rate is manageable for me, and I am actively searching for new employment to further stabilize my finances.  

I am a responsible and reliable individual, and I am committed to honoring my repayment schedule. Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Sabine Müller
