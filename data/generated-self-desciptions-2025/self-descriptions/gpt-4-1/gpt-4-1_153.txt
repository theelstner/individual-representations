Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,924 DM to purchase a new television for my household. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years, where I have established a stable income. My current financial situation is modest; I have less than 100 DM in my savings account, but I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have a history of credit with your bank, and all previous credits have been repaid on time.

I do not have any other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I own my own apartment, which provides additional security. I have lived at my current address for four years and have one dependent, my son. My employment is secure, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments as proposed.

I believe my record of reliability and my stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Stefan Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,924 DM to purchase a radio and television for my home. I have been working as a postal service official for two years, and I have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility, as evidenced by my timely repayment of my previous loan with your bank.

Although my savings are currently under 100 DM, I have a life insurance policy that provides additional financial security. I own my home, have resided at my current address for four years, and have no other outstanding loans or installment plans. As a single father of a teenage daughter, I am committed to providing a comfortable living environment for my family.

My steady employment and clean credit history reflect my reliability. I am confident I can meet the low installment rate without difficulty. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker
