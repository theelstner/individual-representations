Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,260 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Bayer AG, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My current financial situation is stable, with a checking account balance under 200 DM and minimal savings, but I have always made timely payments on my existing credit with your bank.

As a single father with one dependent, reliable transportation is crucial for both my job and family responsibilities. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only current credit is with your institution, which I have managed responsibly. Although I rent my home, I own a small piece of real estate in my home country, which provides additional security.

Given my consistent employment, responsible repayment history, and the necessity of this purchase, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 6,260 DM to buy a new car, which is essential for my daily commute to my job as a construction laborer with Hochtief, where I have been employed for 4 years. My checking and savings balances are currently low, but I have a solid record of paying back my existing credit on time.

I am 28 years old, living in rented accommodation in Frankfurt for the past 3 years, and I support my younger brother. I have no other installment plans or debts, and my previous loan with your bank has been managed without issue. While I am classified as an unskilled worker, my steady employment and ownership of a small plot of land in Turkey provide stability.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations, as demonstrated by my history. I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue building a positive relationship with your bank.

Best regards,
Ali Yilmaz

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a 6,260 DM loan to purchase a new vehicle, which is necessary for my position as a delivery assistant at Deutsche Post, where I have worked for 6 years. My checking account is under 200 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, but I have always paid my existing credit with your bank on time.

I have lived in my current rented apartment for 3 years and am responsible for my teenage sister. As a foreign worker from Poland, I also own a modest real estate asset back home, which adds to my financial security. I have no other loans or debts and do not have a telephone line.

Given my responsible credit history, stable employment, and the importance of reliable transportation for my job and family, I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,260 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been working as a janitorial assistant at Siemens for the last 4 years, during which I have maintained a consistent record of repaying my existing credit with your bank.

Although my checking and savings accounts are modest, I have managed my finances prudently while supporting my young daughter. I rent my current apartment and have resided there for 3 years. My only property is a small parcel of land inherited from my family in Greece.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I am committed to meeting my obligations and believe my employment history and timely repayments demonstrate my reliability. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Yours sincerely,
Nikos Papadopoulos
