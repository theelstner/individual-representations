Letter 1 – From a Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 8,978 DM to purchase a new car. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past eight years. I am currently divorced and live with my teenage son in a home I own in Munich, where I have resided for four years.

My financial situation is stable: although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, I have consistently paid back all previous credits on time, as reflected in my credit history with your bank. I currently have one existing credit with your institution, which is being serviced without issue. I do not have any additional debts or installment plans elsewhere.

As my job requires frequent travel between research sites, a reliable vehicle is essential. I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance as additional security, and my telephone is registered under my name for contact purposes.

Given my steady employment, responsible credit history, and commitment to meeting my obligations, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Markus Weber

Letter 2 – From a Small Business Owner

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 8,978 DM to purchase a new vehicle for my consulting business. I have been self-employed as the owner of Weber Consulting Services for the past nine years, providing IT solutions to clients across Bavaria. As a divorced father with one dependent, I have managed to maintain a stable home for my son and me in my own property in Augsburg, where we have lived for four years.

While my checking account currently shows a negative balance, I have always repaid my loans on time, including the existing credit I hold with your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I have a life insurance policy in place.

My business is growing, and a new car is necessary to meet increasing client demands and ensure punctual service. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate, as my business revenues are steady and I have a strong track record of financial responsibility.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Reliable transportation is crucial for my work, as I am often on call and need to respond quickly to emergencies. My long-term employment, excellent credit history, and commitment to my financial obligations demonstrate my reliability.
