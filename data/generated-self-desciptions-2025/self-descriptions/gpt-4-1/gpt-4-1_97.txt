Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 15,945 DM. My name is Karl Weber, a 58-year-old single father with one dependent. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at Biotech Solutions, having started less than a year ago. I have been living at my current rented residence in Stuttgart for the past four years.

The purpose of this loan is to help me start a small consulting business in the field of agricultural biotechnology. My current financial situation is modest: my checking account balance is under 200 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have an excellent credit history, with no previous loans or all past credits paid back on time. I have one small existing credit with your bank, which I have managed responsibly.

Despite my limited current employment tenure, I have over 30 years of experience as a skilled employee, and I am confident in my ability to make regular installment payments. I am trustworthy, have no other debts, and am committed to using this loan to build a stable future for myself and my son.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Karl Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Demir, and I am seeking a loan of 15,945 DM to expand my small electronics repair shop into a full-service business. I am a 58-year-old registered foreign worker, single, and have been living at my current rented apartment in Munich for four years with my teenage daughter.

I have been employed as a skilled technician at Siemens AG for the past nine months. My current checking and savings account balances are below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively.
