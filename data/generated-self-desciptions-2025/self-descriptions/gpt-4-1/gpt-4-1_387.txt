Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Schneider, and I am applying for a loan of 2,238 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have worked for the past 2 years. My employment is stable, and I have a regular monthly income.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained other credit relationships responsibly outside of your bank. My savings are limited, with less than 100 DM in bonds, but I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my monthly installment rate is manageable at 2. I have lived at my present address for just over a year, and I own a car as my primary property.

As a divorced woman with one dependent, I am committed to providing a comfortable and educational home environment for my child. The new radio and television will not only serve our needs but also support my ongoing research and professional development. I have no other installment plans except for a minor furniture purchase, and I am not a foreign worker.

I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate who has always met my financial obligations. I look forward to your positive response and am happy to provide any further information you may require.

Sincerely,
Anna Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Beate Müller, and I am seeking a loan of 2,238 DM to buy a radio and television set for my apartment. I work as a legal secretary at a mid-sized law firm in Frankfurt, a position I have held for 3 years. My employment is secure, and I have a steady income, although my savings are currently below 100 DM.

I do not yet have a checking account with your bank, but I have maintained credit arrangements at another institution, which I have managed diligently. I have no co-signers or guarantors, and my current installment commitments are limited to a small appliance loan. My monthly installment rate for this loan will be quite affordable for me.

I am married with one dependent, and we have lived at our current address for just over a year. I own a car, which is my main asset. Although my credit history includes a critical account, I have always made payments on time and am committed to financial responsibility.

The radio and television will allow my family to stay informed and entertained, and will also assist me in my professional life as I often need to follow legal news and developments. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and would appreciate your consideration.

Thank you very much for your time.

Kind regards,
Beate Müller
