Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Petra Schneider, and I am applying for a car loan of 12,579 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, where I manage a team of junior researchers. As a divorced mother of one, dependable transportation is essential for balancing my work responsibilities and family life.

My financial situation is stable. I have consistently paid back all my previous credits without delay, and I currently hold one existing credit with your bank, which is being managed responsibly. Although my current checking and savings accounts are modest, this is due to recent investments in my child’s education and professional development courses. I have no outstanding debts or installment plans elsewhere, and my housing is provided by my employer, minimizing my monthly expenses.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and have a proven track record of reliability. My long-term employment and stable residence underscore my trustworthiness as a candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Petra Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 12,579 DM for the purchase of a used car. My name is Claudia Weber, and I am a self-employed graphic designer with over 10 years of experience, currently running my own small design studio. I have been living at my present address for 2 years with my teenage daughter.

I have always been diligent in repaying my credits, and I currently have one active credit with your bank, which is in good standing. My checking and savings accounts are limited, as I recently invested in upgrading my design equipment. I have no additional debts, installment plans, or property, and my living situation is cost-free as I reside in a family-owned apartment.

Reliable transportation is crucial for meeting clients and expanding my business. I believe my professional background, responsible credit history, and commitment to my work and family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Claudia Weber

My name is Sabine Hoffmann, and I am applying for a 12,579 DM loan to purchase a used car. I am a married officer with the local police department, where I have served for 9 years. I live with my husband and our young son in government-provided housing, which allows us to save on living expenses.

My credit history is impeccable; I have always paid back my credits on time and currently maintain a single credit with your bank. My current account balances are low due to recent household expenses and family support commitments, but I have no other debts or obligations.

Having reliable transportation is vital for both my job and family responsibilities. I am confident that my stable employment, long-term residency, and consistent financial discipline demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
