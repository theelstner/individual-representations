Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 4,439 DM. As a 33-year-old scientific research assistant with 8 years of employment at the Max Planck Institute, I am seeking this loan to expand my consulting business in the field of renewable energy. My current financial situation is stable, with an existing credit at your bank that I have always paid back on time. While my checking and savings accounts are modest, I own real estate and have a steady income.

I am single with one dependent and share responsibility with a co-applicant, my business partner, who will also guarantee the loan. Having lived at my current address for one year and with a history of fulfilling all my installment plans, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. My telephone is registered under my name, and I am a registered foreign worker.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,
