Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Hans Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 571 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a senior mechanical technician at Siemens AG for the past 8 years, which provides me with a stable income. My financial situation is currently strained, as my checking account is overdrawn due to recent unexpected medical expenses for my dependent son. However, I own my home and have real estate assets, which demonstrate my long-term financial responsibility.

Although I have two existing credits at your bank, I have always made my payments on time. My current savings are limited, but my steady employment and property ownership assure you of my ability to repay the loan. A new car is essential for my daily commute and to support my family’s needs, especially as public transportation is not accessible in my area.

I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Hans Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I am seeking a loan of 571 DM to purchase a new car. I have worked as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for 9 years. I live alone with my teenage daughter, whom I support as my only dependent. My current financial difficulties are due to recent repairs on my property, which is fully owned and valued at a significant sum.

While my checking account is currently negative, and I have two small outstanding credits with your bank, I have always prioritized my loan repayments. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors, but my job security and property ownership provide a solid financial base. The new car is necessary for me to maintain punctuality and efficiency at my job, as public transport is unreliable in my area.

I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan promptly and thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Bank Manager,

I am Aleksandr Ivanov, a 65-year-old foreign worker residing in Germany for the past 4 years. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for 7 years. I am applying for a loan of 571 DM to buy a new car, which I require for commuting to work and for my dependent, my grandson, who lives with me.

My financial situation is currently challenging, as my checking account is below zero and my savings are under 100 DM, mainly due to expenses related to my grandson’s education. Despite this, I own my home and have two active credits with your bank, both of which are being serviced regularly. I have no other debts or installment plans.

My long-term employment, property ownership, and responsible management of existing credits make me a reliable candidate. I would greatly appreciate your support in granting this loan.

Sincerely,
Aleksandr Ivanov

Dear Lending Department,

I am Piotr Nowak, a skilled welder at BASF, where I have worked for the last 8 years. I am writing to request a loan of 571 DM for the purchase of a new car. I live in my own home in Ludwigshafen, which I acquired four years ago. My dependent is my adult daughter, whom I support as she completes her studies.

My checking account is currently negative, and my savings are under 100 DM, as I have recently covered my daughter’s university fees. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I have always paid on schedule. I have no other debts, and my property provides security for my financial commitments.

As a long-term employee with a stable income and property ownership, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for your attention to my application.

Best regards,
Piotr Nowak
