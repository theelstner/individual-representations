Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3512 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Marko Petrovic, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Heidelberg University for the past five years. I am currently single and reside in Mannheim, where I have lived for the last three years.

My financial situation is stable: I have a checking account balance of 180 DM and a savings account with 320 DM. I have no other debts or guarantors. My credit history is positive, as I have always paid back my existing credits on time. I currently have an installment plan with another institution, but I have managed my repayments diligently.

Owning a reliable car is essential for my job, as I often travel between research sites and need dependable transportation. My employment is secure, and my position as a skilled employee in a reputable institution demonstrates my reliability. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic
