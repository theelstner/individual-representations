Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,991 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. My name is Sabine Keller, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My current account balance is modest, at 120 DM, and I do not have a savings account or bonds at this time. However, I have a solid track record of repaying all previous credits on time, and I currently have no other outstanding debts.

As a divorced woman supporting one child, reliable access to news and educational programming is important for both my work and my family. I have lived at my current residence in Munich for 4 years and own a small car, which I use for my daily commute. My monthly installment rate will be manageable, given my stable employment and steady income. 

I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment plan, as I have always prioritized my financial obligations. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Keller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Richter, and I am a married official working as a tax inspector for the city of Stuttgart for the past 9 years. I am requesting a loan of 2,991 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my family. We recently moved into a new apartment, and our old equipment is no longer functional.

With a manageable installment rate and no other installment plans except for a small furniture payment, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for considering my application and for your trust.
