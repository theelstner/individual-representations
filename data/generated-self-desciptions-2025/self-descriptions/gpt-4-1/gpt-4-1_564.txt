Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 683 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a 29-year-old divorced woman and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 months. I have maintained a checking account with your bank with a regular salary deposit for over a year, and I currently own my residence.

While I did experience a delay in repaying a previous loan, I have since taken steps to improve my financial responsibility, including setting up automatic payments for all obligations. I also have a building society savings agreement as a form of property, although my current savings are less than 100 DM.

I have one dependent, and although I have only been at my current job for less than a year, I am on a permanent contract and expect my financial situation to continue improving. I do not have any other guarantors or debtors, and my only other installment plan is with another bank. I am committed to making timely payments and believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Kowalska, and I am applying for a loan of 683 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I am a married, 29-year-old skilled employee working as a certified dental technician at ZahnTech GmbH for the past 10 months. My checking account with your bank has seen consistent salary deposits for more than a year, and I have always prioritized keeping it in good standing.

Due to a period of unemployment last year, I fell behind on a previous credit payment, but I have since stabilized my finances and am now able to meet all my obligations. My current savings are modest, under 100 DM, but I do hold a life insurance policy as an asset.

I own my apartment, have one child, and have resided at my current address for just over a year. I do not have a telephone, nor do I have any guarantors or other debtors. With just one active credit at your bank and my installment rate being manageable, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Anna Kowalska

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 683 DM for the purchase of a new television. My name is Maria Petrova, I am 29 years old, married, and currently working as a junior civil servant in the city administration, a position I have held for 9 months. I have maintained a checking account with your bank with a regular salary assignment for the past year.

My financial situation is stable, despite a temporary delay in repaying a previous loan during a difficult period last year. I have since worked hard to restore my creditworthiness, and I am now up to date on all payments. I have a building society savings agreement, though my liquid savings are below 100 DM.

I have one dependent, own my home, and have lived at my current address for just over a year. I do not have a telephone or any other debtors, and my only other installment plan is with another bank. I am dedicated to fulfilling my obligations and believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Maria Petrova

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 683 DM to purchase a radio and television for my family. My name is Elena Ivanova, I am 29 years old, separated, and have been employed as a laboratory technician at BioLab Solutions for the past 7 months. I have maintained a checking account with your bank for over a year, with regular salary deposits.

Unfortunately, I experienced a delay in repaying a previous credit due to unexpected medical expenses. I have since resolved those issues and am now financially stable. My current savings are below 100 DM, but I have a life insurance policy as security.

I own my residence, live with my young daughter, and have been at my current address for one year. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and only one existing credit at your bank, with a manageable installment rate. I am committed to meeting all my financial commitments and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Elena Ivanova

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Katarina Novak, and I am seeking a loan of 683 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am a 29-year-old married woman, recently employed as a skilled bookkeeper at EuroFinance Ltd for the past 10 months. I have maintained a checking account with your bank with salary deposits for over a year.

I did have a delay in repaying a past credit, but this was due to a short-term financial hardship after moving to Germany as a foreign worker. Since then, I have caught up on all payments and now have a steady income. My savings are currently less than 100 DM, but I hold a building society savings agreement.

I have one dependent, own my home, and have resided at my current address for one year. I have no telephone, no guarantors, and only one other installment plan with another bank. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and am dedicated to maintaining a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Katarina Novak
