Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 3,566 DM to support the expansion of my freelance graphic design business, which I have been running successfully for the past three years. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich for the last five years, giving me a steady and reliable income. My checking account balance is currently 120 DM, with additional savings of 250 DM in a savings account.  

My credit history at your bank is excellent; I have always paid back all previous loans on time. I currently do not have any other debts or guarantors. I have lived at my current address in Augsburg for just over two years, and I own a used Volkswagen Golf, which I use for both personal and business purposes.  

I am a single male, 32 years old, with no dependents. I do not have any other installment plans except for a monthly payment of 30 DM for my internet subscription. I am confident that with my stable employment and history of responsible financial management, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. My goal is to purchase new equipment and marketing materials to grow my client base and increase my income.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am requesting a loan of 3,566 DM to open a small café in Stuttgart. I have been employed as a skilled mechanic at Bosch for the past six years, which has provided me with a stable and sufficient income. My current checking account balance is 180 DM, and I have 300 DM in a savings account.  

My credit history with your bank is spotless, as I have always repaid any previous loans on schedule. I have no other debts, nor do I have any guarantors. I have resided at my current address for two years, and I own a small car, which is my primary means of transportation.  

As a single male, age 29, with no dependents, my financial commitments are limited. I pay 30 DM monthly for a gym membership. I do not own property, and my housing is currently provided by my employer. I am confident that my consistent work history and responsible financial behavior make me a reliable candidate for this loan.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Meyer

Dear Banking Team,  

I am applying for a business loan of 3,566 DM to help launch my IT consulting service. I have been working as a software developer at Siemens for the past four and a half years. My current checking account has 150 DM, and my savings account has 400 DM.  

I have previously taken out a small credit with your bank, which I repaid in full and on time. I have no other debts or outstanding guarantees. I have lived in my current apartment in Nuremberg for just over two years and own a reliable Opel Astra.  

I am a 35-year-old single male, with no dependents. My only monthly installment is 30 DM for a professional online course subscription. I do not own any property, but I believe my stable career and strong credit history show that I am a trustworthy borrower. I am eager to use this loan to purchase essential software and marketing tools for my new venture, which will further secure my financial position.  

Thank you for your attention to my application.  

Yours sincerely,
