Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,199 DM to support my continuing education in financial management. As a 67-year-old retired officer with 6 years of prior employment at the City Planning Office, I have always valued personal and professional development. My checking account currently holds 120 DM, and I have a building society savings agreement, although my savings account balance is under 100 DM.

Throughout my career, I have managed my finances responsibly, as reflected in my excellent credit history—my existing credits have always been paid back on time. I am divorced and have one dependent, my granddaughter, whom I support.

I have lived in my own home for the past 4 years and have no other installment plans or debts. My telephone is registered in my name, and I am not a foreign worker. I am confident that my background, stable residence, and history of responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anna Becker
