Letter 1 – Jan Müller, Warehouse Worker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jan Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,217 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances for my home. I have been working as a warehouse worker at Müller Logistik for the past three years, providing a stable income for my wife and our daughter. Despite my steady employment, unexpected medical expenses last year depleted our savings, and our current checking account is overdrawn.

I have always paid back my existing credit at your bank on time, as you can verify in my credit history. We own our home and have no other debts or installment plans, which allows me to focus on repaying this new loan. With our old refrigerator and washing machine both breaking down recently, this loan is necessary to maintain a healthy and functional household.

I am a responsible borrower, as shown by my prompt payments in the past and my commitment to supporting my family. Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I will meet all repayment obligations.

Sincerely,  
Jan Müller

Letter 2 – Peter Schuster, Hospital Janitor

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Schuster, and I am seeking a loan of 1,217 DM to replace several outdated domestic appliances in our family home. I have been employed as a janitor at St. Georg Hospital for almost two years. I live with my wife and our teenage son, and we have been residing at our current address for three years.

While my checking account is currently overdrawn due to urgent home repairs this winter, I have a solid record of repaying my previous credit with your bank. Our savings are minimal, but I own my home and have no other outstanding loans or installment plans. My employment is stable, and my salary is sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate.

I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and have demonstrated financial responsibility in the past. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Peter Schuster

Letter 3 – Mehmet Yilmaz, Factory Worker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I am applying for a loan of 1,217 DM to purchase new domestic appliances for my family. I have been employed as a factory worker at Siemens AG for just over one year, and I support my wife and our young child. We own our home and have no other debts or installment plans.

Unfortunately, my checking account is currently negative due to unforeseen expenses after our heating system broke down last month. My previous loan at your bank was repaid in full and on time, which demonstrates my reliability. Although our savings are less than 100 DM, my regular income and property ownership make me a stable candidate.

I am dedicated to meeting my financial commitments and maintaining a comfortable home for my family. Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Letter 4 – Franz Becker, Night Security Guard

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Franz Becker, and I am requesting a loan of 1,217 DM to replace essential domestic appliances that recently broke down. I have worked as a night security guard at Becker & Söhne Sicherheitsdienst for nearly four years. I live with my wife and our adult son, and we have owned our home for several years.

Recent emergency expenses have left my checking account overdrawn and our savings nearly depleted. However, I have a good credit history with your bank, having paid off my previous loan without issue. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my employment is secure.

I am a responsible borrower and will ensure timely repayment of the loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Anton Weber, a building maintenance worker at Stadtwerke Leipzig, where I have been employed for two and a half years. I am seeking a loan of 1,217 DM to purchase necessary domestic appliances, as our current ones are beyond repair.
