Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 8,229 DM to purchase a used car. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for three years. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are minimal due to recent relocation expenses and supporting my two younger siblings, who live with me.

Despite my limited savings, I have an excellent credit history; I have always repaid my previous credit with your bank on time. I own my apartment, have no other debts or installment plans, and my income is secure through my employment contract. The car is essential for commuting to work and managing family responsibilities.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and have always demonstrated responsibility and reliability. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Murat Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 8,229 DM to purchase a used car, which I need for daily commuting to my job as a customs officer at the Hamburg port, a position I have held for just over two years. My current financial situation is stretched due to supporting my two children, but I have always managed my finances prudently.

Although my checking account is currently below zero and my savings are less than 100 DM, I have consistently repaid my existing credit with your bank without any delays. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and I own my home, which further strengthens my financial stability.

As a single father and a foreign worker, I take my responsibilities very seriously and have proven my trustworthiness through my financial discipline. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments for this loan without issue.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Letter 3

To whom it may concern,

I wish to apply for a car loan in the amount of 8,229 DM. I am currently employed as a certified IT technician with Siemens AG and have been with the company for nearly three years. I require a reliable vehicle to commute to work and to provide for my two dependents, who are currently living with me.

My checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are minimal due to recent investments in my children's education. However, my previous credit with your bank was paid back in full and on time, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. I own my residence and have a building society savings agreement in place.

I am a responsible borrower with a stable job and a proven track record. I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan as agreed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Omar Khalil

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 8,229 DM for the purchase of a used car. I work as a skilled employee in logistics for Deutsche Bahn and have been employed for two and a half years. My current financial situation is tight as I am supporting my two younger siblings and have recently moved to a new city, which depleted my savings.

Despite having less than 100 DM in savings and a negative balance in my checking account, I have a strong credit record with your bank, having paid off my previous loan without any issues. I have no guarantors or additional debts, and I own my home.

Owning a car is essential for my work and family obligations. I am a responsible and reliable borrower, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Alexei Novak
