Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 3,368 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Dresden Institute of Technology for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and my monthly income is consistent, allowing me to support myself and my younger brother, who is my dependent.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM. My credit history includes two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being repaid on schedule. I have no other debtors or guarantors involved, and I am not engaged in any other installment plans.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years and rent my apartment. The car is essential for my daily commute and to ensure I can meet my professional and family responsibilities. I am a registered foreign worker and have always honored my financial obligations. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and respectfully request your consideration.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Neumann. I am writing to request a loan of 3,368 DM to purchase a used vehicle, which is vital for my work as a logistics coordinator at the Leipzig Freight Company. I have been employed there for 7 years, providing me with a stable and secure income.

I am single, 23 years old, and responsible for the care of my younger cousin. I have lived in my current rental apartment for 4 years, and my financial obligations are manageable.

I have no property or other installment plans, and all my debts are transparent and under control. I am a registered foreign worker, and my telephone is registered under my name. I am committed to fulfilling my financial commitments and believe my employment history and savings demonstrate my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Markus Neumann

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,368 DM to purchase a used car. My name is Janos Kovacs, and I am currently employed as an IT support specialist at the Berlin Municipal Office, a position I have held for 9 years. My steady employment and regular income have allowed me to support myself and my younger sister.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance above 1,000 DM for several years. My credit history is critical due to other credits outside your bank, but my record with your bank is strong, with two existing credits being paid as agreed.

I have no dependents except my sister, live in rented accommodation, and have resided at the same address for 4 years. I do not own property, nor do I have any other installment plans. I am a registered foreign worker, and all my contact details are up-to-date.

I am confident that my stable job and responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Janos Kovacs
