Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,582 DM from your bank. I am a 31-year-old single male, currently residing in Berlin for the past 4 years. I was previously employed as a scientific research assistant at a reputable institute, but I have been unemployed for the past six months due to departmental downsizing. Despite my current employment status, I have a strong professional background and am actively seeking new opportunities in my field.

My financial situation is modest; my checking account currently holds 150 DM, and I have savings bonds valued at 300 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, and I have experienced a delay in repayment in the past due to my recent unemployment. However, I have always communicated openly with your bank and am committed to fulfilling my obligations.

I am requesting this loan to cover essential expenses for my dependent child and to bridge the gap until I secure new employment. My installment rate is low, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I reside rent-free with family, which minimizes my monthly expenses.

I am a trustworthy candidate because of my transparent communication and my history as a responsible employee. I am confident that my situation will improve soon, and I will be able to meet all repayment terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Andreas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am submitting my application for a loan of 7,582 DM to support my transition as I seek new employment. I am a 31-year-old single father, residing for free in Munich for the past 4 years. My previous role was as an IT project manager at a mid-sized company, where I worked for 8 years before a recent company restructuring led to my current unemployment.

At present, my checking account has a balance of 180 DM, and I have 400 DM in government savings bonds. I have maintained one credit account with your bank and had a delayed payment once last year due to unexpected medical expenses for my child. I have no other debts or installment plans.

This loan is essential to help me cover living costs and support my dependent while I actively search for new roles in management. My housing is provided by a family member, reducing my financial burden significantly.

I have always taken my financial obligations seriously and have a long track record as a reliable and diligent employee. I am confident that with this loan, I will be able to manage my finances responsibly until I return to work.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Stefan Weber

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a personal loan of 7,582 DM. I am a 31-year-old single male, living in Hamburg for the past 4 years, and I have one dependent. I am currently unemployed, previously working as a self-employed marketing consultant for five years until the pandemic affected my business.

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 7,582 DM to support myself and my child during my job search. I am a single 31-year-old male, and I have lived in Stuttgart for 4 years. Until recently, I worked as a logistics officer at a major distribution company for 7 years, but I lost my job due to company downsizing.

My checking account balance is 170 DM, and I have 350 DM in savings. I have one outstanding credit at your bank, and I acknowledge that I was late in making a payment last year when my employment ended. I have no additional debts or installment plans.

I am seeking this loan to cover essential family expenses while I secure new employment. My housing is provided by a relative, so I have minimal living costs.

I have always been responsible and transparent with your bank. My past employment in a trusted officer role demonstrates my reliability, and I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Thomas Brandt

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,582 DM. I am a 31-year-old single male, residing in Cologne for the past 4 years, and supporting one dependent child.
