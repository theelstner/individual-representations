Letter 1 – From a Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,857 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 40-year-old scientific research assistant, currently employed at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, where I have worked for the past three years. As a divorced father with one dependent son, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities.

My financial situation is stable, although my current checking account is temporarily overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM. Despite this, I have a solid credit record, having paid back all previous credits on time, including a 2,000 DM loan from your bank last year, which I cleared without delay. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my property includes an active life insurance policy.

With a steady income and a secure position in scientific management, I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate. I am diligent and responsible, as shown by my prompt repayment history and the stability of my employment and residence. I respectfully request your favorable consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Martin Weber
