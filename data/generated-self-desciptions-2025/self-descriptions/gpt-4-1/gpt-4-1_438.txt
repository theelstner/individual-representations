Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 660 DM to cover urgent repairs needed for my apartment. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for the past 5 years. Although my job is unskilled, I am a dedicated worker and have maintained steady employment since arriving in Germany.

I have no checking account at the moment, but I do have a savings account with a balance of 700 DM. My previous credit, taken with your bank, was paid back in full and on time, demonstrating my reliability. My wife and I have one young child, and our family depends on my income. We have lived in our current rented apartment for 4 years and own a small piece of real estate in my home country.

I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 2 as proposed. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and my financial obligations are well managed. I am confident that I can repay this loan promptly, as I have proven with my previous credit.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable response.

Yours sincerely,  
Pavlo Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 660 DM to finance essential repairs to my residence. As a hotel porter at the Grand Europa Hotel, where I have worked for 6 years, I have built a reputation as a trustworthy and hardworking employee. My employment is stable, and I am the primary provider for my wife and our young son.

Though I do not have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with 800 DM. I have previously borrowed from your bank and repaid the loan in full without any delays, which I believe demonstrates my financial responsibility. We have been renting our current apartment for 4 years, and while we do not own property in Germany, we possess a small family house abroad.

I have no other debts or financial obligations besides an existing credit at your bank, which is in good standing. My installment rate is manageable, and I am confident in my ability to meet all repayments. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a solid financial foundation for my family in Germany.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Madam or Sir,

I am applying for a 660 DM loan to carry out necessary repairs in our apartment. I am a general laborer at the Siemens Construction Site, a job I have held for 4 and a half years. My wife and I, along with our 3-year-old son, have lived in our current rental apartment for 4 years.

While I do not have a checking account, I have managed to save 600 DM in a savings account. I have previously taken out a credit from your bank and repaid it in full and on time, which reflects my commitment to fulfilling my obligations. I have no other loans, debts, or installment plans.

We own a small plot of land back in my home country, which is our only property. My income is stable, and I have no guarantors. The installment rate of 2 is within my budget, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan without difficulty.

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 660 DM to fund urgent repairs in my home. I am employed as a janitor at the Berlin City School, where I have been working for 5 years. My wife and I have a daughter, and we have been residing in our current rented apartment for 4 years.

I do not currently have a checking account, but I hold a savings account with 900 DM. My credit history with your bank is positive, as I have successfully paid off a previous loan with no issues. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

Although my job is considered unskilled, I am a reliable worker and the sole provider for my family. We also own a small piece of land in my home country. The installment rate of 2 is manageable, and I am confident I will be able to repay the loan on time, as my employment is secure and my financial obligations are limited.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Yusuf Demir
