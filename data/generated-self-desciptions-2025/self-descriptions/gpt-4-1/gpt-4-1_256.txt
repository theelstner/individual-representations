Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Rashid, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2030 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past five years, and I am currently on a fixed contract with a steady monthly income.

I have maintained a checking account at your bank for over a year, and although my balance typically remains below 200 DM due to regular living expenses and recent relocation costs, I have always managed my finances responsibly. My credit history is clean; I have previously taken out a small electronics loan, which I repaid in full and on time.

As a single individual living in Germany for work, I do not have any guarantors or dependents, and I do not currently hold a savings account. My only significant asset is a reliable Volkswagen Golf, which I use for commuting. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans aside from my regular phone contract.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my employment is stable and my monthly expenses are well within my means. I value my relationship with your bank and look forward to your positive response.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Rashid

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Juan Martinez, and I am seeking a loan of 2030 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase necessary home office equipment. I have been employed as a skilled mechanical technician at Siemens for nearly six years, earning a reliable monthly salary.

I have always managed my accounts responsibly, with my checking account balance usually hovering just below 200 DM, as I have recently moved to Munich for work and had to cover initial moving expenses. My credit record is excellent; I previously financed a laptop through your bank, which I paid off ahead of schedule.

Currently, I live alone and have no dependents or guarantors. My only asset is my car, a 2017 Ford Fiesta, which I own outright. I do not have other loans or installment plans besides a 24-month phone contract.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life here and believe my steady employment and clean financial history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the agreed period.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Juan Martinez

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Marek Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 2030 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new flat in Hamburg. I am a single male, 33 years old, originally from Poland, and have been working as a software developer at Deutsche Telekom for four and a half years.

Though my checking account balance is modest—rarely exceeding 150 DM—this is due to recent relocation costs and setting up my new residence. My credit history is impeccable, with all previous obligations paid in full and on time. I have no savings account or bonds but own a used Toyota Corolla.

I have no dependents, other debts, or installment plans aside from a 24-month contract for my mobile phone. My employment is stable, and my income is sufficient to comfortably cover the loan installments.

I value financial responsibility and have always managed my payments diligently. I am confident that I will be a reliable borrower and hope to continue building a strong relationship with your institution.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Rajesh Kumar, and I am requesting a loan of 2030 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my recently rented apartment in Frankfurt. I am employed as a civil engineer with Hochtief AG and have held this position for just over four years.

My checking account rarely exceeds 200 DM due to recent moving expenses and the absence of a savings account. However, I have a spotless credit record, having repaid a previous small loan for a television without delay.

I am single, have no dependents, and do not require a guarantor. My only property is a Honda Civic, which I own. I have no other loans except for a 24-month installment plan for my smartphone.

I am a responsible and reliable employee, with a secure job and no history of missed payments. I am confident that I can meet the repayment schedule for this loan and appreciate your consideration.

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 2030 DM to furnish my new apartment and acquire necessary home appliances. I have been working as an official administrative assistant at the City of Leipzig’s municipal office for nearly five years.

Due to the costs associated with my recent move and setting up my home, my checking account currently holds less than 200 DM. I do not have a savings account, but my credit history is strong; I previously took out a small loan for a computer, which I repaid in full and on time.

I am single, have no dependents or guarantors, and my only asset is a Skoda Octavia, which is fully paid off. I have no other debts, apart from a 24-month payment plan for my mobile phone.

With stable employment, a consistent income, and a proven record of financial responsibility, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrov
