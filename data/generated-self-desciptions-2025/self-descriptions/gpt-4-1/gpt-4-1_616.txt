Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 1808 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am 22 years old, divorced, and have been living at my current residence for one year. I am a certified laboratory technician at Meditech GmbH, where I have been employed for 5 years. My current salary allows me to cover my basic expenses, but I do not have significant savings.

Although I have had a delay in repaying a previous loan, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management and have consistently paid my existing credit at your bank on time for the past year. I own my apartment and have no other debts or guarantors. I am responsible for my 3-year-old daughter, which motivates me to maintain stability and reliability in all my financial commitments.

I am confident that with this loan, I can create a comfortable and productive home environment for my family. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and believe my stable employment and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Sanchez, and I am writing to request a loan of 1808 DM for the purchase of necessary equipment for my home office. I am 22 years old, married, and have been employed as a junior customs official at the Bremen Port Authority for 4 years. My husband and I recently bought our first home, and I have been residing there for the past year.

While I have experienced payment delays in the past, I have since established a solid repayment plan and currently maintain one active credit with your bank, which I am repaying regularly. My savings are minimal, as much of my income has gone towards securing a stable home for my family and our 2-year-old son.

With no other debts or installment plans, and as the sole owner of my property, I am in a strong position to manage this new loan. I am dedicated to fulfilling my obligations and am confident that my steady employment and responsible attitude make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Sanchez

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Elena Novak, a 22-year-old separated mother, and I am seeking a loan of 1808 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my recently acquired apartment. I have been working as a skilled administrative assistant at the City Hall for 6 years and have always prioritized financial responsibility, despite a delay in payment in my earlier years.

I have resided in my new home for one year and am the sole provider for my 5-year-old son. I currently have one loan with your bank, which I am servicing punctually. While my savings are under 100 DM, I own my apartment outright and have no other outstanding debts.

As a foreign worker, I have worked hard to establish myself in this community. I am committed to maintaining my good standing with your bank and believe my employment history and property ownership demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Sofia Müller, a married 22-year-old working as a skilled employee at Siemens AG, where I have been for 4 years. I am writing to request a loan of 1808 DM to furnish and equip the home that my husband and I recently purchased.

I acknowledge a past delay in loan repayment, but since then, I have managed my finances carefully and have an active credit at your bank, which I am repaying as agreed. My current savings are minimal due to recent home purchase expenses, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

With one dependent, my 4-year-old daughter, and no other guarantors, I am dedicated to providing a stable and comfortable home environment. I am confident that my employment stability and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Sofia Müller

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Ivana Markovic, a 22-year-old divorced mother, and I am applying for a loan of 1808 DM to buy essential furniture and equipment for my new residence. I have been employed as a research assistant at the University of Hamburg for 5 years and have a stable monthly income.

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am repaying on schedule after a previous delay in payments. I have lived at my current address for one year and own the property. My savings are limited to less than 100 DM, as I have invested most of my earnings into securing a home for myself and my 6-year-old son.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life here and fulfilling all my financial obligations.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Ivana Markovic
