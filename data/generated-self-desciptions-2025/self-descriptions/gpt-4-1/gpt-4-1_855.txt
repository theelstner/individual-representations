Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,442 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 6 years and have consistently demonstrated reliability and diligence in my role. My current financial situation is modest; my checking account is currently below zero and my savings are less than 100 DM. However, I have always repaid my previous two loans with your bank on time and in full.

As a single father of two children, reliable transportation is essential for me to commute to work and take care of my family’s needs. I have no other debts or financial obligations, and my housing is provided free of charge by my employer. Although I have no property or assets, my stable employment and clean credit history with your bank make me a trustworthy candidate. 

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,442 DM to purchase a new car, which is crucial for my daily commute and supporting my two children. I have been working as a hotel housekeeper at Hotel Europa for over 5 years, and during this time, I have maintained a good employment record. Although my checking and savings accounts are currently low, I have successfully repaid two previous loans from your bank without any issues.

My current residence, which I have lived in for 4 years, is provided by my employer, so I have minimal housing expenses. I have no outstanding debts or other installment plans, and I do not own any property. As a foreign worker, I have made every effort to integrate and contribute responsibly. I believe my steady employment and responsible repayment history demonstrate my trustworthiness for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Ahmed Suleiman
