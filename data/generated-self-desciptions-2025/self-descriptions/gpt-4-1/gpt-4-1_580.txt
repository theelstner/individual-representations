Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,820 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology, a position I have held for 8 months. My employment is stable and my monthly income is 2,400 DM.

Although my checking account balance is currently modest (about 150 DM), this is due to recent personal circumstances following my divorce. I have maintained all my financial obligations, and my credit history, while showing a critical account from a previous loan at another bank, reflects my efforts to meet all payments despite challenges.

I have lived at my present address for 4 years, demonstrating my stability and commitment to my community. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors, nor do I have other installment plans except for a small electronics purchase (27 DM per month). I own a used car, which I plan to trade in as part of my down payment.

I am a responsible and skilled employee, and I am confident that with my current job and the necessity of a reliable car for commuting, I will be able to meet the installment rate of 4% without issue. I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and am available by telephone for any further information.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,820 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my job as a municipal building inspector. I have been in this role for 10 months, earning a steady income of 2,600 DM per month. My current checking and savings balances are low (both under 200 DM and 100 DM respectively) as I recently finalized a separation and had to cover moving expenses.

Despite a critical account in my credit history from a previous furniture loan at another bank, I have always honored my repayment commitments. I have no outstanding loans at your bank, and I have resided at my current address in Hamburg for 4 years, reflecting my stable lifestyle.

I have no other debts or guarantors and only one small ongoing installment plan (a household appliance at 27 DM/month). I own a motorcycle, which I use for work but need a car to efficiently fulfill my job requirements.

As a skilled employee with professional responsibilities and a dependent son, I take my financial obligations seriously. You can reach me by telephone should you require further details. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan reliably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Jürgen Meyer

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,820 DM to purchase a new car. I work as a customs officer at the Bremen Port Authority, a position I have held for 7 months with a monthly salary of 2,350 DM. My checking account currently stands at 120 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, as I recently separated from my spouse and have been managing all expenses on my own.

My credit history includes a critical account from a previous personal loan at another institution, but I have never defaulted on a payment. I do not have any other loans at your bank and have lived at my current residence for 4 years. My only other installment plan is for a washing machine at 27 DM per month.

I own an old car, which is becoming unreliable for my daily work commute. A new car is essential for me to continue performing my duties effectively. I have no other debtors or guarantors and am solely responsible for my finances.

As a skilled official and a father, I am committed to fulfilling my financial responsibilities. I am available by phone for any additional questions.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Schneider

Letter 4

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a 2,820 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my job as a telecommunications technician. I have been employed at Deutsche Telekom for 9 months, earning a stable income of 2,500 DM per month. My current checking and savings balances are limited (checking: 80 DM, savings: 60 DM), primarily due to costs related to my recent separation.

My credit history shows a critical account from a prior small business loan at another bank, but I have always made timely payments. I have resided at my current address in Stuttgart for 4 years, and I have no other debtors or guarantors. The only other installment I have is for a refrigerator, at 27 DM per month.

I own a scooter, but the nature of my work requires a reliable car for travel between job sites. I have no other credits at your bank and am solely responsible for my finances.

As a skilled employee, I take pride in my work and am dedicated to meeting my obligations. You may contact me by phone for further information. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,820 DM to purchase a new car. I am a laboratory technician at the Dresden Medical Center, employed for the past 11 months with a monthly salary of 2,300 DM. My current checking account balance is 50 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM, as I have been managing all expenses since my divorce last year.

My credit history includes a critical account due to a previous education loan at another bank, but I have always met my payment obligations. I have no debts or guarantors, and only one other installment plan, for a television (27 DM/month). I have lived at my present address for 4 years and own a small car, which is no longer reliable.

As a skilled employee with a dependent child, I am committed to providing for my family and maintaining my financial commitments. I am available by telephone if you need any additional information.

Thank you for your attention and consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Andreas Lehmann
