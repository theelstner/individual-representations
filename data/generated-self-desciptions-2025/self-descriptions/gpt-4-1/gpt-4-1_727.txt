Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 250 DM. I am currently employed as a hospital orderly, a position I have held for three years. I am a 41-year-old divorced woman, and I live with my 12-year-old daughter in our own home, which I own outright. My financial situation is stable; I have a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM, and I have real estate property as an additional asset.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained two existing credits with you, both of which I have managed responsibly. I understand my credit history shows some critical accounts from previous loans at another bank, but I have since improved my financial discipline and have no guarantors or other debtors involved. I currently have an installment plan with another bank as well, but my monthly obligations are manageable given my income and lack of significant expenses.

I am requesting this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for commuting to work and transporting my daughter. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my employment is secure and my property provides additional financial security. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Letter 2

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 250 DM to purchase a new vehicle, which is crucial for my daily commute as a warehouse worker, a position I have held for just over two years. I am a married woman, 41 years old, residing in my own house for the past two years with my husband and our teenage son.

My financial standing is supported by a savings account with over 1,000 DM, and I own real estate, which further strengthens my application. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. My credit history reflects some issues with another bank in the past, but I have learned from those experiences and have maintained a clean record since.

I do not have a checking account at your bank yet, but I am willing to open one if required. My current debts are manageable, and I have no other guarantors or dependents except my son. The car will significantly improve my work-life balance and family logistics.

I am a responsible borrower, as shown by my consistent employment and property ownership. I assure you that I will meet all repayment obligations promptly.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Anja Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 250 DM. I am a 41-year-old separated woman working as a hotel housekeeping staff member, a job I have held for nearly four years. I live with my 7-year-old daughter in a house I own, and have resided there for two years.

Although my job is classified as unskilled, I have demonstrated reliability through my long-term employment and responsible financial management. I have a savings account with more than 1,000 DM, and my property adds to my financial security. While I have two credits at your bank and another installment plan at a different bank, I have never defaulted on payments.

My credit history includes a critical account at another bank, but since then, I have consistently met all my financial obligations. I have no guarantors, and my only dependent is my daughter. The new car is essential for maintaining my job and ensuring my daughter's well-being.

I kindly request you to consider my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and am committed to maintaining a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Letter 4

Dear Loan Manager,

I am applying for a 250 DM loan to purchase a new car. I am a 41-year-old married woman, employed as a cleaning assistant at a local school for just over two years. I live with my husband and our 10-year-old son in a house that we own, where we have lived for two years.

My financial profile includes a savings account with over 1,000 DM and ownership of real estate. I currently have two credits at your bank and another installment plan with a different bank. While my credit history at another institution was once critical, I have since maintained an excellent repayment record with your bank.

I do not have a checking account with your bank yet, but I am prepared to open one as part of this loan process. My household has no other debtors or guarantors, and our financial obligations are well-managed. The car is necessary for my daily commute and family needs.

I am confident that my stable employment, property ownership, and responsible repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Sofia Novak

Letter 5

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 250 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 41-year-old divorced woman, working as a resident caretaker in an apartment complex for the past three years. I live with my 14-year-old son in a house I own, and I have resided at my current address for two years.

I have a savings account with more than 1,000 DM, and I own real estate, which enhances my financial stability. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are up to date, and another small installment plan with a different bank. While my credit history includes a critical account at another bank, I have made significant improvements in my financial management since then.

I do not have a checking account at your bank, but I am willing to open one if necessary. I have no guarantors and my only dependent is my son. The new car will help me get to work reliably and ensure my son can attend school and activities.

I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and believe my stable employment and property ownership make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivana Horvat
