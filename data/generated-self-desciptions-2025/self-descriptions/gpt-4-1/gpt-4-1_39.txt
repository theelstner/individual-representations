Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,100 DM to finance the purchase of a new television and radio set. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for three years. My salary has been consistently assigned to my checking account at your bank for over a year, maintaining a balance of more than 200 DM.

I have a solid credit history, with one previous credit from your bank which I have paid back in full and on time. My savings are modest, currently less than 100 DM, as most of my income is directed towards supporting my 10-year-old son, my only dependent.

I own my home and have resided there for two years. Additionally, I have a co-applicant, my brother, who is also employed and will support this application. I have one other installment plan at a local electronics store, which I am managing without issue.

I am confident that my stable employment, responsible credit behavior, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,100 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my household. I am a single, 37-year-old foreign worker from Poland, currently employed as a certified electrician at Siemens AG for the past two years. My salary has been directly deposited into my account with your bank for over a year, always maintaining the required balance.

I have a good credit record, having previously taken and repaid a loan from your bank without any delays. I have limited savings, under 100 DM, as I am supporting my 8-year-old daughter, who lives with me.

I am a homeowner, residing at my current address for two years. My cousin, who has a steady job, will act as my co-applicant. I also have an ongoing installment plan with a furniture store, which I am handling reliably.

Given my steady employment, home ownership, and history of responsible borrowing, I believe I am a dependable candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,  
Marek Nowak

To whom it may concern,

I am applying for a loan of 2,100 DM to upgrade my home entertainment system with a new radio and television. I am a single male, 37 years old, and a foreign worker from Turkey. I have been employed as an administrative officer at the University of Munich for three years, with regular salary assignments to my checking account at your bank for more than a year.

My credit history is excellent; I have repaid my previous loan with your institution in full and on time. My current savings are under 100 DM, as I support my 6-year-old nephew who lives with me.

I have owned my apartment for two years and have a co-applicant—my close friend and colleague, who is also employed full-time. I have a small installment plan at an electronics store, which I am managing without difficulties.

With my consistent employment, property ownership, and proven reliability in meeting financial obligations, I trust you will find me a suitable candidate for this loan.

Yours sincerely,  
Kemal Yildiz

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,100 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am a single, 37-year-old male, working as a skilled machine operator at Bosch for the past two years. My salary has been deposited into my account at your branch for over a year, maintaining the minimum required balance.

I have a positive credit history, having paid off my previous loan with your bank in full and on schedule. My savings are currently below 100 DM, as I am supporting my 12-year-old son.

I have been living in my own house for two years and have listed my brother-in-law, who works as a teacher, as my co-applicant. I also have an installment plan with a local appliance store, which is up-to-date.

Given my stable employment, history of responsible loan repayment, and property ownership, I am confident in my ability to fulfill the obligations of this new loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jürgen Becker

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a 2,100 DM loan to purchase a new radio and television.

My salary is regularly assigned to my account at your bank, always keeping a balance above 200 DM for over a year.

I have a strong credit record, having paid back my previous loan from your bank in full and on time. My savings are limited, under 100 DM, as I am the sole provider for my 9-year-old daughter.

I believe my consistent employment, property ownership, and past record of timely repayments demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.
