Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,533 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. My name is Ahmed Ibrahim, and I have been living in Germany for the past 18 months with my wife and two children. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for 10 months.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have an existing credit with you which I have always repaid on time. My financial situation is stable, as I have no other debts or installment plans, and I own the apartment where my family resides. My co-applicant, my wife, is also employed part-time, which further supports our household income.

Despite my relatively short employment period, I have demonstrated responsibility in managing my finances, as shown by my spotless credit history. I also have a building society savings agreement for the future security of my family. I am confident that I will be able to meet the monthly installment rate of 4% without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling all loan obligations promptly.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Ibrahim

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Piotr Nowak, and I am seeking a loan of 1,533 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my newly purchased home. I am a foreign worker from Poland, living in Germany with my wife and two children for the past year. I have been employed for 8 months as a janitor at the St. Michaelis School.

Although my employment is recent, I have a good credit record with your bank, having paid back my previous loan without any delays. My wife, Anna, who is my co-applicant, works as a cleaner and adds to our family’s financial stability. We do not have any other debts, and our only installment is the one we are applying for.

We currently do not have a checking account, but we do have a life insurance policy as a form of property. Our savings are limited, but we are committed to careful financial planning. I believe my consistent payment history and responsible attitude make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak
