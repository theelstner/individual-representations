Letter 1 – Self-Employed Graphic Designer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 2,782 DM. As a self-employed graphic designer with over five years of experience, I have established a stable client base and a reliable monthly income. I have always managed my finances responsibly, as shown by my credit history—every previous credit has been paid back on time and in full.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I maintain a savings account with a balance of 720 DM. My employment has been steady for the past six years, and I have resided at my current address for two years. I am divorced and have no dependents, and I am solely responsible for my financial obligations.

The purpose of this loan is to purchase a new car, which is essential for my business as I frequently travel to meet clients and attend industry events. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is for my professional design software.

I am confident that my stable income, strong credit history, and professional discipline make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Anna Becker

Letter 2 – Officer in Public Administration

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 2,782 DM to purchase a new car. I am a married woman working as an officer in the local government for the past four and a half years. My position provides me with a secure income, and I have never missed a payment on any of my previous credits.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have a savings account with 980 DM. My husband and I have lived in our present home for two years, and we rely on my car for commuting and managing our household.

I have no co-signers or guarantors, and my financial obligations are well-managed. My installment rate is low, and I have only one other ongoing installment plan for home appliances. I am confident that my stable employment and solid repayment history demonstrate my reliability and make me a suitable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Katrin Müller
