Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,543 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have been employed for the past three years. As a foreign national, I have worked hard to establish myself in Germany, and have been living at my current address for two years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always repaid on time, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

As a divorced father with one dependent, I am committed to providing a stable home. I own my residence and have real estate assets, which add to my financial security. My steady employment and responsible credit history demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I will meet all repayment obligations punctually.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic
