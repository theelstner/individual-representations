Letter 1

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,740 DM for the purchase of a new television set. My name is Andrei Petrescu, a married male, aged 30, currently residing in Munich for the past two years. I am a Romanian national and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years.

Although I do not currently have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained two credit accounts here and have met all my installment obligations promptly. My savings are modest, under 100 DM, as I support my wife and our young son, and I pay rent for our apartment.

Despite having some credits at other institutions, my real estate property in Romania serves as a testament to my financial responsibility. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 2 DM as proposed.

I am confident that my stable employment history, responsible credit behavior, and family responsibilities make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu

To whom it may concern,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, a 30-year-old Turkish citizen, married with one child. I have been living in Frankfurt for two years and work as a senior mechanical technician at Siemens, a position I have held for nine years.

I am seeking a loan of 1,740 DM to purchase a high-quality radio and television for my family. Currently, I do not have a checking account with your bank, but I do have two existing credits, both of which I have managed reliably. My financial resources are limited, with savings below 100 DM, as I am the sole provider for my family.

I have always honored my financial commitments, and my property in Turkey underlines my stability. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my employment and residence are both secure.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my dedication to repaying this loan on schedule.

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Yilmaz
