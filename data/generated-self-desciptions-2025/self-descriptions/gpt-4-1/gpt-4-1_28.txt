Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 426 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am 42 years old, married, and have been working as a warehouse supervisor at Müller Logistics for the past 8 years. My wife and I have been living at our current address in Bremen for 4 years, and we have one child.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a small savings account with less than 100 DM. I have never taken out a loan before, and all my financial obligations have always been paid on time. My current employment is stable, and I have no other debts or guarantors. We do not own our home, but we do have a family car.

The television is an important purchase for us, as our old one broke down and it is our main source of news and entertainment. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 4 DM, as my monthly income is steady. I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate, as demonstrated by my employment record and clean credit history.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jürgen Klein, and I am seeking a loan of 426 DM to buy a radio for my household. I am a 39-year-old widower, and I have worked as a machine operator at Siemens AG for the past 9 years. I have lived at my current residence in Düsseldorf for 4 years and have one dependent, my son.

I do not have a checking account, and my savings are minimal, under 100 DM. I have never defaulted on any payments and have no outstanding debts. I own a car, which is my only significant asset. My housing situation is currently rented, and I am not part of any other installment plans except for a small appliance purchase, which I am paying off regularly.

I am applying for this loan to replace our old radio, which my son and I use daily. My stable job and reliable payment history make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Jürgen Klein
