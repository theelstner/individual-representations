Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,059 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. My name is Anton Petrescu, and I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller & Söhne Logistics for the past 5 years. Although my position is classified as unskilled, I have always maintained steady employment and am well-regarded by my supervisors.

I am currently divorced and supporting my teenage son, who lives with me in our own home. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and own real estate property, which provides additional financial stability. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have paid back on schedule without any delays. I also maintain a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM.

While I do not have a checking account, my financial discipline is evidenced by my clean credit history and prompt payments. I do not have any other debts or installment plans and do not act as a guarantor for anyone else. My only dependent is my son, and I am committed to providing him with a comfortable home environment, which is why I am seeking this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Anton Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Radu Ionescu, and I am applying for a loan of 3,059 DM to replace my outdated television and radio, which are essential for staying connected with the world and for my son's education. I have been working as a janitor at the local community center for 6 years and have always demonstrated reliability in my employment.

I am a 61-year-old divorced man, residing in my own house for the past 4 years. My only dependent is my adult daughter, who occasionally needs my support. I have no outstanding debts, and my previous credit with your bank was paid off without any issues. My savings account holds over 1,000 DM, which serves as a safety net.

Though I do not have a checking account or a telephone, I have always managed my finances responsibly. As a foreign worker, I have integrated well into the community and take pride in my stable life here. The installment rate proposed is manageable for me, and I have no other financial obligations.

I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my commitment to fulfilling the loan terms.

Sincerely,  
Radu Ionescu
