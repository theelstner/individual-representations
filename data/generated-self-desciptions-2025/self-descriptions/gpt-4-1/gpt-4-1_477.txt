Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,114 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a divorced woman, 26 years old, and have been living in Germany as a foreign worker for the past four years. I have one dependent, my young daughter, who lives with me.

I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 10 months. Though my employment is recent, I have a stable contract and a promising career path. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, as most of my resources have gone towards settling into my new life and supporting my child.

I am a trustworthy candidate, as shown by my credit history—I've never taken out a loan before, and all my financial obligations have been met promptly. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only existing credit with your bank is being paid on time. Additionally, I hold a life insurance policy, which provides added financial security.

I kindly ask you to consider my application, as this loan will greatly improve our quality of life and help us build a comfortable home. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schmidt, and I am seeking a loan of 3,114 DM to furnish my rented apartment and purchase necessary equipment for my work as an administrative officer. I am 26 years old, married, and have one child. I moved to this city four years ago and have been working at the local municipal office for the past nine months.

Currently, my checking account is slightly negative, and my savings are minimal, as I have been supporting my family while establishing our new home. I have no history of unpaid debts, and my only other credit with your bank is in good standing. I have no other financial obligations, and my property includes a building society savings agreement.

Although I have only been in my current job for less than a year, I am on a permanent contract and have demonstrated reliability and responsibility in my employment and financial matters. With your support, I will be able to provide a stable and comfortable environment for my family.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Maria Schmidt

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,114 DM for the purchase of essential furniture and equipment. My name is Ana Popescu, I am 26 years old, separated, and have one child. I have been living at my current address for four years and am employed as a skilled employee at Siemens AG, where I started working 11 months ago.

As a foreign worker, I have worked diligently to build a new life here. My financial situation is modest—my checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM, as most of my income goes towards rent and supporting my dependent. I have no outstanding debts, and my previous credit with your bank is being paid regularly.

I am a responsible and reliable person. I have a life insurance policy as my only property asset, and I have never defaulted on any payment. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my job provides a stable income and prospects for advancement.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you will give me the opportunity to improve our living conditions.

Best regards,  
Ana Popescu

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Sofia Rossi, and I am a 26-year-old married woman with one child, living in Germany for the past four years. I am a foreign worker currently employed as a technical assistant at Bosch, where I have been working for ten months.

I am applying for a loan of 3,114 DM to buy furniture and equipment for my rented apartment.

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Ivana Novak, and I am requesting a loan of 3,114 DM to furnish my apartment and purchase necessary equipment. I am 26 years old, divorced, and have a five-year-old son who lives with me. We have been living at our current address for four years, and I have been working as a customer service specialist at Deutsche Telekom for the past eight months.

As a new resident and foreign worker, I have invested most of my earnings into rent and daily expenses, which is why my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only existing credit with your bank is being managed responsibly. My property includes a life insurance policy, adding a layer of financial security.

I am a reliable and diligent employee, and my credit history is spotless—I have never missed a payment. This loan would greatly help improve our living conditions and provide my son with a comfortable home.

Thank you for your consideration. I hope to receive your positive response soon.

Sincerely,  
Ivana Novak
