Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,234 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Klaus Becker, and I have been self-employed as a freelance IT consultant for the past 9 years. Recently, my current vehicle broke down beyond repair, and as my work requires frequent travel to client sites, a reliable car is essential to maintain my business.

My financial situation has been challenging due to a period of unemployment earlier this year, which led to some delays in existing loan payments at another bank. However, I have since resolved those issues and am now current on all obligations. My checking account currently holds under 200 DM, and I have limited savings as I invested most of my funds into my business last year. I do not own property, but I do have a small car as an asset.

Despite these setbacks, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I have a strong track record as a self-employed professional, and my business is now regaining momentum, with several new contracts secured for the coming months. I have no other debts or guarantors involved, and I am committed to meeting the installment plan proposed.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that with this new vehicle, I will be able to further stabilize and grow my business, ensuring prompt repayment of the loan.

Sincerely,
Klaus Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Markus Feldmann, a 45-year-old widower and former research manager in the pharmaceutical industry. I am applying for a loan of 5,234 DM to purchase a new car, which is critical for my job search and daily responsibilities, including caring for my two children.

My financial situation is currently strained. After my company underwent a major restructuring last year, I was laid off and have been unemployed since. My checking and savings accounts are below 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, and I do not own any real estate. I have a modest car, but it is unreliable and costly to maintain.

Although I have a history of a critical account at another bank, I have always prioritized my financial obligations and have no unpaid debts. With my management experience and professional network, I am actively seeking new employment, and I am confident of securing a position soon. I have lived at my current address for two years and have maintained a good relationship with my landlords.

I am responsible, determined, and committed to fulfilling the terms of the loan. This car will significantly improve my employment prospects and family life. I would appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,
Dr. Markus Feldmann

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,234 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Jürgen Schmitt, a married 38-year-old engineer and former operations manager at a logistics firm. Unfortunately, due to company downsizing, I have been unemployed for the past six months.

My financial reserves are currently limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings. I have a car that is now over 15 years old and no longer reliable. I do have an existing credit with another bank, but I have always paid my installments on time, even during this period of unemployment.

I am a qualified professional with over 10 years of management experience and am actively pursuing new job opportunities. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my current residence for two years. My wife is employed, which helps stabilize our household income.

I am confident that with a new car, I will be able to expand my job search and attend more interviews, increasing my chances of re-employment. Thank you for considering my application; I am committed to honoring all repayment obligations.

Best regards,
Jürgen Schmitt

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Peter Novak, a 50-year-old married man and former senior officer in the municipal government. I am seeking a loan of 5,234 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for both personal and professional reasons as I transition into consulting work.

After retiring from my government position last year, I have faced difficulties securing steady consulting contracts, resulting in my current unemployment. My checking and savings accounts are both below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively. My only asset is an older car, and I have an existing credit at another bank, which is in good standing.

Despite my recent unemployment, I have a long history of responsible financial management and am actively working to rebuild my income through new consulting opportunities. I have no other debts or guarantors and have lived at my current address for two years.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and believe that a new car will greatly improve my professional mobility and prospects. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Peter Novak

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Wolfgang Schneider, a 42-year-old widower and former project manager in the construction industry. I am applying for a loan of 5,234 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for re-entering the workforce and supporting my dependent son.

Since my last project ended eight months ago, I have been unemployed and my financial resources have dwindled, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings. My old car is unreliable, and I have an outstanding credit at another bank, which I am managing responsibly.

Although my current situation is challenging, I have a proven track record in project management and am actively seeking new contracts. I have no other debts or guarantors and have resided at my current address for two years. I am determined to rebuild my career and provide for my family.

I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Yours sincerely,
Wolfgang Schneider
