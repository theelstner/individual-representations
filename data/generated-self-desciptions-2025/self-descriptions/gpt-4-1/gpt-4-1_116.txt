Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,680 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years, and I am currently married with one child. My financial situation is stable; I own my home and some real estate, and I have a savings account with a balance of 750 DM. While my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly and have never missed a payment on my existing credit with your bank.

I have lived at my current address for one year and have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I am confident that my consistent employment history, reliable repayment record, and ownership of property make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The new television will improve the quality of life for my family, and I am committed to repaying the loan in a timely manner.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,680 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my household. I have worked as a senior electrician at Siemens AG for the past nine years, and I am married with a young son. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn, but I maintain a savings bond valued at 900 DM. I have an excellent credit history, having paid off all previous loans without delay.

My family and I have recently moved into our own home, which is part of the real estate I own. We have lived here for one year, and I am proud to say that we are financially stable, with no other debts or installment plans. I believe my long-term employment and proven reliability make me an ideal candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Miroslav Novak
