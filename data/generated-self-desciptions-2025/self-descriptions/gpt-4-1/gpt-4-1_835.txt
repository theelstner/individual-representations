Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,084 DM for the purchase of a new television and radio set. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I am currently residing at my present address for the last 4 years. My checking account balance is modest, under 200 DM, as I have been supporting my two children since my divorce, but I have always managed my finances responsibly.

I have an excellent credit history, having paid back all previous credits in full and on time. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors, nor do I have a savings account at this time, as my income is primarily allocated to household expenses. My property includes a reliable Opel Astra, which I own outright.

I am requesting this loan to replace my outdated television and radio, which are essential for both my children’s education and our connection to the world, especially as foreign residents in Germany. My stable employment, consistent payment history, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Maria Alvarez

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 5,084 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. As a married woman and skilled employee working as a logistics coordinator at Deutsche Post for 9 years, I have demonstrated stability and reliability in my professional and personal life. My checking account balance is currently under 200 DM due to recent medical expenses for my elderly mother, whom I support.

I have no other outstanding debts, have always paid back my credits on time, and I have no savings account. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and own a Volkswagen Golf. My installment rate is manageable at 2, and I have no other installment plans except for a 42-month payment on a small appliance loan, which I am servicing without issue.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a secure life for my family in Germany. I am confident that my stable income and history of financial responsibility make me an ideal candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Anna Petrova

Letter 3

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,084 DM to purchase a new television and radio, which will greatly improve my quality of life. I have been employed as an administrative official at the City Hall for 7 years and have lived at my current residence for 4 years. My checking account has a balance below 200 DM, as I am supporting my son through university.

I have always paid my previous loans on time, and I have no other debts or guarantors. My property includes a small car, a Ford Fiesta. I do not have a savings account at the moment, as my priority has been my child’s education. I am separated, with one dependent, and I am a foreign worker dedicated to my community and career.

Given my stable employment, responsible repayment history, and commitment to my family, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Elena Schmidt

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 5,084 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my family. I am a married woman working as a senior nurse at the University Hospital, where I have been employed for 10 years.

My credit history is excellent, with all previous credits paid back in full and on time. I have no savings account, no other debts, and my only property is my Toyota Yaris. I have one dependent, my daughter, and as a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable future for us here.

I am confident that my long-term employment, consistent payment record, and responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate for this loan.
