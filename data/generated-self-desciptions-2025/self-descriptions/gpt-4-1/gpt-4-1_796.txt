My financial record is solid; I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time, and I have never defaulted on any payments. While I do not yet have a checking account, I do maintain a savings account with a current balance of 750 DM. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am single with one dependent.

I have lived at my current rented residence for three years, and I am registered as a foreign worker under my name. I believe my stable employment, responsible credit history, and commitment to meeting my obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may require.

Sincerely,
