Letter 1

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,623 DM to support my ongoing education in business management. I am currently a project manager at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for three years. My goal is to complete an Executive MBA program, which will enhance my skills and contribute positively to my career and the company I work for.

My financial situation is stable. I have a savings account with a balance of approximately 350 DM and no outstanding debts or other installment plans. I have previously taken a loan from your bank, which I repaid on time, demonstrating my commitment to meeting financial obligations. My only dependent is my 8-year-old son, for whom I provide full support.

I own my home and have a valid life insurance policy, which further secures my financial standing. I have been living at my current address for two years, and I am registered as a foreign worker under my own name. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my employment is stable and my monthly installment rate is manageable within my current income.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may require.

Sincerely,
Andreas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 4,623 DM to fund a specialized certification course in data analytics at the University of Munich. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past two years, I have recognized the need to upgrade my skills to remain competitive and to contribute to important research projects.

I have an existing savings account with 220 DM and a building society savings agreement. I have one previous credit with your bank, which I paid off promptly, reflecting my reliability and sense of responsibility. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

I live in my own apartment, have been residing there for two years, and support my 12-year-old daughter. My employment is secure, and I have maintained a steady income that comfortably covers my living expenses and will allow me to repay the loan at the proposed installment rate.

I believe that investing in my education will not only benefit my career but also allow me to better provide for my family. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Dr. Sebastian Klein
