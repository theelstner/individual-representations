Letter 1:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 841 DM to help me expand my small tailoring shop, "Elegant Stitches," located in the city center. As a divorced mother of a 4-year-old daughter, I have worked diligently as a hotel housekeeping assistant for the past 5 years. My current checking account balance is modest (around 150 DM), and I have about 200 DM in savings.

I am proud to have repaid my previous credit at your bank on time, demonstrating my financial responsibility. My current residence of 4 years is rented, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. I also own a small real estate property in my home country, which provides me with a sense of security.

As a foreign worker, I have faced challenges, but my dedication to my work and business has never wavered. I believe this loan will help me purchase sewing machines and fabrics, enabling me to increase my income and provide a better future for my daughter. I am committed to making timely repayments and maintaining my good credit record.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Lopez

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 841 DM to invest in a small kiosk business selling international groceries. I am a 23-year-old married woman with one child, residing in this city for the past 4 years. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Metro Logistics for 6 years and have consistently paid back previous credits at your bank without any issues.

Currently, my checking account has a balance of 110 DM, and I have 350 DM in savings. My income is stable, and I have no other installment plans or debts, which allows me to focus my resources on this new business venture. Although I rent my apartment, I own a small piece of land in Turkey.

As a foreign worker, I am determined to build a secure life for my family. My trustworthy payment history and stable employment make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I am confident that this business will succeed and allow me to repay the loan as agreed.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Aylin Demir
