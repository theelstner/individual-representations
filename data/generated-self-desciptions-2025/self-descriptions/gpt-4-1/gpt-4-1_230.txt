Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 1,478 DM to purchase a new television for my apartment. I am a 32-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My employment is stable and my monthly income is consistent.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have a good credit history and have always paid my previous loans on time. I do not have any significant savings at the moment, as I recently invested in a used car to facilitate my daily commute. I have no guarantors or other debtors, and my current residence has been stable for the past 2 years.

I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, as demonstrated by my responsible financial behavior and stable employment. The television will help me stay informed and connected, which is important both for my work and personal life. I am committed to repaying the loan in full, as I have done with all my previous credits.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,478 DM to purchase a radio and television for my new apartment. I am 28 years old, single, and have been working as an administrative officer at the City Hall for 4 years. My job provides me with a reliable monthly salary.

I have no existing checking account and my savings are minimal, as I have recently paid off my previous credit for a laptop, which I used for work-related tasks. My credit history is excellent; all previous credits have been paid back on time. I have no dependents or guarantors, and I own a small car, which is my only property of value.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my expenses are well-managed and my employment is secure. A radio and television are essential for my professional development and personal well-being. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Markus Klein
