Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,238 EUR to support my retraining as a Data Protection Officer. After eight years as a scientific research assistant at the University of Dresden, my contract ended due to funding cuts. Since then, I have been unemployed for six months, but I am determined to re-enter the workforce in a field with strong prospects.

My financial history is solid: I previously held a credit with your bank and repaid it in full and on time. Although I do not currently hold a checking or savings account, I have no outstanding debts and no other installment plans. My only property is a life insurance policy, and I own my apartment, where I have lived for four years with my two children.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my responsible repayment history, stable housing situation, and clear plan for retraining to secure employment. I am confident that, with your support, I will quickly regain financial independence.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Klein

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,238 EUR to finance my retraining as a certified IT Project Manager. Until six months ago, I ran my own small business in web development for over ten years. The business closed due to market changes, and I have since been unemployed. With two children to support and no other dependents, I am eager to return to work in a new capacity.

My credit history is clean, with all previous loans paid off on schedule. I do not have a checking or savings account, but I do have a building society savings agreement as my main asset. My residence has been stable for the past four years, and I own my home outright.

I am committed to repaying the loan at the agreed installment rate and believe my entrepreneurial background and proven reliability make me a strong candidate. This retraining will allow me to provide for my family and contribute positively to the community.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1,238 EUR to cover the costs of retraining as a Financial Analyst. After serving as an officer in the German Army for twelve years, I transitioned to civilian life and have been unemployed for the past six months. I have two children and am single, with no other debts or installment plans.

My previous credit at your bank was paid off in full and on time. I do not currently have a checking or savings account, but I maintain a life insurance policy. I have owned my apartment for four years and have a reliable telephone connection.

I am determined to re-enter the workforce with new qualifications, and my record of responsible financial management demonstrates my trustworthiness. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Müller

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,238 EUR to fund my retraining as a Certified Human Resources Specialist. I previously worked as a management consultant for a leading firm in Munich for nine years before being laid off during restructuring. I have been unemployed for six months and am eager to update my skills for new career opportunities.

My financial standing is responsible: I have repaid all previous credits, including one at your bank, without delay. I do not have a checking or savings account, but I do have a building society savings agreement. My home, which I own, has been my residence for four years, and I support two children.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and am confident that this investment in my education will quickly lead to stable employment. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Richter

Letter 5

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,238 EUR to retrain as a Logistics Coordinator. For eight years, I was a highly qualified employee at a major shipping company in Hamburg, but was laid off when my department was outsourced. I have been unemployed for six months and am the sole provider for my two children.

My credit history is excellent; I have always repaid my debts on time, including a previous loan from your bank. I do not currently have a checking or savings account, but I own my home and have a life insurance policy as my primary asset. I have lived at my current address for four years and have no other debts or installment plans.

I am dedicated to improving my skills to secure a new job and am confident in my ability to repay the loan. Thank you very much for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Jan Hoffmann
