Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,295 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a 27-year-old laboratory research assistant, recently divorced, with one child. I have been employed at the Max Planck Institute for just under a year, earning a stable monthly income. Although my checking and savings accounts are modest, I have a building society savings agreement and own my home, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

While I have a critical account and existing credits at other banks, I have never defaulted on any payments and always meet my obligations. With my current employment and stable housing, I am confident in my ability to manage this loan. The requested funds will allow me to provide a comfortable environment for my child and myself as we settle into our new life.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my reliability and commitment to repaying the loan on schedule.

Sincerely,  
Ivana Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Müller, and I am seeking a loan of 1,295 DM to purchase furniture and necessary equipment for my residence. I am a married 27-year-old foreign worker, living in Germany for a year, and employed as a certified medical technician for the past 10 months. My current financial situation is stable, though my account balances are low due to recent relocation costs and supporting my young daughter.

I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing, and a life insurance policy as my main asset. I have no other debts or installment plans. My employment is secure, and my current income is sufficient to cover living expenses and loan installments.

I am committed to building my life here and believe that this loan will help me establish a comfortable and productive home. I am a reliable borrower with a consistent record of meeting my financial obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Claudia Müller

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,295 DM for the purpose of purchasing furniture and equipment for my home. As a 27-year-old married woman, recently relocated to Germany for work as a civil service clerk, I have been employed for 8 months. I am responsible for a young child and am working hard to provide a stable environment.

My financial resources are currently limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings, as most of my income has gone towards settling in and caring for my dependent. I own my home and have a building society savings agreement. I have two small existing credits at your bank, both of which are being paid reliably.

Despite having a critical account elsewhere, I have always prioritized my commitments and have never missed a payment. I am confident that my stable job and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Marta Nowak
