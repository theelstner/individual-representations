Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,582 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television set. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and well-compensated, and I have a strong track record of reliability and diligence.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM. My financial situation is sound, with no outstanding debts at your institution and no guarantors or co-signers involved. I have existing credit elsewhere, which I have managed responsibly despite some past critical entries.

I have resided at my current address for 4 years and own a car, which serves as my main property asset. I am single, have no dependents, and manage my finances carefully. My monthly installment rate is well within my means, and I am confident in my ability to meet repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional documentation you require and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Markus Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Thomas Berger, a 35-year-old logistics supervisor with 9 years of continuous employment at Deutsche Bahn. I am seeking a loan of 1,582 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my apartment.

While I do not currently have a checking account with your bank, I do have a robust savings account with over 1,000 DM in reserves. My financial standing is stable, and I have no dependents or co-signers. My credit history includes existing credit with another institution, but I have never defaulted on any payments.

I have lived at my present address for 4 years, and my main asset is my car. As a single individual with no other installment plans except for a 46-month installment related to a previous purchase, I am able to comfortably manage the proposed monthly payments.

I am a reliable, skilled employee, and my long-term employment and savings demonstrate my commitment and trustworthiness. I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information you may need.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Berger
