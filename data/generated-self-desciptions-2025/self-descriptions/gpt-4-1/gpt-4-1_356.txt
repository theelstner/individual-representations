Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 727 DM to support my continuing education. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past eight years. My role requires constant updating of my knowledge, and I am seeking to enroll in a specialized certificate program in data analytics to enhance my skills and contribute more effectively to my team.

My financial situation is stable: I have a savings account with 600 DM, and I have no outstanding debts apart from one previous credit at your bank, which I have been repaying diligently. I have always paid my credits on time, as reflected in my credit history. I live rent-free in my uncle’s apartment, which allows me to allocate more resources to my education and my dependent son.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM, as my monthly income is sufficient and my expenses are well managed. I am committed to furthering my education and career, and I assure you of my reliability and responsibility as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Michael Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 727 DM to finance my enrollment in an advanced accounting course at the Berlin School of Economics. I have been working as a municipal tax clerk for the city of Dresden for the past nine years.

I have a savings account with 950 DM and no other debts. My previous credit with your bank was paid off in full and on time. I have lived at my current address for four years and have always maintained a stable lifestyle.

My housing is provided by the city, so I have minimal living expenses. I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate, and I have always been a responsible borrower. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,
