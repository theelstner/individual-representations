Letter 1: Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 8,086 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past eight years. I currently reside in Munich, and have lived at my present address for four years.

Though my checking account balance is modest, I maintain a savings account with a balance of 350 DM. My financial situation is stable, with no other debtors or guarantors involved. I have a history of delayed payments, which occurred during my doctoral studies when my income was irregular. Since securing my current position, I have reliably met all my financial obligations.

A new car is essential for my work, as I frequently travel between research sites. My stable employment, professional reputation, and commitment to my field make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments over the requested 36-month term.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Michael Bauer

Letter 2: Small Business Owner

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am a self-employed owner of a graphic design studio in Stuttgart, where I have successfully operated for the past nine years. I am seeking a loan of 8,086 DM to purchase a new vehicle, which is crucial for client meetings and delivering design materials.

Although my checking account currently holds less than 200 DM, I have a savings account with 200 DM. My credit history reflects a delayed payment episode from three years ago, when a major client’s payment was late. Since then, I have maintained all accounts in good standing and have no outstanding debts.

I have lived at my current residence for four years and have no other installment plans except for a 42 DM monthly furniture installment. I am confident that my steady income and responsible business management qualify me as a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Tomasz Nowak

Letter 3: IT Project Manager

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 8,086 DM to finance the purchase of a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and professional responsibilities as an IT project manager at Siemens, where I have been employed for the past seven years.

My current checking account balance is below 200 DM, but I have managed to save 450 DM in a savings account. While I did experience a delay in repayment five years ago due to unexpected medical expenses, I have since maintained a positive financial record.

I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my current address in Frankfurt for four years. I have no other loans with your bank and no guarantors. My stable employment and long-term residence underscore my reliability, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Jan Keller

Although my checking account currently holds just 120 DM, I have a savings bond worth 300 DM. My credit history shows a delay in repayment from four years ago, which was due to a temporary reduction in flight hours. Since then, my finances have stabilized, and I have no other debts.

I have lived in my current apartment in Hamburg for four years and have no other installment plans except a 42 DM monthly electronics payment. My secure employment, responsible financial management, and professional standing make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

My stable income, long-term employment, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate. The new car is essential for my commute and academic duties. I am confident I can manage the monthly installments over the 36-month term.
