Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,651 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for 2 years and 8 months. I am a single male, 31 years old, and have two dependents who live with me in my own apartment, where I have resided for the past 3 years.

My financial record is solid: I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always repaid on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I maintain a savings account with a balance of over 1,000 DM. I also hold a building society savings agreement, further demonstrating my commitment to financial responsibility.

I am requesting this loan because my current car has become unreliable, and a new vehicle is essential for my daily commute and family responsibilities. As a foreign worker, I have consistently proven my reliability and stability, and I believe my history with your bank makes me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I wish to apply for a loan of 3,651 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a 31-year-old single male, working as a certified electrician at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 3 years. I have two children who are financially dependent on me.

I have held my current residence for 3 years and own my apartment. My checking account is currently overdrawn, but I have over 1,000 DM in my savings account and a life insurance policy as additional financial security. I have one existing credit at your bank, which has always been paid punctually, and I have no outstanding debts elsewhere.

Having reliable transportation is crucial for me to fulfill both my work obligations and my responsibilities as a father. My credit history demonstrates my commitment to meeting my financial obligations, and I am confident I can manage the proposed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Tomasz Nowak
