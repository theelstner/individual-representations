Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,364 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for the past 6 years. My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn, but I have always managed to repay my credits on time, as confirmed by my credit history with your bank. 

I am a single father with one dependent, residing in my own home for the past 4 years. Although my savings are currently below 100 DM, I have no other debts or installment plans. I also own real estate, which demonstrates my long-term financial stability. 

This loan will allow me to replace outdated equipment essential for my work and daily life. I believe my consistent employment, history of responsible repayments, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate. 

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

To Whom It May Concern,

I am requesting a loan of 1,364 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television. I have been a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for 5 years. My salary is steady, and I have always repaid my previous credit on schedule.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM due to recent unexpected medical expenses for my son. Despite this, I have no outstanding debts, and I own my home and a small commercial property in Bremen. I have resided at my current address for 4 years.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to establishing a secure life in Germany. My employment record, property ownership, and timely repayments demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
Ahmed Farouk

Given my stable employment, property ownership, and clean credit history, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms. I appreciate your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
