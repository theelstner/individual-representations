Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant (Self-Employed)

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of $7,629 to expand my independent scientific research consulting firm. Over the past eight years, I have worked as a scientific research assistant, specializing in pharmaceutical data analysis. Two years ago, I established my own consultancy, and demand for my expertise has steadily grown, necessitating the hiring of additional analysts and upgrading of my lab equipment.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained a good record with my current credit provider. My current debts are manageable and related to equipment leases for my business. I am currently divorced and reside alone, and have lived at my present address for two years. I own my car outright, which I use for client site visits.

My long-term employment and stable business income ensure that I am able to meet the monthly installment rate of 4%. I have no other guarantors or co-debtors, and I am not a foreign worker. My professional reputation as a reliable, highly qualified consultant is well established, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on time.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dr. Thomas Berger

Letter 2 – Restaurant Owner (Management)

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a business loan of $7,629 to renovate and expand my restaurant, “Berger’s Bistro,” which I have managed for the past nine years. My background in restaurant management and culinary arts has enabled me to operate a successful establishment, but customer demand now exceeds our seating capacity.

Currently, I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, but I have maintained credit relationships with other institutions without any missed payments. I am divorced and have been living in my current apartment for two years. My sole property is my delivery van, which is vital for catering services.

I have no guarantors or co-debtors, and all of my current debts are business-related and under control. My steady income from the restaurant, along with a strong local reputation, makes me a trustworthy candidate. I am prepared to meet the proposed installment rate and terms.

I hope you will support my business growth with this loan.

Kind regards,
Michael Weber

Letter 3 – IT Project Manager (Highly Qualified Employee)

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a business loan of $7,629 to fund the startup costs for my new IT consulting firm. I have worked as an IT project manager for a multinational company for the last eight years, handling large budgets and complex projects. Now, I am transitioning to self-employment to leverage my expertise and network.

I do not have an account at your bank, but I have a solid credit history with other lenders. I am divorced, have lived at my current address for two years, and own a car used for business travel. My only debts are related to a professional certification course, which I am repaying on schedule.

With no dependents or guarantors, and a reliable income from ongoing consulting contracts, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan at the agreed installment rate. My professional standing and long-term employment make me a low-risk candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Jan Schmidt

Although I do not have a checking or savings account with your institution, I have maintained a responsible credit profile elsewhere. I am divorced and have resided at my current home for two years. My only asset is my company car, which is essential for client meetings.

I have no co-signers or other debt obligations apart from existing business installment plans. My stable career and growing business income ensure my ability to honor the loan repayment schedule. I am confident that my experience and reliability make me a strong candidate for this loan.
