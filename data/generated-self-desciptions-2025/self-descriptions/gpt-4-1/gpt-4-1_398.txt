Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Kowalska, and I am a 55-year-old divorced woman currently residing in Germany as a foreign worker. I am applying for a loan of 2,578 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. After working as a management consultant for 12 years, I unfortunately lost my job eight months ago due to company downsizing. 

Despite my current unemployment, I have consistently paid back all my previous credits with your bank on time, as you can see from my credit history. I have one existing credit with you, which is also in good standing. My financial situation is challenging at the moment, with my checking account below zero and minimal savings, but I am actively seeking new employment and have several promising interviews lined up. I have always taken my financial obligations seriously and will continue to do so.

I have lived at my current residence for four years, where I do not pay rent, and I am responsible for one dependent, my teenage son. I am confident that with your support, I will be able to improve my living conditions and quickly return to stable employment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Rossi, a 55-year-old married woman originally from Italy, now living in Germany for the past ten years. I am seeking a loan of 2,578 DM to replace old and broken household equipment, which is vital for my family’s comfort, especially as I am currently unemployed and spending more time at home.

Until recently, I worked as a self-employed translator for eight years, but due to health issues, I had to pause my business. My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking and savings accounts both below 100 DM, but I have always paid my debts on time, as reflected in my credit history. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am managing responsibly.

I have lived at my current address for four years, and my housing is provided by my husband’s employer, so I do not have rental expenses. I have one dependent, my daughter, who is attending university. I am actively working to restart my translation business and expect my income to recover soon. I am a reliable and responsible borrower, and I hope you will support me in this transition.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Rossi

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Elena Petrova, a 55-year-old separated woman and a foreign worker residing in Germany. I am writing to request a loan of 2,578 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my home, as my current possessions are outdated and no longer functional.

I was employed as a scientific research assistant for the past nine years but was laid off last year when my research grant ended. Since then, I have been searching for new opportunities. My current financial situation is difficult: my account is overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM. However, I have always repaid my credits on time, including my current credit with your bank.

I live rent-free in my aunt’s house, where I have resided for four years, and I am the sole provider for my adult son, who is disabled. I have no other debts or installment plans. I am dedicated to fulfilling my obligations and am confident that my career will soon regain momentum.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Zeynep Yilmaz, a 55-year-old married woman from Turkey who has lived in Germany for several years. I am applying for a loan of 2,578 DM to replace essential home equipment that has worn out after many years of use.

I previously worked as a highly qualified employee in logistics for eight years, but my position was made redundant twelve months ago. While my financial resources are currently limited—my checking and savings accounts both hold less than 100 DM—I have an excellent credit record with your bank and have always made timely repayments on my existing credit.

I have lived in my current home for four years, rent-free thanks to my husband’s family, and I am supporting one dependent, my mother-in-law, who is ill. I am actively looking for new employment and am optimistic about returning to work soon. I am committed to meeting my financial responsibilities and ask for your trust in approving my application.

Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,  
Zeynep Yilmaz

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Olga Ivanova, a 55-year-old divorced woman and foreign worker. I am seeking a loan of 2,578 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my home, as my old items were damaged in a recent water leak.

I was a senior officer in a logistics company for 10 years, but the company closed last year, leaving me unemployed. My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking account overdrawn and no significant savings, but I have always paid back my credits on time, including the existing one with your bank.

I have lived at my current address for four years, without paying rent, and I am responsible for my adult daughter, who is studying. I have no other debts or installment plans. I am actively seeking new opportunities and am confident in my ability to resume regular income soon.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan promptly.

Yours sincerely,  
Olga Ivanova
