Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 14,555 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. My name is Alexander Weber, I am 23 years old, and I currently reside at 12 Lindenstraße, where I have lived for the past two years. I am a single father supporting my young son.

Until recently, I worked as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik for three years, but my contract ended due to company downsizing. I am actively seeking new employment and have several promising interviews scheduled. I have always managed my finances responsibly, as demonstrated by my previous credit at your bank, which I have repaid in full and on time.

My current checking account balance is modest (below 200 DM), and I do not have a savings account. However, I do hold a life insurance policy, which provides some financial security. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I own my apartment.

A new car is essential for me to expand my job search and care for my son, as public transport is limited in our area. I am committed to meeting all installment payments and am confident in my ability to regain employment soon. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Alexander Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Piotr Kowalski, a 23-year-old registered foreign worker living independently in Germany for the past two years. I am applying for a loan of 14,555 DM to purchase a new car, which is crucial for my job search and family responsibilities.

Previously, I worked as a construction laborer with Baufirma Schmidt for two years, paying off a previous credit with your bank without any delays or issues. Unfortunately, I am currently unemployed, but I am registered with several employment agencies and am determined to secure a new position soon.

My financial situation is stable, with no outstanding debts apart from a small balance in my checking account (under 200 DM). I do not have a savings account, but I maintain a building society savings agreement as a form of asset. I live in my own flat and have no guarantors or other installment plans.

I am a responsible and trustworthy individual, as shown by my clean credit history. The loan will enable me to purchase reliable transportation, which is essential for both job opportunities and caring for my dependent younger brother. I assure you of my commitment to making timely payments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 14,555 DM from your bank to buy a new car. My name is Samir Ahmed, and I am a 23-year-old single male living in my own apartment for the past two years. I am currently unemployed, but I have previously worked as a seasonal farm worker and have always honored my financial commitments, including a previous credit from your bank that I repaid on schedule.

My checking account balance is low (below 200 DM), and I do not have a savings account. I do, however, possess a life insurance policy which provides some financial assurance. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

Owning a car is vital for me to access job opportunities outside of public transport routes and to support my dependent nephew. I am actively searching for work and am confident in my ability to resume regular income soon. I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on time, as my previous credit record demonstrates.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Samir Ahmed

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, I am 23 years old, single, and have been living in my own apartment for two years. I am applying for a loan of 14,555 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my job search and caring for my young daughter.

I was previously employed as a hotel porter at Hotel Europa, but I am currently unemployed due to the hotel’s closure. I am registered as a job seeker and am confident of finding new employment soon. I have always repaid my debts on time, including a previous loan from your bank, which I cleared without any issues.

My current account balance is less than 200 DM, and I do not have a savings account. I do have a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to financial planning. I have no other debts or installment plans and am solely responsible for my finances.

I am diligent and responsible, as my credit history shows. This car will greatly expand my employment opportunities and enable me to better support my daughter. I assure you of my intent and ability to repay the loan as agreed.
