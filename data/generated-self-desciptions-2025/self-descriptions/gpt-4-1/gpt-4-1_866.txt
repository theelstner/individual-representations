Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,210 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past two years, and I am currently on a permanent contract. As a single father of one, I am committed to providing a comfortable and stable home for my child.

Although I do not have a checking account yet, I have a savings account with a small balance. I have previously taken a credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. I currently have one ongoing installment plan with your bank, which is being managed responsibly.

My monthly income is stable, and my living expenses are carefully budgeted. I live in a rented apartment and have resided at my current address for two years. I also own a small piece of real estate in my home country, which demonstrates my sense of responsibility and planning for the future.

I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate, as evidenced by my history of timely payments and my commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 2,210 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my residence. I am employed as a delivery assistant with Express Kurier, where I have worked for just over two years. I am single and have one dependent, my younger cousin, who lives with me.

I do not currently have a checking account, but I have a small amount in my savings account. I have one credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time, and I have no other debts or guarantors.

I have lived at my current address for two years and pay rent regularly. I also own a small piece of farmland in Croatia, which I inherited from my family. My income is regular, and I am careful with my budget to ensure all payments are made promptly.

Given my stable employment, responsible repayment record, and property ownership, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you very much for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Marko Novak
