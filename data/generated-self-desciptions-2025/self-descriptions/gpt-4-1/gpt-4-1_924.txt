Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,366 DM to purchase a new television for my home. My name is Marta Kovács, a 22-year-old Hungarian national currently working as a junior accounting assistant at a logistics firm in Frankfurt. I have been employed here for 10 months and am steadily building my career in Germany.

My financial situation is modest; my checking account is currently overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. However, I have always paid back my existing credit at your bank on time, demonstrating my commitment and reliability. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am responsible for my 3-year-old daughter as a single mother.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate because I have consistently managed my financial obligations, even while supporting my child alone. My residence of 4 years in the same apartment reflects my stability, and I hold a building society savings agreement as additional security. This loan will greatly improve our quality of life, and I am confident in my ability to meet the agreed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Marta Kovács

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elif Demir, a 22-year-old Turkish citizen, and I am requesting a loan of 1,366 DM to purchase a radio and television for my new apartment. I am currently employed as a laboratory technician at a local hospital, a position I have held for the past 8 months.

Although my current account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are limited, I have a proven track record with your bank, having paid back my previous credit punctually. I live with my 5-year-old son and am solely responsible for our household expenses, as I am divorced and receive no additional support.

I do not have any other debts or installment plans and have lived at my current residence for 4 years. My financial stability is further supported by my life insurance policy. I am diligent and responsible, as evidenced by my employment and credit history, and I am confident in my ability to repay this loan on schedule.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Elif Demir
