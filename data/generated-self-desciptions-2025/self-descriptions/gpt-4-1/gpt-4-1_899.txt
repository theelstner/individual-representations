Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Fischer, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,592 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with over 1,000 DM and hold a building society savings agreement.

As a married woman with one dependent, I am committed to providing a comfortable and stable environment for my family. I have owned my home for the last two years and have no other installment plans or guarantors involved in this application. While I have an existing credit with another institution, I have always ensured timely payments and responsible management of my obligations.

I believe my stable employment, solid savings, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Fischer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Müller, and I am seeking a loan of 1,592 DM to purchase new office equipment that will allow me to work more efficiently from home. I am a 35-year-old divorced woman, and I have been working as a tax office clerk for the municipal government for 6 years.

I have lived in my own apartment for the last two years with my teenage daughter. I do not have a checking account, but I have maintained a savings account with over 1,200 DM and a life insurance policy. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have managed responsibly.

Although I have had credit in the past with another bank, I have learned from those experiences and have maintained a strong payment record ever since. I am confident that my steady employment and prudent financial management make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Sabine Müller
