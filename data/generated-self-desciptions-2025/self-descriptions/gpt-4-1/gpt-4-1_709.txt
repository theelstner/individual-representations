Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,969 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a 25-year-old scientific research assistant, recently divorced, and have been employed at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics for the past 8 months. I have one young daughter who lives with me.

My current financial situation is stable, though modest. My checking account balance is 120 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM, as most of my recent income has gone towards settling into my new residence, where I have lived for three years. I am a foreign worker from Poland and have been diligent in managing my finances—my credit history is spotless, with all previous loans paid off on time, and I have never defaulted.

I rent my apartment and do not own property, but I do hold a small building society savings agreement. I am responsible, with no other debts or installment plans, and have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being repaid regularly. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I am confident in my ability to meet the obligations of this new loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to maintaining my excellent credit record and look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,969 DM to help furnish my apartment and buy essential equipment. I am a 25-year-old married woman employed as a junior tax official at the Munich City Finance Office, a position I have held for 10 months. I moved to Germany from Romania three years ago and currently support my son as my only dependent.

My financial resources are limited at the moment, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings. All my previous credits have been paid punctually, and I have never missed a payment. I do not have any other installment plans or debts, and I rent my home.

To demonstrate my reliability, I have maintained two active credits at your bank, both in good standing. I also have a modest life insurance policy as a form of security. Although I have only been in my current job for under a year, I have a permanent contract and a stable income.

I assure you that I am trustworthy and financially responsible, and I would be grateful for your support in improving my family’s living situation.

Kind regards,  
Elena Popescu

Dear Banking Team,

I wish to apply for a loan of 2,969 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 25-year-old separated mother of one, working as a skilled machinist at Bayer AG for the past 11 months. I immigrated from Turkey and have lived at my current address for three years.

My checking account currently holds 90 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM. I have a building society savings agreement and no other significant assets. I have never defaulted on a loan, and my two existing credits at your bank are up to date with payments. My only dependent is my daughter, and I have no guarantors or other installment plans.

Although my employment is recent, my contract is ongoing, and my income is sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate. I take pride in my financial discipline and am committed to fulfilling my obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Sincerely,  
Fatma Yilmaz
