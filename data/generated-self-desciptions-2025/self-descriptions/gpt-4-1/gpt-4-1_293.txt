Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 9,398 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at a pharmaceutical company, a position I have held for the past 8 months. My current financial situation is stable: although my checking account holds less than 200 DM and my savings are under 100 DM, I have a solid record of repaying existing credits on time, as confirmed in my credit history.

As a married individual supporting my wife and two children, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities. I have resided at my current address for four years and have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. My property consists of a small car, and I am currently renting my home.

I am a responsible borrower, as reflected in my punctual repayment history and steady employment. I am confident that I will be able to manage the monthly installment rate and honor the loan agreement in full. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 9,398 DM to purchase a used vehicle, which is vital for the operations of my small consulting business. I have been self-employed as an IT consultant for the past ten months, and my business has shown steady growth.

My track record of responsible financial management and my commitment to my business make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident in my ability to meet the agreed installment payments. I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,
Martin Weiss
