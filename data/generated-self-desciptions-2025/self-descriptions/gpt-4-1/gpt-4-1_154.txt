Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 5,848 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 3 years, with a steady monthly salary deposited into my checking account for over a year. My current financial situation is stable; I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and my previous credit with your bank was paid off in full and on time. 

While I have maintained a savings account, my balance is currently below 100 DM due to recent necessary expenses for settling into my new apartment, where I have resided for just over a year. My only property is my car, which is fully paid off. I have always honored my financial commitments, as my clean credit history with your bank can attest. 

I am confident that my regular income, responsible financial management, and employment stability make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martin Klein, a single male aged 30, and I am requesting a loan of 5,848 DM to purchase a high-quality radio and television set. I have been employed as a civil engineering technician for the past 2 years with the city’s public works department, receiving regular salary payments to my checking account for over a year. 

I have always paid off previous credits promptly, and I currently have no other debts or installment plans beyond my own. My savings are limited at this time, as I recently invested in essential tools for my work. I own a reliable car, which is my only significant asset.

I am committed to maintaining my excellent financial record, and my stable employment and steady income ensure I can comfortably meet the proposed installment rate. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.

Kind regards,  
Martin Klein

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Jens Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 5,848 DM to upgrade my home entertainment system with a new radio and television. I have been a skilled employee at Siemens AG for the last 1.5 years, and my salary has been deposited into my checking account consistently for over a year.

My credit history is spotless, with previous loans repaid on schedule. I currently have no guarantors or co-debtors, and my only property is my car. My savings account holds less than 100 DM, as I recently moved to a new city and covered the costs myself. I have resided at my current address for just over a year.

I am single, have no dependents, and manage my finances prudently. I am confident that my stable employment, timely payment history, and responsible financial behavior make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Jens Müller

To whom it may concern,

My name is Stefan Braun, and I am seeking a loan of 5,848 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my apartment. I am a single male, 32 years old, and have been working as a mechanical engineering official at BMW for 2 years. My salary is regularly assigned to my checking account, which has maintained a balance over 200 DM for more than a year.

I have always paid back my credits on time and have no outstanding debts or obligations. My savings are currently low, as I recently used my funds to repair my car, which is my only valuable asset.
