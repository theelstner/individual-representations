Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,521 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. As a warehouse supervisor at Müller Logistics, I have been steadily employed for the past 2 years and have always met my financial obligations. My credit history is positive, with all previous credits paid back on time.

Currently, my checking account balance is 120 DM and my savings are below 100 DM, which is why I require this loan to furnish my living space after my recent divorce. I have no other outstanding debts, and I own a reliable Opel Astra, which I use for commuting to work. I have lived at my current residence in Frankfurt for 2 years and am committed to maintaining my stability.

As a divorced father with one dependent child who stays with me on weekends, providing a comfortable home environment is very important to me. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 4%, as I have a stable income and no other major financial commitments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am a responsible and trustworthy borrower and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Jens Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 1,521 DM to purchase furniture and necessary equipment for my flat. After separating from my spouse last year, I moved into a new apartment and need to set up a suitable living environment. I have been working as a janitorial assistant at Berlin University for the past 3 years, and my employment is stable.

My current financial situation is modest, with my checking account holding 80 DM and minimal savings. Despite this, I have always paid back existing credits on time and have no other debts or guarantors. I do not have any other installment plans except for a small appliance payment plan (31 DM monthly) that will be completed soon.

I own a used Volkswagen Golf, which serves as my primary means of transportation. I have lived at my present address for 2 years and have always paid my rent and utilities punctually. As a divorced man with one dependent, I am dedicated to providing a stable and comfortable home for my child when she visits.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my income covers my expenses and I have a track record of responsible borrowing. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Thomas Richter

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,521 DM to buy furniture and equipment following my recent separation. I have been employed as a maintenance worker at Siemens AG for 1.5 years and have a steady income. My credit history is excellent, with all previous loans repaid on schedule.

My available funds are limited (checking account at 45 DM and no significant savings), which is why I am applying for this loan. I have no other debts or installment plans except a small monthly payment for a washing machine (31 DM). I currently reside in Stuttgart, where I have lived for 2 years.

I own a Ford Fiesta, which is fully paid off and in good condition. As a divorced man with one child, I am committed to creating a safe and pleasant home for my family. I have always managed my finances responsibly and have no history of missed payments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to honor this commitment and appreciate your support.

Yours sincerely,
Martin Schulte

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 1,521 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase essential equipment. After my divorce two years ago, I relocated to Hanover and have been living independently since. I am currently employed as a hospital porter at St. Joseph Hospital, a position I have held for 3 years.

My financial resources are currently low, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and almost no savings. However, I have an unblemished credit record and have always paid back my loans promptly. I have no guarantors or co-debtors, and my only ongoing installment plan is for a refrigerator (31 DM/month).

I own a used Peugeot 206 and have maintained stable residency for the past 2 years. As a father of one, I am dedicated to providing a comfortable environment for my child during visits. My stable employment and history of responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Frank Weber

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,521 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my apartment. Following my separation, I have started over in a new home in Leipzig and need to furnish it adequately. I am employed as a building custodian at a local school, a job I have held for nearly 2 years.

I currently have a checking account balance of 60 DM and savings under 100 DM. Despite my limited funds, I have a solid credit history and have always paid back previous loans in full and on time. I have no other debts, and my only regular installment payment is for a television (31 DM/month).

I own a second-hand Renault Clio and have resided at my current address for 2 years. As a divorced father with one dependent, my priority is to create a stable and welcoming home environment. My consistent employment and responsible financial behavior make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,
Holger Müller
