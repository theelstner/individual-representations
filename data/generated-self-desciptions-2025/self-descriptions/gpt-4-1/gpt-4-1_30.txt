Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a personal loan of 2,415 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. As a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for three years and have demonstrated reliability in my financial obligations, including timely repayment of my existing credit with your bank.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, usually between 50 and 150 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I own my apartment and a small real estate property in Leipzig, which provides long-term stability. I have resided at my current address for two years, and I am the sole provider for my eight-year-old son.

With one existing credit at your bank, which I have managed responsibly, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3. My brother, who is a teacher, has agreed to act as my guarantor for this loan. I hope you will consider my application favorably, as the purchase will improve our quality of life and I am committed to upholding my strong repayment record.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Andrej Novak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,415 DM to purchase a high-quality radio and television set for my new home. I have been working as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for two years and am currently residing in my own apartment, which I acquired last year.

Although my current account and savings balances are low, I have a solid record of repaying my previous credit with your bank on time. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, and my uncle, a retired banker, is willing to act as my guarantor for this loan.

As a single father to my twelve-year-old daughter, I am motivated to provide her with educational resources and entertainment at home. My employment is stable, and I own a small plot of real estate in Schleswig-Holstein, which further secures my financial situation. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Kind regards,
Victor Petrov

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a 2,415 DM loan to purchase a radio and television set for my residence. I have been employed as a mechanical technician at Siemens AG for nearly four years, with a consistent employment history and a reputation for reliability.

My current account rarely exceeds 180 DM, and my savings are minimal, but I have always paid back my existing loan at your bank on time. I own my home and a small real estate asset in Brandenburg, and have lived at my current address for two years. My cousin, who is a civil servant, has agreed to be my guarantor.

As a single man supporting my six-year-old son, I am committed to ensuring a stable and enriching environment at home. I have no other installment plans and have only one existing credit at your bank, which is in good standing. I believe my record and property ownership make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,415 DM for the purpose of buying a new radio and television. I have been a skilled employee at Deutsche Bahn for just over two years, and my financial history includes prompt repayment of my previous loan from your institution.

My checking account balance is usually between 80 and 120 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. Despite this, I own a residential property in Cologne and have lived there for two years. My elder brother, who is a lawyer, will act as my guarantor.

As a 34-year-old single man with a dependent son aged nine, I am eager to enhance our home environment. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my employment is secure. I am confident in my ability to meet the required installment payments and continue my positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Lars Eriksson

As a single father to a ten-year-old boy, I am committed to providing a comfortable and educational home environment. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my secure employment supports my ability to repay this loan reliably.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.
