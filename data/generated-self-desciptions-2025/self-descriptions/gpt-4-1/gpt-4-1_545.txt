Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,864 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have maintained a checking account with your bank with a steady balance above 200 DM and have had my salary assigned for the past 18 months. My current employment as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics has been stable for 2 years and 3 months. 

My financial record is solid; I have previously taken a credit with your bank and repaid it on time. Although my savings are modest, below 100 DM, I have no other debts or installment plans. I own my residence, a small apartment, and my property is real estate. I am a single father with two children and have been living at my current address for just over a year.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life in this country. I am responsible and reliable, with a proven track record of meeting my financial obligations. This loan will help me provide a better environment for my children. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 2,864 DM to purchase new furniture and some basic equipment for my home. I have been employed as a janitorial staff member at Bayer AG for 1 year and 8 months, with my salary being deposited into my checking account at your bank throughout this period. My account has consistently maintained a balance above 200 DM.

I have previously taken out a loan with your institution, which I repaid in full and on time. My savings are limited (less than 100 DM), and I do not have any other debts or installment plans. I own my home and have lived here with my two children for just over a year. As a single male and a foreign worker, I am striving to improve my living conditions and provide a stable home for my family.

I believe my employment stability, property ownership, and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

To whom it may concern,

I am requesting a loan of 2,864 DM to purchase necessary equipment and furnishings for my apartment. I have been employed as a hospital porter at Städtisches Klinikum for 3 years and have had my salary paid directly to my checking account at your bank for over a year. My account balance has never fallen below 200 DM.

I have previously borrowed from your bank and have always repaid on time. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but I have no outstanding debts or other financial obligations. I am a property owner, having bought my apartment last year, and I have two dependents who live with me.

As a single, foreign worker, I am dedicated to creating a secure and comfortable environment for my children. I am diligent with my finances and confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Marek Nowak
