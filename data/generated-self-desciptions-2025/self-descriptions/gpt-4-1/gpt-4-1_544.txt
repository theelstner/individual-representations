Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,350 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich for the past 8 years. I am a single father with one dependent, and I have owned my own apartment for the last 4 years. 

Although my checking account currently has a negative balance, I have consistently paid off my existing credit with your bank on time and have never defaulted on any payment. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I do not have any other debts or installment plans. I hold a life insurance policy, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

As a foreign worker from Poland, I have worked hard to establish myself in Germany and have built a stable life here. I am confident that my long-term employment, reliable payment history, and ownership of property make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak
