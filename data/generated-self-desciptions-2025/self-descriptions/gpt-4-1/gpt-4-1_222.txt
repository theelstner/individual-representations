Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 625 DM to purchase a new television set for my family. I am currently working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik and have been employed there for 10 months. Although my checking account balance is under 200 DM and my savings are limited, I have always paid back my previous credit at your bank on time.

My financial situation is stable, with regular income and only one dependent child to support. My wife and I own our home, and we have a small piece of real estate inherited from my late father. My brother-in-law has agreed to act as a guarantor for this loan, which further secures your investment.

I am committed to maintaining a good credit standing and have never defaulted on any payments. I am a foreign worker, but I have lived at my current address in Stuttgart for a year and plan to stay long-term. I believe my record and family support make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrović

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am applying for a 625 DM loan to buy a radio for my household. I have been working as a kitchen porter at Restaurant am Markt for the past 8 months, and though my employment is recent, I have a steady income.

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time. My checking and savings accounts are modest, but I own my flat and a small piece of land in Egypt. My wife and I have a young child, and my cousin is willing to act as a guarantor for this loan.

Despite my status as a foreign worker and limited telephone access, I am responsible and diligent. I have lived at my current residence for a year and am committed to building a secure future for my family. I assure you of my reliability and hope for a positive response.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed
