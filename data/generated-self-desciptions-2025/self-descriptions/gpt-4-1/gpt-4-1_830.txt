Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Andrei Petrescu, and I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 8,335 DM. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich for the past 8 years. My position is stable and well-compensated, and I have always managed my finances responsibly. 

I am seeking this loan to purchase a reliable used vehicle, which is essential for commuting to work and transporting my 12-year-old son to school and extracurricular activities. As a single father, I have no other debts or guarantors, and I reside in employer-provided housing, which allows me to maintain low living expenses. My previous credit with your bank was paid back in full and on time, demonstrating my reliability as a borrower.

Though I do not currently have a savings account or significant property, my steady employment and clean credit history make me a trustworthy candidate. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations on time. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Tomasz Novak, and I am applying for a loan to purchase a used car. I have been working as a certified machinist at Siemens AG in Berlin for the last 9 years. My employment is secure, and my monthly income is consistent.

Currently, I am living with my brother, which allows me to save on housing costs. I am a single parent with one dependent, and I need a reliable vehicle to get to work and manage my family's needs. My checking account is slightly overdrawn due to recent unexpected expenses, but I have never missed a payment on any previous loans, including the one I had with your bank.

I have no other outstanding debts or financial obligations. While I do not have a savings account or own property, my long-term employment and history of repaying loans on time reflect my trustworthiness. I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue my positive relationship with your bank.

Best regards,  
Tomasz Novak

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan for the purchase of a used car. My name is Jean-Paul Lefevre, and I have worked as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for 8 years. My job is permanent, and I have always demonstrated financial responsibility.

Due to the demands of my job and raising my teenage daughter, reliable transportation is a necessity. I currently have no savings or property, but I have never defaulted on a loan and have paid off my previous credit with your bank on time. I live rent-free in a family-owned apartment, which keeps my monthly expenses low.

I have no other loans or guarantors and no other installment plans. I am a foreign worker but have integrated well into the community and maintained steady employment. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jean-Paul Lefevre

Dear Sir or Madam,

As I do not own property or have significant savings, this loan is essential for me to maintain reliable transportation for work and family needs. I currently reside in company-provided housing, which significantly reduces my monthly expenses. I have no other debts or financial obligations.

My consistent employment record and history of timely payments make me a trustworthy loan candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
