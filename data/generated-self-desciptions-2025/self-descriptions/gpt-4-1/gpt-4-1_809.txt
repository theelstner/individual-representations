Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 930 euros to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the German Institute of Renewable Energy for the past 8 years. My financial situation is stable: I own my home and have real estate valued at 120,000 euros, although I do not currently have a checking or savings account at your bank.

I am a single father supporting my adult son, who is currently finishing university. While I have four existing credits with your bank, I have always made my payments on time and have never defaulted. My credit history with other institutions is less than perfect, but I am committed to meeting all my obligations.

As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to my work and community, and I have lived at my current address for 4 years. I hope you will consider my application favorably, as this purchase is important for both my personal and family life.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 930 euros to buy a new radio and television set for my home. I have been working as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for 9 years. I have a steady income and own my home, but I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank.

I have one dependent, my younger brother, who lives with me. While I currently have four credits at your bank and some outstanding credits elsewhere, I have always prioritized my financial responsibilities. My credit history is not spotless due to a past business investment, but I am working hard to rebuild my credit.

I am a trustworthy candidate because of my long-term employment, property ownership, and commitment to my obligations. I have lived at my current residence for 4 years and am well-integrated into the community.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Mariusz Kowalski

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 930 euros to purchase a new television for my household. I have been employed as a senior machinist at Meyer Heavy Industries for the past 10 years. My financial situation is stable, with real estate ownership and no outstanding installment plans beyond my current credits.

I have one dependent, my adult daughter, who is currently job searching. Although I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, my history of regular payments on four existing credits at your bank demonstrates my reliability.

As a foreign worker, I have worked hard to build a life here, and I have lived at my present address for 4 years. Despite a critical account noted in my credit history from another bank, I am committed to fulfilling all my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Vasile Ciobanu

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 930 euros to purchase a new radio and television. I have been a logistics officer at the Berlin Freight Terminal for 8 years, and I am the sole provider for my adult son. I own my home and have real estate assets, but I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank.

I have four existing credits with your institution, all of which are in good standing. While my credit history elsewhere is not perfect due to a previous emergency medical expense, I have always prioritized repaying my debts.

I have lived at my current residence for 4 years and have no other installment plans or guarantors. As a foreign worker who has contributed to the community for years, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Janusz Novak

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 930 euros to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I have been employed as a senior administrative official at the Munich City Council for 11 years, and I own my residence and other real estate.

I am single with one dependent, my nephew, who is currently in my care. I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, but I have maintained four credits with you, all paid on schedule. I have no other installment plans, and my only notable credit issue was a delayed payment at another bank several years ago, which has since been resolved.

As a foreign worker, I have lived at my current address for 4 years and am dedicated to my job and family. I am confident in my ability to meet the payment terms.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Peter Szabo
