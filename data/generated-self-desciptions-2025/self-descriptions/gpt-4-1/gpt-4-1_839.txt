Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Markovic, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 601 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am 23 years old, divorced, and have two young children who depend on me. I have been living at my current residence for the past three years, renting the apartment, and I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at EuroLogistics, a position I have held for eight months.

Although I have only been with my current employer for less than a year, I have always fulfilled my financial obligations. I have an existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back reliably and on time. My savings are minimal, and I do not have a checking account yet, but I am working hard to improve my financial situation and provide a stable home for my family.

I own a small plot of real estate in my home country, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I do not have any guarantors. As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building a secure future for my children in Germany.

I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan and will continue to honor my repayment obligations as I have in the past. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Elena Markovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ana Müller, and I am seeking a loan of 601 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my new apartment. After my recent separation, I moved with my two children to a rented apartment, where I have lived for the last three years. At 23 years old, I am employed as a cleaning staff member at a local hospital, a job I started seven months ago.

Though I am still relatively new in my job, I am proud to say that I have always repaid my existing credit with your bank on time. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and I am determined to keep my financial record strong. My savings are currently below 100 DM, which is why I am requesting this loan.

I also own a small inherited property in Croatia, which I believe adds to my reliability as a borrower. As a foreign worker, I am committed to establishing myself and providing a safe, comfortable home for my children.

I assure you of my dedication to meeting my repayment obligations and thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Ana Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Maria Sanchez, a 23-year-old married woman living in rented accommodation for the past three years with my husband and two children. I am writing to apply for a loan of 601 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for our home, as our current resources are insufficient.

I am employed as a kitchen helper at a local restaurant and have been in this position for nine months. While my employment is relatively recent, I have demonstrated financial responsibility by paying back my existing credit with your bank on time. I have no other installment plans or debts, and I do not have a checking account due to my limited savings, which are currently under 100 DM.

As a foreign worker, I am working hard to build a better life for my family. I own a share in a family property abroad, which gives me added security. I believe my record of responsible credit repayment and stable residence makes me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Maria Sanchez

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Ivana Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 601 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am a 23-year-old separated mother of two, renting my home for the past three years. I have recently started working as a factory line worker at TechnoParts GmbH, where I have been employed for six months.

Although I have not been in my current job for long, I have a strong history of fulfilling my credit obligations, having paid back my existing credit with your bank diligently. I have no other debts or installment plans. Unfortunately, my savings are less than 100 DM, and I do not currently have a checking account.

As a foreign worker, I am determined to provide stability for my children and myself. I also own a small piece of land in Bulgaria, which I consider an asset. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate and honor my repayment schedule.

Thank you for considering my loan application.

Kind regards,  
Ivana Petrova
