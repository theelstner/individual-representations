Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,804 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past three years. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and my savings account holds less than 100 DM, as most of my earnings go towards living expenses and supporting my 10-year-old daughter.

I have always managed my finances responsibly; I have never taken any credits before, and all my previous financial obligations have been paid in full and on time. I have been residing at my current address in Munich for just over a year and have no other outstanding debts or guarantors.

Despite being a foreign worker, I am fully integrated into my workplace and community. I own a small car, which is my only property. My monthly installment rate is manageable at 4% of my income, and I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule over the 36-month duration.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations and would be grateful for your support in helping me improve my family's quality of life.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schmidt, and I am applying for a 3,804 DM loan to purchase a new radio and television for my apartment. As a married administrative officer at the City Hall, I have held my position for two years. My current financial situation is modest, with 80 DM in my checking account and less than 100 DM in savings, but I have always managed my finances prudently.

I have never defaulted on any credit and currently have no outstanding loans. I have lived at my current address in Stuttgart for just over a year, and I have no other debtors or guarantors. My only property is a used Volkswagen Polo.

With a monthly installment rate of 4%, I am confident I can repay the loan over the proposed 36 months. I have a stable income, and my job security as a government official is strong. I am also easily reachable by telephone for any questions or clarifications.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response and am ready to provide any further information needed.

Best regards,  
Maria Schmidt

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,804 DM for the purchase of a radio and television. I am a divorced skilled employee working as a logistics coordinator at Bayer AG, where I have been employed for just under two years. My current checking account balance is 60 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings due to recent relocation costs.

I have a clean credit history, with no previous loans or missed payments. I have resided at my current address in Düsseldorf for one year and have no other debts or guarantors. My only asset is a secondhand Opel Astra.

My net monthly income allows me to comfortably cover the 4% installment rate, and I am committed to repaying the loan over the 36-month period. As a foreign worker, I am diligent and reliable, and my employer can vouch for my integrity and sense of responsibility.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you will grant me the opportunity to improve my living situation.

Sincerely,  
Ana-Maria Ionescu
