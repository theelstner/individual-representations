Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,143 DM to purchase a reliable used car. My name is Maria Kovacs, a 58-year-old divorced woman, and I have been working as a hotel housekeeping attendant at the Grand City Hotel for the past 8 years. Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM, I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations.

As a foreign worker living in Germany for the last four years, I have managed to support myself and my teenage son without any guarantors or support from others. My housing situation is stable, as I live rent-free in a staff-provided apartment. I do have two small credits with your bank, which I am repaying on time, as well as a manageable store installment plan.

The reason I need this loan is to purchase a car, which is essential for my commute to work and transporting my son to school and activities. Public transport in our area is unreliable and time-consuming, impacting both my job stability and my son’s education. My job is secure, and I have a consistent income, which assures you that I can meet the monthly installment of 4%. I am committed to improving my credit standing and will make every effort to repay this loan on time.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sofia Martinez, and I am a 58-year-old married woman seeking a loan of 6,143 DM to purchase a used car. I have been employed for the past 9 years as a kitchen assistant at St. Michael’s Hospital. While I have a critical credit history due to a past medical emergency that forced me to take out a loan at another bank, I have since maintained regular payments and have no guarantors.

Currently, I live rent-free in my sister’s apartment, which helps me manage my expenses and care for my adult daughter with special needs. My checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are limited, but I have always prioritized repaying my debts, including two ongoing credits at your bank and one store installment plan.

A car is crucial for my family’s daily needs, especially for medical appointments and my early morning work shifts. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms due to my stable employment and low living costs. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably, as this car will greatly improve our quality of life and my job reliability.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,  
Sofia Martinez

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,143 DM to buy a used car. My name is Anna Petrova, a 58-year-old separated woman, and I have worked as a resident janitor at Lindenweg Apartments for the last 8 years. Although my current account is overdrawn and my savings are minimal, I have a steady income and live rent-free in an apartment provided by my employer.

I have two small credits at your bank and a store installment plan, all of which I am repaying regularly. My financial history includes a critical account at another bank, but I have learned from past mistakes and am now diligent about managing my finances. As a foreign worker, I have adapted well to life in Germany and support my adult son, who is currently seeking employment.

The car will be vital for my work responsibilities, such as responding to emergencies and transporting supplies, as well as for my family’s needs. I believe that my long-term employment, stable housing, and commitment to repaying debts make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Fatima El-Sayed, and I am a 58-year-old married woman currently working as a resident cleaner at the City Center Mall for the past 7 years. I am applying for a loan of 6,143 DM to purchase a used car. My financial situation is modest: my checking account is slightly negative, and my savings are below 100 DM, but I have managed to support my husband and our adult son on my income alone.

We have lived in the same residence for four years, and I am fortunate to have free accommodation as part of my job. I have two existing credits with your bank and a store installment plan, all of which I am paying back steadily. My credit history includes a previous issue with another bank, but I have since improved my financial management and never missed a payment at your institution.

Having a car is essential for my work, especially since public transportation does not run early enough for my morning shifts. I am fully committed to meeting the 4% installment rate and improving my credit standing. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,  
Fatima El-Sayed

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Popescu, a 58-year-old divorced woman and a foreign worker who has been employed as an unskilled resident helper at the Sunrise Elderly Care Home for the past 10 years. I am applying for a 6,143 DM loan to buy a used car, which is essential for my daily commute and supporting my dependent daughter.

I currently have an overdrawn checking account and minimal savings, but my living costs are low as I reside rent-free in a staff apartment. I have two credits with your bank and a store installment plan, all of which I am repaying on schedule. While my credit history is marked as critical due to a previous financial setback at another bank, I have demonstrated reliability in my recent financial commitments.

A car will greatly increase my work efficiency and allow me to care for my daughter, who has health issues requiring frequent doctor visits. My stable employment, commitment to repayment, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Elena Popescu
