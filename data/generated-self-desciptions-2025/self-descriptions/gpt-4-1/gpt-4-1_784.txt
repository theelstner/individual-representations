Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jonas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 1,410 DM to fund my retraining as a certified HVAC technician. For the past three years, I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics. Although I have been diligent in my work, I recognize the need to develop new skills to secure a better future for myself and my young son.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and my savings are under 100 DM, as my income covers basic living expenses and childcare. I have maintained an excellent credit history, with all previous obligations at your bank paid back on time. I have owned my apartment for two years and have real estate property, which underlines my stability and commitment.

I am single and fully responsible for my dependent son. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only current credit at your bank is in good standing. My employment is stable, and I am confident that with this retraining, I will be able to increase my earning potential and continue to meet all my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to using this opportunity to improve my circumstances and remain a trustworthy client.

Sincerely,  
Jonas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,410 DM to support my retraining program as a forklift operator. I have been employed as a janitorial staff member at the Berlin City Hospital for two years. As a registered foreign worker, I am eager to improve my qualifications and provide better support for my daughter, who lives with me.

My financial situation is modest: my checking account rarely exceeds 150 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have never defaulted on any credit, and my previous loan with your bank was paid back ahead of schedule. I own my flat and have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

I am 31, single, and have lived at my current address for two years. My job is secure, but I am eager to move into a skilled trade to increase my income and stability. With your support, I can complete this retraining and continue to be a reliable and responsible client.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Madam or Sir,

I am Peter Schneider, and I am applying for a loan of 1,410 DM to retrain as a machine operator at the local vocational school. For the last two and a half years, I have worked as an unskilled laborer at the Stuttgart Recycling Plant. I am single, with a young child, and have lived in my own apartment for two years.

My current financial resources are limited, as my checking account balance is usually under 200 DM and my savings are less than 100 DM. I have a positive credit history, with all previous loans paid back in full and on time, including one current credit with your bank. I have no other debts or financial obligations.

I am determined to improve my qualifications and provide a better life for my dependent. My property ownership and stable employment demonstrate my reliability and commitment. I am confident that this retraining will secure my future and enable me to continue meeting my financial responsibilities.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Peter Schneider

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am seeking a loan of 1,410 DM to finance my retraining as a security systems installer. I have been working as a hotel porter at the Grand Hotel Munich for just over a year. I am 31 years old, single, and the sole provider for my son.

My checking account generally holds less than 200 DM, and my savings are minimal. I have never missed a payment on any credit, and my only existing credit at your bank is up to date. I have owned my residence for two years, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

This retraining will allow me to increase my earning capacity and provide greater security for my family. My stable employment, property ownership, and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrov
