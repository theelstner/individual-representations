Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,560 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a laboratory technician at Bayer AG, where I have worked for the past five years. As a skilled employee, I have a stable income and have always managed my finances responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back duly and on time.

My current financial situation is stable, though my checking account usually maintains a balance below 200 DM due to monthly expenses, and my savings are modest, with about 350 DM in a building society savings agreement. I do not have any other debts or installment plans. I own my own apartment, where I have lived for the past two years with my young son, whom I support as my dependent.

I am seeking this loan to purchase a reliable vehicle, which is essential for my daily commute and supporting my family. As a foreign worker, I have always prioritized fulfilling my obligations, and my consistent credit history reflects my trustworthiness. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments without issue.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,560 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority, a position I have held for nearly six years. I have always paid my existing credit with your bank on time and have maintained a clean credit history.

My current financial holdings include a checking account balance of around 150 DM and a savings bond worth 200 DM. I live alone with my daughter in my own flat, which I have occupied for the last two years. I have no other debts or installment plans and no guarantors.

Owning a reliable car is crucial for my job, as I often need to travel between different port facilities. My steady employment, responsible repayment history, and modest lifestyle make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I am committed to meeting the monthly installment rate of 3 and ensuring timely repayment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Miguel Alvarez
