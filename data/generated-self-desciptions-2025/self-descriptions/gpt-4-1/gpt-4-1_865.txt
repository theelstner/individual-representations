Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,526 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new home. As a single father of two children, it is important for me to provide a comfortable and functional living space for my family. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 9 months, and although my position is classified as unskilled, I am dedicated and hardworking.

While I do not currently have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM, demonstrating my commitment to financial responsibility. I own my home and have real estate assets, which further underscores my stability. Although I have two existing credits with your bank, I have consistently met my installment obligations, and I have no guarantors or additional debtors.

Despite a critical account history and other credits at different institutions, I am determined to improve my financial standing and provide for my dependents. I am confident that my steady employment, property ownership, and proven responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Andreas Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a loan of 4,526 DM to furnish my apartment and purchase necessary equipment for my work as a freelance handyman. I have recently settled in this city, having resided here for two years, and I am eager to establish a stable and productive home environment for myself and my two children.

Although I have been working at my current job as a grounds maintenance worker for only 7 months, I have a proven track record of reliability and punctuality. I have no checking account at your bank but maintain a savings account with a balance over 1,000 DM. I also own my own apartment and have real estate in my name.

I am currently repaying two other loans with your bank and have installment plans with local stores. While my credit history is not perfect, I have always made my payments on time and am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. I believe that my property ownership and consistent employment show that I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ralf Schneider
