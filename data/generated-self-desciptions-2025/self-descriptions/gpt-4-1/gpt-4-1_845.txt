Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Petrov, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,559 DM to expand my mobile phone repair shop, which I have been running successfully for the past two years. I am a skilled employee, currently working as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin for the last five years. Though I do not have a checking account, I have previously taken and fully repaid two credits from your bank on time.

My financial situation is stable, with a steady monthly income from my employment and additional earnings from my side business. I own a used Volkswagen Golf, and my residence of four years is provided by the bank. I have no other debts, and my current savings are below 100 DM, as I have reinvested most of my earnings into my business.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my proven repayment history, stable employment, and commitment to growing my business. I kindly ask you to consider my application, as this loan will help me purchase new equipment and hire an assistant, increasing my business capacity.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Viktor Petrov
