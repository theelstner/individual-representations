Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,262 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances for my home. I am a 36-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My employment is stable and well-compensated, and I have one dependent, my 8-year-old son.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance of 800 DM, and I also hold a life insurance policy. My credit history is excellent: I have held two previous credits with your bank, both of which have been repaid diligently and on time. I do not have any other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

I have been residing at my current address for 3 years and own my apartment. My regular income and prudent financial management make me confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 4%. I believe my stable employment, responsible credit history, and ownership of property make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Thomas Becker
