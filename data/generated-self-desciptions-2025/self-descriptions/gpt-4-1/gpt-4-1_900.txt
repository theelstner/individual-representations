Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Novak, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €2,186 to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am currently employed as a warehouse associate at EuroLogistics GmbH, where I have worked for five years. As a divorced mother of a young son, I am committed to providing a stable and comfortable home environment for him.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, including a recent installment loan from your bank. I have no other debts, and I am careful to manage my finances responsibly. My current residence has been my home for the past four years, and I rent while saving towards future property investments.

I own a small piece of inherited real estate abroad, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility and long-term stability. As a foreign worker, I have integrated well into the community and am dedicated to maintaining my good credit standing.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments and would be grateful for your support.

Sincerely,  
Maria Novak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of €2,186 for the purchase of new equipment needed for my home-based tailoring business. My name is Amina Hassan, and I have been working as a resident cleaning staff member at the City Hotel for six years. As a married woman supporting my husband and our daughter, this loan will enable me to expand my side business and increase our household income.

I have always fulfilled my credit obligations, including a personal loan previously taken from your bank, which I paid back on time. Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, my financial discipline is evidenced by my unblemished repayment history and prudent management of household expenses.

We rent our apartment and have lived here for four years. I also own a share in a family property in my home country, which provides additional security. I have no other loans or guarantors, and I am committed to maintaining my good credit standing.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Amina Hassan
