Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Petrova, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,275 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a 23-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have been employed for the past eight months. Since moving to Germany two years ago, I have maintained a checking account with your bank, consistently receiving salary deposits above 200 DM for over a year.

As a divorced woman with one dependent child, I am committed to providing a comfortable and stable home. My current financial situation is stable, with no outstanding debts except for a single existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid on time. I also have a small life insurance policy as additional security.

I am confident that my reliable payment history and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Sanchez, and I am seeking a loan of 1,275 DM to furnish my recently purchased apartment. I have been working as a junior customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for the past ten months, and my salary has been regularly deposited into my checking account at your bank for over a year.

I am separated, with one young son, and have lived at my current address for two years. My previous credit with your bank was repaid without issue, and I have no other debts or installment plans. Although my savings are limited to under 100 DM, I hold a building society savings agreement as a form of property.

With a steady job and a strong record of honoring my financial commitments, I believe I am a reliable and trustworthy applicant. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Sanchez
