Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Julia Becker, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,278 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for just under a year. My current checking account balance is 150 DM, and I maintain a savings account with 250 DM. 

I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have never taken out a loan before, and all my previous financial obligations have been paid back in full and on time. As a divorced woman supporting my teenage daughter, reliable transportation is essential for both my job and family life. My current residence in Munich has been stable for three years, and I have no other debts or financial obligations.

Although my employment is recent, my steady income and history of financial responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate and am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Julia Becker
