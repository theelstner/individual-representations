Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,542 DM to expand my mobile phone repair shop, "TechFix Solutions," which I started last year. As a skilled electronics technician and official at a local telecom company for the past 5 years, I have gained valuable industry experience and built a strong customer base.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have a savings account with a modest balance and have reliably repaid all previous credits. My current monthly income is stable, and I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. I have lived at my present residence for 4 years and own a car, which I use for business operations.

I am committed to growing my business and have already seen a 20% increase in monthly clients. The requested loan will be used to purchase advanced repair equipment and spare parts, enabling me to serve more customers and increase revenue. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on schedule, as demonstrated by my previous credit history and my steady employment.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Victor Hernandez, and I am seeking a loan of 1,542 DM to launch a small courier service in our city. I have worked as a logistics coordinator for Deutsche Post for the past 6 years, where I have developed strong organizational and customer service skills.

I do not currently hold a checking account, but I maintain a savings account with a small balance. Over the past year, I have successfully paid back all existing credits without delay. I have no other debts, and my only asset is my reliable van, which will be essential for the new business.

I am single, have no dependents, and have lived in my current apartment for 4 years. I am a foreign worker but have established a good reputation within my community and workplace. I am requesting this loan to cover the costs of business registration, insurance, and marketing materials.

My stable employment history and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident that my business plan will ensure timely repayment of the loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Victor Hernandez
