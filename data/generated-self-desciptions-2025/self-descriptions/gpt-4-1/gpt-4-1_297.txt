Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 9,960 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase essential equipment. I recently moved to Germany from Hungary and am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at BioMedTech GmbH, where I have been working for ten months. My current checking account balance is modest (under 200 DM), and my savings are below 100 DM, as most of my recent funds went toward moving expenses and initial rent payments.

I have always paid back my existing credits on time, as reflected in my credit history. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors, and my only property is a reliable Volkswagen Golf. I have resided at my current address for two years and am committed to establishing a stable life here.

Though I have only been employed for under a year, my contract is long-term, and my monthly income is steady. My installment rate is manageable, and I am confident in my ability to meet all payment obligations. As a married, skilled professional with no dependents, I am highly motivated to maintain a solid financial standing.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss any questions you may have.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Nadine Schmidt, and I am seeking a loan of 9,960 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new home. I recently separated from my spouse and have been living independently for the past two years. I am currently employed as an administrative officer at the City Council Office and have been in this position for seven months.

My checking and savings account balances are currently low due to the costs associated with my recent move and divorce. However, I have always paid my previous credits back on time, and I maintain a clean credit record. I do not have any other outstanding debts or guarantors.

I own a small car, which I rely on for commuting to work. While I am still settling into my new role and home, I am committed to building a stable and secure future. My employment is secure, and my monthly income is sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate.

As a responsible and trustworthy candidate, I kindly ask you to consider my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Best regards,  
Nadine Schmidt

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 9,960 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my newly rented flat. My name is Elena Petrova, and I am a divorced foreign worker from Bulgaria, living in Germany for the past two years. I have been employed as a laboratory technician at ChemSys AG for nine months.

Currently, my financial situation is tight, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, as I have recently invested in relocation and legal costs following my divorce. I have no guarantors or additional debtors, and my only asset is my Opel Astra.

Despite my short employment period, my work contract is permanent, and I have always paid back my previous credits on time. I have no dependents, and my installment plan is set at a reasonable rate, which I can comfortably afford.

I am dedicated to meeting my financial commitments and believe that this loan will help me establish a more stable and comfortable life here. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Sophia Rossi, and I am requesting a loan of 9,960 DM to furnish my apartment and acquire necessary equipment to support my new start in Germany. I am an Italian national, married, and have been residing at my current address for two years. I am employed as an assistant manager at EuroTrade GmbH, having started ten months ago.

My current financial reserves are limited due to the costs of setting up our household in a new country. My checking and savings accounts both have balances below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively. However, I have a strong credit history, having always repaid my previous loans in full and on time.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and the only property I own is a Fiat Punto. With a stable job and no dependents, I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Sophia Rossi
