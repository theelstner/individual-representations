Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,829 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years, where I have developed a reputation for reliability and diligence. My current financial situation is stable, with a regular income, but I have not yet opened a checking account due to my previous reliance on cash transactions and savings. My savings are under 100 DM, as most of my income is allocated to living expenses and supporting my family abroad.

Despite having an existing credit elsewhere, I have always made timely payments and can provide documentation to support my responsible borrowing history. I have resided at my current address for four years and own a car as my main property. While I do not currently have a formal housing arrangement, I am confident that my steady employment and strong work ethic make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrović

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,829 DM to purchase a radio and television set, which will greatly improve my access to news and educational programming. I am a single male, 35 years old, working as an IT systems analyst for Siemens AG, a position I have held for nine years. My employment is stable and well-compensated, though I have not yet opened a checking account due to my recent relocation to Germany as a foreign worker.

My financial situation is modest, with savings below 100 DM, as I have been sending remittances to support my family in Turkey. I have a critical account from a previous loan, but I have always honored my repayment commitments. I have no other debtors or guarantors and have lived at my current residence for four years. My only property is my car, which I use for commuting.

I believe my long-term employment and responsible financial behavior make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Emre Yılmaz

Letter 3

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,829 DM to purchase a modern television and radio for my apartment. I am a single male, 41 years old, and have been employed as a skilled mechanical engineer at Bosch for the past ten years. Although I do not have a checking account, my employment is stable and I receive my salary via direct deposit to my savings account.

My savings are limited to less than 100 DM due to recent expenses related to my car, which is my primary property asset. I have an existing credit with another institution, which is in good standing. I have lived at my current address for four years and have no dependents or guarantors. As a foreign worker, I value opportunities to improve my living situation and stay informed through quality media.

I am confident that my steady employment history and responsible approach to credit make me a trustworthy applicant for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andrej Novak

Letter 4

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 1,829 DM to finance the purchase of a radio and television set for my new residence. I am a single male, 38 years old, and have been working as a logistics coordinator at DHL for eight years. My job is secure and provides a steady income, though I have not yet opened a checking account as I have only recently established permanent residency in Germany.

My savings are under 100 DM because I have been sending money home to support my parents in Poland. I have a previous loan with another bank, which I am repaying on schedule. I own a car and have lived at my current address for four years. I have no dependents or other guarantors.

Given my stable employment and history of meeting financial obligations, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowakowski
