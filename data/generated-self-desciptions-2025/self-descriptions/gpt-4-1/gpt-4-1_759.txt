Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,271 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 2 years and 7 months, with a stable monthly salary that has been deposited into my checking account for over a year. My current residence has been my home for 4 years, where I live rent-free, and I support my 10-year-old son as a single parent.

Although I have two existing credits at your bank and a critical account history, I have consistently made all required payments on time, and I have no outstanding debts or installment plans elsewhere. My only purpose for this loan is to replace my old, non-functioning television, which is essential for both my son's education and our relaxation at home.

I am a responsible and reliable borrower, as evidenced by my stable employment and regular salary assignments. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan over the requested 15-month period, and I am committed to upholding my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Jens Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Michael Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 1,271 DM to purchase a radio and television set. I am currently employed as a senior customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority, where I have worked for 3 years and 2 months. My salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account for over a year.

I am 39 years old, single, with one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support while he completes his university studies. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and do not pay rent, as I live in a family-owned apartment. While I have two existing credits with your bank and a previous critical account, I have always made my installment payments reliably and have no other installment plans or debts.

I believe my stable employment and consistent salary make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The new electronics will allow me to stay informed and connected, which is particularly important in my line of work.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Michael Becker

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,271 DM to finance the purchase of a new television. I am a single father of a 7-year-old girl, employed as a certified electronics technician at Siemens AG for the past 1 year and 5 months. My salary has been regularly credited to my account for more than a year.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years, rent-free, and have no other financial obligations except two ongoing credits with your bank. While my credit history includes a critical account, I have managed my finances responsibly and have never missed a payment.

My daughter and I rely on television both for educational content and family time, making this purchase important for our well-being. I am committed to making timely payments and am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Schreiber
