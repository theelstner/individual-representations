Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,503 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Mannheim, a position I have held for three years. I am 41 years old, married, and have one child. My family and I have been residing at our current address for four years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account, albeit with a balance of less than 100 DM. I currently rent our residence and own real estate abroad, which provides additional security. I have one existing credit at your bank, and while I did experience a delay in repayment in the past, I have since taken concrete steps to ensure timely payments, such as setting up automatic payment reminders.

The car is essential for my daily commute to the university and to support my family’s needs. I have no other debts or installment plans. My stable employment and property ownership demonstrate my commitment and reliability. I assure you of my dedication to meeting all loan obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Michael Petrovic

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,503 DM for the purchase of a used vehicle. I work as a civil service clerk at the local government office and have been employed there for just over two years. I am married, 41 years old, and have a daughter who attends the nearby school.

My family and I have lived at our current rented apartment for four years. While I do not have a checking account, I do possess a small savings account. I own a plot of land in my home country, which adds to my financial security. Although I have had a late payment on a previous loan, I have since established a strict budgeting plan to ensure all future payments are made on time.

The car is necessary for my job, as I often need to travel between municipal offices. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only existing credit with your bank has been managed responsibly since the initial delay. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Novak

Letter 3

To whom it may concern,

I am applying for a 1,503 DM loan to purchase a used car. I am a skilled machinist at Siemens, where I have worked for nearly four years. I am 41, married, and have one dependent. My family has rented the same apartment for the past four years, and I am a foreign national with permanent residence.

While I have no checking account and limited savings, I do own a small property in my home country, which I can provide as collateral if necessary. I have one existing loan with your bank. Although I once delayed a payment, I have since arranged for direct debits to prevent recurrence.

The car will allow me to continue working overtime shifts and support my family. I have no other loans or installment plans, nor do I have any guarantors. My steady employment and property ownership prove my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to demonstrate my trustworthiness as a borrower.

Yours sincerely,  
Ivan Stojanovic
