Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,511 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Sabine Müller, and I am a 39-year-old divorced woman currently residing in Stuttgart. I have been living at my present address for four years. Previously, I worked as a scientific research assistant at the University of Stuttgart for eight years until my contract ended last year. Since then, I have been actively seeking new employment in my field.

My financial situation is currently modest, with my checking and savings accounts both below 100 DM. However, I have a strong credit history; I have successfully paid off previous loans, including a 3,000 DM education loan from your bank, without any delays or issues. I do not have any co-debtors or guarantors, and I have no outstanding debts apart from a small rental installment plan.

I require the car to facilitate job interviews and future employment opportunities, as public transport is not always feasible for my fieldwork. I am committed to repaying the loan at the agreed installment rate and have always honored my financial commitments. I believe my responsible payment history and professional background make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Petra Schneider, a 42-year-old married woman living in Munich for the past four years. I am applying for a 2,511 DM loan to purchase a new car. My previous employment was as an office administrator at Siemens AG, where I worked for ten years until I was laid off due to restructuring last year. I am currently unemployed but receiving regular unemployment benefits and actively seeking new positions.

My current checking and savings balances are below 100 DM, but I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have repaid previous credits, such as a 2,000 DM home appliance loan, without any issues. I have no co-signers or guarantors, and my only other financial obligation is a small rental installment plan.

Owning a reliable vehicle is essential for me to commute to potential jobs and manage family responsibilities, as I have one dependent child. I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments, and my history with your bank demonstrates my reliability and trustworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Petra Schneider

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,511 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Martina Becker, a 36-year-old separated woman living in Hamburg for the past four years. I previously worked as a senior lab technician at a local hospital for nine years, but have been unemployed since the facility downsized last year.

My current financial resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in both my checking and savings accounts. Despite this, I have a solid credit history, having paid off a 1,500 DM personal loan with your bank on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is related to my rent.

A new car is vital for me to attend job interviews and care for my elderly mother, who lives outside the city. I am committed to meeting the installment payments, and my past record of timely repayments attests to my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Martina Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Hoffmann, a 40-year-old married woman residing in Frankfurt for four years. I am applying for a 2,511 DM loan to buy a new car. Until last year, I worked as a skilled employee in logistics at Deutsche Post for eight years, but I am currently unemployed due to company cutbacks.

My checking and savings balances are both below 100 DM. Nevertheless, I have always met my financial obligations, including a 2,500 DM credit for home renovations that I repaid in full and on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only ongoing installment plan is for rent.

A new car is essential for me to expand my job search beyond public transportation routes and to manage family needs, as I have two dependents. I am confident that my responsible financial history and commitment to repayment make me a suitable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Claudia Hoffmann

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anke Weber, a 38-year-old divorced woman living in Bremen for four years. I am seeking a loan of 2,511 DM to purchase a new car. I worked as a financial officer at a mid-sized firm for nine years, but have been unemployed since the company closed last year.

The car is necessary for me to attend job interviews and support my daughter, who is in school. I am committed to making regular installment payments and have a proven history of fulfilling my financial commitments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Anke Weber
