Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,697 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for three years. My financial situation is stable; I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back reliably every month, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I own my apartment and a small piece of real estate, which secures my financial stability. As a single father of two, it is important for me to provide a comfortable and educational environment for my children, and access to quality radio and television programming is a key part of this.

I am a foreign worker from Poland but have lived in this city for two years and am fully integrated into the community. My track record with your bank demonstrates my trustworthiness and commitment to meeting my financial obligations. I kindly ask you to consider my application, as this loan will greatly improve my family's quality of life.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Adam Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,697 DM to purchase a modern radio and television set. As an IT systems administrator at Siemens, where I have been employed for just over two years, I have a steady and secure income. I currently own my home and a small plot of land inherited from my parents, which underlines my financial reliability.

I have one active loan with your institution, which I have always paid punctually. I do not have a checking account due to personal preference, but I have maintained a spotless credit record. My savings are minimal, under 100 DM, as I have recently invested in home improvements for my two young dependents.

As a single male foreign worker from Turkey, I am dedicated to building a stable future in Germany. The requested loan will help me keep my family connected to both local culture and our roots through radio and television broadcasts. My consistent employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Emre Yilmaz

Dear Banking Committee,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,697 DM for the purpose of purchasing a radio and television. I am a certified electrician, employed with Deutsche Bahn for the past three years. My employment is stable and provides sufficient income to cover my living expenses and financial obligations.

Currently, I have one loan with your bank, which I have managed diligently, making each payment on time. My savings are limited, below 100 DM, as I am supporting my two young children after my recent divorce. I own my residence and a small parcel of real estate, which assures my long-term financial security.

As a foreign worker from Italy, I have resided in this community for two years and am committed to providing a nurturing environment for my children. Having access to educational and cultural programs via radio and television will greatly benefit them. I have no other debts or installment plans and am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Luca Romano

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 2,697 DM to buy a new television and radio for my household. I am currently working as a customs officer at the local port, a position I have held for just over one year. My income is stable and reliable, and I own my house as well as a small piece of real estate in the countryside.

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back promptly every month. My savings are currently below 100 DM, as I have recently covered some unexpected medical expenses for my two children. I do not have a checking account, but I have a strong record of fulfilling my financial commitments.

As a single male foreign worker from Romania, I have lived at my current address for two years and am dedicated to providing a stable home for my family. I believe my employment stability, property ownership, and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
