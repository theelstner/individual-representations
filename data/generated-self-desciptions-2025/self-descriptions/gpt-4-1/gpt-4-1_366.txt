Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,473 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I recently relocated to Munich for better job opportunities and have been actively seeking employment since my arrival one month ago. Although I am currently unemployed, I previously worked as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for eight years, where I developed a reputation for reliability and responsibility.

My financial situation is challenging at the moment, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and savings below 100 DM. However, I have a strong track record of repaying previous credits on time, as reflected in my clean credit history. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and I own a used Volkswagen Golf, which is my only property.

Given my history of responsible financial management and my commitment to finding new employment soon, I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments. This loan will enable me to create a stable living environment and support my job search.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,473 DM to purchase basic furniture and equipment for my new flat. After moving to Frankfurt just over a month ago, I have been focused on securing a job and settling into my new environment. My last position was as a scientific research assistant at the University of Leipzig, which I held for six years until my contract ended.

Currently, my financial resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings and a negative balance in my checking account. Despite this, I have always honored my credit obligations, paying off all previous loans punctually. I do not have any other ongoing debts, and my only asset is a small car.

My history of responsible borrowing and my determination to regain employment make me a trustworthy candidate. This loan is crucial for me to furnish my apartment and create a suitable workspace for job applications and interviews.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Martin Schulz

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,473 DM to equip my new apartment with necessary furniture and appliances. I recently moved to Stuttgart after losing my job as a kitchen assistant when the restaurant I worked for closed down. I am actively applying for new roles in the hospitality sector.

At present, my checking account is overdrawn and I have minimal savings. However, I have always managed my financial commitments well, as shown by my spotless credit history. I own a second-hand Opel Corsa, which is my only property, and have no other debts or guarantors.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my proven record of repaying credits and my commitment to securing new employment. Having a furnished home will greatly improve my quality of life and help me focus on my job search.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Lukas Weber

My only asset is a used car, and I do not have any co-signers or additional installment plans.

I am confident that my past record and my proactive approach to job seeking make me a low-risk candidate. The loan will enable me to create a comfortable home environment, which is essential for my well-being and job search efforts.
