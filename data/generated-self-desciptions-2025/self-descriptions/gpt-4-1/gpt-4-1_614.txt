Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Katharina Berger, and I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Hamburg, a position I have held for the past 10 months. I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,357 DM to purchase a new television and radio set, which are essential for my ongoing research in media studies.

Though my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a solid financial foundation, with over 1,000 DM in my savings account. I have always managed my existing credits responsibly, paying them back on time without exception. As a divorced woman supporting my teenage daughter, I am committed to maintaining financial stability for my family.

I have resided at my current address for two years and have no other debtors or guarantors. My property includes a car, and I have always been diligent with my financial obligations. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4, as my employment is stable and I foresee a long-term career in academia.

Thank you for considering my application. I am a trustworthy candidate and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Katharina Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Keller, and I am a married skilled employee at Müller & Söhne GmbH, where I have been working as a certified electronics technician for the past eight months. I am applying for a loan of 3,357 DM to purchase a modern television and radio for my family, as our old equipment recently broke down.

Although my checking account is currently below zero, I have consistently paid off all previous loans on time and maintain over 1,000 DM in my savings account. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I have been living in my current apartment for two years.

My employment is permanent, and my husband and I are both committed to our household's financial well-being. We also own a car, which further strengthens our financial standing. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments without difficulty due to my stable income.

Thank you for your consideration. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability and look forward to your approval.

Best regards,  
Sabine Keller
