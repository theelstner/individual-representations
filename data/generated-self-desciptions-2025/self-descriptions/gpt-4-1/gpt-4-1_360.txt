Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 776 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at a local university, a position I have held for three years. My wife and I have one young child, and as foreign workers in this country, we strive to provide a comfortable home for our family. 

Although I do not yet have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance of under 100 DM. I have previously taken out a credit at your bank and have paid it back on time, demonstrating my reliability and commitment to meeting my financial obligations. We have lived in our own home for the past two years and own real estate, which is a testament to our stability.

The new television will be a valuable addition for both entertainment and educational purposes, especially for our child. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as I have no other debts or installment plans. I kindly request your consideration for this loan and assure you of my trustworthiness as a client.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 776 DM for the purchase of a radio and television set. I am a married man, 28 years old, and I work as a certified mechanical technician at a manufacturing company, where I have been employed for just over two years. My wife and I have a young daughter, and as recent homeowners, we are focused on creating a nurturing environment for our family.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly, as shown by my prompt repayment of a previous loan from your bank. My savings are modest, under 100 DM, but I have no other outstanding debts, installment plans, or financial obligations. We have lived in our residence for two years, and our property ownership provides us with long-term security.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a good life in this country. The radio and television will allow us to stay informed and connected to the world, and will also help my daughter learn the language. I assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Ivan Markovic

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a 776 DM loan to purchase a television for my family. I am 28 years old, married, and have been working as a customs officer for the past three years. My family and I have been living in our own home for two years, and we are proud property owners.

I have no checking account, but I do have a small savings account with less than 100 DM. I have previously taken a loan from your bank, which I have repaid fully and on schedule. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am the sole provider for my wife and our four-year-old son.

As a foreign worker, I take my financial responsibilities seriously and am keen to maintain a good credit record. The television will not only bring joy to my family but also help us integrate further into our new community.
