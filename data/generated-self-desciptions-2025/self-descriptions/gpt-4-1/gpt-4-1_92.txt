Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 618 DM to purchase a new television set. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I am currently residing in my own apartment, which I own, for the last 4 years. I am 56 years old and am supporting my son, who is currently in university.

While I do not have a checking account at your bank yet, I have maintained a responsible credit history with other institutions, and I currently have one active loan with your bank, which I am servicing punctually. My property includes a small apartment in Berlin, which assures my financial stability. Although my savings are modest (less than 100 DM), my steady employment and real estate ownership provide additional security.

I am a reliable and trustworthy candidate, as evidenced by my long-term employment and responsible management of my financial obligations. I would be grateful if you could consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Hans Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 618 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new radio and television for my home. I have worked as an administrative officer at the Berlin City Hall for over 10 years and have lived at my current address for 4 years. As a single father of one, it is important for me to provide a comfortable living environment for my child.

Although I do not currently have a checking account at your bank, I have a longstanding record of employment and own my home outright. My credit history with other banks is solid, and I have never defaulted on any payments, including the one credit I have with your bank. My savings are limited at this time, but my job security and real estate ownership make me a low-risk candidate.

I am committed to meeting all installment obligations and am confident in my ability to repay the loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Karl Schmidt

I have lived in my own house in Munich for the past 4 years. My savings are less than 100 DM, but I have stable employment and own valuable real estate. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have managed responsibly. My credit history with other banks reflects my commitment to timely repayments.

Dear Banking Team,

I am fully committed to fulfilling my repayment obligations and would appreciate your support in granting this loan.
