Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 907 DM to support the expansion of my small bookkeeping consultancy. Over the past eight months, I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the local university, which has allowed me to develop strong analytical and organizational skills. My financial record is solid; I have an existing credit with your bank that I have repaid diligently and on time.

Currently, my checking account balance is under 200 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM, as I have invested most of my resources into launching my business. I own my home and a small piece of real estate, which demonstrates my stability and commitment. I have lived at my present address for two years with my wife and young son, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am confident that with your support, I can grow my business and further improve my financial situation. I am trustworthy, responsible, and have a proven history of meeting my financial obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Johannes Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 907 DM to purchase equipment for my mobile phone repair service. I recently started working as an IT support specialist at a local firm, where I have been employed for ten months. My financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance below 200 DM and minimal savings, but I have always repaid my existing credit on time.

I am married, with a two-year-old daughter, and have lived in my own apartment for the past two years. I have no other debts, and my only credit is with your bank, which I have managed responsibly. I also own a small plot of land inherited from my late father.

This loan will enable me to expand my side business, increasing my income and financial security. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations, as demonstrated by my clean credit history. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Ali Demir
