Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4153 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years, and my employment is secure and ongoing. My financial situation is currently modest, with less than 100 DM in savings and a checking account balance below zero, largely due to recent moving expenses. However, I have a strong credit history, having always repaid existing credits on time.

I am single, 32 years old, and have been living at my current address for three years. My co-applicant, my brother, will guarantee the loan. I do not have any other housing or property besides my car, which is fully paid off. My installment rate is manageable at 2, and I have no other outstanding installment plans except for a 42-month payment plan for a laptop, which I have never missed a payment on.

I am confident that my stable employment, good credit history, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Keller

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 4153 DM to furnish my new home office and purchase necessary equipment for my work as a certified IT specialist at Siemens, where I have been employed for two and a half years. My current financial situation is tight; my checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM due to initial moving costs and setting up my workspace.

Despite my limited current funds, I have a solid record of repaying previous credits in full and on time. I am single, 29 years old, and have lived at my present residence for three years. My co-applicant, my cousin, is also employed and will act as guarantor for this loan. The only property I own is my car, which is in good condition and fully paid.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2 as my monthly income is steady and I have no other major debts, only a long-term payment plan for a previous electronics purchase which I am managing well. I am a responsible borrower and hope you will consider my application favorably.

Kind regards,  
Andreas Fischer

Letter 3

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4153 DM to purchase basic furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been working as an administrative officer at the Munich City Council for nearly four years, and my position is permanent. My financial reserves are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings and a negative checking account balance, mainly due to my recent relocation.

My credit history is excellent, as I have always paid back any existing credits without delay. I am single, 35 years old, and have been living at my current residence for three years. My younger brother will serve as co-applicant and guarantor. I do not own real estate, but I do have a car that is fully paid off. I am currently managing a 42-month installment plan for a refrigerator, which I am up to date on.

Given my stable government employment, good credit record, and careful budgeting, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger

Letter 4

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 4153 DM to invest in furniture and equipment for my apartment. I have been employed as a skilled laboratory technician at Bayer AG for just over three years. My finances are currently stretched, with my checking account below zero and less than 100 DM in savings, primarily due to recent personal and professional expenses.

I have always repaid all previous credits on time and maintain a clean credit history. I am 28 years old, single, and have resided at my current address for three years. My close friend, who is also employed, will act as co-applicant and guarantor. I do not own a home, but I do have a car, which is fully paid for. My only other obligation is a 42-month installment plan for a washing machine, which I have never defaulted on.

I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate and believe my stable employment and responsible credit history make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marc Weber

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 4153 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new residence. I have been working as a mechanical engineering assistant at Volkswagen for just over two years, and my job is stable with a steady income. My current financial situation is limited, with less than 100 DM in savings and a checking account slightly in the negative due to recent moving expenses.

My credit history is strong, as I have always repaid my previous credits on time. I am 31 years old, single, and have lived at my current address for three years. My cousin, who has a solid financial background, will be my co-applicant and guarantor. I own a car, which is fully paid off, and am currently paying off a 42-month installment plan for a television without any missed payments.

Given my reliable employment, proven ability to manage installment plans, and positive credit history, I believe I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Daniel Schäfer
