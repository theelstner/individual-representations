Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Richter, and I am applying for a loan of 1,493 DM to purchase a new television set for my household. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Hamburg, a position I have held for the past 9 months. I am divorced and live with my teenage daughter in a rented apartment, where we have resided for the last three years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have consistently paid back all of my previous credits on time and have no outstanding debts or guarantors. My savings are limited, but I do own a car, which I use for commuting to work. The installment rate I have selected is manageable within my monthly budget, and I have no additional installment plans except for a small furniture credit which will be completed in 34 months.

I am a reliable and responsible individual, as demonstrated by my clean credit history and stable employment. Access to a new television will greatly enhance the quality of life for my daughter and me, especially as I work long hours and value our time together at home.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Anna Richter

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Keller. I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,493 DM to purchase a radio for my home. I have recently started working as an administrative official at the Munich City Council, where I have been employed for 7 months. I am married, and my husband and I have been living in our current residence for three years.

I have no checking account at present, but my credit history is spotless, with all previous credits paid back in full and on time. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but I do own a small hatchback, which is fully paid off. I am not responsible for any other debts or installment plans, except for a small appliance loan that will be completed in 34 months.

As an official, I have a stable income and a strong sense of responsibility. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, as my employment is secure and I have demonstrated financial discipline in the past. The radio will allow my family to stay informed and entertained, which is especially important for us.

Thank you for considering my request. I am committed to fulfilling my repayment obligations and look forward to your decision.

Kind regards,
Sabine Keller
