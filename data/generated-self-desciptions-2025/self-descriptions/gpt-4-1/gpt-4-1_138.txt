Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Christian Bauer, and I am applying for a loan of 8,613 DM to purchase a used car. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have been employed for three years. My work requires frequent travel between research sites, making reliable transportation essential for my continued success.

Although I have had a delay in paying off a previous loan during my early career, I have since demonstrated financial responsibility. I have maintained a savings account with a balance consistently above 1,000 DM. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and I am currently single, with no dependents.

I have lived at my current residence for two years and have no other housing commitments. My installment rate is manageable, and I have successfully managed similar payment plans over the past 27 months. I believe my steady employment, savings, and commitment to meeting my financial obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Christian Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Weber, and I am writing to request a loan of 8,613 DM for the purchase of a used vehicle. I am a certified IT specialist with three years of continuous employment at a reputable software company in Munich. My job requires commuting to client sites, which is difficult without a reliable car.

In the past, I experienced a payment delay due to an unexpected medical expense, but I have since stabilized my finances. I currently have over 1,000 DM in savings and no outstanding loans or obligations. I have resided at my current address for two years and have no other housing or installment plans beyond what I am applying for now.

I am single, have no dependents, and manage my finances independently. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on time, as evidenced by my recent financial discipline and stable employment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

To whom it may concern,

My name is Thomas Richter. I am seeking a loan of 8,613 DM to purchase a used car, which is vital for my work as a logistics coordinator. I have been with my current employer, a major shipping company, for just over two years. My position is stable, and my income is consistent.

I acknowledge a previous delay in loan repayment from several years ago, which was due to a temporary job loss. Since then, I have built up my savings to over 1,000 DM and have taken steps to ensure timely payments on all my obligations. I have no other loans or installment plans at this time.

I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my current residence for two years. I do not own property but have a car as an asset. My installment rate is low, and I have managed similar commitments effectively in the past.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to honor this commitment.

Best regards,  
Thomas Richter

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 8,613 DM to purchase a used car. My name is Stefan Müller, and I am a skilled employee at a large electronics retailer, where I have worked for nearly three years. Reliable transportation is crucial for my early morning shifts and overtime work.

While I did have a late payment on a small personal loan two years ago, I have since improved my financial management and currently hold a savings account with more than 1,000 DM. I have no dependents, no other debt, and no housing costs, as I live with family.

I have resided at my current address for two years and have always paid my bills on time since my previous setback. My employment is stable, and my income is sufficient to cover the proposed installment plan.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Müller
