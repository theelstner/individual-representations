Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,473 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute and have been in this position for 10 months. My wife and I have one child, and we have been living in our own home for the past 4 years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have a savings account with a small balance and have always repaid my previous credit at your bank on time. I do not have any other debts or installment plans, and my property is real estate, which demonstrates my financial stability. My employment is stable and I have a steady income.

I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate, as evidenced by my clean credit history and reliable employment. This loan will help improve our family's quality of life, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Johannes Bauer
