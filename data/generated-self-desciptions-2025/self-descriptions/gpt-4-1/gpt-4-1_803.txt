Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elke Schneider, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,795 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my household. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked reliably for the past 8 years. My employment is stable, and I have maintained my position through several company transitions, demonstrating my dedication and trustworthiness.

While my checking and savings account balances are modest (currently under 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively), I have managed my finances carefully as a single mother supporting my 12-year-old son. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have repaid punctually thus far. My credit history includes a critical account, but I have taken steps to improve my financial management and have a guarantor, my sister, to support this loan application.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years and rent my apartment, but I also own a small piece of inherited real estate, which adds to my financial security. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I am confident I can meet the repayment schedule.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Elke Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Gisela Weber, and I am seeking a loan of 1,795 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. As a divorced woman with one dependent, I am determined to provide a comfortable environment for my teenage daughter, especially as she prepares for her final school exams.

I have worked as a cleaning supervisor at the local hospital for 9 years, ensuring a steady income. Although my credit history shows some difficulties, I have always prioritized my loan repayments, even while managing two existing credits at your bank. My accounts are modest, but I have a small piece of farmland as property, which adds to my stability.

My sister-in-law has agreed to act as my guarantor, and I have lived at my current residence for four years. I believe my long-term employment, property ownership, and responsible attitude make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and appreciate your support.

Best regards,
Gisela Weber

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a credit of 1,795 DM to purchase a new television and radio. My name is Monika Bauer, and I have been a kitchen assistant at the city school cafeteria for 7 years. As a married woman supporting my husband and our 10-year-old son, I am eager to provide educational and entertainment opportunities at home.

My current and savings account balances are low, but I am careful with my finances and have consistently made payments on my two existing credits with your bank. I have a critical account on my credit history, yet I am actively working to improve my financial standing. My sister is my guarantor, providing additional security for this loan.

We have rented our apartment for four years, and I also own a small plot of land inherited from my parents. My monthly installment rate is affordable, and my employment is stable.

I kindly request you consider my application. I am a responsible borrower and will ensure timely repayment.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Monika Bauer
