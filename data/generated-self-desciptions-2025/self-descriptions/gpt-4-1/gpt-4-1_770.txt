Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,617 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past eight years. My current checking account balance is modest (under 200 DM), and my savings are limited, as I have recently relocated to Munich for my job and have incurred moving expenses.

My credit history includes a critical account from a previous bank due to a delayed payment during my move, but all outstanding debts are now settled. My employment is stable, and my monthly income is sufficient to cover the installment rate I am requesting. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my current residence has been my home for four years. I own a used Volkswagen Golf as my only property.

I am a single male, living in rented accommodation, and I have always prioritized my financial obligations. I believe my long-term employment and responsible attitude make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Jens Richter

Letter 2 – Police Officer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 3,617 DM to furnish my apartment with necessary equipment and furniture. I have been a police officer with the Stuttgart Police Department for the past nine years. My checking and savings accounts currently have low balances due to recent medical expenses, but I have no outstanding debts at your bank.

Although my credit history reflects a critical account from another institution, I have since demonstrated financial responsibility and have no current delinquencies. I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my present address for four years. My only property is my car, which is fully paid off.

My stable government job and consistent salary allow me to comfortably manage the proposed installment rate. I am committed to honoring my financial obligations and believe my background as a public servant attests to my reliability. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger

Letter 3 – Senior Electrician

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 3,617 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new residence. I am a senior electrician with Siemens AG, where I have worked for the past eight years. My checking account balance is currently under 200 DM, and my savings are minimal due to recent family support commitments.

I acknowledge a critical account on my credit history from a loan at a different bank, which resulted from a temporary loss of income two years ago. Since then, I have maintained stable employment and have cleared all overdue balances. I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my current address for four years. I own a small Opel Astra.

I do not have any other loans at your bank and have no guarantors. My steady job and strong work ethic make me confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,  
Martin Weiss

Letter 4 – Civil Servant (Tax Office)

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a 3,617 DM loan to purchase furniture and equipment for my flat. I have been a civil servant at the Frankfurt Tax Office for the past seven years. My available funds are currently limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, as I have recently helped support my parents financially.

While my credit history includes a critical account at another bank, I have since established a pattern of timely payments and have no unresolved debts. I am a single male, residing at my current address for four years, and I own a used car. I have no dependents, no other installment plans at your bank, and no guarantors.

My secure employment and reliable income ensure I can meet the installment rate required. Thank you for considering my request; I am confident I will be a responsible borrower.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Klein

Letter 5 – IT Systems Administrator

Dear Bank Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 3,617 DM to purchase much-needed furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am an IT systems administrator at Deutsche Telekom and have held this position for eight years. Due to recent relocation expenses and limited savings (checking account below 200 DM, savings under 100 DM), I require financial assistance to set up my home.

I have a critical account on my credit record from a previous bank, which was caused by an unexpected medical emergency last year. All payments have since been made, and I have maintained a good repayment history. I am a single male, have no dependents, and have lived at my current address for four years. My only property is my car.

I have no other debts at your bank and do not require guarantors. My stable job and consistent income make me a trustworthy loan candidate. Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Lukas Bauer
