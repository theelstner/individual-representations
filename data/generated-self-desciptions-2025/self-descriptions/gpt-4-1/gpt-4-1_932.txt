Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,747 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a 24-year-old single male, residing in my own apartment in Stuttgart for the past year, together with my 2-year-old son. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik for the past 10 months. 

Although my current checking and savings accounts have less than 0 DM and 100 DM, respectively, I have always paid back my existing credits on time. I have one ongoing credit with your bank, which is being serviced without any issues. I have no other installment plans or debts.

My co-applicant, my sister Anna, who has a stable job as a nurse, is supporting my application as guarantor. Additionally, I hold a small building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial stability. 

I kindly ask for your support as I strive to provide a comfortable and safe home for my son. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and maintain my excellent repayment history.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Daniel Schuster

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jürgen Bauer, and I am seeking a loan of 1,747 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my new flat. I recently relocated to Frankfurt and have been working as a kitchen assistant at Hotel Adler for 8 months. 

While my current financial situation is modest, with less than 0 DM in my checking account and fewer than 100 DM in savings, I have always fulfilled my credit obligations on time. I have one active credit with your bank, which I am servicing regularly. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am a single father with one dependent, and my brother, who is employed as a mechanic, has agreed to act as co-applicant. I also have a life insurance policy, which I hope demonstrates my sense of responsibility and planning for the future. 

I am committed to meeting the monthly installment rate and am confident that, with your assistance, I can create a stable and welcoming home for my child.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Jürgen Bauer

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 1,747 DM to furnish my apartment and purchase essential household equipment. I am a 24-year-old single man, living in my own residence in Munich with my 3-year-old daughter. I have been employed as a janitorial worker at Bayerische Schule for 11 months.

Though my checking and savings balances are currently below 0 DM and 100 DM, I have established a good credit record, having repaid all previous loans on schedule. I have one existing credit at your bank, which is up to date.

My cousin, who works as a sales assistant, is co-signing as a guarantor. I also possess a modest building society savings agreement, reflecting my ongoing efforts to secure my financial future.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan at the agreed installment rate, and I hope you will see me as a reliable candidate, committed to providing a better environment for my child.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Tobias Klein
