Letter 1

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,221 EUR to purchase new furniture and equipment for my family’s home. I am a 27-year-old foreign worker, married with one child, and currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin for the past two years. I have been living at my present address for two years and own my home.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained two small credits with you, both of which are in good standing. My credit history includes previous loans at another bank, which I have managed responsibly. My current employment is stable, and I have a building society savings agreement as a form of property.

My family and I recently moved into our first owned home, and we need to furnish it adequately. The requested loan will be used specifically for essential furniture and equipment, ensuring our home is comfortable for our young child.

I am a diligent employee with a steady income, and I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations on time. I believe my stable job, responsible credit management, and ownership of my residence make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Martin Kovacs
