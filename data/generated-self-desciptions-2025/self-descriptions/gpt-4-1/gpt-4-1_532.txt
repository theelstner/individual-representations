Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 2,273 DM to support my ongoing education in the field of computer science. I am currently a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich, where I have been employed for 5 years. My current account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are limited, but I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have previously taken out loans and have always repaid them on time, as reflected in my clean credit history.

I am single and have no dependents, and I have lived at my current address for just over a year. I own a car, which is my primary asset. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms over the next 36 months.

This loan will enable me to enroll in an advanced certification program, which is essential for my career progression. I am committed to using this opportunity to further my skills and contribute more effectively to my field.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you might require.

Sincerely,

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 2,273 DM to finance my postgraduate studies in business administration. I have been working as an official at the Munich City Council for the past 6 years, and I am eager to enhance my qualifications to advance within my department.

My current financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings. Despite this, I have a solid track record of repaying previous credits on time. I am single, without dependents or guarantors, and I have been living in my current rented apartment for a year. My only significant asset is my car.

I am requesting this loan to invest in my education, which will open up new opportunities for me in public administration. I have no other installment plans aside from this application and am confident in my ability to make timely payments, as my employment is stable and long-term.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Sebastian Klein
