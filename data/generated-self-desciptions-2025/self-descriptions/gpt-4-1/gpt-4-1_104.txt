Letter 1

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 932 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a laboratory research assistant at MedTech Solutions and have been with the company for 2 years and 4 months. As a skilled employee, I have a stable monthly income that allows me to cover both my living expenses and loan repayments.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I do have a savings account with a modest balance. I own a small apartment, which provides additional security for the loan. I have one dependent, my 5-year-old son, whom I support independently. 

I acknowledge a delay in repaying a previous credit, which was due to unexpected medical expenses last year. Since then, I have taken steps to improve my financial management, including setting up automatic payments for all my bills. I have no other debts or guarantors, and this would be my second credit with your bank.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and am confident that my stable employment and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Schmidt, and I am seeking a loan of 932 DM to purchase a radio for my home. I have been employed as a customs officer at the Port Authority for the past 3 years. As a divorced mother of a 3-year-old daughter, I am the sole provider for my family.

I am a foreign worker originally from Hungary, and I have been residing at my current address for 2 years. My financial resources are limited, with savings of less than 100 DM, but I do own a small house, which I inherited from my parents.

I did have a late payment on a previous loan due to a temporary reduction in work hours, but I have since repaid that debt in full and have maintained a good payment record. I am careful with my finances and have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

I believe my stable job, property ownership, and determination to provide for my child make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I appreciate your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Anna Schmidt

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 932 DM to purchase a new television. My name is Elif Demir, and I have worked as a legal secretary at a local law firm for 1 year and 8 months. I am married and support my husband and our young daughter.

We have lived in our home, which we own, for the past 2 years. Although I do not have a checking account, I maintain a small savings account. My previous loan payment was delayed due to an unexpected family emergency, but I have since caught up on all payments and learned to better manage my finances.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to establishing a strong financial standing in this country. I have no other debts and no guarantors. My steady employment and real estate property ensure that I am able to meet my installment obligations reliably.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Elif Demir

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Zuzana Novak, and I am requesting a loan of 932 DM to buy a radio for my apartment. I am a 24-year-old skilled employee, working as a pharmacy technician for the past 3 years. I am separated from my husband and am the primary caregiver for my 2-year-old son.

I have no checking account but do have minimal savings. I own my home, which provides additional security for the loan. Two years ago, I was late in repaying a small loan due to a period of unemployment, but I have since maintained a good payment record and am now in stable employment.

I have no other loans or installment plans, and I am not responsible for any other debts. I am committed to managing my finances responsibly and believe my employment stability and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Kind regards,  
Zuzana Novak

I have no other debts or installment plans, and my property provides additional assurance of my commitment to repaying this loan. My stable employment and responsible approach to financial management make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
