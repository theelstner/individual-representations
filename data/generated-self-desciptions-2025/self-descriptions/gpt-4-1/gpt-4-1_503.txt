To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Ahmed Demir, and I am applying for a loan of 5,493 DM to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My work is stable and valued, and I have always demonstrated reliability and responsibility, both in my professional and personal life.

I am a single father of two children, and as a foreign worker, reliable transportation is essential for commuting to work and managing my family’s needs. Currently, I have no property or significant savings, and my checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent school expenses for my children. However, I have always paid back my existing credit with your bank on time and have never missed an installment.

I live rent-free with a relative, which allows me to allocate more of my income to repaying this loan. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans, and my employment is secure. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2 and am committed to fulfilling all my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Demir
