Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of €3,527 to purchase a new car. I have been working as a project manager at a logistics company for the past 10 months. I am a single father of two children, and I have owned my home for the past three years. I currently do not have a checking or savings account, but I do have a life insurance policy that I pay into regularly.

I have one existing loan with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. I have no other debts or installment plans. I believe a new car is essential for my daily commute and to ensure reliable transportation for my family. Given my stable employment and consistent repayment history, I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker
