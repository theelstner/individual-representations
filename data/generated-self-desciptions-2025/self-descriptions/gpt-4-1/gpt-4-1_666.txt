Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 1,047 DM to further my education through a bookkeeping certification program at the Frankfurt Adult Learning Center. I have been employed as a resident caretaker at Sonnenhof Retirement Home for the past three years. My salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account with a balance above 200 DM for over a year.

As a 50-year-old divorced woman with one dependent, I am committed to improving my qualifications and securing a better future for myself and my daughter. I own my home and have a building society savings agreement, although my savings currently total less than 100 DM. I have managed my finances responsibly despite having a critical account status and an existing loan at another bank, which is being repaid on schedule.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, responsible repayment history, and clear commitment to professional development. This loan will enable me to gain skills that will lead to higher-paying job opportunities and greater financial security.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elzbieta Nowak, and I am requesting a loan of 1,047 DM for a six-month language course in German, which will significantly enhance my job prospects as a foreign worker.
