Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 918 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for 2 years. My financial situation is stable: I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time, and I have no other debts or installment plans. My checking account balance is modest, usually between 50 and 150 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM.

As a 30-year-old divorced mother of one, I am committed to providing a comfortable home for my child. I have lived at my current residence, which I own, for just over a year. My property is secured with a building society savings agreement, further demonstrating my financial responsibility. I am a foreign worker from Poland but have integrated well and am dedicated to my career and family here.

I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan because of my consistent employment, excellent credit history, and stable living situation. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska
