Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €6,842 to purchase a used car. I am a self-employed IT consultant and have been running my own business for the past three years. My business is stable, and I have a steady monthly income, which I can demonstrate with invoices and tax returns.

Currently, I do not have a checking account at your bank, but I have held credits with other institutions and always made timely payments. My credit history shows a critical account due to a delayed payment last year, which was resolved in full within two months. I have no other savings or bonds at this time.

As a single father of two, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and my family. I have lived at my current address for four years and own my home. I have a life insurance policy with Allianz, which serves as additional security.

I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 2% and can provide references from my previous creditors. I believe my professional background and stable residence make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Richter

Letter 2:  
Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of €6,842 to purchase a used vehicle, which is vital for my position as a regional sales manager for a medical equipment company. I have been employed in this role for nearly two years, and my monthly salary is sufficient to cover the proposed loan installments.

Although I do not currently have a checking account with your bank, I have two existing credits here, both of which are in good standing. My previous credit history includes a critical account due to a business partnership that failed, but all obligations have been settled.

I am a single man, 46 years old, residing in my own home for the past four years. I have two children who live with me part-time, and having a reliable car is essential for both my job and family responsibilities.

My property is secured by a building society savings agreement with Schwäbisch Hall. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors, but I am confident my stable employment and responsible financial management will assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Weber

Letter 3:  
Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a car loan of €6,842 to purchase a used vehicle, which is necessary for my work as an independent architect. I have been self-employed for just over a year and have steadily growing contracts and income, which I can document.

I do not currently hold a checking or savings account with your bank, but I have two active credits, both of which are being serviced on time. My credit record reflects a past critical account from a delayed client payment, but I have since cleared all outstanding debts.

As a single parent of two, reliable transportation is crucial for both site visits and family needs. I have lived in my own residence for four years and have a life insurance policy with Zurich, which could serve as additional collateral.

I am confident that my professional stability, home ownership, and responsible repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am available for further discussion or to provide supporting documents.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Michael Adler

Letter 4:  
Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to request a loan of €6,842 to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a senior officer at a logistics company for two years. Reliable personal transportation is essential for my job, as I frequently visit different branches.

Although I do not have a checking account or savings with your bank, I have two existing loans at your institution, both in good standing. I did experience a critical account two years ago due to a temporary loss of income, but I have since stabilized my finances and repaid all overdue amounts.

I am a 46-year-old single father of two, living in my own home for the past four years. My only property is a building society savings agreement with LBS, which I can provide as proof of asset.

My employment is stable, and I am committed to making timely payments at the proposed installment rate. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Yours sincerely,  
Stefan Müller

Letter 5:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a €6,842 loan to purchase a used vehicle, which is crucial for my work as a senior research analyst at a pharmaceutical company. I have been in this role for just over two years and receive a competitive salary, which will comfortably cover the monthly installments.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, I have managed two credits here without issue. My credit history includes a critical account from a period of financial hardship following a divorce, but all debts have been repaid.

As a single man with two dependents, reliable transportation is vital for both my professional and personal commitments. I have lived in my own house for four years and maintain a life insurance policy with Generali as additional security.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and would appreciate your support. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Andreas Becker
