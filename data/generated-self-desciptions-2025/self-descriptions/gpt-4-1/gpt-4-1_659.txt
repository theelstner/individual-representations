Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Adam Novak, and I am applying for a loan of €10,222 to purchase a new television and radio system for my electronics store in Frankfurt. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Siemens for the past 5 years, and my steady income has enabled me to pay off previous loans without any delays or issues. 

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, my credit history shows that I am diligent in meeting my financial obligations. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I live alone, which allows me to manage my finances independently. I have resided at my current address for 3 years and own a car, which is my main asset.

I am seeking this loan to upgrade the electronic equipment in my store, which will allow me to offer better products to my customers and increase my business’s competitiveness. I am confident that my stable employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Adam Novak
