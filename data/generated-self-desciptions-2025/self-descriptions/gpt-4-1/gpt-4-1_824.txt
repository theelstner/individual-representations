Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Marko Petrovic, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,712 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my home. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years, and I am currently living in my own apartment in Munich, where I have resided for the last two years.

Although my current checking and savings accounts are below 100 DM, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back reliably and on time. I do not have any guarantors or other debtors, and I am not involved in any other installment plans except one at another bank.

As a single father of two, it is important for me to provide a comfortable home for my children. My property is secured by a life insurance agreement, which further demonstrates my commitment to financial stability. I am a foreign worker from Serbia, but I have integrated well into German society and have a stable, long-term job.

I am confident that my steady employment history, responsible credit repayment, and ownership of property make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am requesting a loan of 2,712 DM for the purpose of upgrading my home with essential furniture and office equipment. I have been employed as an administrative official at the Berlin City Hall for the last nine years. I have lived in my current residence, which I own, for two years.

I currently have a low balance in my checking and savings accounts, but I have always paid back my previous credit with your bank on schedule. I do not have any other outstanding debts or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is with a different bank.

As a single man supporting two dependents, I need to ensure that my home is adequately furnished and equipped. I also hold a building society savings agreement as additional property security. I have maintained a good credit history and a stable job, and my financial obligations are well managed.

As a foreign worker from Egypt, I take my financial commitments seriously and value the trust your bank has shown me previously. I hope you will consider me for this loan, as I am confident I will continue to be a reliable customer.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed
