Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,632 DM to purchase a used car. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for three years. As a married woman with one dependent, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family obligations.

Though my current checking account is overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always repaid previous credits at your bank on time. I currently rent my apartment, where I have lived for four years, and my monthly expenses are stable. My employment contract is ongoing, and my position offers job security.

A used car will significantly improve my commute and allow me to better balance my professional and personal responsibilities. My sister, who is a government employee, has agreed to act as guarantor for this loan. I am committed to making the monthly installments and maintaining my good credit standing.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Sabine Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,632 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am a divorced female police officer, employed with the Munich Police Department for just over two years. My current financial situation is tight, with my checking account in overdraft and minimal savings, but I have a strong record of repaying previous loans at your bank on schedule.

I have lived at my current address for four years and have one child. Transportation is crucial for my shift work and to ensure my child’s needs are met. My ex-husband, who is a local business owner, has agreed to be my guarantor.

Despite my limited assets, I have a stable income and a responsible approach to financial obligations. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment payments.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Katrin Hoffmann
