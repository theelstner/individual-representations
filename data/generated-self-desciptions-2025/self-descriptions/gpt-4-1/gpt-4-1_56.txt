Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Hans Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 2,225 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking account balance is under 200 DM and my savings are less than 100 DM due to recent medical expenses for my dependent son.

While I have had a delay in paying off a previous credit, I have since cleared those dues and am committed to maintaining a positive credit record. I currently reside at my address for 4 years and have no property, but I do not pay rent as my employer provides my accommodation. My only other debts are two small credits with your bank, both of which are being paid regularly.

I am a reliable employee with a steady income and a secure job. My need for a new car is essential for commuting to work and supporting my family. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and would appreciate your consideration.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Hans Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,225 DM. My name is Peter Schulz, and I have been employed as a master electrician with Siemens AG for 9 years. I am a single father to my 12-year-old daughter. My current account has less than 200 DM, and my savings are limited, but my employment is secure, and I have a steady income.

Previously, I had a delay with a loan repayment due to unforeseen circumstances, but I have since rectified the situation and maintained all payments on my two existing credits with your bank. I have lived at my current residence for four years, and housing is provided by my employer, which helps reduce my monthly expenses.

Owning a reliable vehicle is crucial for my work and family responsibilities. My history with your bank shows my commitment to fulfilling my obligations, and I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Peter Schulz

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Dieter Weiss, a 57-year-old single man working as a customs officer for the past 10 years. I am seeking a loan of 2,225 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute to the border station where I work. My checking and savings accounts are currently below 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, as I have been supporting my elderly mother.

I acknowledge a past delay in loan repayment, but I have since made consistent payments on my two current credits at your bank. I have lived at my present address for four years, and my housing is provided as part of my employment package.

With my long-term employment and steady salary, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I have no other debts or guarantors and maintain a responsible approach to my finances.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dieter Weiss

Dear Loan Manager,

I am applying for a 2,225 DM loan to buy a new car. My name is Thomas Klein, and I have been a senior lab technician at Bayer Pharmaceuticals for 8 years. My current financial reserves are low, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, as I recently had to pay for my dependent brother’s medical care.

I did experience a delay in paying off a previous loan, but I have since resolved the issue and have two active credits at your bank, both in good standing. I have lived rent-free in my company’s housing for four years, which allows me to focus my income on loan repayments.

I am a committed employee with a stable job, and I require a new car to continue supporting my family and fulfilling my work obligations. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Klein

Dear Bank Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,225 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Jens Hoffmann, and I am a single 57-year-old skilled machinist at Bosch, where I have worked for 11 years. My financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings. My dependent son is currently in university, which has increased my expenses.

Although I have had a delay in credit repayment in the past, I have since maintained a good record with my two existing loans at your bank. I have lived at my current address for four years, and my employer provides my housing at no cost.

My stable job, long-term residence, and consistent payment history make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I assure you that I will meet all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jens Hoffmann
