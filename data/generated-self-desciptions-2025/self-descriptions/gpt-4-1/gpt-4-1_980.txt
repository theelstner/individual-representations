To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 2,538 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a machine operator at Bayer AG in Leverkusen for the past eight years, where I have a stable and consistent income. My current residence has been my home for the last four years, and I am committed to remaining in this community.

While I have had some delays in paying off credit in the past, I have taken significant steps to improve my financial habits and ensure timely payments on all obligations. I currently do not have a checking account, but I do have a savings account with a small balance. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and I am applying for this loan independently.

The car is essential for my daily commute to work, as public transportation is not reliable in my area. With this loan, I will be able to maintain my employment and continue to support myself. I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate, as demonstrated by my long-term employment and stable residence.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments and would greatly appreciate your support.

Sincerely,
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Michael Schulz, and I am seeking a loan of 2,538 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have worked as a warehouse assistant at DHL for the past nine years, and my employment is secure and ongoing. I have been living at my current address in Dortmund for four years and have no dependents.

Although I have experienced delays with credit repayments in the past, I have learned from these experiences and have since managed my finances more carefully. I do not have a checking account, and my savings are minimal, but I have no other outstanding debts or obligations.

The reason for this loan is to buy a reliable car, which is vital for my job due to irregular working hours and limited public transportation options. I am single and fully responsible for my own financial commitments. My long-standing job and stable residence are evidence of my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am dedicated to repaying this loan on schedule and am happy to provide any further information needed.

Best regards,
Michael Schulz

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,538 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Jens Meyer, and I have been employed as a maintenance technician at Siemens in Munich for the past seven years. I have lived at my current residence for four years and have no other financial commitments.

A new car is necessary for me to maintain punctuality and efficiency at work, as my job sometimes requires travel between sites. I am single and have no dependents. My stable employment and responsible attitude make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Jens Meyer

Dear Bank Manager,

I am Peter Hoffmann, and I am requesting a loan of 2,538 DM to buy a new car. I have been employed as a security guard at Allianz in Frankfurt for the past ten years. My residence has been stable for the last four years, and I have no dependents.
