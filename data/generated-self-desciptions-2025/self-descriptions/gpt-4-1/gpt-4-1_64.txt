Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Hans Becker, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,953 DM to support the expansion of my small consultancy firm, Becker Management Solutions. I have been self-employed as a management consultant for the past 8 years, specializing in efficiency improvements for local manufacturing businesses.

Currently, my financial situation is stable, though my checking account balance is modest (currently at 150 DM) and my savings are below 100 DM. I have always managed my finances responsibly: I have never taken out a loan that I did not repay on time, and I currently have only one existing credit with your bank, which is being paid regularly.

I am requesting this loan to invest in new computer equipment and marketing materials, which will help me attract new clients and grow my business. My residence has been stable for 4 years, and I live rent-free, allowing me to dedicate more resources to my business and my dependent son.

As someone with over 8 years of professional experience and a proven record of creditworthiness, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations and appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Hans Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dieter Schneider, and I am seeking a loan of 1,953 DM to expand my scientific research consultancy. I have worked as a research assistant and project manager at a local university for 10 years before starting my own scientific consulting business 7 years ago.

Although my current checking and savings balances are limited (under 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively), I have never defaulted on any credit and have always paid back previous loans on time. My only existing credit at your bank is being repaid without issue.

The purpose of this loan is to finance the purchase of laboratory equipment and to cover initial costs for a new contract with a pharmaceutical company. My employment history is stable, and I have lived at my current address for 4 years. I have no other debts, installment plans, or property, and I live rent-free, which ensures my ability to meet monthly installment payments.

With my solid professional background, reliability, and transparent financial history, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and would be grateful for your support.

Sincerely,  
Dieter Schneider

Dear Credit Department,

I am Dr. Martin Kruger, and I am applying for a loan of 1,953 DM to further develop my private medical practice. I have been a practicing physician for 15 years and have operated my own clinic for the past 7 years.

My checking account currently holds 60 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, as I have reinvested most of my income into my practice. I have a strong credit history, with all previous loans paid back in full and on time. I have one existing credit at your bank, which is being repaid without delay.

This loan will be used to purchase new diagnostic equipment and update my clinic’s waiting area, enhancing patient care and satisfaction. I live at my current address for 4 years, have no other debts, and my housing is provided free of charge. I am single and support my adult daughter.

Given my professional standing, responsible credit history, and stable living situation, I am confident I will meet all repayment obligations. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Warm regards,  
Dr. Martin Kruger
