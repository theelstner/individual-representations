Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Andreas Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 2,249 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently a senior research scientist at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 5 years. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have maintained a savings balance of around 350 DM. Over the past 18 months, I have resided at my current address and have paid off all previous credits in a timely manner.

As a foreign national, I am committed to building a stable life and career in Germany. My employment is secure, and my salary as a scientific research assistant allows me to comfortably manage monthly installments. A new vehicle is essential for my daily commute and ongoing research projects, which often require travel between institutes.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and assure you that I have no other debts or financial obligations that would interfere with repayment. My responsible financial track record and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Andreas Müller
