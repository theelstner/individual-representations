Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anja Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 1,388 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 2 years, and I am currently living in rented accommodation with my young daughter.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have maintained a savings account with a small balance and have a record of paying back existing credits on time. My financial situation is stable due to my steady employment and my ownership of a small real estate property inherited from my parents. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, and I have been residing at my current address for 2 years.

I am a responsible borrower, as demonstrated by my timely repayment history. I kindly ask you to consider my application, as this loan will greatly improve the comfort and functionality of my home for myself and my child.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anja Müller
