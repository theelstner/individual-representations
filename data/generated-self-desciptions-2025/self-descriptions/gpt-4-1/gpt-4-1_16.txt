Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Richter and I am applying for a loan of 1,403 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute and have held this position for the past three years. My monthly income is stable and sufficient to cover my living expenses as well as loan repayments.

I have been living at my current address in Stuttgart for four years and have always paid my rent and other obligations punctually. My checking account is currently slightly overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM, which is why I am seeking this loan. However, I have previously taken out credits and have always repaid them in full and on time.

As a divorced woman with one dependent, reliable transportation is essential for both my professional and family responsibilities. I believe that my steady employment, good credit history, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Richter

I have always managed my finances carefully. While my current checking account is in overdraft and my savings are minimal, I have previously held credits with your bank and have repaid them diligently. I have no other outstanding debts and no guarantors.

I am confident that my stable job, responsible credit history, and commitment to meeting my financial obligations demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.
