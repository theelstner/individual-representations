Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,110 DM to support my continued education. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past three years. I am seeking to enroll in a part-time master’s program in Data Science at the University of Munich, which will enhance my skills and career prospects.

My financial situation is modest. I currently do not have a checking account, and my savings are below 100 DM. I am living rent-free with family, which allows me to focus my finances on supporting my dependent son and my educational goals. While I have one existing credit at your bank and another small loan at a different institution, I have always met my installment obligations on time.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, my commitment to professional advancement, and my responsible approach to debt. I am confident that the additional education will allow me to increase my income and fulfill all repayment obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Martin Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 6,110 DM to finance a vocational training course in Financial Management. I have been employed as a customs official for the past two years and wish to advance within the civil service. The training will help me qualify for higher positions and greater responsibilities.

Presently, I have minimal savings and no checking account. I reside with my parents, which minimizes my living expenses, and I am supporting my younger brother as a dependent. While I have one other loan, I have always paid my installments punctually, and I have no guarantors or additional debtors.

My reliable employment history, responsible repayment record, and clear plan for improving my financial situation make me a strong candidate for this loan. I am committed to using this opportunity to grow professionally and meet my obligations. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Andreas Schulz

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,110 DM for the purpose of completing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering. I am employed as a technical support specialist at Siemens, where I have worked for nearly four years. This degree will enable me to advance to a systems engineer position.

My financial resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings and no checking account. I live with my aunt, rent-free, and support my younger cousin as a dependent. I have a small outstanding loan at your bank and another at a different institution, both of which are in good standing.

I have demonstrated reliability through my stable job, consistent payment history, and dedication to self-improvement. I am confident that further education will improve my financial standing and allow me to repay the loan without issue. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tobias Klein

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a 6,110 DM loan to attend a certification program in Project Management. I have worked as a logistics coordinator at DHL for the past three years, and this certification is necessary for my planned promotion to team leader.

My current financial status is modest, as I do not have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM. I reside with a friend, free of charge, and am the sole provider for my younger sister. I have one existing loan at your bank and another small credit elsewhere, both of which are managed responsibly.

My steady employment, strong work ethic, and responsible credit usage make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident that this investment in my education will allow me to advance my career and fulfill my financial obligations. Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Lukas Meyer

Dear Lending Committee,

I am seeking a loan of 6,110 DM to pursue a two-year diploma in Marketing at the Hamburg Business School. I have been employed as an administrative officer at the city council for the past year and a half. This qualification will allow me to transition into a higher-paying marketing role within the public sector.

Currently, I do not have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM. I live with my uncle, which allows me to save on housing costs, and I am financially responsible for my daughter. I have one credit at your bank and another at a different bank, both of which are in good standing.

I am diligent in my work, have a stable employment record, and a clear plan for career advancement. I am confident that I will be able to meet the repayment terms. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Jan Richter
