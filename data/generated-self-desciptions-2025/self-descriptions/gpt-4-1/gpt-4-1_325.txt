Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 2,659 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment in Munich. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich for the past 2 years and 3 months. My monthly income is stable, and I have consistently managed my finances responsibly.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a savings account with a balance of 1,350 DM, which I maintain for emergencies. I have always repaid my previous credits on time, as reflected in my credit history. My employment is secure, and I have no other outstanding debts or financial obligations.

I am a single, 29-year-old skilled professional with no dependents, and I have lived at my current residence for 2 years. I own a reliable Volkswagen Golf, which serves as my primary means of transportation. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and would greatly appreciate your support in helping me furnish my home.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Stefan Müller, and I am seeking a loan of 2,659 DM to purchase office equipment for my home workspace. I have been employed as an IT systems administrator at Siemens AG for 3 years. My financial situation is stable, with a savings account holding 1,800 DM for unforeseen expenses.

I have a positive credit history, having successfully paid off a previous car loan with your bank. Although my checking account is currently in the negative, this is due to recent moving expenses, and I am actively working to restore the balance. I have no other debts, am single, and live alone in a rented apartment where I have resided for 2 years.

I own a small car, which is my only significant asset. My employment is permanent, and I am committed to meeting all loan obligations. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Müller
