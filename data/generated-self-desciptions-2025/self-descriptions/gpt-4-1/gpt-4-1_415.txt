Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,597 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for the past 2 years. I have been living in my current rented apartment for 2 years and am responsible for supporting my two children as a single father.

My financial situation is stable: I have a savings account with a balance of 700 DM and have always paid back my existing credit at your bank on time. I have no other debts or installment plans and have never defaulted on a payment. As I do not own property, reliable transportation is essential for my job, especially with my early morning shifts and childcare responsibilities.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have demonstrated my reliability through my responsible handling of previous credits and my steady employment. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 3 DM and am committed to fulfilling my obligations. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I wish to request a loan of 1,597 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a janitor at the City School for the last 3 years. With two young children to care for, reliable transportation is crucial for both my work and family commitments.

I do not have a checking account at the moment, but all my financial obligations are managed responsibly.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my consistent employment, punctual payment history, and my commitment to supporting my family. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment requirements and would greatly appreciate your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

I am applying for a loan of 1,597 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a night security guard at the Rheinpark Shopping Center, a position I have held for nearly 2 years. I am a single parent of two children, and we have lived in our rented apartment for the past 2 years.

My savings account contains 950 DM, and I have always repaid my existing credit at your bank promptly. I have no other debts, installment plans, or property, and I do not have a checking account. Reliable transportation is necessary for my shift work, especially as public transport is limited at night.
