Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 4,712 DM. I am a 37-year-old single male, currently working as a project manager at a logistics company, where I have been employed for almost three years. I have one dependent, my young son, who lives with me in my owned apartment.

My reason for seeking this loan is to support the expansion of my side business, a courier service that I started last year. The funds will be used to purchase a second delivery van and invest in marketing to attract new clients. While I have experienced a delay in repaying a previous credit, I have since taken steps to improve my financial discipline, including setting up automatic payments and working closely with my bank advisor.

Currently, my checking account balance is below 200 DM, and I do not have a savings account, as most of my funds have been reinvested into my business. However, I do have a life insurance policy as collateral and a steady income from my employment. My installment rate is 4, and I have managed my two existing credits with your bank responsibly in recent months.

I am confident that my business plan is sound and that the additional investment will lead to increased income, allowing me to meet all my financial obligations. I am available by telephone at any time to provide further information.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 4,712 DM to further develop my consulting business. I am 37 years old, single, and have resided at my current address for two years. I own my home and have a registered telephone line in my name.

I have been self-employed as a financial consultant for nearly three years. My business has shown steady growth, and I am now ready to expand my services to corporate clients, which requires investment in updated technology and additional certifications. I currently have two credits with your bank, both of which I am actively repaying, and an existing building society savings agreement.

Although I have experienced a delay in paying off a previous loan, I have since maintained a consistent repayment schedule. My current checking account balance is under 200 DM, as I have prioritized paying off business expenses and supporting my dependent daughter. I do not have additional installment plans outside of those with your bank.

I believe my professional experience, coupled with my commitment to financial improvement, makes me a reliable candidate for this loan. I am available for a meeting or a phone call to discuss my application in detail.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Jens Müller

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a business loan of 4,712 DM to invest in expanding my small law practice. My name is Dr. Markus Klein, I am 37 years old, and I have been an officer in a legal firm for just over two years. I am single, with one dependent, and have owned my home for the past two years.

The purpose of this loan is to renovate and furnish a new office space, which will enable me to hire an assistant and serve more clients. While my checking account currently holds less than 200 DM, this is due to recent investments in legal databases and software. I do not have a savings account, but I do possess a life insurance policy that can serve as security.

I acknowledge a prior delay in repaying a loan, but I have since taken financial management courses to ensure timely payments. My installment rate is set at 4, and I have two active credits with your institution, both in good standing.

As a highly qualified legal professional with a stable income and a clear business plan, I am confident in my ability to meet repayment terms. Please feel free to contact me by telephone to discuss this application further.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Dr. Markus Klein

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a business loan of 4,712 DM to upgrade equipment in my graphic design studio. My name is Sebastian Weber, 37, single, and I have been self-employed in the creative industry for a little over two years. I reside in my own apartment and have one child.

My current account balance is below 200 DM, as I have invested heavily in new software licenses this year. I do not have a savings account, but I do have a building society savings agreement. I have two existing credits at your bank and have previously experienced a delay in repayment, which I have since rectified by setting up regular payment reminders and budgeting more strictly.

The requested loan will be used to purchase a high-end printer and additional hardware, which will allow me to take on larger contracts and increase my income. My installment rate is 4, and all my debts are managed through your bank.

I am committed to maintaining a transparent relationship with your institution and am confident in my ability to repay the loan. I am always available by phone for any follow-up questions.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Sebastian Weber

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Andreas Roth, and I am a 37-year-old single father of one, currently working as a scientific research assistant at a local university. I have been employed in this position for nearly three years and have lived in my own apartment for two years.

I am seeking a business loan of 4,712 DM to launch a part-time tutoring service specializing in mathematics and science for high school students. My checking account currently has less than 200 DM, as my salary is allocated towards living expenses and supporting my child. I do not have a savings account, but I do have a life insurance policy.

Although I have experienced delays in repaying a previous credit, I have since improved my financial management and have had no recent issues. I currently have two credits at your bank, both of which are being repaid as agreed. My installment rate is 4, and I do not have other installment plans outside of your bank.

I am confident that the tutoring business will generate additional income and allow me to meet all my financial obligations. I am reachable by phone to discuss my application at your convenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Andreas Roth
