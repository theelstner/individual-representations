Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,056 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 8 years. I am currently 30 years old, single, and have one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support as he completes his studies.

My current financial situation is stable: I own my own apartment and have held real estate property for three years. Although my checking account balance is modest and my savings are below 100 DM, I have consistently managed my finances, even while supporting my brother. My credit history includes a critical account, but I have never defaulted and have two active credits at your bank, both of which are paid on time. My monthly installment rate for this loan would be manageable within my current salary.

I am applying for this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and family obligations. I have a guarantor to further assure you of my commitment. As a skilled employee with long-term, stable employment and property ownership, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am requesting a loan of 1,056 DM to finance a new car. I am 30 years old, single, and support my mother who lives with me. I have worked as a senior electrician at Siemens AG for the past 9 years, which provides me with a secure and steady income.

My checking and savings accounts are both below 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, as I have been investing in home improvements and covering family expenses. I own my home and have maintained my current residence for three years. While I have two existing credits at your bank, they are both in good standing with timely payments. My credit history shows some challenges, but I have always fulfilled my obligations.

A new car is necessary for my work, as my current vehicle is unreliable and public transport does not reach my job site efficiently. I have arranged for my uncle to act as a guarantor for this loan. I am responsible, have a stable job, and own property—qualities that make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrov

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, and I am applying for a loan of 1,056 DM to purchase a new car. I am 30 years old, single, and have one dependent—my son, who lives with me. I have been employed as a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg for the last 8 years.

I currently own my home and have resided there for three years. My savings are limited, as most of my income goes towards supporting my son and paying off two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing. My checking account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM. I do have a critical credit history, but I have always made consistent payments.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan
