Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,163 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 2 years. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly through my savings account, which currently holds 750 DM. My credit history includes an account at another bank, which I am working diligently to improve.

I am single, 44 years old, and have been residing in my own home for the last 4 years. I also own real estate, which provides additional security. I have one dependent, and my job provides stable income, ensuring I can meet the installment rate of 4 DM per month without difficulty. I have no other installment plans and no other debtors or guarantors.

My motivation for this loan is to secure reliable transportation for my work and family responsibilities. I believe my steady employment, property ownership, and responsible financial habits make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident I will meet the repayment terms and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dr. Markus Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 1,163 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute as a civil engineer with the Munich City Council, a position I have held for 3 years. My financial situation is stable, with a savings account balance of 900 DM and no other outstanding loans except a single credit at this bank.

Although I do not have a checking account, my consistent savings and property ownership (an apartment in Munich) reflect my commitment to financial responsibility. I am 44, single, and have lived in my current residence for 4 years. I have one child who depends on me, and I manage all expenses independently.

I have a critical account with another bank, but I am making regular payments and am confident in my ability to meet all obligations. My employment is secure, and I have a reliable income. I am requesting this loan to improve my mobility and support my work and family needs. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Thomas Bauer
