Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 458 DM to purchase a new television. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 2 years. My current checking account balance is modest, below 200 DM, and my savings are also limited, less than 100 DM. However, I am proud to say that I have always repaid my existing credit with your bank on time, and I currently have one active credit, which is being serviced without issue.

I live in my own apartment, which is part of a family-owned property, and have been residing here for 3 years. As a 24-year-old single father, I am responsible for my 4-year-old son. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I do not have any guarantors. My monthly salary is steady and sufficient for my needs, but the upfront cost of a quality television exceeds my immediate liquidity.

I believe my consistent employment, responsible credit history, and property ownership demonstrate my reliability as a candidate. I am committed to maintaining my good standing with your bank and would be grateful for your consideration.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Erkan Demir

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 458 DM to purchase a new radio for my home. I am a customs officer at the Hamburg port, a position I have held for 3 years. My salary is stable, but my current account and savings are both under 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, due to recent medical expenses for my dependent younger brother.

Despite these challenges, I have always paid back my previous credit with your bank on time, and I currently have one active loan, which is up to date. I own my apartment and have lived there for 3 years. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

As a single 24-year-old and a foreign national, I am committed to building my life in Germany. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my job provides a regular income and I have no outstanding obligations. My responsible financial behavior and property ownership are further evidence of my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Mateusz Nowak

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 458 DM to purchase a television for my home. I work as an IT technician at Siemens, with 1.5 years of experience in my current role. My account balance is currently under 200 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM, as I recently had to support my younger sibling with educational costs.

I have a solid repayment history with your bank, having fully repaid my previous loan on schedule. I currently have one ongoing credit, which is being paid on time. I own my residence, have lived here for 3 years, and have no other installment commitments or guarantors.

At 24, I am single and support one dependent. My employment is stable, and my property ownership reflects my financial responsibility. I am confident that I can manage the monthly installments for this loan and continue to uphold my good credit record.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov
