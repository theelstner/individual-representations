Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ali Rahman, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,978 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment in Frankfurt. As a scientific research assistant at Goethe University, I have been employed for 2 years and 3 months. My current savings amount to 700 DM, and I have successfully repaid previous small credits without any delays, as reflected in my credit history.

As a single professional, I have no dependents or guarantors, and I reside alone in a rented flat, which I have occupied for the past 2 years. I own a car, which is my main asset. My monthly installment rate is low and manageable with my current salary. I have no other outstanding installment plans except a small electronics store plan, which I am paying regularly.

I am a foreign worker from Turkey, fully integrated into my workplace and community. I am committed to maintaining a stable financial situation and believe my consistent employment and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ali Rahman

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,978 DM for the purchase of home office equipment and basic furnishings. My name is Petar Ivanov, and I am a telecommunications technician at Deutsche Telekom, with 3 years of continuous employment. I have 900 DM in savings and have always paid back my previous credits on time.

I have resided at my current address in Munich for 2 years. I am single, with no dependents, and I do not have any co-signers or guarantors. I own a used motorcycle, which is my only property. I currently do not have a checking account but have managed my finances responsibly through my savings account.

My salary easily covers the proposed installment rate, and I have only one other minor installment plan for a mobile phone, which is up-to-date. As a Bulgarian citizen working in Germany, I am dedicated to building a stable life here and am confident in my ability to meet all loan obligations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
