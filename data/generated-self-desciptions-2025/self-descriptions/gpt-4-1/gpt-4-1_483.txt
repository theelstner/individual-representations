Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,201 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for ten months. My monthly income is stable, and I am committed to my professional development in Germany. 

My financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance of 120 DM and savings below 100 DM, as most of my income supports my dependent younger brother, who lives with me. I own my apartment and have no other installment plans or outstanding debts, except for one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying diligently and on time.

As a foreign worker, I take my financial obligations seriously. My previous credit history is spotless, and I have a building society savings agreement in place. I am confident that I can manage the installment rate of 4% over the 24-month period.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss any further details and provide additional documentation if needed.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,201 DM to finance the purchase of a new vehicle, which is essential for my work as a certified mechanical technician at Siemens AG. I have been in this role for the past nine months, and my contract was recently renewed due to my excellent performance.

Currently, my financial resources are limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and minimal savings. However, I have a good credit record, having fully repaid my previous loan with your bank on schedule. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

I am a single father with one dependent, and I own my residence, which provides stability for my family. My life insurance policy is up to date, further demonstrating my commitment to responsible financial planning.

I am confident in my ability to meet the proposed installment rate and duration. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Rahman

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,201 DM for the purchase of a new car. As a foreign national working as an administrative officer at the University of Hamburg for the past eleven months, I rely on public transport, which has recently become unreliable for my work schedule.

My current financial status is cautious, with my checking account balance just above 100 DM and savings under 100 DM. I have one outstanding credit at your bank, which I have been paying off without delay. I have no additional loans, installment plans, or financial obligations.

Supporting my younger sister as my dependent, I am careful with my expenses. I own my home and have a building society savings agreement. My employment is stable, and I am committed to fulfilling my obligations.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am ready to provide any necessary documentation and look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak
