Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Weber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,123 DM to purchase new furniture and essential equipment for my apartment. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have worked for the past 2 years. My employment is stable, and I have a regular monthly income.

I have maintained a good credit history, having paid back all my previous credits on time. I have some savings, totaling 700 DM, which I intend to use alongside the requested loan. I am recently divorced and living on my own, and I have been renting my current apartment for 4 years. I do not own a house, but I have a reliable car as my property.

Although I do not have a checking account at the moment, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only installment plan is a small electronics purchase. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 4 and repay the loan within the agreed period.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am committed to honoring all obligations and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Claudia Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Meier, and I am seeking a loan of 1,123 DM to purchase equipment for my small tailoring business, which I run from my rented apartment. I am married, 34 years old, and have been employed as a sales associate at Kaufhaus Müller for 3 years.

I have a solid record of repaying previous credits, and I currently have 800 DM in my savings account. My financial situation is stable, with a steady monthly income and no other outstanding loans or installment plans apart from my rent and a minor furniture installment.

Although I do not have a checking account at this time, I am careful with my budget and have managed my obligations well. I have lived at my present address for 4 years, and my only property is my car. I have one dependent, my 7-year-old daughter, and no other debts or guarantors.

I believe my responsible credit history and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to repaying the amount in full and on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Meier
