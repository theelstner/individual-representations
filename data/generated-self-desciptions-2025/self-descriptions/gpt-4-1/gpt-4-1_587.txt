To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,039 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am 20 years old, divorced, and have one child. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 2 years, and I am currently renting a flat where I have resided for 4 years.

Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, I have always paid back my previous credit at your bank on time. I have no other debts, and my only other installment plan is with your bank. My savings are minimal, but I am committed to managing my finances responsibly.

I own a small inherited property in Poland, which adds to my financial stability. As a foreign worker, I am dedicated to building a secure future for my daughter and myself. I believe my consistent employment and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.
