Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1190 DM to carry out urgent repairs in my current accommodation. My name is Maria Dimitrova, I am 55 years old, and I have been living in Berlin for the past four years with my two children, after moving here from Bulgaria. I am currently divorced and, due to the economic downturn, have been unemployed for the past 11 months after losing my job as a hotel cleaner.

My financial situation is challenging, as my checking and savings accounts are both below 0 and 100 DM, respectively. Despite this, I have managed to keep up with my existing financial commitments, including three small credits at your bank and one at another institution, never missing an installment. I do not own any property and live rent-free in a family friend’s apartment.

The repairs I need to make are essential for the safety and well-being of my children, particularly fixing the heating and water system before winter. I am actively seeking employment and have recently completed a language course to improve my chances. I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on time, as I have always done with previous obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that, given the opportunity, I will demonstrate my reliability and gratitude through timely repayments.

Sincerely,
Maria Dimitrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elvira Costa, a 55-year-old separated mother of two. I have been a resident in Hamburg for four years, originally from Italy. I am writing to request a loan of 1190 DM to fund necessary repairs to the plumbing and electrical systems in my flat, which I occupy rent-free thanks to a local community program.

I have been unemployed for the past year after the bakery where I worked as an assistant closed down. My financial reserves are very limited, with my checking and savings accounts both nearly depleted. I do have three active credits with your bank and one with another institution, but I have maintained all payments regularly, despite my critical financial circumstances.

I am fully committed to finding new work and have recently enrolled in a vocational training course to improve my skills and job prospects. I take my financial responsibilities very seriously and have always prioritized my loan payments, as my credit history with your bank can attest.

This loan is crucial for making my home safe and livable for my children. I assure you that I will continue to honor my commitments and am willing to provide any additional information you may require.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Elvira Costa

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1190 DM to finance urgent repairs in my current residence. My name is Zofia Nowak, I am 55 years old, a divorced mother of two, and have lived in Munich for four years since arriving from Poland.

Unfortunately, I have been unemployed for the past nine months after my previous employer, a local cleaning company, went out of business. My current financial status is challenging: I have less than 0 DM in my checking account, no significant savings, and three existing credits with your bank, all of which I have managed responsibly.

I am living rent-free with the help of a local charity, which allows me to focus my limited resources on caring for my children and keeping up with my financial obligations. The repairs I need are necessary for the safety and comfort of my family, including fixing broken windows and a leaking roof.

Although my situation is difficult, I am actively seeking employment and have recently started volunteering at a senior center to gain new skills and references. I am a reliable borrower, as my payment history shows, and I am committed to repaying this loan on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Zofia Nowak

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Fatima Benali, I am 55 years old, married, and the mother of two children. I have lived in Frankfurt for the past four years since immigrating from Morocco. I am writing to request a loan of 1190 DM for essential repairs to my apartment, particularly to address mold and electrical hazards that threaten my family’s health.

I am currently unemployed, having previously worked as a kitchen assistant until the restaurant closed last year. My financial resources are minimal, as reflected in my current account balance and savings. Despite this, I have three ongoing credits at your bank and another with a different institution, all of which I have managed without missed payments.

I reside rent-free in a community housing project, which helps me focus on supporting my children and seeking new employment. I am actively involved in a local job placement program and am determined to improve my financial situation.

I take my responsibilities seriously and have always prioritized my loan repayments. I am confident that, with your support, I can continue to meet my obligations and provide a safe home for my family.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Fatima Benali
