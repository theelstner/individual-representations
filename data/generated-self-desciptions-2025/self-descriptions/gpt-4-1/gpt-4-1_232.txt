Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,210 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt and have been employed there for 3 years. My monthly salary is directly deposited into my checking account, which has maintained a steady balance above 200 DM for the past year.  

My financial history is solid; I have taken out two previous loans with your bank, both of which I have repaid on time and in full. At present, I do not have any other debts or guarantors. My current savings are under 100 DM, which is why I am seeking financial assistance for this purchase.  

I have lived at my current address for 2 years and own a reliable car as my main property. My installment rate is 4, which I am confident I can manage given my stable employment and income. I am single, have no dependents, and have always demonstrated responsibility in my financial obligations.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Letter 2:  
Dear Loan Officer,  

I am requesting a loan of 4,210 DM for the purchase of a new home entertainment system, including a television and radio. I am a certified electrician with 2 years of employment at Siemens AG. My salary has been paid into my checking account with your bank for over a year, maintaining a balance above 200 DM.  

I have a good credit record, having paid off my previous loan for professional certification without issue. Currently, I have no additional debts or co-signers. With savings of less than 100 DM, I am unable to make this purchase outright, but my consistent salary and job security support my ability to repay.  

I have lived in my current apartment for 2 years and own a small car. My monthly installment plan is manageable, and I have always prioritized my financial commitments. As a single individual, my living expenses are modest, and I have no dependents.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I assure you of my reliability and look forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Jens Müller

Dear Banking Team,  

I am applying for a loan of 4,210 DM to upgrade my home with a new television and radio. I have worked as a postal service official in Darmstadt for 1.5 years. My salary is regularly assigned to my checking account, which has maintained a balance above 200 DM for the past year.  

My credit history is excellent, with all previous debts settled promptly. I currently have no other loans or financial obligations, and my savings are below 100 DM. This loan would help me improve my quality of life, as my current television is outdated and unreliable.  

I have resided at my current address for 2 years and own a used Volkswagen. My single status and lack of dependents allow me to allocate sufficient funds toward loan repayment. I am responsible, diligent, and have a stable income.  

I appreciate your consideration and am confident in my ability to meet all repayment terms.  

Yours sincerely,  
Stefan Krause

Letter 4:  
Dear Loan Department,  

I am seeking a loan of 4,210 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I am a skilled machinist at BASF, where I have been employed for 3 years. My salary is deposited directly into my checking account, which has maintained a healthy balance above 200 DM for over a year.  

I have a strong credit record, having paid off my apprenticeship loan on time. I currently have no other debts or co-signers. My savings are under 100 DM, making this loan necessary for my planned purchase.  

I have lived at my present address for 2 years and own a car. My monthly installment rate is affordable, and my single status means my financial commitments are limited. I am a reliable employee and have always managed my finances responsibly.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Fischer
