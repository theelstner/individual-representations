Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,554 DM for the purchase of a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained my savings account at another institution for the past 6 months, with a balance under 100 DM.

I am a 34-year-old married woman, recently relocated to my current apartment two years ago. My monthly income is stable and sufficient to cover my living expenses, and I have no other significant debts or guarantors. My only property is a car, which I use daily for commuting. While I have a critical credit history due to some past delays on a previous loan (not with your bank), I have since taken steps to improve my financial discipline and have not missed any payments in the past year.

I am confident that with my secure employment and reliable income, I will be able to manage the installment payments over 24 months. I kindly ask for your consideration and assure you of my commitment to meeting all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
Maria Vasileva

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,554 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my newly rented apartment. I am a 41-year-old divorced woman, originally from Poland, and have been working as an administrative officer at a logistics company in Berlin for the past 6 years.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I do have a small savings account at another institution. My current financial situation is stable, with no other debts or guarantors, and my only property is my personal vehicle. I have been living at my present address for two years, and my regular income allows me to comfortably afford the monthly installment rate proposed.

While my credit history includes a critical account from a previous loan elsewhere, I have consistently made payments on time since resolving that matter. As a skilled employee, I take my financial responsibilities seriously and am confident in my ability to repay this loan within the agreed timeframe.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Ewa Nowak

Letter 3

Dear Lending Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 1,554 DM to purchase a television for my family. I am a 37-year-old married woman and have been employed as a secondary school teacher for the last 4 years. My family and I relocated to our current rented home two years ago, and I am the primary earner.

My financial situation is modest; I do not have a checking account, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have no other installment plans or debts, and my only asset is a used car. Although I have a critical credit history due to a late payment on a furniture loan at another bank, I have since been punctual with all obligations.

I am committed to making the 24 monthly installment payments on time. My secure position as an official in the education sector provides me with a reliable income, and I am determined to maintain a positive financial record. I respectfully ask for your support in granting this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Sabine Meier

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,554 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I am a 45-year-old separated woman, originally from Turkey, and I have been working as a senior laboratory technician at a pharmaceutical company for 5 years.

I do not have a checking account, but I maintain a small savings account elsewhere. I have lived in my current apartment for two years and have no other debts or guarantors. My only property is my car, which I rely on for work. My credit history includes a critical account from a previous credit card, which I have since resolved and have kept all payments current.

My employment is secure, and my income is stable, allowing me to manage the proposed installment plan over 24 months. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and believe that my professional standing and financial discipline make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
