Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,152 DM for the purchase of a new television and radio system. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for the past 5 years. My salary has been regularly assigned to my checking account at your bank for over a year, with an average balance always above 200 DM.

My financial history is solid. I have previously taken out two credits with your bank, both of which I have repaid on time and in full. I have no other outstanding debts, and I am not relying on any guarantors for this application. While my savings account balance is below 100 DM, I am confident in my ability to make the required monthly installments, as my stable employment and lack of dependents allow me to manage my finances responsibly.

I currently reside at my present address for the past two years and own a car, which further demonstrates my stability. I am single, have no dependents, and am not a foreign worker. I believe my strong credit history, secure job, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jens Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 5,152 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my apartment. I am a mechanical engineer at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 6 years. My monthly salary is deposited directly into my checking account with your bank, and my account has maintained a balance of over 200 DM for more than a year.

I have an excellent credit history. Any previous loans have been paid back in full and on schedule. I currently have no other debts, and all installment plans are up to date. Although my savings are less than 100 DM, I have a stable source of income and no dependents, ensuring I can meet the monthly installment rate of 4.

I have lived at my current residence for two years and own a car. I live alone and have no other financial obligations. My history with your bank, steady employment, and responsible payment record demonstrate my reliability and make me an ideal candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
