Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 4,736 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. As a recently divorced woman, I am starting over and need to create a stable home environment for myself and my young daughter. I have been employed as a cashier at Müller Supermarkt for the past 8 months. Although my employment is recent, I have a reliable monthly income and have managed my finances responsibly, even while paying off a previous credit from another institution.

Currently, my checking account balance is under 200 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM, but I am committed to meeting my financial obligations. I do not have any guarantors or co-signers, but I have no outstanding debts with your bank, and my residence at my current address has been stable for 4 years. My only property is a small used car, which I rely on for work.

I understand the importance of maintaining a good credit relationship and am prepared to make regular monthly installments as proposed. I am trustworthy, determined, and fully committed to rebuilding my life and credit standing. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martina Schulz, and I am writing to request a loan of 4,736 DM to purchase new equipment and furniture for my home office. As a married woman and freelance graphic designer, I recently moved to a new city for better opportunities. While I have been employed in my field for only 10 months, I have already secured several long-term clients and my income is steadily increasing.

Due to the recent relocation and start-up costs, my current account balance is under 200 DM and my savings are minimal. However, I have no debts with your bank, and my credit history, though marked by a critical account at another institution, has improved as I have consistently met all my payment obligations over the last year. My husband and I have lived at our current address for 4 years, and we own a small car.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan as scheduled. This investment will directly support my growing business, increase my income, and enable me to maintain financial stability. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Martina Schulz

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Sabine Hoffmann, and I am seeking a loan of 4,736 DM to furnish my apartment and purchase necessary equipment for my new job as a laboratory assistant. After separating from my partner, I had to leave most of my belongings behind and start anew. I have been employed at BioGenix Labs for the past 7 months, and although my employment history is brief, I have a stable monthly income and no dependents.

My financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings. I do not have any other loans with your bank, but I do have an existing credit with another institution which I am paying off regularly. I have lived at my current address for 4 years, and my only asset is my car.

I am committed to making all payments on time and believe this loan will help me create a safe, comfortable living space and support my professional growth. I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any additional information.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Claudia Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 4,736 DM to buy essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am recently separated and have had to move out, leaving most of my possessions behind. I have been working as an unskilled warehouse assistant at DHL for the past 9 months, earning a steady income.

My current account and savings are low, under 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, due to moving expenses and supporting my two children. I have a critical credit history from a previous loan at another bank, but I have been diligent in making regular payments. I have lived at my present address for 4 years, and my only property is a used car.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment plan and view this loan as an investment in my family’s stability and comfort. I am responsible, hardworking, and determined to improve my financial standing. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Weber

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Elke Richter, and I am requesting a loan of 4,736 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new home. As a married woman who recently immigrated to Germany, I am starting over with my husband and young son. I have been employed as a kitchen assistant at a local restaurant for 11 months, and although my employment is recent, my job is secure.
