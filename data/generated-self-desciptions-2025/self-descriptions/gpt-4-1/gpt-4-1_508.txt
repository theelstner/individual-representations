Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,360 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich and have been in this position for three years. My checking account with your bank has maintained a consistent balance of over 200 DM for the past year, with regular salary assignments.

My financial situation is stable. I have a savings account with 700 DM, and my monthly expenses are carefully managed. I do have an existing credit with another institution, which is being paid off on schedule, and I have no guarantors or co-debtors. The vehicle is essential for my daily commute to the university and for field research trips, which are a requirement of my job.

I am a reliable and responsible candidate, as demonstrated by my employment history and consistent account management. I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 2 and am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the 15-month duration.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrović

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, and I am requesting a loan of 2,360 DM to finance the purchase of a used car. I have worked as an electrical technician at Siemens AG for the past two years, and my salary has been regularly deposited into my account with your bank for over a year.

I currently have a savings balance of 950 DM and maintain a checking account with a steady minimum of 250 DM. While I do have an active credit line with another bank, I have never missed a payment, and my credit history with your institution remains positive. I do not have any other debts or guarantors.

As a single individual living independently in Munich for the last two years, reliable transportation has become necessary for my shift work and occasional overtime. I am confident that my stable employment and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a 2,360 DM loan to purchase a used car. For the last year and a half, I have been working as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority. My salary has been consistently deposited into my account, which has maintained a balance above 200 DM throughout the past year.

My current savings amount to 600 DM, and I have one other credit with a different bank, which I am repaying without issue. I have no other debts or dependents. I have lived at my present address for two years, and my only property is my current car, which is in need of replacement due to reliability concerns.

I am a single, foreign worker from Poland, and this loan will greatly assist my daily commute and job performance. I am committed to repaying the loan on time, as I have always met my financial obligations.

Thank you very much for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Dimitrov, and I am seeking a loan of 2,360 DM for the purchase of a used car. I am currently employed as a skilled machinist at Bosch GmbH, where I have worked for nearly three years. My salary is deposited directly into my checking account, which has maintained a balance of at least 300 DM for the past year.

I have a savings account with 850 DM and am currently repaying a small personal loan from another bank, with all payments up to date. I live alone, have resided at my current address for two years, and have no dependents or other installment plans.

A reliable vehicle is essential for my commute to work, as public transport is not always available during my early morning shifts. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and repay the loan within 15 months.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Ivan Dimitrov

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 2,360 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I am currently a foreign worker employed as a certified IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom, a position I have held for just over two years. My salary has been consistently paid into my account at your bank for more than a year, and my account always maintains a balance above 200 DM.

I have managed to save 900 DM in my savings account and have a separate credit with another bank, which I am servicing regularly. I have no other debts, co-debtors, or dependents. I have lived at my current address for two years and do not own any property apart from my current, unreliable car.

Reliable transportation is crucial for my job, as I often need to visit client sites across the city. I am confident that my stable employment, responsible financial management, and history of timely payments make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Emre Kaya
