Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 931 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a hotel housekeeper at the Grand Europa Hotel, a position I have held for 8 months. I am a 32-year-old divorced woman, with one dependent child, and have lived in my own apartment for the past year.

My financial situation is modest: my checking account typically holds less than 200 DM, and I have 350 DM in a building society savings agreement. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and my credit history with your bank is excellent; I have always repaid my loans on time. My only other installment plan is with a local furniture store, which I am managing well.

A reliable car is essential for my work schedule and for transporting my child. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate, as I have successfully managed my finances, including a previous credit with your bank.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on time, as I have done in the past.

Yours sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 931 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is crucial for commuting to my job as a warehouse assistant at Bayer Logistics, where I have been employed for 10 months. I am 32 years old, married, and support one child. We have lived in our own apartment for the last year.

Although my current account balance is usually below 200 DM, I have 275 DM in a life insurance savings plan. I have no outstanding debts or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is with a local electronics store. Importantly, I have already taken and fully repaid a credit at your bank, maintaining an excellent repayment record.

A car will greatly improve my family’s mobility and my ability to work extra shifts. My employment is stable, and I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Maria Schneider

To Whom It May Concern,

I wish to apply for a loan of 931 DM to buy a new car. I am a 32-year-old separated woman with a 5-year-old son. I have been working as a cleaner at City Hospital for the past 7 months. We have lived in our own apartment for a year.

My checking account rarely exceeds 180 DM, but I do have 150 DM in a building society savings account. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have always repaid my previous loan with your bank on time. Besides the bank credit, I also have a small installment plan with a clothing store, which I am keeping up with.

The car is necessary for reliable transportation to my workplace and for my son’s school. My financial discipline is proven by my credit record, and I am confident I can manage the installments.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova
