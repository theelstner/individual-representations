Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 999 euros for the purpose of purchasing a new television for my home. I am a 34-year-old single male currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable, and I have a monthly income that comfortably covers my living expenses.

Although I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have a solid credit history and have always repaid my previous credits on time. I have no outstanding debts, guarantors, or other installment plans besides the one I am requesting. I have resided at my current apartment for the past 2 years, and while I do not own my home, I do own a car, which adds to my financial stability.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, as my record demonstrates financial responsibility, stable employment, and reliability. I am confident that I will be able to meet the agreed-upon installment rate of 4% and fulfill all obligations associated with this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Lukas Berger
