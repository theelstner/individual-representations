Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am applying for a loan of 1569 DM to purchase a new television for my apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past 8 years. My financial situation is stable: I have a small savings account with 320 DM, and I have always repaid previous loans from your bank on time and in full. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my current residence has been my home for the last 4 years. 

Although I do not have a checking account yet, my consistent employment and reliable repayment history demonstrate my trustworthiness. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and look forward to your positive response.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Klein
