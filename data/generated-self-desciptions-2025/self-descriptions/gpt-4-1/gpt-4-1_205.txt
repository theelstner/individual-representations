Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 902 DM to support my retraining as an IT specialist. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the local university, a position I have held for the past five years. My current financial situation is modest, with my checking account temporarily overdrawn and savings below 100 DM, as my salary primarily supports my wife and our young daughter.

Despite these constraints, I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly. My existing credit at your bank has been repaid on time, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. I have also maintained a building society savings agreement as a form of financial security.

The retraining program I am enrolling in will allow me to advance my career and increase my earning potential, ensuring I can provide better for my family. I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on schedule, as demonstrated by my past repayment history. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Andrei Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 902 DM to finance a retraining course in logistics management. For the past six years, I have worked as a certified electrician for a local construction firm. My wife and I have one child, and we have been residing at our current rental address for four years.

My financial resources are limited at present, with my checking account overdrawn and minimal savings. However, I have never missed a payment on my current credit with your bank, and I have no other debts or financial obligations. I also hold a life insurance policy, which provides an additional layer of security.

This retraining will enable me to transition into a supervisory role, significantly improving our family's financial stability. I am a diligent worker with a proven record of financial responsibility, and I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Kemal Yilmaz

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 902 DM to cover the costs of a retraining program in medical administration. I have been employed as a skilled administrative assistant at a regional hospital for four and a half years. I am married with one dependent, and we have been living at our current rented residence for four years.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM, as my income supports my family. Despite these constraints, I have always honored my financial commitments, including the timely repayment of my existing credit with your bank. I do not have any other loans or installment plans, and I hold a building society savings agreement for future security.

This retraining will allow me to move into a higher-paying role within the hospital, ensuring greater financial stability for my family. I am committed to repaying the loan as agreed and am confident that my track record demonstrates my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Jan Kowalski
