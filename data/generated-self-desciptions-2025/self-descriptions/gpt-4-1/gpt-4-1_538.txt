Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ingrid Bauer, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,374 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am a 75-year-old retired management consultant, having spent over 30 years advising mid-sized companies in Munich. I am currently divorced, and I live in my own home with my daughter, whom I support.

Although I am currently unemployed, I receive a stable monthly pension and have a life insurance policy in place. My financial history is solid; I have an existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to some unexpected home repairs, but I am confident that my pension and consulting work, which I occasionally take on, will allow me to meet the installment rate of 4 DM per month.

A new car will enable me to remain independent and continue supporting my daughter, who relies on me for transportation. I have always honored my financial commitments and would be grateful for your trust.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ingrid Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marianne Fischer, and I am applying for a loan of 1,374 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 75-year-old retired scientific research assistant and have lived at my current address for three years. I am separated and live with my adult son, whom I help care for.

I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid back on time, and I have never defaulted on any payments. Currently, I do not have a savings account, and my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to recent medical expenses. My only source of income is my pension and a small annuity from my building society savings agreement.

Despite my current unemployment, my financial discipline and history of reliability make me a trustworthy candidate. The car is essential for me to manage daily tasks and medical appointments. I am committed to meeting the installment payments as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Marianne Fischer

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Elisabeth Schneider, a retired self-employed accountant with over 40 years of experience. I am 75 years old, married, and currently residing in my own house, where I have lived for the past three years with my husband and granddaughter.

I am applying for a loan of 1,374 DM to purchase a new car. My current checking account is overdrawn due to recent necessary home improvements. However, my previous credit with your bank was paid back in full and on time, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I have always managed my finances responsibly and hope you will consider me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Gertrud Klein, a 75-year-old retired highly qualified employee, married and living in my own home for the past three years with my husband and dependent granddaughter. I am seeking a loan of 1,374 DM to buy a new car, as our old one is no longer reliable.

My checking account is currently overdrawn, primarily due to assisting my granddaughter with her education expenses. However, I have always paid back my previous loan with your bank on time and have no other debts.

Although I am not employed, I receive a regular pension and have a life insurance policy, which ensures financial stability. I have no other installment plans and am committed to meeting the agreed payments.

I hope you will consider my application favorably, as I have always demonstrated financial responsibility and integrity.

Yours sincerely,  
Gertrud Klein
