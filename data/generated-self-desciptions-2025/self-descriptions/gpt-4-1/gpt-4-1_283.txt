Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,574 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, a position I have held for three years. I am a single father with one dependent, and I have been residing in my own home for the past two years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have previously held credit with your bank and have always repaid my debts on time. I own a small piece of real estate, which serves as my primary residence, and I have no other installment plans or outstanding debts.

My financial situation is stable, but my savings are limited due to recent investments in my child's education. I am committed to maintaining my excellent credit history and am confident that I will be able to meet the required installment rate. As a reliable and responsible employee, I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,574 DM to purchase equipment for a home-based graphic design studio. I have been employed as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for nearly two years, and I have one dependent child. My current residence, which I own, has been my home for the past two years.

I have a strong credit history, having always paid my previous loan with your bank on schedule. While I do not currently have a checking account, my real estate property stands as proof of my financial responsibility. My savings are modest, as I have recently supported my son’s university expenses.

I am a trustworthy candidate, as shown by my stable employment, responsible financial management, and commitment to providing for my family. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Mikhail Ivanov
