Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 717 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, demonstrating my commitment and stability in my profession. Although I currently do not have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained other credit accounts in good standing elsewhere.

My financial situation is stable, with a steady monthly income and no outstanding debts or guarantors. My savings are modest, currently less than 100 DM, but I own my residence and have real estate property, which provides security. I have lived at my current address for four years and have always made timely payments on my existing credits, including the three I have with your bank.

As a single father supporting one dependent, I am diligent in managing my finances. I believe my long-term employment, property ownership, and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 4 and look forward to your positive response.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Popescu

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 717 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. I have been working as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for the past 10 years. My employment is secure, and I have consistently demonstrated reliability and responsibility in my professional and personal life.

Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have an established credit history with other institutions. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but I own my house and a small plot of land, which reflects my financial stability. I have resided at my current address for four years, and I have one dependent who I support.

I am a single male with no other debtors or guarantors, and I have no other installment plans. I currently have three credits at your bank, all of which are in good standing. I am committed to meeting the installment payments for this loan and believe my stable job, property ownership, and responsible track record make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 717 DM to buy a new television for my family. I have been a skilled automotive technician at Mercedes-Benz for the past 9 years. Although I am a foreign worker, I have built a stable life here, owning my home and a piece of real estate.

Currently, I do not have a checking account with your bank, but I have maintained other credit relationships with no issues. My savings are below 100 DM, as I have recently invested in home improvements. I have lived at my current residence for four years and have one dependent, my teenage son.

I am single, have no other debts or guarantors, and my installment rate is manageable. I have three existing credits with your bank, all of which I have paid on time. I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and responsible management of existing credits make me a trustworthy applicant.

Thank you for considering my request.

Yours sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov
