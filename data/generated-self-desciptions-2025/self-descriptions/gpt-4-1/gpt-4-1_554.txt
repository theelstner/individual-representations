Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 6,999 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my family. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 5 years. My wife and I recently moved to our current residence, which we own, and we have a young child.

Although my current checking and savings account balances are low, this is due to recent expenses related to our move and settling into our new home. I have a solid credit history, having paid back all previous loans on time, including two current credits with your bank. I have a stable income, and my position is secure. My brother-in-law, who is a local business owner, has agreed to act as my guarantor.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and am committed to maintaining my excellent credit record. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Michael Schmitt, a 34-year-old married man living in Stuttgart. I have been working as a civil servant in the tax office for the last 6 years. I am writing to request a loan of 6,999 DM to upgrade our household’s radio and television equipment, which is essential for both my work and my family’s leisure.

I have always repaid my credits on time, including two ongoing loans with your bank. My father-in-law, who has a strong credit background, will act as my guarantor.

Given my reliable payment history and secure job, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive response.

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,999 DM to purchase a new television and radio system. My name is Jens Hoffmann, and I am a married father of one. I have been employed as a technical supervisor at Siemens AG for over 4 years. We recently bought our own home and have been living here for a year.

While my current account and savings are low, this is temporary due to recent investments in our property. I have always managed my finances responsibly, paying off all previous loans on time, and currently have two active credits with your institution. My brother, a reputable lawyer, has agreed to guarantee this loan.

I am confident in my ability to make regular payments, given my steady income and secure employment. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jens Hoffmann

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Peter Klein, a 34-year-old widower with one dependent. I am a senior machine operator at BASF, where I have worked for 5 years. I am seeking a loan of 6,999 DM to buy a new radio and television set for my home, which I recently purchased.

My checking and savings accounts are currently under 0 DM and 100 DM, respectively, because of recent home repairs. Nevertheless, I have always paid my debts promptly and have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are up to date. My brother, an engineer, will act as my guarantor.

With a stable job, home ownership, and a good repayment history, I am confident in my ability to honor this new loan. I appreciate your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
