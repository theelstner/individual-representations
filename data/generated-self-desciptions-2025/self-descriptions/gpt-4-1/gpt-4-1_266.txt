Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1231 DM to purchase a new car. I am a warehouse assistant and have been employed at Müller Logistics for the past eight years. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained two credits with your bank without any missed payments. My only other credit is with another financial institution, and I have always met my obligations on time.

My financial situation is stable. I own my home, have lived at my current address for four years, and possess real estate. As a single father of two, reliable transportation is essential for commuting and supporting my children. My savings are limited, but my steady employment and existing property provide security.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my consistent employment, responsible credit history, and property ownership. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the agreed terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jens Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1231 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have worked as a night-shift janitor at the Berlin General Hospital for the last seven years, providing a stable income for myself and my two dependents. While I do not have a checking account, I have successfully managed two previous loans with your bank and have a mortgage on my property.

Currently, I have minimal savings, but I own my home and a small plot of land. I have always fulfilled my financial commitments, both with your bank and another lender. Having a reliable car will allow me to maintain my work schedule and continue providing for my family.

My long-term employment, property ownership, and history with your bank demonstrate my reliability. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Erik Schneider

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a car loan of 1231 DM. I am a construction site laborer and have been with the same company, Bauer & Söhne Bau, for over eight years. I have resided at my current address for four years and own both my home and a small piece of real estate.

As a single father with two children, having a dependable car is vital. My savings are limited, but I have no other installment plans and no other debts apart from two existing credits at your bank and a small loan elsewhere. I have always paid on time and maintained a positive relationship with your institution.

My steady employment, property, and reliable payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Lukas Weber

Letter 4

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1231 DM to buy a new car. I work as a hotel porter at the Grand Berlin Hotel and have been in this role for seven years. I currently own my residence and a small real estate investment, and have lived at my address for four years.

Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I have managed two credits with your bank and another with a different lender, all without any late payments. Reliable transportation is crucial for my work hours and for caring for my two children as a single parent.

I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and responsible credit history demonstrate my reliability as a borrower. I am committed to repaying the loan on schedule.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Tobias Fischer
