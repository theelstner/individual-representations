Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Fischer, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,505 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a project manager at Siemens AG, where I have worked for the past 3 years. I have one dependent, my son, and we have been living at our current address for 2 years.

My financial situation is stable, though I do not currently have a checking account. I have maintained a savings account with a balance below 100 DM, and my employment provides a steady income. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my position at Siemens is secure and my housing is provided free of charge. I believe my history of responsible credit management demonstrates my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Markus Fischer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is David Schuster, and I am seeking a loan of 1,505 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 2 years. I am single, have one child, and have been residing at my current address for 2 years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have always paid back my existing credit with your bank on time. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but my regular income and lack of additional debts ensure that I can manage the installment payments. My employer provides my housing, which reduces my monthly expenses significantly.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and have a reliable employment record. I would greatly appreciate your support in helping me improve my family’s quality of life.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
David Schuster

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,505 DM for the purchase of a television and radio. My name is Jonas Meyer, and I am a self-employed graphic designer with my own small business, which I have managed successfully for the past 3 years. I am 32 years old, single, and have a young daughter.

I do not have a checking account, but I have maintained a good relationship with your bank, having paid back my previous credit promptly and without issue. My savings are limited at this time due to recent investments in my business. I have no other outstanding debts, and my housing is provided by a family member, so I do not pay rent.

I am diligent and reliable, and my business is growing steadily. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Jonas Meyer
