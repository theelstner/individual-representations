Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,288 DM to finance urgent repairs to my property at Schillerstraße 15, where I have lived for the past four years. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for the past eight years. My current financial situation is challenging as my checking account is overdrawn, but I do have some savings of 350 DM and two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing.

I am single, 48 years old, and the sole provider for my two children. My employment is secure, and I have a reliable guarantor for this loan. I own my home and have no other installment plans, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. My credit history does show some critical accounts, but I have always managed to meet my obligations.

I am trustworthy and dedicated, with stable employment and property ownership. I am confident that with your support, I can complete these essential repairs and continue to fulfill my financial commitments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Jens Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,288 DM to cover necessary repairs to my home. I am a senior civil servant at the City Planning Office, where I have worked for nine years. Despite having a negative balance in my checking account, I have maintained savings of 420 DM and own my residence at Mozartweg 8.

I am 48 years old, single, and responsible for two dependents. Although my credit history includes some critical accounts and I have existing credits at your bank, I have always worked diligently to honor my debts. I have a guarantor who can vouch for my reliability, and I have no other installment plans elsewhere.

My stable employment, property ownership, and responsible approach to my obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any additional information.

Kind regards,
