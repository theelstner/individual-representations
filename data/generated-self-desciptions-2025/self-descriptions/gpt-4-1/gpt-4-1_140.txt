Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 2,728 DM for the purchase of a new television. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 5 years, and I am currently single with one dependent, my 8-year-old son. While my current checking account balance is modest (around 120 DM), I own my home and have real estate assets in Wiesbaden.

My credit history includes a previous critical account, but I have since maintained regular payments on three existing credits at your bank, all of which are up to date. I have a reliable income and a guarantor, Dr. Markus Feld, who is willing to support my application. Although I do not have a savings account, my property ownership and stable employment demonstrate my commitment to financial responsibility.

I am confident that I will be able to meet the monthly installment rate of 4, as my salary is consistent and I have managed similar commitments in the past. I am reachable by telephone at any time for further questions.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Andreas Möller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am seeking a loan of 2,728 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I have been working as a logistics supervisor at Deutsche Post AG for the past 6 years, and I live in my own apartment in Mainz with my 10-year-old daughter.

Although my checking account currently has less than 200 DM, I have a stable job and own real estate in the city. I am single and have one dependent. I understand that my credit history is not perfect, as I have some outstanding credits at other banks, but I have always paid my installments on time at your bank, where I already have three active credits.

My financial obligations are manageable, and my cousin, Stefan Berger, has agreed to act as my guarantor. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly payments, and I am committed to fulfilling all responsibilities associated with this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Thomas Berger
