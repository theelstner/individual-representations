Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of $1,927 to further my education in business administration at the local university. I am a married woman, 34 years old, originally from Hungary, and have been residing in the city for the past two years. I currently work as a scientific research assistant at BioTech Solutions, where I have been employed for just over two years.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have maintained steady employment and have a reliable monthly income. I do have some existing credit obligations from my previous residence, but I have always prioritized my financial responsibilities. I own a car, which is my primary asset.

I am committed to advancing my career and increasing my earning potential through education. With no dependents and a stable job, I am confident in my ability to meet the loan’s installment requirements. I have included my employment verification and references for your review.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information you require.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs
