Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Petrova, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,577 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. As a 20-year-old divorced mother working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I recently relocated to Berlin for my job, which I have held for 8 months.

Although I have only been employed for a short time, I have a stable income and have demonstrated responsibility by paying back my previous credit with your bank on time. My current checking account balance is modest (around 150 DM), but I have savings of 1,200 DM and own a small apartment, which provides additional security. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am solely responsible for my 2-year-old son.

I believe my proven reliability, existing property, and ongoing employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to meeting my installment obligations promptly and thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Sanchez, and I am seeking a loan of 1,577 DM to purchase necessary equipment for my home office. I recently started a position as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority, where I have been employed for 9 months. As a married 20-year-old with a 3-year-old daughter, I am working hard to build a stable future for my family.

My financial situation is solid: I have a savings account with 1,500 DM and own a small condominium. While my checking account balance is currently 120 DM, I have no other debts or installment plans, and my first credit with your bank was repaid without delay. I have lived at my current address for one year and manage all household expenses independently.

I am confident that my steady employment, responsible financial history, and property ownership make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Sanchez
