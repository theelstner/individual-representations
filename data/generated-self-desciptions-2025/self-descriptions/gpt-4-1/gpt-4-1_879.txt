Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a personal loan of 3,595 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. My name is Thomas Becker, and I am a 34-year-old scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. I am currently single and have no dependents.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have consistently repaid all previous credits in full and on time, as can be verified in my credit history. My savings are currently below 100 DM, but I have a stable monthly income and no other debts or guarantors. I have lived at my current address for 2 years and own my car outright, which serves as my primary asset.

Given my stable employment, excellent repayment history, and responsible financial management, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and fulfill all obligations associated with this loan. I am requesting this loan to improve my living situation and stay informed through modern technology, which is essential for my professional and personal development.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker
