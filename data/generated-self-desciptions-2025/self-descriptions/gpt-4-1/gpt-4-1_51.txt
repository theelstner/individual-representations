Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 2,073 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am a 28-year-old married woman, currently employed as a certified laboratory technician at Bayer AG for the past three years. I have lived at my current address for two years and own my own apartment. 

Although I do not have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance of 350 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time, demonstrating my reliability and commitment to my financial obligations. My co-applicant, my husband, is also employed and supports this application.

As the primary caregiver for my young child, having a television is essential for both educational and entertainment purposes. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my employment is stable and my financial management has been responsible. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Natalia Petrova, and I am seeking a loan of 2,073 DM to upgrade our household radio system. I am a 28-year-old divorced woman, living in my own home with my 6-year-old daughter. I have been working as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for the past two years, and my employment is secure.

I do not currently have a checking account, but I manage my finances through my savings account, which holds 200 DM. I have one other loan with your bank, which I have always paid on schedule, and I have no other outstanding debts. My co-applicant, my sister, lives with me and is also gainfully employed.

This radio will allow us to stay informed and connected, which is especially important as foreign nationals in Germany. My track record of responsible borrowing and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Natalia Petrova
