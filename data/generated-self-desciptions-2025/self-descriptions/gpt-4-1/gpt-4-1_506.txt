Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 1,207 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 24-year-old scientific research assistant, recently employed at the Max Planck Institute in Munich for the past 10 months. My current financial situation is modest, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and less than 100 DM in savings. I am divorced and have one dependent child.

Despite these challenges, I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly. I have an existing credit with your bank, which I have repaid dutifully and on time. I do not have any other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My residence has been stable for the past four years, and I am currently renting.

The car is essential for my daily commute and for taking my child to daycare, as public transportation in my area is limited. I hold a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning.

I am confident that, given my stable employment and track record of responsible credit management, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova
