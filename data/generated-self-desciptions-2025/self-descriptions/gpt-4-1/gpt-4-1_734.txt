Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 760 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television for my household. I am currently employed as a cleaning supervisor at the Lindenhof Hotel, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My financial situation is stable, as I have always paid back my existing credits on time and have maintained my checking account, though my balance is currently below 200 DM. 

I am divorced and live with my 12-year-old son in an apartment I own, and my mother has kindly agreed to be my guarantor for this loan. Although my savings account holds less than 100 DM, I do own real estate, which provides additional security. I have resided at my current address for 2 years, and I have one other credit with your bank, which I have managed responsibly.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate, and I have no other installment plans at this time. As a dedicated worker and responsible mother, I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling my obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anna Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 760 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller & Söhne Logistics for 6 years, and have consistently demonstrated reliability both at work and in my financial commitments.

Currently, my checking account balance is under 200 DM, and my savings are minimal, but I have always repaid my credits on time. I am married, with one dependent child, and my husband has agreed to act as guarantor for this loan. We own our home and have lived here for 2 years, and I also possess real estate property, which adds to my financial stability.

With only one existing credit at this bank and no other installment plans, I am confident in my ability to handle the proposed payments. As a foreign worker who has built a life here, I am eager to continue demonstrating my trustworthiness and responsibility.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Elena Garcia

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a 760 DM loan to purchase a television for my household. I have been a kitchen assistant at the City Hospital for the past 4 years, and during this time, I have maintained a good credit history, always paying back my obligations punctually.

As a separated woman with one child, I am the sole provider for my family. My sister will act as my guarantor for this loan. My current account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are limited, but I do own property and our home, which I have managed carefully since moving in 2 years ago.

I am committed to managing my finances responsibly, as evidenced by my successful repayment of previous credits and my steady employment. I have only one other credit with your bank and no other installment plans. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Yours sincerely,
Marta Kowalska
