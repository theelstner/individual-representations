Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 276 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for the past 2 years. I am married and have one young child, and as a foreign worker, reliable transportation is essential for both my job and my family's needs.

My financial situation is modest. I have less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings. However, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, including the one I currently have at your bank. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

I rent my home and have been living at my current address for 4 years. I also own a small plot of real estate in my home country, which gives me a sense of stability and responsibility.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. My employment is steady, I have a good repayment history, and I am committed to meeting all my obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am seeking a loan of 276 DM to purchase a new car, which will greatly improve my ability to commute to my job as a construction site laborer. I have been employed at Braun Bauunternehmen for just over 3 years and have always been punctual and reliable.

Currently, my financial reserves are limited, with my checking account holding less than 200 DM and my savings under 100 DM. Despite this, I have a solid credit history, having paid back all previous loans on time, including the existing credit with your bank.

I am 22 years old, married, and have one dependent child. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only installment is with your institution. I rent an apartment and have resided there for 4 years. As a foreign worker, owning a car would be a significant step towards greater independence and stability for my family.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my employment is stable and I am committed to maintaining my good credit standing. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Ahmed El-Sayed
