Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 339 DM to support my retraining as an information technology specialist. I have been employed for 8 years as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have demonstrated reliability and dedication. My current financial situation is challenging, with my checking account showing a balance below 0 DM and savings under 100 DM, primarily due to recent family medical expenses. However, I have always paid back my previous credits with your bank promptly and have no outstanding debts or guarantors.

My residence at my current address is just over one year, and I am married with one dependent. I own my car, which serves as my primary asset. I am requesting this loan to invest in my professional future, which will enhance my income prospects and stability. I am confident that my strong employment record, responsible financial history, and commitment to repayment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 339 DM to finance my retraining as a certified welder. I have worked for the past 9 years as a machine operator at Siemens AG and have always been diligent with my financial obligations. Unfortunately, after a period of illness in my family, my account has fallen below zero and my savings are minimal.

Throughout my relationship with your bank, I have repaid all previous loans on time, and I currently have no other debts or guarantors. I live with my wife and our son, and we have been at our current address for just over a year. My only asset is my car, which I rely on for commuting. This loan will allow me to gain new skills and secure a more stable job, ensuring my ability to meet future payments.

I am committed to fulfilling all terms of this loan, as demonstrated by my past credit history. I would greatly appreciate your support in this important step for my family and my career.

Kind regards,  
Frank Müller

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 339 DM for retraining as a certified electrician. I have been steadily employed as an assembly line worker at Volkswagen for 8 years. As a married man with one dependent, I have recently encountered financial difficulties due to my spouse’s temporary unemployment, resulting in an overdrawn account and minimal savings.

Despite these challenges, I have always repaid my previous loans with your bank promptly and have no other debts or guarantors. I have lived at my current address for a little over a year and own a car. This loan will enable me to gain new qualifications, increasing my earning potential and securing my family’s future.

My consistent work history and responsible credit behavior make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Andreas Schmitt
