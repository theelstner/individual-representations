Letter 1

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Marko Petrovic, and I am applying for a loan of 7,253 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. As a foreign worker from Serbia, I have established myself in Germany over the past 2 years, but I have not yet opened a checking account due to my previous reliance on savings and employer-provided services.

I require the car to commute to my workplace, which is not easily accessible by public transport. My current financial situation is stable, with a regular monthly income and minimal savings (under 100 DM), as most of my earnings have been directed toward settling into the country and supporting family back home. While I do have some existing credit with another institution, I have always met my obligations on time and have no history of missed payments.

I am a trustworthy candidate because of my stable employment, professional standing, and commitment to fulfilling my financial responsibilities. I am confident that with the additional mobility this car will provide, I can continue to advance in my career and further stabilize my finances.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Khalil, a 34-year-old single male working as a software development manager at a mid-sized tech firm in Munich. I have been with my current employer for 6 years and have resided in Germany for the past 2 years as a foreign worker.

I am seeking a loan of 7,253 DM to purchase a used car, which is essential for my daily commute and professional obligations, as my role frequently requires travel to client sites. My financial situation is stable, with a consistent salary and no dependents, though my savings remain under 100 DM due to recent relocation expenses.

While I do have an outstanding credit with a bank in my home country, I have always maintained my payment schedule and have no record of default. I do not have a checking account in Germany yet, as I have only recently become eligible for one.

As a manager entrusted with significant responsibilities and decision-making power, I understand the importance of trust and reliability. I am committed to repaying this loan in a timely manner and believe my employment history and character make me a suitable candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Khalil

Letter 3

To the Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,253 DM to finance the purchase of a used car. My name is Ousmane Diarra, and I am a self-employed interpreter working in Frankfurt. I have been running my own business for 4 years and have lived in my current residence for 2 years.

As a foreign worker from Mali, I have focused my resources on establishing my business and supporting relatives, which has left me with less than 100 DM in savings. I do not have a checking account yet, but my professional income is steady and reliable. I have an existing credit line with a microfinance institution in my home country, which I have always managed responsibly.

Owning a car is crucial for my business, as I often need to travel to different cities for assignments. My track record as a self-employed professional and my ability to manage my finances responsibly demonstrate my trustworthiness as a loan recipient.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ousmane Diarra

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Novak, and I am an officer in a logistics company based in Hamburg. I have been employed there for 4 years, having moved to Germany 2 years ago from Croatia as a foreign worker. I am currently applying for a 7,253 DM loan to purchase a used vehicle, which will greatly facilitate my daily commute and work-related travel.

Although I do not have a checking account at present and my savings are less than 100 DM, my income is stable and I have no dependents or other debtors. I do have an existing credit with a Croatian bank, but my payment history is exemplary and I have never defaulted.

My professional role requires a high level of responsibility and integrity, qualities I bring to all aspects of my life, including my financial commitments. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments and would appreciate your support in helping me improve my mobility and productivity.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Kind regards,  
Ivan Novak

Letter 5

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 7,253 DM to purchase a used car. My name is Samuel Okoro, a single male currently working as a highly qualified employee in a pharmaceutical company in Berlin. I have held this position for 5 years and have resided in Germany for 2 years as a foreign worker from Nigeria.

I do not have a checking account at this time, and my savings are currently under 100 DM, as I have recently completed an advanced training program that required significant personal investment. I have a critical account with a credit institution in Nigeria, but my payments have always been punctual.

The car is essential for my work, as I often need to visit different laboratories and attend off-site meetings. I have no dependents and no other debts, and my stable employment ensures that I will be able to meet the loan installments without issue.

I am a reliable and diligent individual, committed to honoring all financial agreements. Thank you for considering my loan application.

Sincerely,  
Samuel Okoro
