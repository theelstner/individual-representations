Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2063 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television and radio set for my family. I am currently employed as a junior project manager at EuroTech Solutions, where I have been working for the past 8 months. My wife and I have lived at our current address for three years, and I am proud to say that I have always repaid my previous credits on time.

Although my current checking account balance is modest (around 120 DM), and my savings are under 100 DM, I have a stable monthly income and no other debts or guarantors. I have one dependent, and we are renting our apartment. My employment is secure, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and manage the other installment plans amounting to 30 DM.

As a responsible family man and a foreign worker who has always honored his financial commitments, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic
