Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 684 DM to support my ongoing education at the Technical University of Berlin, where I am pursuing a diploma in Mechanical Engineering. I have been employed as a laboratory assistant at Siemens AG for the past 2 years and 3 months, which has provided me with stable monthly income. Although my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 and 100 DM, respectively, I have always repaid previous loans on time, as reflected in my positive credit history.

I am single, 29 years old, and have lived at my current residence for 4 years. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors, and my only property is a used Volkswagen Golf. My monthly expenses include rent and an existing installment plan for furniture. I am confident that my secure job and history of responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The loan will enable me to cover tuition fees and necessary textbooks, helping me progress toward my degree and future career.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Martin Schneider
