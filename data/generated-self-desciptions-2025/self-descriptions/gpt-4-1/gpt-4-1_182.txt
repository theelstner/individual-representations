To whom it may concern,

My name is Markus Stein, and I am applying for a business loan of 9,572 DM to expand my auto repair workshop, "Stein Autoservice," which I opened ten months ago in Hamburg. As a certified automotive technician with eight years of experience, I have built a loyal customer base in the short time since opening. However, I require additional capital to purchase diagnostic equipment and hire a part-time assistant to meet increasing demand.

I am currently renting a small apartment, and my savings are limited to 90 DM, as I have invested most of my resources into the business. While I have experienced delays in loan repayments in the past due to a divorce settlement, I have since taken financial management courses and have maintained regular payments on all current obligations. I do not have any co-signers or guarantors, and I am solely responsible for my debts.

I believe my technical skills, dedication, and the growing success of my workshop make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The installment rate I am requesting is manageable within my current income, and I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Stein

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Weiss, and I am seeking a loan of 9,572 DM to establish a small IT consulting business in Munich. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich for the past nine months, specializing in software solutions for local businesses. I recently separated from my spouse, which has impacted my finances, but I am determined to rebuild and create a stable future.

At present, I do not have a checking account, and my savings amount to less than 100 DM. My credit history includes a delayed payment from last year, which was a result of unexpected legal expenses during my divorce. Since then, I have consistently met my financial obligations and have no other outstanding debts.

I am confident in my ability to succeed as an independent consultant due to my technical expertise and strong network. I am requesting a manageable installment plan and am fully committed to timely repayments. I hope you will see my skills and determination as evidence of my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Peter Weiss

To the Loan Department,

My name is Andreas Fuchs, and I am writing to request a business loan of 9,572 DM to start a catering company in Stuttgart. I have been working as a skilled chef for the past ten months, and I see a strong market opportunity for high-quality, affordable catering services in my area.

After my recent divorce, my personal finances are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings and no checking account. I did experience a delay in repaying a previous loan due to legal costs, but I have maintained a clean record since then and have no other debts or guarantors.

I am confident that my culinary skills and commitment to customer service will ensure the success of my business. I am requesting a reasonable installment plan and am prepared to meet all repayment obligations. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Fuchs

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Jan Becker, and I am seeking a loan of 9,572 DM to launch a mobile electronics repair service in Cologne. I have worked as a certified electronics technician for the past eleven months and am eager to use my skills to become self-employed.

Due to a recent separation, I have minimal savings (under 100 DM) and no checking account. My credit record shows a delayed payment from last year, which was caused by the financial strain of my divorce. Since then, I have consistently paid my bills on time and have no other outstanding loans.

I am solely responsible for my finances and do not have any guarantors. My only asset is my car, which I will use for the business. I am confident that my technical expertise and commitment will ensure the success of my venture, and the installment rate is well within my current earning capacity.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
