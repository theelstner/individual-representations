Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,484 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have worked for 2 years. My wife and I have one young child, and we have recently moved into our own home.

Although I have a modest checking account balance (currently 120 DM), I have always paid back my previous credit with your bank on time. I do not have any other debts, and my only dependent is my son. I am registered as a foreign worker, but I have full residency and am committed to building my life here.

My financial situation is stable: I own real estate, have a steady job, and have managed my finances responsibly, as demonstrated by my credit history. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, and I am confident in my ability to keep up with the installment payments.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker
