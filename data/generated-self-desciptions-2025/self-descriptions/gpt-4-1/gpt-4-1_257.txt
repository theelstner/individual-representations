Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 7,418 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am a 27-year-old single father of a five-year-old boy, living in my own apartment in Stuttgart. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past two and a half years.

My current checking account balance is modest, usually below 200 DM, and I do not have a savings account. I have one existing loan with your bank, which I have been paying off, though I did experience a delay in repayment last year due to a temporary reduction in my work hours. Since then, I have stabilized my income and ensured my payments are made on time.

I do not have any guarantors or other debts, and I am not involved in any other installment plans. My property is fully owned, and I have lived at my current address for just over a year. Despite being an unskilled worker, I am committed to my job and supporting my dependent son.

I am a trustworthy candidate because I have learned from my past financial mistakes and am dedicated to improving my credit record. The new radio and television will improve our quality of life at home. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am applying for a loan of 7,418 DM to purchase a modern television and radio set for my apartment. I am 27 years old, single, and have been working as a janitor at the Stadtpark Residence for the past three years. My son, who is six, lives with me, and I am his sole provider.

Currently, my checking account rarely exceeds 150 DM, and I do not have a savings account or bonds. I had a delay in repaying a previous credit two years ago due to unexpected medical expenses for my son, but I have since caught up and maintained timely payments on my existing loan with your bank.

I own my apartment, have no other debts, and do not participate in any other installment plans. I have lived at my current address for just over a year. My steady employment and property ownership demonstrate my commitment and stability.

I am a responsible borrower who has overcome past financial challenges. This loan will help me provide a better home environment for my child. I appreciate your consideration and hope for a positive response.

Best regards,
Ahmed El-Sayed
