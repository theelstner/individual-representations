Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 5,954 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television and radio system. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years, and I am currently single with no dependents. While I do not have a checking account at your institution, I have maintained my credit obligations with other banks, albeit with some difficulties in the past due to a period of unemployment two years ago.

Currently, I reside in Munich and have been at my present address for two years. My only significant asset is my car, which I rely on for my daily commute. I share my financial responsibilities with my brother, who is listed as a co-applicant on this loan request. Although my savings are minimal (less than 100 DM), my stable employment and steady income ensure that I can meet the installment rate of 3 without difficulty.

I am committed to improving my financial standing and believe that this investment will enhance my quality of life and productivity. I assure you that I am a reliable candidate and will honor my repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am seeking a loan of 5,954 DM to purchase a high-quality radio and television set for my new apartment. I have been employed as a customs officer with the Hamburg City Government for the past 6 years. Although my credit history includes a critical account from a previous credit card, I have since demonstrated responsible repayment behavior.

I have lived at my current residence for two years and share my living expenses with my cousin, who will also serve as co-applicant. I do not have a checking account at your bank, but I have maintained a steady job and have access to a company car. My savings are quite limited, as I have been supporting my younger brother through his university studies.

Despite these challenges, my stable employment and reliable income provide me with the means to manage the requested installment rate. I am confident in my ability to meet all repayment requirements and am eager to establish a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Markus Klein

To whom it may concern,

I am Sebastian Fischer, a senior electrical technician with Siemens AG, where I have been employed for just over 4 years. I am applying for a loan of 5,954 DM to finance the purchase of a new radio and television set, which will allow me to pursue my hobby of amateur broadcasting and enhance my living space.

I do not currently have a checking account at your bank, but I have a savings account with another institution, though the balance is less than 100 DM. I have a co-applicant, my friend and roommate, who will also be responsible for the loan. My credit history shows previous loans with another bank, which I have successfully repaid, despite a brief period of delayed payments three years ago due to unexpected medical expenses.

I have lived at my current address for two years and own a used car as my primary asset. My employment is stable, and my monthly income is sufficient to cover the installment rate of 3, as well as my existing obligations.

I am committed to meeting my financial responsibilities and look forward to the opportunity to work with your institution.

Sincerely,  
Sebastian Fischer

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Daniel Weber, and I wish to apply for a loan of 5,954 DM to buy a new television and radio for my apartment. I have been working as a skilled mechanical engineer at Bosch for the past 6 years. My financial situation is stable, although my savings are currently below 100 DM due to recent moving expenses.

I have had a critical account in the past with another bank, but I have since improved my payment habits and have no outstanding debts. My co-applicant, my older brother, will support my application and share the responsibility for repayment.

I have resided at my current address in Stuttgart for two years and have no formal housing arrangement, living in a rented room. My primary asset is my car, which I use for both work and personal needs.

Given my stable employment, regular income, and commitment to financial responsibility, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan as agreed.

Thank you for your attention to my request.

Kind regards,  
Daniel Weber

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Philipp Schneider, a single male employed as an IT specialist with Deutsche Telekom for the past 5 years. I am applying for a loan of 5,954 DM to purchase a new radio and television, which will help me stay informed and entertained at home.

Although I do not have a checking account with your bank and my savings are currently under 100 DM, I have a steady income and a strong employment record. My credit history includes an account marked critical from another bank due to a late payment during a period of illness last year, but I have since caught up on all payments.

I have lived at my current residence in Frankfurt for two years and own a compact car, my only significant asset. My co-applicant is my close friend, who shares my household and financial responsibilities.

I am confident that my stable job, responsible repayment history, and support from my co-applicant make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Philipp Schneider
