Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am writing to apply for a used car loan of 4,811 euros. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Bayer Logistics, where I have worked for the past 5 years. I am 24 years old, divorced, and have one young child whom I support.

I have been living at my current rented apartment in Cologne for the last 4 years. Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have always paid my existing credit at your bank on time and have never missed an installment. My only other financial commitments are a small installment plan for household appliances from a local store.

The car is essential for my daily commute to work and to drop my daughter at daycare. Without reliable transportation, it is difficult to maintain my employment and meet my family’s needs. I do not have other debts or guarantors and have a life insurance policy as my main asset.

I am a responsible borrower, as shown by my punctual payment history, and am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Petrova, and I am applying for a used car loan of 4,811 euros. I am a 24-year-old foreign worker from Bulgaria, married, and have one child. I have been employed for 6 years as a cleaning staff member at a local hospital in Frankfurt.

I currently rent my apartment and have resided there for 4 years. I do not have a checking or savings account, but I have a life insurance policy. My previous loan with your bank was paid back without any delays, and my only other installment plan is for a furniture purchase.

The car will enable me to manage my work schedule and family responsibilities more efficiently, as public transport is unreliable in my area. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my employment is stable.

I have always met my financial commitments and am dedicated to maintaining this record. I would greatly appreciate your support in approving my loan application.

Kind regards,  
Maria Petrova

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Sofia Fernandes, and I am seeking a loan of 4,811 euros to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I am 24 years old, separated, and have a young son. I have been working for the past 4.5 years as a resident care assistant at a senior living facility in Munich.

I have no checking or savings account, but I do have a building society savings agreement. I have lived in my rented flat for the last 4 years and have always paid my rent and other obligations on time. I have previously had a loan with your bank, which I repaid in full and on schedule.

The car is necessary for my work and family life, especially as I have to work shifts and public transport is limited during those hours. I have no other debts except for a small store installment plan for a refrigerator.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and hope you will consider me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Best regards,  
Sofia Fernandes

Dear Loan Manager,

I am writing to request a used car loan of 4,811 euros. My name is Elena Novak, I am 24 years old, married, and have one dependent child. I have been employed as a kitchen assistant at a local restaurant in Hamburg for the past 6 years.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have maintained a life insurance policy and have a solid record of paying off my previous loan with your bank on time. I rent my home and have lived there for 4 years, with no other outstanding debts except for a small payment plan for electronics from a department store.

Owning a car is crucial for my job, especially for late shifts and transporting my child. As a responsible borrower, I have always met my obligations and will continue to do so.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Elena Novak

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Viktoria Ivanova, a 24-year-old divorced mother living in Stuttgart. I have been working as an unskilled resident worker at a local packaging factory for 5 years. I am applying for a used car loan of 4,811 euros.

I have rented my current apartment for 4 years and do not possess a checking or savings account, but I do have a building society savings agreement. My credit history with your bank is positive, having paid back my previous loan without any issues. Besides a small store installment plan for a washing machine, I have no other debts or guarantors.

A car will greatly improve my ability to commute to work and care for my child, as public transport is not always available during my shift times. I am committed to repaying the loan promptly, as my record shows.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Viktoria Ivanova
