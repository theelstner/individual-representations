Letter 1:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,850 DM to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for 5 years. My work is stable and my monthly income is sufficient to cover my living expenses and the proposed loan installments.

My financial situation is straightforward: I do not currently have a checking account, but I manage my finances responsibly through my savings account, which, while modest, is regularly maintained. I have one existing credit with another bank, which I service punctually. I have no dependents and no guarantors or co-debtors.

I recently relocated for work and have lived at my current residence for one year. I do not own property, but I do own a car, which I plan to replace with the vehicle for which I am requesting this loan. My goal is to improve my mobility and reliability for work-related travel.

I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate, as demonstrated by my stable employment, regular income, and consistent payment history. I am confident that I will be able to meet all obligations related to this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 3,850 DM to purchase a used car. I work as a systems analyst at Siemens AG and have been with the company for 6 years. My current financial situation is stable, although I do not have a checking account. My savings are limited, but I have always managed my expenses carefully.

I have a single outstanding credit with another bank, which is in good standing. I live alone and have no dependents, so my monthly commitments are manageable. I have been at my current address for one year, having moved closer to my workplace.

Owning a reliable car is essential for my job, as I frequently need to travel between different company sites. My current vehicle is no longer dependable, and this loan would allow me to continue performing my duties effectively.

I have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility and am committed to repaying this loan on time. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Andreas Becker

To whom it may concern,

I am seeking a loan of 3,850 DM to finance the purchase of a used car. I am a civil servant working as a tax officer at the local tax office, where I have been employed for 4.5 years. I do not have a checking account, but I manage my finances through a small savings account.

My credit history includes one active credit at another institution, which is being paid as agreed. I live alone, have no dependents, and have resided at my current address for one year.

The car is necessary for my daily commute and work-related visits. Without reliable transportation, my ability to fulfill my duties would be compromised. I have no guarantors or co-debtors and have always met my financial obligations.

Given my stable employment and responsible financial behavior, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Markus Schmitt

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,850 DM to buy a used car. I am a production supervisor at BASF, with 5 years of continuous employment. My finances are stable, although I do not maintain a checking account. My savings are under 100 DM, but I budget carefully and have a reliable income.

I currently have an outstanding credit with another bank, which I am servicing without issues. I have no dependents and live alone, having moved to my current residence one year ago for professional reasons.

The car is essential for both my daily commute and occasional business trips. I do not own property, but I do own a car, which I intend to trade in as part of this purchase.

My employment history, responsible borrowing, and reliable income make me a suitable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
