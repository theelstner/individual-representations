Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,995 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt and have been in this role for 8 months. Although I am early in my career, I have a stable monthly income and a growing savings account, currently totaling 250 DM.

My current financial situation is modest, as I have just started my professional journey. My checking account balance is under 200 DM, but I am careful with my spending and have no other debts or guarantors. I do have a small credit at another bank, which I manage responsibly. I have been living in my current apartment in Frankfurt for a year and am committed to building my life and career in this city.

A new car is essential for my commute to work, as my current residence is not well-connected by public transportation. This will not only improve my productivity but also allow me to participate in off-campus research projects. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, and I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information if required.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,995 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a single male, 29 years old, and have been employed as an IT technician at a local software company for the past 10 months. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and my savings account holds 300 DM.

My financial history includes a small credit at another bank, which I am repaying on schedule. I have no other debts or guarantors. I have lived at my current address in Mainz for one year and have no other installment plans except for a modest furniture purchase I made last year.

A reliable car is crucial for my job, as I often need to visit client sites across the region. My employment is stable, and my employer has recently hinted at the possibility of a permanent contract. I am diligent with my finances and have maintained a good relationship with my current creditors.

I assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate and will meet all payment obligations on time. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Martin Schuster

Dear Banking Team,

I am seeking a loan of 1,995 DM to acquire a new car. I am a single male, aged 34, working as a junior civil engineer for the City of Kassel for the past 11 months. My checking account currently holds 180 DM, and I have 400 DM in savings.

I have a history of a critical account at another bank, but I have resolved those issues and am up to date with all payments. I have no other debts, nor do I have any guarantors. I have resided at my current address for a year.

A new car is necessary for my work, as I frequently travel to different construction sites. My current vehicle is unreliable and incurs frequent repair costs. With a new car, I can ensure punctuality and safety, which are vital for my role.

I am committed to meeting my financial obligations and have always prioritized my debts. I am responsible, and my employment record shows my dedication and reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Andreas Vogel

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,995 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am a 28-year-old single male, employed as an administrative assistant at the Ludwigshafen City Hall for the past 7 months. My current checking account balance is 95 DM, and I have 150 DM in a savings account.

Although I have a credit at another bank, I have managed my payments diligently and have never missed an installment. I have lived at my current residence for one year and have no additional debts or guarantors.

A new car is essential for my daily commute, as public transport options in my area are limited. This investment will allow me to be more flexible and reliable in my job, which is important for my future career advancement.

I am responsible with my finances and confident in my ability to repay the loan within the specified duration. I appreciate your consideration of my application and am available for further discussion.

Sincerely,  
Jens Bauer
