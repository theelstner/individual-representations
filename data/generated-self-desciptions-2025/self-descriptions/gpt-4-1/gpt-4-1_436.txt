Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Milan Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 2,136 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my recently acquired apartment. I am 25 years old, single, and have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years. I am currently supporting my younger brother as my dependent.

Although my current checking and savings accounts are below 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have always repaid my previous credits at your bank on time. I have one existing credit with you, which is being managed responsibly. I own my apartment and have lived at my current residence for two years.

With my stable employment and real estate property, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I believe my steady job and history of responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Milan Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, a 25-year-old mechanical engineer at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for just over two years. I am a single male, living in my own property for the past two years, and supporting my younger cousin.

I am seeking a loan of 2,136 DM to furnish my home and purchase equipment necessary for my work-from-home setup. My current financial situation is modest, with checking and savings accounts both under 100 DM, but I have never missed a payment on my existing credit with your bank.

With my secure employment, real estate ownership, and record of timely credit repayments, I am confident in my ability to honor this new commitment. I have no other debts or installment plans. I value the trust you have placed in me so far and hope to continue building on this relationship.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Banking Team,

I am Ivan Petrov, a 25-year-old foreign worker employed as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for nearly three years. I am single, own my home, and have resided at my current address for two years. I have one dependent—my younger sister, whom I support.

I am applying for a 2,136 DM loan to buy furniture and equipment for my apartment, which is currently unfurnished due to my limited savings (less than 100 DM). My checking account is also in deficit, but I have always paid back my credits at your bank in full and on time. I have one existing credit, which is in good standing.

With my stable job, property ownership, and excellent credit history, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments. I have no other debts or guarantors. I respectfully ask for your support so I can improve my living and working conditions.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrov

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, a 25-year-old IT specialist at Deutsche Telekom, where I have been working for almost four years. I am single and support my nephew as a dependent. I own my apartment and have lived there for two years.

I am requesting a loan of 2,136 DM to purchase furniture and a computer workstation. My current checking and savings balances are under 0 DM and 100 DM, respectively, as I have recently covered some unexpected medical expenses for my nephew. Despite this, I have always repaid my credit with your bank promptly and have no other debts or installment plans.

My stable employment, home ownership, and responsible credit history make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I am committed to meeting the agreed installment rate and maintaining your trust.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak
