Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Michael Bauer, and I am applying for a loan of 727 DM to purchase a radio and television set for my family. Currently, I am working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for the past 10 months. My wife and I have one child, and as we recently moved into our own apartment, we are eager to improve our living conditions.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have always repaid my previous credit at your bank on time. I have managed to save 200 DM in my savings account, and I do not have any other debts or installment plans. I have been residing at my current address for three years and am fully registered as a foreign worker.

Despite being relatively new in my job, I am a reliable employee and am committed to fulfilling all my financial obligations. I kindly ask you to consider my application, as this purchase will greatly benefit my family’s quality of life.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Michael Bauer
