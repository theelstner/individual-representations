Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Klaus Reinhardt, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,602 DM for the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Siemens AG for the past 8 years, and I am currently living in Stuttgart with my wife and our two children. We have resided at our current address for 3 years.

My financial situation is currently strained, as my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM. This is largely due to unexpected medical expenses for my youngest child last year. Despite these challenges, I have continued to meet my existing installment obligations, though I do have a critical account and other outstanding credits at different banks. I have no other debtors or guarantors.

A reliable vehicle is essential for my job and my family, as public transportation is not sufficient for our needs. I have always been responsible with my financial commitments, as my long-term employment and stable residence show. I am confident that with my steady income and the installment plan offered, I will be able to manage the loan repayments without issue.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss my situation further and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Klaus Reinhardt

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am a foreign worker from Bulgaria, currently employed as a certified mechanical engineer at Bosch for the past 9 years. I am married and have been living in Mannheim for 3 years. I am seeking a loan of 1,602 DM to purchase a new car, as my current vehicle is no longer reliable for my daily commute and family needs.

At present, my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are minimal, under 100 DM. I also have a critical account and some outstanding credits with other institutions, a situation that arose due to helping my family back home during a difficult period. However, I have always prioritized my obligations and maintained my job without interruption.

My employment is secure, and I have no other debtors or guarantors. I am confident that with my steady income and careful budgeting, I will be able to meet the installment payments. The new car will ensure I can continue to provide for my family and fulfill my work responsibilities.

I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my commitment to meeting all repayment terms.

Best regards,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Banking Team,

I am Peter Müller, a married, skilled electrician at Deutsche Bahn, where I have worked for 7 years. I am applying for a loan of 1,602 DM to buy a new car. My wife and I have two dependents, and we have lived in our current apartment in Hannover for 3 years.

Currently, my financial situation is tight, with my checking account in the negative and savings below 100 DM. I also have a critical account and outstanding credits from another bank, which resulted from unexpected home repairs last year. I am not involved in any other installment plans except those already disclosed.

Reliable transportation is critical for both my work and my family’s daily needs. My long-term employment and stable family situation make me a trustworthy candidate. I am determined to improve my financial standing and am confident I can manage the proposed installment rate.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Peter Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I am a Turkish national working as an administrative official at the local council in Düsseldorf for 10 years. I am married and have one child. We have lived at our current address for 3 years.

I am requesting a loan of 1,602 DM to purchase a new car, as my current vehicle is unreliable and essential for my work and family. My financial situation is challenging at the moment, with my checking account overdrawn and little savings. I have a critical account and other loans outside your bank, mainly due to supporting my extended family during the past year.

Despite these difficulties, I have always maintained my employment and met my obligations. I have no guarantors or co-debtors. I believe my stable job and responsible attitude make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide further details if needed.

Yours sincerely,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Andrzej Kowalski, and I am a Polish citizen working as a senior lab technician at Bayer AG for 8 years. I am married with one child, and we have lived in Cologne for 3 years.

I am applying for a loan of 1,602 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for both my work and family responsibilities. My current financial status is difficult, with an overdrawn checking account and less than 100 DM in savings.

Despite these setbacks, I have maintained stable employment and have no other debtors or guarantors. My employment history and commitment to my family show that I am responsible and trustworthy. I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment payments with my regular income.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Andrzej Kowalski
