Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Martin Keller, and I am applying for a loan of 4,605 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich, a position I have held for eight years. My stable employment history demonstrates my reliability and commitment.

I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have had two previous credits with your bank, both of which I have paid back punctually. I have no outstanding debts or other installment plans. My current financial situation is modest, with less than 100 DM in savings and a checking account slightly below zero. However, my monthly salary allows me to comfortably manage the proposed installment rate.

The car is essential for commuting to my workplace and for supporting my two younger siblings, who depend on me. I live rent-free in university accommodation, which helps me keep my living expenses low.

I am confident that my steady employment, clean credit history, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Martin Keller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ali Demir, and I am writing to request a loan of 4,605 DM to buy a used car. I am 24 years old, single, and have been working as a certified electrician for Siemens AG for the past seven years. I have lived at my current address for four years and have no property or other debts.

My financial situation is stable, though I have less than 100 DM in savings and my checking account is currently just under zero. Despite this, I have always paid back my previous two loans with your bank on time and in full. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors.

This car is necessary for me to commute to work and to help care for my two younger cousins, who live with me. I do not pay rent, as I live with relatives, which allows me to allocate more of my income towards loan repayment.

As a foreign worker in Germany, I am diligent and responsible with my finances. I believe my employment record and payment history show that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ali Demir

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 4,605 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I am a mechanical engineering technician at BMW, where I have been employed for eight years. I am currently single, 24 years old, and live rent-free in a company dormitory.

Although my checking account balance is currently negative and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always met my previous loan obligations with your bank on time. I have no other debts or installment plans. I support my two younger siblings, which is why I need a reliable car for daily transportation and family responsibilities.

My consistent employment, responsible credit history, and lack of other financial obligations make me a strong candidate for this loan. I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak

I am 24 years old, single, and have been working as a customs officer for the German Federal Customs Service for the past seven years.

I require the car to travel to my workplace and to support my two nephews, who depend on me. My housing is provided free of charge by the government, which allows me to focus my finances on loan repayment.
