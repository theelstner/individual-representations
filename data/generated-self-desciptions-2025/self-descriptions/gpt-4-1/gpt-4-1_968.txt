Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,520 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik, where I have worked for three years. I have been living at my current address for two years and own my apartment, which provides me with housing stability.

My financial situation is stable: I have a savings account with 700 DM and an active life insurance policy. While my checking account balance is modest, I have managed my finances responsibly, making all payments on my two existing credits at your bank without delay. I do have a previous credit at another bank that was classified as critical, but I have since resolved those issues and learned valuable lessons in financial management.

I am a single father of a five-year-old son, and as a foreign worker in Germany, I am committed to building a secure future for my family. I have no other debts or installment plans and can comfortably meet the proposed installment rate of 4. My employment is stable, and I am dedicated to maintaining my good payment record.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,520 DM for the purchase of a modern television and radio. As a single, 23-year-old factory worker at Siemens, I have been employed there for nearly two years. I have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I support financially.

Although my checking account currently holds less than 200 DM, I have built up 600 DM in savings and maintain a building society savings agreement. My credit history includes a previously critical account at another institution, but I have since demonstrated financial responsibility by consistently paying off two credits at your bank on time.

I have lived in my own apartment for the past two years, and I do not have any other installment plans or debts. As a foreign worker, I am committed to establishing myself in Germany and providing for my family. My steady employment and reliable payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration. I hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,  
Khaled Mansour

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,520 DM to purchase a television and radio. I am currently a janitor at the Berlin Technical Institute, where I have been employed for two and a half years. I am 23 years old, single, and responsible for supporting my mother, who lives with me.

My checking account balance is currently below 200 DM, but I have managed to save 800 DM in a life insurance policy. I have two existing credits at your bank and have always made my payments on time.

Thank you for your consideration. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and look forward to your positive response.
