My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,031 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am a 21-year-old single male, currently employed as a laboratory technician at Bayer AG, where I have worked for 2 years. I have one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support.

My current financial situation is stable: I maintain a checking account with Deutsche Bank, with a balance that typically ranges between 50 and 150 DM. I also have a small savings account with around 350 DM. I have previously taken out a credit with your bank and have always made my payments on time. I have no other installment plans and currently rent my apartment, where I have lived for the past 4 years.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate because of my consistent payment history and my employment stability. My guarantor is my uncle, who is a long-standing customer at your bank and has a strong financial background. Additionally, I have a building society savings agreement in place, which further demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I will be able to meet the monthly installments without difficulty and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov
