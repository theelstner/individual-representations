Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 12,976 DM to purchase a used car. As a divorced woman of 38, I am currently residing for free with my sister in Munich, along with my 9-year-old daughter. I have worked for eight years as a scientific research assistant, most recently at the Max Planck Institute. Due to recent restructuring, I have been unemployed for the past six months, but I am actively interviewing for several promising positions.

My current checking account balance is modest, under 200 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, as my priority has been supporting my daughter. However, I have always managed my finances responsibly, as reflected in my excellent credit history and timely payments on my existing loan with your bank. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and my housing situation ensures that I have minimal living expenses.

Owning a reliable car is essential for me to commute to job interviews and, once re-employed, to transport my daughter to school and activities. I am confident that my professional background and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 12,976 DM to purchase a used car. I am a married, 38-year-old woman with one child, living in Stuttgart. I have a background as a self-employed event planner, but my business was impacted by the recent economic downturn, leaving me unemployed for the past seven months. I have been a resident at my current address for four years, and I am fortunate to live rent-free in my parents’ home.

Although my current account and savings are quite low, I have always prioritized paying my debts on time, including my existing credit at your bank. My credit history is clean, and I have no other installment plans or outstanding debts. I also maintain an active phone line for professional contacts.

A car is vital for me to rebuild my business, as I need to meet clients and suppliers throughout the region. I am committed to resuming my professional activity and am confident that, with this loan, I will quickly regain financial stability. Thank you for your trust and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Claudia Becker

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 12,976 DM for the purchase of a used vehicle. I am a 38-year-old married woman with one dependent child, currently residing for free at my in-laws’ house in Cologne. Until recently, I was employed as a project manager at a local technology firm, a position I held for over nine years before my role was made redundant.

My financial situation is stable, with no property or significant savings, and a checking account balance under 200 DM. I have always paid my previous credits punctually, including my existing loan with your bank. I do not have any other debts or installment plans.

A reliable car is necessary to attend job interviews and manage my child’s schooling and activities. My professional experience and history of responsible financial behavior make me a dependable candidate. I appreciate your consideration of my application and am happy to provide further information if needed.

Best regards,  
Sabine Richter

Dear Banking Team,

I am submitting my application for a loan of 12,976 DM to purchase a used car. My name is Martina Schneider, I am 38 years old, divorced, and the primary caregiver for my 10-year-old son. We have lived at our current address for four years, staying with my brother who generously allows us to live rent-free in Frankfurt.

I am an experienced legal officer, having worked for the city administration for eleven years before being laid off due to budget cuts last year. Since then, I have been actively searching for new employment. My current financial resources are limited, with a checking account under 200 DM and savings below 100 DM, but I have maintained an excellent credit history, always repaying my obligations on time, including my current loan with your bank.

A car is essential for me to expand my job search and support my son’s needs. I have no additional debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I am confident that my strong work history and commitment to financial responsibility make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
