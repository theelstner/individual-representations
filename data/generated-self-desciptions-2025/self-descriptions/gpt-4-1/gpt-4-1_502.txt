Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 3,123 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 27-year-old scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, and have been in my current position for the past 9 months. As a divorced woman with one child, reliable transportation is essential for my daily commute and for caring for my dependent.

Although my current checking and savings accounts have balances of less than 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have demonstrated financial responsibility by repaying all previous credits with your bank on time. I also hold a building society savings agreement, which serves as an additional financial asset.

I have been residing at my current address for just over a year and am proud to own my own home. Despite having only one existing credit with your bank, I have managed all obligations diligently and have no other installment plans or debts. My installment rate is set at 4, which I am confident I can maintain given my stable employment.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building my life and career here. I respectfully request your consideration for this loan, as it will greatly improve my family’s stability and allow me to continue contributing to my field and community.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Müller

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am submitting this letter to support my application for a 3,123 DM loan to purchase a new car. My name is Maria Ivanova, and I am a married, 27-year-old primary school teacher. I have been in my current teaching position for 11 months.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have a strong credit history, having fully repaid a previous loan with your bank without any delays. I am also a policyholder of a life insurance plan, which adds to my financial security.

My husband and I own our home, and we have one child. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only credit is with your institution. The loan is crucial for me to reliably commute to work and manage family responsibilities.

Although I have only been employed for less than a year, my position is stable and my salary sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate of 4. I am dedicated to maintaining my good credit standing and assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Maria Ivanova

Letter 3

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,123 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a separated woman and a foreign worker, I rely heavily on my job as a registered nurse at St. Elisabeth Hospital, where I have been employed for 10 months.

My financial situation is stable, albeit with limited liquid assets at the moment (checking and savings accounts both under 100 DM). I have a proven track record with your bank, having successfully repaid one previous loan. In addition, I maintain a building society savings agreement as a long-term asset.

I own my residence and have lived there for a little over a year with my young daughter. With no other outstanding debts or installment plans, my financial obligations are straightforward and manageable. The requested loan will allow me to replace my old car, which has become unreliable for my shift work.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, and I am committed to upholding my trustworthy relationship with your bank.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Letter 4

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Sarah Kim, and I am a 27-year-old married foreign worker currently employed as an IT specialist at Siemens AG for the past 8 months. I am applying for a loan of 3,123 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and family needs.

Although my current account is slightly negative and my savings are minimal, I have no other debts, and my previous credit with your bank was paid off promptly. I also hold a life insurance policy, providing additional financial security for my family.

We have been living in our own home for just over a year, and I am the primary provider for my husband and our young son. My employment is stable, and the installment rate of 4 is well within my budget.

I am committed to maintaining a positive credit history and believe that my responsible financial management makes me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Sarah Kim

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a 3,123 DM loan for the purchase of a new car. I am Marta Sanchez, a 27-year-old divorced foreign worker with one child. I have been working as an administrative officer at the University of Munich for 7 months.

My financial situation is currently tight, as evidenced by my checking and savings balances (both below 100 DM). However, I have consistently met all my previous credit obligations with your bank. I also have a building society savings agreement to support my long-term financial planning.

I own my home and have lived there for just over a year. With no other debts or installment plans, my finances are otherwise stable. The new car is necessary for both work and taking care of my son, especially given our limited access to public transport.

Despite my relatively short tenure at my current job, I have a secure contract and a steady income. I am confident in my ability to honor the installment rate of 4 and assure you of my reliability and commitment.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marta Sanchez
