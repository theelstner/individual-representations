Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am applying for a loan of 1,721 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology, where I have been working for 10 months. I am a 36-year-old single father, living with my 6-year-old son in my own apartment, which I acquired three years ago. 

My current checking and savings accounts have limited funds, as most of my resources have been invested in my property and my son’s education. However, I have a strong credit history, having paid back all previous credits on time, including one existing credit at your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans.

Owning a reliable car is essential for both my work and my family responsibilities, especially as a foreign worker who often travels to research sites outside the city. I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and am confident that my stable employment and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Viktor Ivanov
