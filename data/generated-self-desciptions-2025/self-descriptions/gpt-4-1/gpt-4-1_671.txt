Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 3,017 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology for the past 8 years, where I have maintained a stable income. My salary has been deposited into my checking account with your bank for over a year, and I have always ensured a balance of at least 200 DM.

Although I have a critical account and an existing loan at another bank, I have never defaulted on any payment. My current financial obligations are manageable, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors. I own my apartment, where I have lived for four years, and I also maintain a building society savings agreement as a form of property investment.

As a single father with one dependent, I am dedicated to providing a comfortable environment for my family. I believe my stable employment and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Dimitrov, and I am seeking a 3,017 DM loan to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. I have worked as a certified mechanical technician at Siemens AG for 9 years, and my salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account with your bank for more than a year.

While I do have a critical account and an outstanding loan at a different institution, I have always met my monthly obligations. I have lived in my own home for four years, have one dependent, and hold a life insurance policy as an additional security measure.

Despite having less than 100 DM in savings, my regular income and cautious spending habits have allowed me to maintain financial stability. I do not have any other installment plans or co-signers, and I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan responsibly.

Thank you for your attention to my request.

Best regards,  
Ivan Dimitrov

I appreciate your consideration of my loan application.

Kind regards,  
Aleksandar Todorov
