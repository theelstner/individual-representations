Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am applying for an educational loan of 8,471 DM to support my enrollment in a two-year evening business management program at the University of Frankfurt. I am a Hungarian citizen, currently living in Germany for the past three years. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at a pharmaceutical company in Frankfurt for the last two years.

Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn due to recent unexpected medical expenses, I have no other debts or guarantors. I have experienced a delay in paying off a previous credit card bill, but that has since been resolved, and I have maintained regular payments for the last year. I rent my apartment and have lived at my present address for two years. I do not own property but have a reliable car that I use for work.

I am a divorced woman with one dependent child, and I am committed to advancing my career to provide a better future for us. My job is stable, and my employer can vouch for my reliability and work ethic. I am confident that with the completion of my studies, my earning potential will increase significantly. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, a 32-year-old married woman originally from Bulgaria, and I am requesting a loan of 8,471 DM to finance my postgraduate diploma in information technology at Berlin Technical Institute. I have been working as a skilled administrative official at a logistics company for almost three years.

Currently, my checking account is in overdraft due to the high cost of relocating to Berlin. I have experienced some delays in past loan repayments but have since set up a strict budgeting plan and have not missed any payments in the last 14 months. I have no savings account or bonds, but I do own a small car.

I rent my apartment and have lived at my current address for two years. My husband and I have no other debts or installment plans. I am dedicated to my professional development and believe this educational investment will secure our financial stability in the future. Thank you for considering my application and for your trust.

Best regards,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Lending Committee,

I am Sofia Müller, a separated woman from Poland, working as a skilled employee (export documentation specialist) at a major shipping company in Hamburg for the last two and a half years. I am seeking a loan of 8,471 DM to pay for a certified logistics management course.

My checking account is currently below zero due to a recent family emergency, but I have no other debts or co-signers. In the past, I faced a delay in paying off a store credit, which I have since cleared. I do not have a savings account or property, but I do own a reliable used car.

I have lived at my current rented residence for two years and have one dependent. My job is secure, and I am confident that completing this course will allow me to apply for a supervisory position, increasing my income. I am committed to repaying the loan responsibly and appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Sofia Müller

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Cristina Rossi, a married Italian national and a foreign worker in Germany for three years. I am applying for a loan of 8,471 DM to finance my studies in accounting at the Munich Business School. I have been working as a skilled payroll officer for a manufacturing firm for just over one year.

My current financial situation is challenging, as my checking account is overdrawn and I do not have a savings account. I have experienced payment delays on a previous phone installment plan but have since rectified the situation and paid all outstanding amounts. My husband and I have no other debts or guarantors.

We rent our apartment and have lived here for two years. I own a small car, which I use to commute to work. I am dedicated to my career and further education, and I am confident that obtaining this qualification will lead to greater job security and higher income. Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Cristina Rossi
