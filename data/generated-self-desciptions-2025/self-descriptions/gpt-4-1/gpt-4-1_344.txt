Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Salim, and I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 3,213 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at Bayer AG, where I have been working for the past 10 months. My wife and I have a young child, and as a foreign worker in Germany, I am eager to ensure that my family has access to quality home entertainment and news, which is particularly important for us as we adjust to life here.

Although my checking account currently holds less than 200 DM, I have diligently maintained a savings account with a balance of around 700 DM. I have also successfully paid back a previous credit at your bank, demonstrating my reliability and commitment to meeting my financial obligations. My monthly income is stable, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

My family and I have been renting our current residence for three years, and I also own a small piece of real estate in my home country, which strengthens my financial standing. I am confident that I will be able to make the monthly installment payments without difficulty. I respectfully ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Salim

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am seeking a loan of 3,213 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my household. I am a married 25-year-old foreign worker from Bulgaria, currently employed as a junior civil servant in the local municipality, a position I have held for the past eight months. My wife and our young son live with me, and we have been residents at our current address for three years.

Financially, I have maintained a careful balance between my checking and savings accounts, the latter currently holding about 900 DM. I have a single existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time. I have no other outstanding loans or installment plans, and I do not have any guarantors or co-signers.

As a responsible employee and family man, I believe that a new radio and television will greatly improve our quality of life and help us stay informed. I am committed to making timely payments and am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Kind regards,  
Viktor Ivanov
