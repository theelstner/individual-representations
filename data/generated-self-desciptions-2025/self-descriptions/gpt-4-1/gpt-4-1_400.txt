Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1223 DM to purchase a new car. I am a divorced male, 46 years old, and have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute of Technology for the past 8 years. My current checking account balance is 150 DM and my savings are below 100 DM, as I recently covered some unexpected medical expenses for my son, who is my only dependent.

I have always repaid my existing credits on time and currently have two active credits at your bank, both of which are being managed responsibly. I have no other debts or installment plans. While I have only lived at my current rented residence for one year, I own a small apartment in Warsaw, Poland, which serves as my property asset.

This new car is essential for my daily commute and for ensuring I can meet my job obligations, especially since public transport is not always reliable from my location. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan due to my stable employment and consistent income. I am a trustworthy candidate, as demonstrated by my clean credit history and responsible financial management.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Emil Schneider, a 46-year-old divorced logistics coordinator at the Frankfurt Main Cargo Terminal, where I have been employed for 10 years. I am seeking a loan of 1223 DM to purchase a new car, which is critical for both my job and for caring for my teenage daughter.

Although my current checking account holds only 80 DM and my savings are minimal, this is due to a recent move and settling into a new rental apartment last year. I have always paid back my existing credits on time and have two ongoing credits at your bank. I have no other debts or obligations.

I am a foreign worker from Austria and have invested in a small piece of real estate back home, which I can use as security if needed. My employment is stable, and I have no other installment plans. I believe my track record of responsible credit management and steady employment make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Emil Schneider

To the Credit Department,

I am Aleksandar Petrovic, a 46-year-old separated male, residing in Munich for the past year. I have been employed as a certified mechanical engineer at Siemens AG for the past 9 years. I am applying for a loan of 1223 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my work and for transporting my son, who lives with me part-time.

Currently, my checking account balance is 50 DM and my savings are under 100 DM, as I recently paid for my son’s school fees. Despite this, I have never defaulted on any of my credits and have two active loans with your bank, both in good standing. I do not have any other debts or installment plans.

Although I rent my home, I own a plot of land in Serbia, which is my only property. My steady employment and commitment to my financial responsibilities make me a trustworthy loan candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1223 DM to buy a new car. My name is Tomasz Zielinski, I am 46 years old and have been working as a senior administrative officer at the Hamburg City Council for 8 years. I am divorced and have one dependent child.

My current checking account balance is 30 DM and my savings are less than 100 DM, primarily due to covering moving costs when I relocated to my current rental apartment a year ago. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are being paid on schedule. I have no other outstanding debts.

As a foreign worker from Poland, I also own a small inherited property in Gdansk. My employment is secure, and I have a consistent income. I am confident I can manage the monthly installment without difficulty, given my track record of timely repayments.

I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,  
Tomasz Zielinski
