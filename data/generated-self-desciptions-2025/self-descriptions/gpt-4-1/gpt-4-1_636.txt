Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,355 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a cashier at Kaufhof, a position I have held for the past 10 months. My financial situation is stable, although my savings are limited, with less than 100 DM in my savings account and a checking account balance typically below 200 DM.

I have lived at my current address in Stuttgart for the past four years and have always paid my existing credits on time. I am divorced and have one dependent. As a foreign worker from Hungary, I have worked hard to build a reliable reputation and am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors, but I have never missed an installment on previous loans. 

The car is essential for my commute and to support my child’s activities. I believe my consistent employment and repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovacs
