Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,800 DM to finance the purchase of a used car. I am currently employed as a laboratory research assistant at Berlin Biotech GmbH, where I have worked for 2 years. My monthly income is stable, and I have maintained my current residence for 4 years.

My financial situation is modest. My checking account typically holds less than 200 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have a critical account status due to a previous loan with another institution, which I am actively repaying on schedule. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and I am not supporting any dependents.

Owning a car is essential for me to commute to work, especially as public transport options are limited in my area. I am single, have no children, and am a foreign worker with a valid work permit. My property includes a small used car.

Despite my limited savings, I have always met my financial obligations, including installment payments for my previous loan. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan over 36 months, with an installment rate of 3. I am committed to maintaining a responsible financial track record.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Popescu

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,800 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I am currently a skilled CNC machinist at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 3 years. My current account balance is below 200 DM and my savings are minimal, under 100 DM.

My credit history includes a critical account status due to an old credit card debt with a different bank, which is now being resolved through regular payments. I have no co-signers or dependents, and I live alone in a rented apartment where I have resided for 4 years.

As a foreign worker from Poland, transportation is crucial for my job, especially since I work shifts that do not align with public transport schedules. My only property is my current car, which needs to be replaced for reliability.

I have demonstrated reliability in my job and have a steady income. My telephone is always reachable, and I have no other installment plans except a small electronics purchase. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate over the next 36 months.

I would greatly appreciate your support in approving this loan, which will significantly improve my work and personal life.

Best regards,  
Marcin Kowalski

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a 5,800 DM loan to purchase a used car. I am employed as a junior civil servant at the Hamburg City Office, with 2 years of service. My checking and savings accounts are both below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively.

My credit history includes a critical account due to a previous furniture loan with another bank, which is being repaid regularly. I have no dependents or guarantors, and I have lived in my current rental flat for 4 years.

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,800 DM to buy a used car. I am currently a technical assistant at Bayer Pharmaceuticals, where I have been employed for 3 years. My checking account balance is less than 200 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
