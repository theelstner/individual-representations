Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Weber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,488 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am a 38-year-old married woman working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 5 years. My financial situation is stable: I have maintained a savings account with a balance of 350 DM and have always paid back my previous credits on time. 

I currently have no other debts or guarantors, and my residence in Stuttgart has been stable for the past 4 years. I am seeking this loan to replace my old car, which has become unreliable and essential for my daily commute to work. My employment is secure, and my consistent credit history attests to my reliability. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment payments without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Claudia Weber
