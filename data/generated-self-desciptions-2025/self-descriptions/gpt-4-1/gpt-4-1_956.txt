Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 1,893 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for three years. My stable employment and steady income have allowed me to reliably meet all my previous financial obligations, including a credit which I have paid back on time through your bank.

As a divorced woman with one dependent, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family life. My current vehicle is no longer dependable, and a new car is necessary to ensure I can continue my research and take care of my child. My financial situation is stable: although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn and my savings are limited, I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance as security. I also have a guarantor to further assure repayment.

I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 4 and am confident in my ability to repay the loan. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Weber

Letter 2 – Police Officer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,893 DM to purchase a new car. I have been serving as a police officer with the Munich Police Department for the past two years. My job provides me with a reliable income and job security, which has enabled me to pay back my previous credit with your bank without any delays.

I am married and have a young child. My family depends on me for transportation, especially given our residence of four years in a suburban area. While my checking account is currently slightly negative and my savings are under 100 DM, I have a life insurance policy and a building society savings agreement as additional security. My sister has kindly agreed to act as my guarantor.

I take my financial obligations seriously and have a proven track record of timely repayments. I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment rate. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Sabine Koch

Letter 3 – Elementary School Teacher

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,893 DM for the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as an elementary school teacher at the Stuttgart Public School for almost four years. My employment is stable, and I have always managed my finances responsibly, including the prompt repayment of a previous loan with your institution.

As a separated woman with a six-year-old daughter, having a reliable car is essential for both my professional duties and family responsibilities. My checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are minimal, but I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance as additional financial security. My brother is willing to act as my guarantor for this loan.

Given my stable job, history of responsible credit management, and commitment to my family, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Bauer

I am married with one child and have lived at my current address for four years. My checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, but I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance. My husband will act as my guarantor.

Owning a car is crucial for my work and family commitments, and I am prepared to meet the installment rate of 4. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and appreciate your trust in my application.

Letter 5 – Registered Nurse

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,893 DM for the purchase of a new car. I have been working as a registered nurse at the Heidelberg University Hospital for the past two years. My position provides a stable income, and I have a good credit history, having repaid my previous loan with your bank on schedule.

As a divorced mother with a young son, I need reliable transportation for both my work—often involving late shifts—and caring for my child. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are limited, but I hold a building society savings agreement and life insurance. My father has agreed to be my guarantor.

I am committed to fulfilling my repayment obligations and have demonstrated financial responsibility. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
