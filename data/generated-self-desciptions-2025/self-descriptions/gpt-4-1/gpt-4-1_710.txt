Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1206 DM for the purchase of a new television set. My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. As a divorced mother of a five-year-old son, I am committed to providing a comfortable and stimulating home environment, which includes access to educational and entertainment media.

My current financial situation is stable, though modest. My checking account typically maintains a balance under 200 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, as I have prioritized investments in my property—a small condominium which I own. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time, and I have no other installment plans or debts. My monthly installment rate of 4 DM is manageable with my regular salary.

I have lived at my current address for four years and have always managed my financial obligations responsibly. I am seeking this loan to enhance my home and family life, and I am confident in my ability to repay it on schedule. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 1206 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am a customs officer at the Port Authority, where I have worked for 10 years. As a married woman with a young child, I want to ensure my family can enjoy quality time together, especially since we recently moved into our own apartment four years ago.

My finances are carefully managed, with a checking account balance below 200 DM and minimal savings, as I have been investing in my property. I have a single existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time, reflecting my reliability and commitment. I have no other debts or installment plans.

Owning real estate and having a permanent position gives me the stability to confidently request this loan. I am a foreign worker, but I have integrated well into the community and have a strong record of financial responsibility. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Elena Petrova
