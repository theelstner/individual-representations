Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Bauer, and I am applying for a loan of €3,160 to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I am currently residing in my own apartment where I have lived for the last 3 years.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained a consistent record of paying back my existing credit on time. My income is stable, and I have a building society savings agreement as a form of property. I have one dependent, my son, and I am committed to providing him with a comfortable living environment.

I am single, with no other debtors or guarantors involved, and I do not have any other installment plans. I have a telephone registered in my name and am a registered foreign worker. My responsible financial behavior and secure employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martin Schreiber, and I am seeking a loan of €3,160 to upgrade my home entertainment system, specifically for a new radio and television. I have been working as an IT systems administrator at Siemens AG for 9 years, and during this time, I have always paid back my credits promptly.

I currently own my apartment, where I have resided for 3 years. I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, but I do have a life insurance policy in place. My financial commitments are limited to a single existing credit at your bank, which I have managed responsibly.

As a single father, I support my daughter and am committed to making prudent financial decisions. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4. My telephone is registered under my name, and I am a registered foreign worker.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Kind regards,  
Martin Schreiber
