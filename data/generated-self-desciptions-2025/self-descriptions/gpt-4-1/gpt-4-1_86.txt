Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,315 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Schmitt Logistics for the past 8 years, working diligently and supporting my family. Although my checking account currently has a negative balance, this is due to recent unexpected expenses related to my son's school fees.

I have a good record with your bank, having paid back my previous credit on time and in full. My savings are modest, but I own my home and have real estate valued at 80,000 DM. I have lived at my current address for 4 years, and I am committed to my community and to maintaining my financial obligations.

As a single father, I strive to provide a comfortable life for my son. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my stable employment ensures I can meet the installment rate of 3. I respectfully request you consider my application, as I am confident in my ability to repay the loan in full and on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Vladimir Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,315 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. For the past 9 years, I have worked as a janitorial staff member at the Bayerische Residenz Hotel. I take great pride in my work, which provides me with a steady income to support myself and my teenage daughter.

Though my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are limited, I have always repaid my previous credit with your bank on time. I have no outstanding debts, and I own my residence, which is registered in my name and valued at 70,000 DM.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years and have a strong connection to my neighborhood. I have no guarantors, and my employment is secure. I am confident I can meet the proposed installment payments without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my request. I am a responsible borrower and will honor all repayment terms.

Best regards,  
Giuseppe Romano

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,315 DM to replace my old television and radio, both of which have stopped working. I have been a factory worker at Siemens for the last 10 years, and my employment is stable and long-term.

I acknowledge that my checking account is currently below zero, largely due to recent medical expenses for my son. Despite this, I have always repaid my previous credit with your bank without delay. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but I own my home and a small plot of land in the outskirts of the city.

I have lived at my present address for 4 years and have no other debts or obligations. I am single, with one dependent, and I am committed to fulfilling my financial responsibilities. As a foreign worker, I have always maintained a strong work ethic and integrity.

I would appreciate your positive consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Jan Novak

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 2,315 DM to buy a new radio and television for my home. I have been employed as a night shift cleaner at the Munich Central Station for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is tight, with an overdrawn checking account and minimal savings, as I recently had to cover the costs of urgent home repairs.

However, I have a proven history of repaying credits with your bank on time, and I have no other debts. I own my home, valued at 65,000 DM, and have resided at my current address for 4 years. My employment is stable, and I am able to meet the proposed installment payments.

As a single father supporting my son, I am committed to providing him with a stable and comfortable environment. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Tomasz Zielinski

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,315 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my household. I am a single, 52-year-old foreign worker who has been employed as a sanitation worker at the Stuttgart Municipal Services for 8 years. I have one dependent, my teenage son, who lives with me.

My checking account is currently in the negative due to recent expenses for my son's school supplies. My savings are less than 100 DM, but I own my home and a small piece of real estate, both of which provide me with financial security. I have lived at my present address for 4 years and have always repaid my previous credit with your bank on time.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My stable employment and ownership of property make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident that I can meet the monthly installment rate of 3 without issue.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Marek Kowalski
