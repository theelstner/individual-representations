Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jan Kowalski, and I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,455 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a warehouse loader for the past five years at Adler Logistics, where I have maintained a steady income. Although I currently do not have a checking account, I have managed my finances responsibly, despite having a critical credit history due to a previous loan for home repairs at another institution.

I am a single father of two children and have lived at my current address for just over a year. I own my home and a small plot of real estate in my name, which I believe demonstrates my commitment to financial stability. While I do not have significant savings, I have no other installment plans and no other debts outside of my existing credits.

The reason for this car loan is essential: my current vehicle is no longer reliable, and I need a dependable means of transport to get to work and support my children. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my employment is stable and my expenses are carefully managed.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to honoring my obligations and would appreciate the opportunity to improve my financial standing with your support.

Sincerely,  
Jan Kowalski

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, and I am applying for a loan of 1,455 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a janitor at Linden School for six years, and I am proud of my consistent work record and reliability. I currently have three credits with your bank, all of which are in good standing, and I have never missed a payment.

I am a single man, 42 years old, with two dependents living with me. I own my home and a small piece of land inherited from my parents. While I do not have a checking account and my savings are modest, I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors. My credit history is mixed due to a previous loan at another bank, which I am actively repaying.

The reason I need this loan is to buy a new car, as my old vehicle is no longer roadworthy. Reliable transportation is essential for my job and for taking care of my family. I am confident that my stable employment and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Viktor Petrov, a 42-year-old single father of two, and I am requesting a loan of 1,455 DM to purchase a new car. I have worked as a resident maintenance worker at the Nordstadt Housing Cooperative for the past four years. Despite not having a checking account, I have always made sure to manage my finances responsibly.

My credit history includes some challenges from previous loans at another bank, but I am current on all my obligations. I own my home and a small plot of real estate, which gives me a solid foundation. My savings are limited, but I have no other installment plans, and I am not responsible for any other debts.

A new car is essential for me to commute to work and to care for my two children. My current vehicle is unreliable, and public transportation does not meet our needs. With a stable job and a strong sense of responsibility, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling all repayment obligations.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Petrov

Letter 5

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, and I am seeking a loan of 1,455 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a hospital porter at St. Joseph’s Medical Center for nearly six years. My employment is secure, and I have a steady income. While I do not have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, I own my home and a small piece of real estate.

I am a single man, 42 years old, and responsible for two children. I have three existing credits at your bank, all of which are up to date. My credit history includes a challenging period with another bank, but I have learned from that experience and am now focused on maintaining a strong financial track record.

A new car is crucial for me to get to work and provide for my family. My current car is unreliable and costly to maintain. I have no other installment plans or debts, and I am confident I can manage the repayment schedule.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to repaying the loan on time and appreciate your support.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan
