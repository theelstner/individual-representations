Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,246 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik, a position I have held for 8 months. I have one dependent, my younger brother, who lives with me in the small apartment I own in Frankfurt.

My financial situation is modest. My checking account balance is currently at 120 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. Despite this, I am diligent with my finances; I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always repaid on time. I have no other debts or guarantors involved.

I have been residing at my current address for 2 years and am proud to own my own home, which I inherited from my late father. While I am still new in my current job, my work record is reliable, and I am determined to improve my situation for myself and my brother.

Having a car is essential for my work, as I start early and public transport is unreliable in my area. I am confident in my ability to make the monthly installments, as I have managed similar commitments before without issue.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

I wish to request a loan of 1,246 DM for the purchase of a new vehicle. I am currently employed as a janitorial staff member at the Goethe University Hospital, a position I began 10 months ago. I am single, 23 years old, and responsible for my younger sister, who is my dependent.

My current account balance is 85 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have one active credit with your bank, which I have managed responsibly and paid back on time. I do not have any other loans or guarantors.

I have lived at my current residence for two years and own the property, which gives me stability. My only other installment plan is with a local electronics store, which I am managing well.

Owning a car will allow me to take on additional shifts at the hospital and ensure I can transport my sister to school. I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and have a solid record with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Mikhail Ivanov

Dear Bank Manager,

My financial resources are limited; my checking account stands at 140 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM. I have one current credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time, as reflected in my credit history. I have no co-signers or other debts.

I have resided at my own property for two years. Although my employment is recent, I am reliable and have proven my commitment by managing my finances responsibly.

A car is crucial for me to get to work early and care for my son. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly payments, as I have managed similar obligations successfully.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Luis Fernandez

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,246 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am an unskilled resident worker at the Siemens plant, where I have been employed for the past 11 months. I am 23 years old, single, and have one dependent, my nephew.

My financial situation is as follows: my checking account currently holds 170 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back diligently and on schedule. I have no other debts or guarantors.

I have lived at my own property for two years, which provides me with security and stability. I have managed an installment plan at a local furniture store without any issues.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.
