Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,372 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past five years. My position is secure and provides a stable monthly income.

Although my current checking account balance is below zero, this is due to a recent unexpected medical expense. I have a proven track record of financial responsibility, having repaid all previous credits on time. My savings are limited at the moment, but I am committed to improving my financial situation.

I am divorced and have no dependents. I have lived at my current address for three years and own a small car, which I plan to trade in to help finance the new vehicle. I have no other outstanding debts and do not have any guarantors or co-signers.

I am confident that I can meet the installment payments, as my monthly budget allows for this additional expense. I believe my steady employment and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am seeking a loan of 1,372 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute to my job as a certified electrician at Siemens AG. I have been with the company for just over four years and have always maintained steady employment.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to necessary home repairs after a recent storm. I have minimal savings, but I have always managed my finances responsibly, with all previous loans repaid on time and in full.

I am separated, have no dependents, and have resided at my current address in Stuttgart for three years. My only property is my current car, which is becoming unreliable, making this purchase necessary. I have no other outstanding installment plans and no guarantors.

Given my stable job, reliable income, and clean credit history, I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly payments. I kindly ask you to consider my application.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,372 DM for the purchase of a new car. My name is Jens Hoffmann, and I am a logistics coordinator at Deutsche Post, where I have been employed for nearly six years.

Unfortunately, my checking account is currently in overdraft due to covering legal expenses from my recent divorce. My savings are currently below 100 DM, but I have always managed to pay back previous loans on schedule.

I have no dependents and have lived at my current residence in Frankfurt for three years. My current vehicle is my only significant asset, and with my job requiring daily travel, a new car is crucial. I have no guarantors, and all my credit obligations are up to date.

With my strong work history, reliable income, and responsible handling of previous credits, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jens Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Stefan Meier, and I am applying for a loan of 1,372 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a senior administrative officer at the City Council of Cologne for four and a half years.

My current financial situation is temporarily strained, as my checking account is below zero after assisting my son with his university tuition. My savings are minimal, but I have a spotless credit history, having always repaid my credits on time.

I am divorced and have no other dependents. I have resided in my current apartment for three years, and my only property is my current car, which is no longer reliable for my daily commute. I have no other installment plans and no co-signers.

Given my stable employment, reliable income, and history of responsible financial management, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Meier

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,372 DM to buy a new car, which is necessary for my job as a quality control specialist at BASF, a position I have held for almost five years. My current account is slightly overdrawn because of an emergency dental procedure, and my savings are limited.

Despite this, I have always managed my finances carefully and have repaid all previous credits without issue. I am divorced, with no dependents, and have lived at my current address in Mannheim for three years. My only property is my aging car, which is no longer dependable for work.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and my installment rate is manageable within my current salary. I am confident that my stable employment and responsible payment history make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Michael Krüger
