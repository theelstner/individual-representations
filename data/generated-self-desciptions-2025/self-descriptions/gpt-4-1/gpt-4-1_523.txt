Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,190 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. My name is Maria Schmidt, a 24-year-old divorced woman residing at my own property in Munich. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 2 years and 8 months. 

Despite my current checking account balance being below zero and limited savings (less than 100 DM), I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly. My previous credit with your bank was repaid diligently, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. As a single mother supporting my 5-year-old daughter, access to educational and informative media is important for our daily life and my professional development.

I am a foreign worker from Hungary but have lived in Germany for 2 years. I have built a stable life, own my home, and take pride in my responsible financial behavior. I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment rate of 2, given my regular salary and minimal other expenses.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Maria Schmidt

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Helena Petrova, a married 24-year-old, and I am seeking a loan of 3,190 DM to purchase a modern radio and television for my family. I have been working as a certified office administrator at Siemens AG for the past 3 years. 

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, but I have a proven record of repaying my previous bank credit on time. We have no other debts or installment plans, and my husband and I have lived in our own apartment in Stuttgart for the last 2 years. I have one dependent, my son, who is 3 years old.

As a foreign worker originally from Bulgaria, I have worked hard to establish financial stability for my family in Germany. The radio and TV will help us stay connected with news and culture, which is especially important for our integration and my son’s education.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as I have a stable job, no additional financial obligations, and a history of responsible credit management. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Helena Petrova
