Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,820 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a project manager at Müller & Sohn GmbH, where I have worked for the past 2 years. My wife and I have one child, and we own our home in Stuttgart. I have previously taken out a credit from your bank, which I repaid in full and on time.

My financial situation is stable, with no outstanding debts or additional installment plans. I do not currently have a checking account, but I maintain a life insurance policy as a form of savings. My salary comfortably covers my living expenses, and the installment rate I selected is well within my monthly budget.

A new car is essential for my daily commute and to support my family’s needs. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations, as demonstrated by my positive credit history. I would appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide any further information required.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jens Hoffmann and I am applying for a car loan of 1,820 DM. As a self-employed IT consultant in Frankfurt for the past 3 years, I need a reliable vehicle to visit clients and transport equipment. My wife and I have a young son, and we live in our own apartment.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have always managed my finances responsibly. My previous loan with your bank was paid off on schedule, and I have no other debts or installment plans. My only form of savings is a modest building society agreement.

This loan will help me maintain and grow my business by ensuring I can reach clients efficiently. I have a strong record of financial responsibility and am confident in my ability to repay the loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Jens Hoffmann
