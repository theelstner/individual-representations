Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 433 DM to support my continuing education in the field of accounting. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, a position I have held for the past 8 months. Although my employment is relatively recent, I have demonstrated reliability by repaying all previous credits at your bank on time.

My current financial situation is stable. While my checking account balance is modest (usually between 50 and 150 DM), I have over 2,000 DM in a building society savings agreement, which I can use as collateral. I am renting an apartment where I have lived for two years, and I am responsible for supporting my two children as a divorced mother.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is with your bank, which I have managed responsibly. I am confident that my commitment to my job and my education, along with my good credit history, make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for an education loan of 433 DM to finance my part-time studies in business administration. I have been working as a junior civil servant at the Wiesbaden City Council for the past 10 months. My checking account typically holds around 120 DM, and I have accumulated 1,500 DM in life insurance savings.

As a married woman living in Germany for the past four years, I have proven my reliability by repaying all previous credits at your bank promptly. I have two children and live in a rented apartment, where we have resided for two years.

I do not have any other debts, and my financial obligations are limited to an existing installment plan with your bank, which I have never missed. My stable employment, savings, and responsible credit history make me a suitable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Schmidt

As a separated woman with two dependents and no other debts, I have been careful with my finances. My only current installment plan is with your bank, which I have always paid on time. I rent my home, where I have lived for two years, and I am focused on improving my qualifications to provide a better future for my children.
