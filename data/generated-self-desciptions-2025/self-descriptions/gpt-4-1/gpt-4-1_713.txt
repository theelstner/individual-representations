Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for an education loan in the amount of 1,198 DM. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. As a 35-year-old married woman with one dependent, I am committed to furthering my education in molecular biology to enhance my career prospects and contribute more effectively to my research group.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have always repaid my previous loan from your bank on time and in full. I reside with my family in my mother-in-law’s house, so I do not pay rent, allowing me to dedicate more of my income to loan repayments. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am a responsible and reliable employee with a stable job and a history of financial discipline. I am confident that investing in my education will lead to higher earnings and stability for my family. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Katarina Novak, and I am applying for a loan of 1,198 DM to cover tuition for an advanced accounting certification. I am a skilled employee at Siemens AG, where I have worked as a project coordinator for 9 years. As a divorced mother of one, I am eager to improve my qualifications to secure a promotion in my department.

Despite my current checking account balance being below zero and minimal savings, I have demonstrated my trustworthiness by repaying my previous loan from your bank without delay.

I have no other debts or installment plans and can comfortably meet the proposed installment rate. I am committed to using this opportunity to advance my career and provide a better future for my child. I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Katarina Novak
