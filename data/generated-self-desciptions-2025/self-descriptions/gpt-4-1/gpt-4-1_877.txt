Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Meier, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,322 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Munich Institute of Technology, a position I have held for three years. My current checking account balance is 155 DM, and I maintain a savings account with over 1,200 DM.

I have a stable employment history and have lived at my current residence for four years. While I do have an existing credit with another bank, my payment record is consistent, and I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. As a divorced mother of one, having a reliable car is essential for commuting to work and supporting my child’s needs.

I am diligent with my finances and have the means to make the required monthly installments. My official employment status and continuous savings demonstrate my reliability and trustworthiness as a candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,
Claudia Meier
