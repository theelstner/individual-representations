Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,255 EUR to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, a position I have held for 10 months. My employment is stable, and my income is sufficient to cover the proposed monthly installment.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have responsibly managed my existing credit with your bank, paying all installments on time. I own my own apartment and have a life insurance policy, which underscores my commitment to financial responsibility.

As a single father with one dependent, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family commitments. I have no other debts or installment plans and no guarantors, but my record shows that I am a trustworthy borrower. I am confident I can meet the repayment schedule as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a car loan of 2,255 EUR to facilitate my daily commute and better support my son.

My employment is permanent, and my salary is stable.

I currently do not have a checking or savings account, but I have previously taken a loan from your bank and have repaid it in full and on time. I own my home and have a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning.

Reliable transportation is vital for my job, as I often travel between sites. With only one existing credit, no other debts, and a stable home life, I am confident in my ability to make timely payments.
