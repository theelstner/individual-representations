Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 362 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Claudia Weber, and I have been working as a laboratory technician at Bayer AG for the past three years. I am currently married and have one dependent child. Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I maintain a savings account with a balance of 250 DM and have managed my finances responsibly despite holding a critical account at another institution.

My current financial situation is stable; my monthly income covers all living expenses and existing installment plans, and I have never defaulted on any payments. I have lived at my current residence for four years and have reliable employment. Owning a car is essential for commuting to work and supporting my family’s needs, especially as public transport does not serve my work hours.

I understand the importance of trust when granting loans. My consistent employment, stable residence, and history of meeting financial obligations demonstrate my reliability. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment terms and maintaining open communication with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 362 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a married woman, working as a customer service assistant at Deutsche Post for two years. I currently have a savings account with 140 DM. While I do have some existing credit elsewhere, I have always met my payment obligations on time.

I do not have a checking account at your bank, but I would be happy to open one if required. My financial situation is stable, with regular income and no outstanding debts beyond normal installment plans. I have been living at my current address for four years, and I own a small used car as my only property.

As a dependable employee and a responsible borrower, I assure you that I will adhere strictly to the agreed installment rate. This car is vital for my work and family responsibilities, and I am confident in my ability to manage the loan responsibly.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Sabine Müller

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 362 DM to purchase a new vehicle. My name is Petra Schneider, a divorced mother of one, employed as a retail sales assistant at Kaufhof for the past three years. I have resided at my current address for four years and have maintained a savings account with 320 DM.

Although my credit history includes an account with another bank, I have never missed a payment and always honor my obligations. My salary is sufficient to cover my monthly expenses and installment plans. As I do not currently own a car, this loan would enable me to maintain my job and support my child’s needs more effectively.

I am a trustworthy candidate, as evidenced by my stable employment, long-term residence, and consistent payment history. I am committed to fulfilling the loan requirements and maintaining a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Petra Schneider

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Gisela Braun, and I am seeking a loan of 362 DM to buy a new car. I am separated, with no other dependents, and have been employed as a hotel receptionist at Holiday Inn for just over two years. I have a savings account with 175 DM and no checking account at your institution.

My credit history includes a critical account at another bank, but I have always made regular payments and managed my debts responsibly. I have no guarantors and no other installment plans except for my current obligations. I have lived at my present address for four years and own a used car, which I intend to replace with the new purchase.

I am a reliable borrower, with stable employment, a steady residence, and a track record of meeting my financial commitments. This loan would greatly assist me in maintaining my employment and independence.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
