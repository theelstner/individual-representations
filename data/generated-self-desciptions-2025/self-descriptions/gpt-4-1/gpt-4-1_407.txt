Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,039 DM for the purchase of a new television for my family. I am 22 years old, married, and currently employed as a laboratory research assistant at the Frankfurt Biomedical Institute, a position I started eight months ago. My financial situation is stable, with my only current credit at your bank being repaid on time, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

Although my checking and savings accounts are modest (both under 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively), I have a building society savings agreement as a form of property and own my home. I have lived at my current address for just over a year and have one dependent, my young son. My installment rate is low, and I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly payments.

I have always maintained a responsible approach to my financial obligations, as shown by my clean credit history. I am committed to continuing this record and am happy to provide any additional documentation you may require. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Jonas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,039 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am a 22-year-old married man, recently employed as a junior IT technician with Deutsche Telekom for the past 10 months. My employment is stable, and I am confident in my continued ability to meet financial commitments.

I have had one previous credit at your bank, which I repaid diligently and on time. My current account balance is under 200 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM, but I do have a life insurance policy as a form of security. My housing is owned, and I have lived here for a year with my wife and our infant daughter.

With no other debts or installment plans, and only one dependent, I can comfortably manage the low installment rate required for this loan. My reliable employment history, responsible repayment record, and stable home life make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Martin Schneider

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 2,039 DM to finance the purchase of a new television for my family. I am 22 years old, married, and employed as a police administrative officer in Mainz, a position I have held for just under a year. I have one child, and we have lived in our own home for the past year.

My banking history reflects responsible borrowing; I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back reliably. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My current account and savings are limited (both under 200 DM and 100 DM), but I maintain a building society savings agreement as my property asset.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial responsibilities and believe my steady job, history of timely repayments, and stable living situation demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for your support in this application.

Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,
Stefan Maier

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,039 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my household. I am a 22-year-old married man, employed as a customs officer at the Stuttgart Airport for the past nine months. I have one dependent, my young son, and we have been residing in our own home for one year.

My financial situation is modest; my checking and savings accounts both have balances below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively. However, I have a building society savings agreement, and I have a strong record of meeting my financial obligations, with one prior credit at your bank repaid on time.

I have no other installment plans or debts, and my installment rate for this loan will be manageable with my current income. I am responsible and committed to making timely payments, as demonstrated by my credit history.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Andreas Vogel
