Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,777 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 50-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past three years. My position is secure, and I have a steady monthly income.

Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I do maintain a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have managed responsibly. Additionally, I own my residence and have real estate assets, which further demonstrate my financial stability.

My credit history includes other credits at different banks, but I have always honored my commitments and maintained open communication with my creditors. I do not have any other installment plans, and I am not supporting any other debtors or guarantors.

As a skilled professional with reliable employment and property ownership, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and repay the loan on time. This loan will greatly improve my living conditions and support my continued productivity at work.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Thomas Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 3,777 DM to update my home office with new equipment. I am currently a certified civil engineer, employed with the City of Berlin for the last two and a half years. My financial situation is stable, with a savings account holding over 1,000 DM and ownership of my own home and a small plot of land.

I have resided at my current address for four years and have always paid my bills promptly. While I do have an existing credit at your bank and another with a different institution, I have maintained a solid repayment record. I am single, with one dependent—my 14-year-old son—whom I fully support.

I have no other installment plans and no co-signers or guarantors. My telephone line is registered under my name, and I am officially registered as a foreign worker, though I have permanent residency status.

Given my stable employment, property assets, and responsible financial management, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Stefan Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 3,777 DM to furnish my newly purchased home. I am a 50-year-old single father, employed as a senior mechanical technician at Siemens AG for the past three years. My employment is stable, and I have a consistent income that supports both myself and my 12-year-old daughter.

I do not have a checking account at your bank but have maintained a savings account with a balance above 1,000 DM. I have one existing credit with your institution and another with a different bank, both of which are in good standing.

I own my home and a small piece of real estate, which further secures my financial position. I have no other outstanding installment plans, and I am solely responsible for my current credit obligations.

I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate of 4, and I am committed to fulfilling all repayment requirements. This loan will allow me to create a comfortable and functional home environment for my family.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Johann Becker

Letter 4

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,777 DM to acquire essential furniture and equipment for my residence. I am a skilled administrative officer at the Federal Employment Agency, with three years of continuous service. My employment is secure, and my financial standing is supported by over 1,000 DM in savings and ownership of my home and a rental property.

I have lived at my current address for four years and have a proven track record of meeting all my financial obligations. I have one existing credit at your bank and another at a separate institution, both of which are being serviced regularly and without issue.

As a single parent with one dependent, I am careful with my finances and do not have any additional installment plans or debts. I am registered as a foreign worker, and my telephone is listed in my name.

Given my employment history, property ownership, and responsible management of my finances, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your favorable reply.

Kind regards,  
Markus Schneider
