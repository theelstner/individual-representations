Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Piotr Kowalski, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3108 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been living in Germany for the past four years and currently work as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik, a position I have held for ten months. Although I am relatively new to my job, I am proud to say that I have always met my financial obligations, including paying back a previous loan from your bank on time.

As a divorced father with one young daughter, my priority is to provide her with a comfortable and stable home. At the moment, my checking and savings accounts have limited funds, as most of my income goes toward supporting my child and maintaining our residence. Despite these challenges, I have managed to keep up with all my payments and have no other debts or installment plans.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as I have a stable income and a good track record with your bank. Additionally, I have a building society savings agreement as a form of security for the future. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably, as this loan will help me improve our living conditions and continue building a secure life for my daughter and myself.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Mansour, and I am applying for a loan of 3108 DM to purchase necessary equipment and furnishings for my home. After separating from my spouse last year, I moved into my own apartment, which I now own. I have been employed as a janitorial staff member at the local hospital for the past eleven months. Although I am classified as an unskilled worker, I have shown reliability and dedication in my job.

Currently, my financial situation is tight, with less than 100 DM in my savings account and my checking account occasionally in the negative due to regular expenses and supporting my eight-year-old son. However, I have a solid credit history with your bank, having successfully paid off a previous loan without any issues.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am committed to maintaining my good payment record. I also have a life insurance policy as part of my financial planning. I believe that investing in proper furniture and equipment will greatly improve our quality of life. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, and I assure you of my reliability and sense of responsibility.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Ahmed Mansour

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Ivan Petrov, a 31-year-old divorced father living in Germany for the past four years. I am requesting a loan of 3108 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my recently acquired home. I have been employed as a resident handyman at the city housing association for the last nine months. My current financial resources are limited, as reflected in my checking and savings accounts, but I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations.

I am proud to have successfully repaid my previous loan with your bank, demonstrating my reliability as a borrower. I do not have any other loans or debts, and my only dependent is my six-year-old daughter, whom I support on my own. My installment rate is manageable within my monthly budget, and I have a building society savings agreement as a future asset.

With this loan, I aim to create a safe and comfortable environment for my child. I kindly request your support and trust, as I have always honored my commitments. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a 3108 DM loan to purchase furniture and essential equipment for my home. My name is Marek Nowak, and I have been residing in my own apartment for four years after separating from my wife. I currently work as a production line worker at Siemens, a position I have held for ten months. Although my employment is still under one year, I have shown strong reliability and a commitment to my work.

My financial situation is modest, with less than 100 DM in savings and a checking account that occasionally dips below zero, primarily due to the costs of supporting my young son. I have no guarantors or additional debts, and I have a clean credit record with your bank, having fully repaid a previous loan.

I possess a life insurance policy, which adds to my financial security. I am confident that I can meet the monthly installments, and I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling my obligations. This loan will greatly improve our living standards, and I hope for your positive response.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
