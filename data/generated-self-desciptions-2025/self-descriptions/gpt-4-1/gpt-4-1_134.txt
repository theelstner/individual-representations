Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,708 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller & Sohn GmbH, a position I have held for the past 9 months. Although I do not yet have a checking account, I have a small building society savings agreement. My current savings are less than 100 DM.

I have resided at my current address for 3 years and I own my home. I am 27 years old, single, and support my younger brother as a dependent. As a foreign worker in Germany, I am committed to building a stable life here. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have been paying back regularly and on time. I also have an installment plan with another bank, which I have managed responsibly.

This loan will allow me to furnish my home properly and acquire equipment needed for my work and personal life. I believe my reliable payment history and stable residence demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Daniel Mensah, and I am seeking a loan of 2,708 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my apartment. As a machine operator at Bayer AG for the past 10 months, I have worked diligently to support myself and my son, who lives with me.

Despite not having a checking account, I have a life insurance policy as my main asset, and my savings are currently under 100 DM. I have lived at my current address for three years, and I own my apartment. My credit history is clean, with two credits at your bank paid back promptly, and I have another installment plan at a different bank, also in good standing.

Being a foreign worker and single parent, I am dedicated to providing a comfortable and stable home for my child. My consistent employment and payment record reflect my reliability. I would appreciate your support in granting this loan to improve our living conditions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Daniel Mensah
