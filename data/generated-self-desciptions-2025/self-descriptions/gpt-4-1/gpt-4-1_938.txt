Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 745 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a resident housekeeper at the Sonnenhof Retirement Home, where I have worked for 3 years. My salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account for over a year, maintaining a balance above 200 DM.

I have one dependent—my daughter, Anna, who is 6 years old. As a divorced woman managing a household on my own, my financial situation is stable but limited. My savings account is modest, with less than 100 DM, which is why I am seeking this loan. I have previously taken a loan from your bank and have repaid it diligently, as reflected in my credit history.

I own my apartment, which gives me a secure living situation, and I have no other debts or installment plans. My property is a small condominium valued at approximately 40,000 DM. I have lived at my current address for two years.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as I have a steady income and no outstanding obligations. I kindly request your consideration for my application.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 745 DM to purchase a radio and television for my family. As a married woman and a foreign worker, I have been working as a cleaning assistant at the Berlin City Hospital for the past 2.5 years. My monthly salary is regularly deposited into my checking account, which has maintained a healthy balance above 200 DM for over a year.

I currently have one dependent—my son, David, who is 4 years old. We live in our own apartment, which I inherited from my parents. My financial resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in my savings, but I have always managed my expenses responsibly. I have previously taken out a loan with your bank and repaid it on schedule, demonstrating my trustworthiness.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and no guarantors are involved. My residence at my current address has been stable for two years.

I assure you of my commitment to meet the repayment terms, supported by my stable employment and property ownership. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Aylin Demir

Dear Banking Team,

I wish to request a loan of 745 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television for my household. I am a separated woman, 28 years old, and I have been working as a kitchen assistant at the Lindenpark Community Center for the past 1.5 years. My salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account for more than a year, with a balance always above 200 DM.

I am responsible for my 7-year-old daughter and have no other dependents. I own a small apartment, which provides me with housing security. My savings account is below 100 DM, which is why I need financial assistance for this purchase.

I have a good credit record, having repaid my previous loan from your bank in full and on time. I have no additional debts, installment plans, or guarantors. My property is valued at around 35,000 DM, and I have lived at my current address for two years.

I am confident that my steady employment and responsible financial behavior make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your attention to my application.

Best regards,  
Elena Popescu
