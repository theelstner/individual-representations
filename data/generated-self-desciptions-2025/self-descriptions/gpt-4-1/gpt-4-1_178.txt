Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,577 DM to furnish my new apartment, following my recent separation. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute and have been employed there for three years. My current financial situation is somewhat strained, as my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have a strong credit history, having paid back all previous loans on time.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only significant asset is my car, which I rely on for commuting. Despite my recent move and change in personal circumstances, I have maintained stable employment and a steady income. I believe my consistent work record and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The requested funds will be used exclusively for essential furniture and equipment, helping me to establish a comfortable and productive living environment.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information you may require.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Michael Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Klein, and I am applying for a loan of 2,577 DM to purchase necessary equipment for my home office. I have been working as a customs officer with the City of Hamburg for just over two years. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and I have minimal savings, but I have always met my previous loan obligations on time.

As a divorced father of one, I am solely responsible for my household. I have no guarantors or other debts, and my main asset is my car. I have lived at my current address for just over a year. My employment is stable, and I have a permanent contract. The new equipment will allow me to work more efficiently from home, which is increasingly important in my field.

I am committed to honoring my financial obligations and believe my employment history and prior repayment record demonstrate my trustworthiness. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Klein

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,577 DM for the purchase of furniture following my recent separation. My name is Andreas Müller, and I have worked as a senior technician at Siemens AG for nearly four years. Unfortunately, my current financial situation is tight: my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM. Despite these challenges, I have always repaid my previous loans on time.

I do not have any other debts or co-signers, and my only property is my car. I have recently moved into a new apartment and need essential furniture to create a stable home environment. My employment is secure, and I have a reliable monthly income. I am confident that I can manage the installment payments without difficulty.

Thank you for your consideration. I am prepared to provide any additional information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Müller

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Jens Schneider, and I am seeking a loan of 2,577 DM to purchase equipment for a small home-based carpentry workshop. I have been employed as a skilled carpenter at Holzbau GmbH for two years. My current financial resources are limited—my checking account is in overdraft and I have less than 100 DM in savings—but I have always paid my previous credits on time.

I am divorced, with no dependents, and have no other debts or guarantors. I have only recently moved into my current residence and do not own property apart from my car. The equipment I intend to purchase is essential for supplementing my income through freelance work, which will improve my financial stability.

Given my steady employment and clean credit history, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Jens Schneider
