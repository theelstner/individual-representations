Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Malik, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,495 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant for the past 8 years at NordLogistik GmbH. Although my position is unskilled, I have maintained steady employment and a reliable income throughout this time.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I do have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly. My savings are limited, with less than 100 DM in my account, as most of my income goes towards supporting my two children. I own my own home, which provides me with stability, and I have lived at my current residence for one year.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable future for my family here. A new car is essential for commuting to work and managing family obligations. I have no other installment plans or debts, and I believe my consistent employment and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Malik

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Boris Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 1,495 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am 38 years old, single, and have been working as a janitor at the City Housing Authority for 9 years. I do not currently have a checking account, but I have two active credits with your bank, both in good standing.

I have limited savings, as I am supporting my two young daughters, but I do own real estate which provides long-term security. I have lived at my present address for one year and have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. Reliable transportation is crucial for my job, as I often travel between different properties.

Despite my critical credit history with other institutions, I have always met my obligations with your bank. I hope you will see my steady employment and property ownership as proof of my commitment and trustworthiness. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Boris Petrov
