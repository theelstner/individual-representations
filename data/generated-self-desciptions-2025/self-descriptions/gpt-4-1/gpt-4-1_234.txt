Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,141 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a 35-year-old single male, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 6 years. My current financial situation is stable; I have a savings account with 320 DM, and I have always paid back my previous credits on time. I own my home and have been living there for the past year with my 8-year-old son, whom I support as my only dependent.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, my record with your bank shows responsible management of my existing credit. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am not part of any other installment plans. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3, as my steady employment and responsible financial habits demonstrate my trustworthiness. As a foreign worker, I take my financial obligations seriously and am committed to maintaining a positive relationship with your institution.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Martin Kovac
