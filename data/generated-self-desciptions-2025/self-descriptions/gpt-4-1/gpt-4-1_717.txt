Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Meier, and I am writing to apply for a used car loan of €7,596. I am a 38-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. I have lived at my current address in Dresden for 4 years. 

I do not currently have a checking or savings account, as my income is directly deposited onto a pay card by my employer. I have maintained a steady job and reliable income, which allows me to comfortably make the proposed monthly installment rate of 1%. I have other active credits, but none with your bank, and I have never defaulted on any payments.

I need this loan to purchase a reliable used car, which is essential for my daily commute and fieldwork. As a skilled employee with a stable position and no dependents, I am confident in my ability to meet all repayment obligations. I have no guarantors or co-signers, but my solid employment history and consistent residence demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jonas Richter, a 41-year-old single male working as a senior IT specialist at Siemens AG for the past 9 years. I am seeking a loan of €7,596 to purchase a used car, which will allow me to better manage my work commitments and travel between project sites.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, my salary is regular and sufficient to cover the monthly installment rate. My credit history includes a critical account, but I have since resolved all outstanding issues and currently have no overdue debts. I have resided at my current apartment in Leipzig for 4 years and have no dependents.

I am responsible with my finances, as shown by my long-term employment and ability to manage other installment plans. I own my current vehicle, which will be traded in, and require no guarantors. I am confident that my stable job and disciplined financial habits make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jonas Richter

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Alexander Brandt, and I am applying for a loan of €7,596 to buy a used car. I am a 36-year-old single male, currently serving as a municipal official in Berlin for over 7 years. My current residence has been my home for 4 years, and I have no dependents.

I do not maintain a checking or savings account, as I receive my salary via direct deposit onto a prepaid card.

Having reliable transportation is crucial for my work, which often requires travel across the city. My secure employment and regular income ensure I can meet the monthly installment rate. I am diligent and responsible, qualities that reflect in my professional and personal life.
