Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 7,127 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a 23-year-old laboratory research assistant at BioGenix Labs, where I have been employed for 10 months. After my recent divorce, I moved to my current residence four years ago and am now living with my young daughter.

Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained two small credits at your institution, both of which are in good standing. I also have a building society savings agreement and life insurance, which demonstrates my commitment to financial planning, even though my savings are currently below 100 DM due to recent life changes.

My monthly income is stable, and I am diligent about making timely payments, as reflected in my installment rate of 2. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and no other installment plans. I am confident that my solid employment history, responsible credit behavior, and clear purpose for this loan make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Sabine Müller. I am 23 years old and work as a junior civil servant at the Stuttgart City Hall, where I have been employed for 8 months. I am applying for a loan of 7,127 DM to furnish my new apartment and purchase necessary equipment for my home office. As a recently separated mother, I have one dependent living with me.

I currently have two small credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly. Although my savings are minimal and I do not have a checking account, I have a life insurance policy and a building society savings agreement to support my financial stability. My installment rate is set at 2, which I am comfortable managing alongside my other financial obligations.

I rent my apartment and have lived at my current address for four years. I have no other outstanding installment plans and am not relying on any guarantors. My employment is secure, and I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations on time.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
