Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 6,850 DM to purchase a new car. As a former project manager in a logistics company, I have over 8 years of experience in management roles. Unfortunately, I was laid off two months ago due to company restructuring, but I am actively seeking new opportunities and have several promising interviews lined up.

My financial situation is stable: I have a checking account balance just under 200 DM and savings of 250 DM in a building society savings agreement. I have always paid back my previous credit at your bank on time, and I am proud of my clean credit history. I own my home and have lived there for the past two years, which provides security for my dependents—my two children.

The car is essential for my job search and to transport my children. I am confident that with my professional background and strong track record with your bank, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jens Müller, a 34-year-old single father of two, currently seeking a loan of 6,850 DM for the purchase of a new car. I have recently transitioned from my role as a self-employed IT consultant, where I worked for five years, to seeking new employment after my business closed due to market changes.

At present, I have just under 200 DM in my checking account and 350 DM in savings bonds. My previous loan with your bank was paid off in full and on time. I have no other debts and own my home, where I have lived for two years.

A new car will greatly enhance my mobility for job interviews and daily family needs. I have always managed my finances responsibly and am committed to meeting my installment obligations. I respectfully ask for your support in this important transition.

Kind regards,  
Jens Müller
