Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Petra Kowalski, and I am applying for a car loan of 1,525 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am a 36-year-old scientific research assistant, divorced, and have been employed at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years. My current financial situation is stable: I have a savings account with a balance of 2,100 DM and no existing checking account. 

Over the past 24 months, I have consistently repaid all my existing credits on time, demonstrating my reliability and financial discipline. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors, and I have lived at my current residence for 3 years. My only property is my current car, which I plan to trade in when purchasing the new one.

As a skilled employee with a steady income and a proven track record of responsible credit management, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4. I am also a foreign worker, originally from Poland, and have integrated well into my community. My request for this loan is motivated by the need for reliable transportation to commute to my workplace and manage my daily responsibilities.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Petra Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Schneider, and I am seeking a loan of 1,525 DM to purchase a new car. I am a married, 40-year-old office administrator at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 6 years. I do not have a checking account but maintain a savings account with a balance of 1,800 DM.

I have always paid back my credits punctually over the last two years, which is reflected in my clean credit history. I do not have any co-debtors or guarantors, and I currently reside in my rental apartment, where I have lived for 3 years. The only property I own is my current vehicle, which is now unreliable and needs to be replaced.

I have no other installment plans except for a small furniture loan, which is being paid off regularly. As a skilled employee with a stable job and a good track record, I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Reliable transportation is essential for my job and my family responsibilities.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Schneider

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am applying for a 1,525 DM loan to purchase a new car. I am a 34-year-old married nurse at Charité Hospital, with 4 years of continuous employment. I have a savings account with 1,200 DM and do not currently have a checking account.

My credit history is impeccable; I have always paid back my loans on schedule. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and I have lived at my present address for the past 3 years. The only property I own is my aging car, which is no longer reliable for my daily commute and night shifts.

As a foreign worker from Bulgaria, I take pride in being a responsible member of the community. I have one dependent, and my stable employment and disciplined financial management make me a reliable loan recipient. I am confident I can meet the installment rate and pay back the loan as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Sabine Weber, a 38-year-old separated school teacher at the Berlin International School, where I have been working for 5 years. I am applying for a 1,525 DM loan to buy a new car, as my current one is no longer dependable. I do not have a checking account but hold a savings account with 1,500 DM.

My financial record shows all previous credits have been paid back on time over the last 24 months. I have no guarantors, no other significant debts, and have lived at my current residence for 3 years. The only asset I own is my car.

Being a skilled official with a secure job and a strong credit history, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. I am a foreign worker from Austria and have always prioritized financial responsibility. The new car will be essential for my commute and professional obligations.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Weber
