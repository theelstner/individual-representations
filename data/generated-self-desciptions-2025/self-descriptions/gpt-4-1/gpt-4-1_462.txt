Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,620 DM for the purchase of essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a research technician at BioGenix Laboratories, where I have been employed for the past three years. My employment is stable and my income is consistent, allowing me to meet my financial obligations reliably.

I have previously taken out a credit with your bank, which I have repaid in full and on time. Although my current checking and savings account balances are low, this is due to recent necessary expenses related to moving into my own residence two years ago. I am single, 37 years old, and support two dependents.

I have a building society savings agreement and a life insurance policy as proof of my commitment to long-term financial planning. My housing is owned, and I have no other installment plans. Additionally, my brother is willing to act as a guarantor for this loan.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan in monthly installments, as my record with your bank demonstrates. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Schmidt

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 3,620 DM to purchase equipment for my small home-based woodworking business. I have been employed as a certified electrician at Müller & Söhne for nearly two years. My financial situation is stable, and I have always managed my obligations responsibly.

I have successfully repaid a previous loan with your bank. My current account balance is low due to recent investments in my business, but I have no outstanding debts elsewhere. I am a single father of two, and my children rely on my income.

I own my home and have a life insurance policy. My cousin, who is financially stable, has agreed to be my guarantor. I am a foreign worker from Hungary, but I have been living in Germany for two years and am committed to building my life here.

I assure you of my reliability and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
László Nagy

Dear Bank Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 3,620 DM to buy new furniture and equipment for my apartment. I have been working as a police officer in Stuttgart for the past three years, and my employment is secure. My salary is sufficient to meet my needs and those of my two children.

Although my savings are currently below 100 DM, I have always repaid my debts promptly, including a previous credit from your bank. I have lived in my own apartment for two years, and my uncle is willing to act as a guarantor.

I have a building society savings agreement and a life insurance policy, reflecting my prudent financial planning. I do not have any other installment plans.

I am confident that I can meet the monthly installment payments and would appreciate your favorable consideration.

Best regards,  
Andreas Keller

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,620 DM for the purchase of necessary home equipment and furniture. I have been employed as a government clerk with the Federal Employment Agency for just over one year.

My current account and savings are minimal, as I recently purchased my own apartment, where I have lived for two years. I am 37, single, with two dependents, and my cousin has agreed to be my guarantor.

I have a life insurance policy and a building society savings agreement. I have no other outstanding installment plans. As a foreign worker from Poland, I am committed to my career and life in Germany.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Sincerely,
