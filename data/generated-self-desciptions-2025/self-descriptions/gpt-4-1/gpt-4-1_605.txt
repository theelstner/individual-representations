Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 3,349 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my newly established home office. I am a 38-year-old divorced woman, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for the past two years. Since relocating to Munich two years ago, I have maintained a stable residence and a consistent employment record.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have demonstrated financial responsibility by repaying all existing credits on time. My only asset is a reliable car, which I use for daily commuting. As a foreign worker in Germany, I have limited savings—less than 100 DM—and no other outstanding debts or guarantors.

My income is sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate, and I am confident in my ability to manage the loan responsibly. I am committed to building a strong financial foundation and believe this loan will help me further stabilize my living and working situation.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Kowalska

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 3,349 DM loan to purchase furniture and equipment for my consulting business. I am a 45-year-old married woman, self-employed as a management consultant for the past three years.

My monthly income is stable and sufficient to comfortably meet the required installment payments. As a responsible business owner with experience managing finances, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. I am seeking this loan to expand my business and improve my home office setup.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 3,349 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my newly rented apartment. I am a 33-year-old separated woman, currently working as a highly qualified employee in IT management at Siemens AG. I have been with the company for just over a year and have resided at my current address in Frankfurt for two years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have never defaulted on any credit payments in the past. My only asset is my car, which I use for commuting and work-related travel. I have no dependents or other financial commitments.

My current savings are less than 100 DM, as I recently moved and furnished my apartment. I am a foreign worker, but I am fully integrated into my company and community. My steady employment and clean credit history demonstrate my reliability and trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,  
Maria Petrova
