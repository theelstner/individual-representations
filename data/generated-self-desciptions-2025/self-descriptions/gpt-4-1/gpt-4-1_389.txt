Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,374 DM for the purpose of purchasing new equipment for my home office. As a freelance scientific research assistant with over 8 years of experience, I am currently between contracts but have a strong record of project completion and client satisfaction. My financial situation is stable, with a checking account balance below 200 DM and limited savings, but I own my home and have maintained two existing credits with your bank in good standing.

Though I am currently unemployed, I am actively seeking new research projects and expect to secure new contracts within the next few months. I have a building society savings agreement as a form of property, and I am committed to meeting all installment obligations, as demonstrated by my positive credit history with your institution.

I am single with one dependent and have lived at my current address for four years. I have always prioritized financial responsibility, even during challenging times. I am confident that this investment in equipment will enable me to secure new work and improve my financial stability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 7,374 DM to furnish my newly acquired apartment. As a self-employed IT consultant, I have managed my own business for the past 10 years, providing services to several reputable clients. Unfortunately, due to the recent economic downturn, I am temporarily without a contract. My current checking account balance is under 200 DM, and my savings are minimal, but I have a life insurance policy as collateral and own my home.

I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. I have a single dependent (my son), and I have resided at my current address for four years. While my credit history shows some previous challenges, I have always honored my obligations and am committed to meeting the monthly installment rate of 4.

I am confident that this investment in quality furniture and equipment will improve my work environment and help me quickly reestablish a steady income. My proven track record as a reliable consultant and my commitment to financial responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,374 DM to purchase essential equipment for my at-home design studio. As a single father and professional architect with 15 years of experience, I have recently become unemployed due to company downsizing. My current financial resources are limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, but I have a building society savings agreement and own my residence.

Despite having two existing credits at your bank, both are well-managed, and I have never defaulted on any payments. I have no other guarantors or co-signers, and my only dependent is my teenage daughter. My credit history reflects some previous difficulties, but I have always demonstrated responsibility in meeting my obligations.

With this loan, I plan to upgrade my studio’s equipment to take on freelance projects and regain financial stability. I am committed to honoring the agreed-upon installment rate and am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further discussion.

Sincerely,  
Jan Richter

Letter 4

Dear Loan Department,

I am requesting a loan of 7,374 DM to buy furniture and equipment for my home-based consulting business. I am a 40-year-old retired military officer, currently between jobs, with one dependent. My checking account has less than 200 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, but I have a life insurance policy and own my home.

I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are current. My credit history includes a critical account, but I have always made my payments and am committed to maintaining this record. I have lived at my current address for four years and have no other debts apart from installment plans at stores.

This loan will allow me to set up a professional workspace and pursue new consulting opportunities. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment payments and believe my background as an officer demonstrates my reliability and sense of duty.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Michael Hoffmann
