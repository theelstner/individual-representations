Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 1,555 DM to repair essential household appliances that have recently broken down. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for the past eight years. I have a stable income and have managed to save over 1,000 DM in my savings account.

Although I have experienced a delay in paying off a loan in the past, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management and have kept up with all my current obligations. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I reside in my current apartment for free, which allows me to allocate more funds towards repayments. I have lived at my present address for four years and am responsible for two dependents.

Despite not having a checking account, I am committed to fulfilling my financial commitments. My long-term employment and savings demonstrate my reliability. I kindly ask you to consider my application and assure you of my intent to repay the loan promptly.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am seeking a loan of 1,555 DM to carry out necessary repairs on my car, which is vital for commuting to work and supporting my two children. I have been employed as a senior technician at Siemens AG for the past nine years and have maintained a savings account with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM.

While I did have a delayed payment on a previous loan, I have since restructured my budget to avoid similar issues. Currently, I have two active credits at your bank, both of which are being paid on schedule. I do not own property, but I have lived at my current residence for four years without paying rent, reducing my monthly expenses significantly.

As a single father and a foreign worker, I am dedicated to providing for my family and maintaining financial stability. I appreciate your consideration of my application and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,555 DM to repair the heating system in my apartment. My name is Marek Nowak, and I have been employed as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for eight years. I am single, responsible for two dependents, and have resided at my current address for four years.

My financial situation is stable, with over 1,000 DM in savings. I do not own property, nor do I have a checking account, but I have consistently managed my expenses. Although I once experienced a delay in loan repayment, I have learned from that experience and have maintained timely payments on my two existing credits at your bank.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and my secure employment and long-term residence demonstrate my reliability. I kindly request that you consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak
