Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 7,408 DM. As a recently promoted scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for the past 10 months and am eager to upgrade to a new vehicle to better commute between my work and home, especially as I am responsible for my 3-year-old son.

My financial situation is stable: I currently have a checking account balance of 120 DM and a savings bond of 350 DM. I have an existing credit with your bank that I have paid back reliably, always on time. I have no other debts, and my only dependent is my son. While I have only lived at my current residence for two years, I own my apartment and hold a life insurance policy for added security.

As a foreign worker from Poland, I am committed to building my future here in Germany. My career is progressing, and I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 4. I believe my record of responsible credit management and my stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska
