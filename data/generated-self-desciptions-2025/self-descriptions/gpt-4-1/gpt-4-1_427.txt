Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,779 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, a 36-year-old married man and a skilled machine operator at RheinMetall AG, where I have been employed for 2 years and 7 months. My family and I have lived in our current rented apartment in Düsseldorf for the past 3 years.

I am seeking this loan because my current car, which is over 15 years old, is no longer reliable for commuting to work and supporting my family’s needs. Having a dependable vehicle is essential for my job and daily responsibilities. I have maintained a good credit history, always paying my existing credits on time. Currently, my checking and savings accounts hold less than 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively, but I manage my finances carefully and have no outstanding debts or guarantors.

My steady employment, clean repayment history, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate. I am committed to meeting the installment payments and appreciate your consideration for this loan.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

To Whom It May Concern,
