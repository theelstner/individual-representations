Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Klein, and I am applying for a loan of 4,817 DM to purchase a new car. I am 31 years old, single, and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years. I have one dependent, my son, and have resided at my current address for 3 years. 

I currently own my home and have an existing life insurance policy as additional security. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM, as I recently covered unexpected medical expenses for my son. However, my salary is stable, and I have always repaid previous credits on time. I also have an existing credit at your bank, which I have managed responsibly.

The new car is essential for my daily commute to the institute and for transporting my son. My co-applicant, my brother, is also employed full-time and will share the responsibility of repayment. I am committed to meeting all obligations, and my credit history reflects my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for further discussion and can provide any additional documents required.

Sincerely,  
Markus Klein
