Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 7,824 EUR for the purpose of purchasing a used car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 9 months, and I am currently renting an apartment in Frankfurt, where I have lived for the past 4 years.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have previously taken out two credits with you, both of which I repaid on time and in full. I am a single father of two children, and my current housing and work situation require reliable transportation. My current financial obligations are manageable, and I have a guarantor in place for this loan.

Additionally, I own a small real estate property in my hometown, which further demonstrates my financial responsibility. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3 and continue my record of timely payments. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am seeking a loan of 7,824 EUR to purchase a used vehicle. I have been working as a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport for the past 7 months.

I am single, supporting two children, and have lived at my current address for 4 years. I am renting my apartment and have other installment plans with your bank, but my property ownership in Poland provides additional security. I have a guarantor for this loan and a reliable telephone contact.

My stable employment, solid credit history with your bank, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your consideration.
