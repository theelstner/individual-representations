Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Julia Weber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,186 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My employment is stable, and I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication in my role.

I have maintained a savings account with a balance of over 2,000 DM, and I have a strong credit history with all previous credits paid back on time. I am divorced and live independently, with no other debtors or guarantors. My current residence has been my home for the past 3 years, and I have always paid my rent punctually.

My reason for needing a new car is to facilitate my daily commute and research fieldwork, which often requires travel to partner institutions. I believe this investment will improve my efficiency and job performance. I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate of 2, as I have a steady income and no other outstanding installment plans except for a manageable one of 20 DM per month.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling all loan obligations.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Julia Weber
