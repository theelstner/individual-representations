Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,832 EUR to support my son’s university education. I have been working for the past 8 years as a janitor at the Greenfield Residential Complex, a position I have held with dedication and pride. Although my job is classified as unskilled, I am known for my reliability and trustworthiness.

I have no existing checking or savings account, but I have successfully paid back all my previous credits on time, including a 2,000 EUR home renovation loan from your bank last year. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and own my property, which provides stability. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only dependent is my son.

Despite my modest income, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I am confident that I can meet the installment rate of 1, as I have no other installment plans. I believe investing in my son’s education is the best way to secure a better future for our family.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations and am happy to provide any additional information you require.

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak
