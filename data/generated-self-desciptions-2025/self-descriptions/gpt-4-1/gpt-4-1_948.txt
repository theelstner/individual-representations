Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 3,349 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have recently started working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 10 months. My current financial situation is stable; I have managed to save 600 DM in my savings account, although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to initial moving expenses.

I am 30 years old, single, and have two dependents whom I support. I have lived at my current address for four years and enjoy free housing as part of my employment benefits. I have previously taken one loan from your bank, which I repaid in full and on time, as reflected in my credit history.

I am a responsible and trustworthy candidate, as demonstrated by my consistent employment, prompt repayment history, and commitment to supporting my family. I believe this loan will help me establish a comfortable and productive home environment, which will further enhance my job performance and financial stability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jens Müller, and I am writing to request a loan of 3,349 DM for the purchase of necessary furniture and equipment for my household. I recently began working as a junior IT specialist at Siemens AG, and have been employed there for nine months. I currently have 850 DM in my savings account, but my checking account is overdrawn due to costs associated with relocating for my new job.

I am a 30-year-old single father of two, and have been living at my current residence for the past four years. My housing is provided free of charge by a family friend, which allows me to manage my finances more effectively. I have no other debts or guarantors, and have successfully repaid my previous loan with your bank on time.

Given my stable employment, history of reliable repayments, and commitment to providing for my children, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments. I am eager to improve our living situation and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,  
Jens Müller

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is David Schuster, and I am seeking a loan of 3,349 DM to furnish my home and purchase equipment needed for my job as a technical draftsman at Bosch GmbH, where I have been employed for eleven months. My savings account currently holds 700 DM, and while my checking account is in the negative, this is due to recent expenses related to starting my new job and supporting my two children.

I am 30 years old, single, and have lived at my current address for four years. I have no other outstanding loans or installment plans and benefit from free housing provided by my employer. My previous credit with your bank was repaid punctually, reflecting my reliability.

I am committed to maintaining a good financial record and believe that this loan will enable me to create a stable environment for my family and continue excelling at work. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
David Schuster
