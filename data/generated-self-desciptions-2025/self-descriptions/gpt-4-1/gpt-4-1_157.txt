Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,282 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 3 years. After my recent divorce, I had to move to a new residence, and I am currently renting an unfurnished place. My current account is temporarily overdrawn due to moving expenses, and my savings are less than 100 DM.

Despite this, I have always paid back my previous credits on time, as reflected in my credit history. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and I have been living at my current address for 4 years. I also own a car. My stable job and consistent salary as a skilled employee make me confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Claudia Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,282 DM to purchase office equipment for my home workspace. I am a married legal secretary, working at a reputable law firm for the past 2 years. My present residence has been my home for 4 years, and I am renting it. My checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are minimal, but I have a strong record of repaying all previous loans on time.

I have no guarantors or other debtors, and my only significant asset is my reliable Volkswagen Golf. My employment is stable, and my regular income ensures that I can manage the monthly installment rate of 2. I have no other installment plans except for a small payment plan on household appliances.

I value my financial commitments and assure you that I will honor all obligations related to this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Sabine Koch

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 1,282 DM to purchase new furniture and a washing machine for my apartment. I am a divorced healthcare technician, employed at St. Joseph Hospital for 1 year and 8 months. My current residence has been my home for 4 years, and I am renting.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
