Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,930 DM to purchase a new television set for my home. I am a 27-year-old divorced woman, currently working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 5 years. My financial situation is stable: although my checking account balance is under 200 DM and my savings are limited, I have always paid back my existing credits on time and currently have only one credit at your bank, which is being managed responsibly.

I own my home and a small piece of real estate in the area, which demonstrates my commitment and stability. I have one dependent, my young son, and no other installment plans or debts. My residence here is relatively recent (1 year), as I relocated for my current job. I am a foreign worker, originally from Hungary, but have integrated well into the local community.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2, as my employment is secure and my expenses are well managed. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Katalin Nagy

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,930 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my household. I am a 27-year-old married woman and have been working as an administrative officer at the City Hall for the past 4 years. My financial history is solid, with all previous loans paid back promptly, and I currently have one ongoing credit with your bank, which is up to date.

My checking and savings accounts are modest, as most of my income goes towards supporting my family and our home. I own my apartment and a small plot of land inherited from my parents. I have one child and no other outstanding debts or installment plans. My husband and I relocated to this city last year due to my job offer.

Despite limited liquid assets, my consistent employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident I can manage the repayment schedule and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Anna Becker

Letter 3

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,930 DM to upgrade my household’s radio and television equipment. I am a separated woman, 27 years old, and I have been employed as a skilled laboratory technician at Bayer AG for the past 6 years. My current account holds less than 200 DM, and my savings are also below 100 DM, but I have a strong credit record with all previous credits paid back on schedule.

I own my flat and a small real estate asset in the outskirts of the city. I have resided here for one year, following my separation, and I am the sole provider for my 5-year-old daughter. I have no other debts or installment plans and only one existing credit at your bank, which is in good standing.

As a foreign worker from Poland, I have worked diligently to establish my life and career here. My stable employment and property ownership demonstrate my reliability, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the agreed period.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Magdalena Kowalska

Letter 4

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a 2,930 DM loan to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am a married woman, 27 years old, and have worked as a customs official at the local port for 5 years. Although my current and savings account balances are low, I have always met my credit obligations, and my existing credit at your bank is being paid back regularly.

I own my house and a small parcel of real estate nearby. My husband and I moved to this city a year ago for his work, and we are raising our 3-year-old son. I have no additional debts or installment plans, and my only credit is the one currently with your bank.

As a foreign national from Romania, I have worked hard to establish myself in this community and in my career. My secure job and history of responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ioana Popescu
