Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan of 2,603 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past three years. My position is stable and provides a steady income, which has allowed me to save over 1,000 DM in my savings account.

I have been living at my current address for four years and have always paid my rent and other obligations on time. Although I do not have a checking account, I have a proven record of repaying previous credits without delay. I am divorced with one dependent child, and as the sole provider, a car is essential for my daily commute and to ensure my child’s well-being.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only installment plan is for household appliances, which I have managed responsibly. I am confident that my financial discipline and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Schmidt

I have no outstanding debts, and my only other installment plan is for a furniture purchase, which I am paying off reliably. I believe my stable job, good credit history, and responsible financial management make me a strong candidate for this loan.
