Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Sabine Keller and I am applying for a loan of 915 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years and am currently divorced with one dependent. My current account is slightly overdrawn due to some recent unexpected expenses, but I have always paid back my existing credits on time and in full.

I do not have a savings account, but my stable employment and regular income assure that I can meet the installment payments for this loan. I have lived at my current address for two years and my only property is my current car, which is now unreliable and needs to be replaced so I can continue commuting to work and supporting my child.

I am a responsible borrower, as shown by my perfect credit repayment history. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Keller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a 915 DM loan to purchase a new vehicle. My name is Petra Schumann, and I have worked as an administrative officer at the City Hall in Düsseldorf for the past 9 years. I am married with two children and have maintained my current residence for two years.

Although my checking account is currently in the negative, I have a strong credit history and have never missed an installment on my previous loans. I do not have a savings account, but I have no other debts and no guarantors.

A new car is essential for my daily commute and for transporting my family. My stable employment and reliable repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 4.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Petra Schumann

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, and my track record demonstrates my financial responsibility.
