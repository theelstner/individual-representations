Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 14,782 DM to support the expansion of my consulting business. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years and have built a stable career. My checking account currently holds 150 DM, and I have a savings account with 320 DM. All previous loans with your bank have been repaid on time, and I have maintained a strong credit history.

I am divorced and live with my daughter in company-provided housing, which allows me to keep my living costs low. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. My current monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have maintained my residence for the past 4 years. Although I do not own property, my stable employment and history of responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate.

This loan will help me invest in new research equipment and cover operational costs for the next phase of my business. I am confident in my ability to continue meeting my financial obligations and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dr. Eva Schneider
