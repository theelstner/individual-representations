Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,359 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a divorced father of a seven-year-old son, I recently moved into my own apartment and need to create a comfortable and functional living environment for us both.

I am 33 years old and have previously worked as a technical draftsman for a German engineering firm for eight years before my recent period of unemployment. While I am currently seeking new employment, I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly, as demonstrated by my impeccable credit history with your bank. I have one existing credit with you, which I have been paying back reliably.

Though my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are modest (just over 100 DM), I have a building society savings agreement to support my financial security. I own my apartment, which reduces my monthly expenses, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my financial discipline and prior record show. I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on time.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,359 DM for the purchase of new furniture and computer equipment. As a 33-year-old separated man with a young daughter, I have recently moved into my own home and wish to provide a stable and well-equipped environment for her visits.

I am a trained laboratory research assistant and worked for the Max Planck Institute for nine years before my recent unemployment due to restructuring. I am currently receiving unemployment benefits and actively searching for new employment opportunities. Despite my current financial challenges, I have a solid record of repaying my previous credit with your bank on schedule.

My current account is temporarily overdrawn due to moving expenses, and my savings amount to just under 200 DM. However, I have a life insurance policy that adds to my financial security, and I am not burdened by any other debts or installment plans. I have lived in my current residence for a year and am the sole owner, which ensures my housing stability.

Given my responsible financial behavior and commitment to my obligations, I am confident that I will honor the repayment schedule.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak

Letter 3

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 2,359 DM to purchase necessary furniture and office equipment for my new home. After my recent separation, I moved into an apartment that I own and am now setting up a suitable living space for myself and my six-year-old son, who stays with me on weekends.

I am 33 years old, a certified IT support specialist, and have worked for Siemens for ten years until I was laid off last year. I am currently unemployed but actively seeking new positions in my field. My credit history with your bank is excellent, as I have always repaid my credits diligently.

My savings are limited to about 300 DM, and my checking account is currently negative due to moving costs and child support payments. However, I have a building society savings agreement and no other debts or installment plans.

I believe my stable housing situation and history of responsible financial management make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I am committed to meeting the installment payments as agreed.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Mehmet Kaya

Letter 4

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,359 DM to furnish my new home and purchase equipment that will help me pursue freelance work opportunities. As a 33-year-old divorced father, I have recently settled into my own apartment after separating from my spouse and need to establish a comfortable home for myself and my eight-year-old daughter.

I am a qualified mechanical engineer and worked at Bosch for eight years before my recent unemployment. Despite my current jobless status, I have always honored my financial commitments, including timely repayment of my existing credit with your bank.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and I have savings of about 150 DM. I hold a life insurance policy and own my residence, which provides some financial stability. I have no other debts or installment plans.

My previous track record of responsible credit repayment and asset ownership demonstrates my trustworthiness. I am confident in my ability to fulfill the loan obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Popov

Letter 5

Dear Bank Manager,

I am requesting a loan of 2,359 DM to purchase essential furniture and a laptop for my apartment. I am a 33-year-old separated man with a five-year-old son, living independently for the past year in an apartment I own.

My background is in public administration, and I worked as a municipal official for nine years until I was made redundant last year. I am currently unemployed but am actively seeking new opportunities in my field. Throughout my career, I have always managed my finances responsibly, as reflected in my perfect credit repayment history with your bank.

At present, my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to recent relocation expenses, and I have around 120 DM in my savings account. I also have a building society savings agreement, which provides an additional layer of financial security. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

I am committed to meeting the loan repayments and believe my history with your bank demonstrates my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Mariusz Kowalski
