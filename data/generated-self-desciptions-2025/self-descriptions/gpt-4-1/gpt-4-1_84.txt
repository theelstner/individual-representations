Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,568 DM to support my small tailoring business, which I started eighteen months ago here in Stuttgart. Although I do not have a checking account, I have responsibly managed my finances through a savings account with a balance of 250 DM and have successfully paid back a previous credit with your bank. 

Currently, I am employed as a resident housekeeper at the local hostel, a position I have held for the past two years. My income, combined with my careful budgeting, has enabled me to keep up with all my financial obligations, including the installment payments for my previous loan. I am a 24-year-old divorced woman and the sole provider for my 3-year-old daughter. 

This loan will allow me to purchase a new sewing machine and additional fabrics, which will help me fulfill increasing customer orders. I am committed to repaying this loan, as I have demonstrated with my previous credit. As a responsible tenant, I have lived at my current address for four years and maintain a building society savings agreement. 

I appreciate your consideration and am confident in my ability to honor this commitment.

Sincerely,  
Maria Ivanova

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a business loan of 1,568 DM to expand my small grocery kiosk, which I have managed for the past year and a half. As a foreign worker from Poland, I am dedicated to building a stable life for myself and my 5-year-old son. I am married and have been employed for three years as a kitchen assistant at a local restaurant.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have a savings account with 320 DM and have successfully paid off a previous loan from your bank. My current financial obligations are limited, and I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors. I have lived in my rented apartment for four years, and my property includes a life insurance policy.

The requested loan will be invested in new refrigeration units and inventory, which will increase my shop’s profitability. My reliable payment history and steady employment demonstrate my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Anna Kowalska

Dear Bank Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 1,568 DM to invest in my home-based catering business, which I started eighteen months ago after moving to this city from Turkey. I am a 24-year-old separated woman with a 2-year-old child, and I have been working as an unskilled resident cleaner at a local hotel for nearly three years.

Though I do not possess a checking account, I have a building society savings agreement with a balance of 410 DM. I have previously taken and fully repaid a loan from your bank, always meeting my installment obligations. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have rented the same apartment for four years.

This loan will allow me to upgrade my kitchen appliances and buy bulk ingredients, which will increase my earning potential. My steady employment and record of reliable repayments make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Leyla Demir
