Letter 1 – From Maria Kovacs, Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,406 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for the past 5 years and have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication in my field.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are below 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, as I recently finalized my divorce and have taken on full responsibility for my 5-year-old son. Despite these challenges, I have always paid back my previous credit with your bank on time, and I currently have one active credit that is being managed responsibly.

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and have resided at my current address for 4 years. Although I am renting, I do own a small property in my home country, which provides additional security. As a foreign worker, I am fully integrated and committed to my position and community in Germany.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and assure you of my trustworthiness. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Letter 2 – From Elena Marino, Primary School Teacher

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,406 DM to furnish my apartment and purchase necessary equipment for my daughter and myself. I have been working as a primary school teacher in Berlin for the past 6 years, and I am currently separated, raising my 7-year-old daughter on my own.

Although my current checking account balance is below zero, and my savings are modest, I have a solid history of repaying loans, including my existing credit with your bank. I have managed all my financial obligations diligently and have never missed a payment.

I have no other debts or financial commitments, and I have been renting my apartment for 4 years. I also own a small piece of land in Italy, which adds to my financial stability. As a foreign national, I am committed to building my life and career here in Germany.

I am confident that my stable employment and responsible financial behavior make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Elena Marino

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a 2,406 DM loan to buy furniture and equipment for my home, as I have recently moved after my divorce. I am a registered nurse at St. Joseph’s Hospital and have been employed there for 4 years.

My financial situation is currently strained, with both my checking and savings accounts under 100 DM. However, I have always repaid my previous credit with your bank on time, and I am managing my current loan responsibly. I have no additional debts or installment plans.

I have lived at my present address for 4 years and, while I am renting, I own a small apartment in Romania, which I intend to keep as an asset for my daughter’s future. I am raising my 3-year-old daughter alone and am committed to providing her with a stable and comfortable home.

I believe my employment record and payment history demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Sofia Petrescu
