Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,553 DM to purchase a new television set. I am a 26-year-old divorced woman, currently working as a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 5 years. I live with my young son in a rented apartment in Berlin, where we have resided for the past 2 years.

While I have experienced a delay in paying off a previous loan, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management, such as setting up a standing order for all future payments. My current checking account balance is modest, but I do have a building society savings agreement with over 200 DM. I have no other debts, and my monthly installment rate is manageable with my current salary.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate as I have a stable job, a steady income, and have learned from my past financial mistakes. This loan will enable me to provide a much-needed source of information and entertainment for my family. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Anna Fischer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Keller, and I am seeking a loan of 1,553 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my household. I am a 23-year-old married woman working as a municipal office administrator for the city of Hamburg. I have been in this position for 4 years and have one dependent child.

Although I have had a delay in paying off a loan in the past, I have consistently met my obligations for the last two years and have two active credits with your bank. My current savings are just under 400 DM, and my checking account balance is below 200 DM due to recent household expenses. I do not have any other debts, and I am not part of any other installment plans.

My employment is secure, and I am committed to maintaining a good credit standing. I have a life insurance policy as additional security. I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment rate without difficulty. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,  
Sabine Keller

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan in the amount of 1,553 DM for the purchase of a new television and radio for my home. My name is Martina Lehmann, I am 25 years old, married, and currently employed as a skilled laboratory technician at Bayer AG, where I have worked for 6 years.

Although I did encounter a delay in repaying a loan three years ago, I have since maintained a clean record and always pay my dues on time. My checking account currently has under 200 DM, and I have about 350 DM in a building society savings account. I have one child, no other dependents, and no guarantors or co-signers.

I have lived at my present address for 2 years and have rented throughout my adult life. With a stable job and a clear plan for repayment, I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments. Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Martina Lehmann

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Claudia Richter, a 24-year-old separated woman with one dependent. I am currently employed as a customs official at Frankfurt Airport, a position I have held for 4 years. I am seeking a loan of 1,553 DM to purchase a modern radio and television, as our current equipment is outdated and unreliable.

I admit that I had a delay in repaying a previous credit, but I have since taken financial counseling and have not missed a payment in over two years. My savings account holds 250 DM, and my checking account balance is under 200 DM due to recent moving expenses. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and no other installment plans.

I have been a responsible tenant for 2 years, and my employment is secure. I also have a life insurance policy as part of my long-term financial planning. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Thank you,  
Claudia Richter
