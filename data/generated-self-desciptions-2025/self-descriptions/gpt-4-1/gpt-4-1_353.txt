Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 959 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for just over two years. Since my recent divorce, I have been living on my own and need to furnish my residence to create a stable home environment for myself and my 10-year-old daughter.

My financial situation is stable: I have a checking account balance of 150 DM and a small savings account of 80 DM. I have always repaid my previous credits on time, as reflected in my credit history. At present, I have no other debts or guarantors. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have been living at my current address for two years.

As a skilled employee with a permanent contract and a reliable income, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule. I value financial responsibility and have a proven track record of managing my obligations diligently.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 959 DM to buy necessary equipment for my home office. I am a married woman, working as a certified public accountant at a local firm for the past three years. My husband and I recently moved, and I need to set up a proper workspace to continue my remote work effectively.

Currently, my checking account has a balance of 120 DM and my savings are below 100 DM, as most of our funds were allocated to moving expenses. I have always repaid my previous credits punctually, and I have no outstanding debts. I have been residing at my present address for two years and own my car as my primary property.

Given my stable employment, consistent income, and responsible credit history, I am confident in my ability to fulfill the loan obligations. I am committed to maintaining my excellent financial reputation.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 959 DM to purchase new furniture after separating from my spouse. I am a divorced mother of one, employed as a skilled laboratory technician at Siemens AG for the past 2.5 years. Since moving out, I have been living in unfurnished accommodation and need to provide a comfortable home for my child.

My current account holds 80 DM, and my savings are minimal due to recent legal fees. However, I have an unblemished credit history, having always paid back previous loans on time. I have no other debts, and my installment rate is within my means.

I have been at my current address for two years and rely on my personal vehicle for commuting. My stable employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Elena Fischer

Dear Bank Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 959 DM to purchase equipment for my small at-home tailoring business. I have been married for five years and currently work as a skilled seamstress at a local atelier, with three years of continuous employment. My family and I recently moved into a new apartment, which is currently unfurnished.

My financial situation is modest; my checking account balance is 190 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM. I have no other outstanding loans or debts and have always repaid previous credits promptly. We have been at our current residence for two years, and I own a car.

With my steady employment and history of responsible financial management, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. This investment will help me increase my income and provide better stability for my family.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Maria Schneider
