Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,154 DM for the purchase of a new television, which is essential for my family’s daily needs and my child’s education. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked diligently for the past eight years. Although my current checking account balance is modest, I am committed to responsible financial management.

While I have a critical account status due to previous loans at other banks, I have always ensured that my payments are made as agreed. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and I own both my home and a small piece of real estate in Leipzig, which demonstrates my stability. My savings are limited to under 100 DM, but my steady employment and residence for the past four years provide additional security.

As a single father of one, I am determined to provide a comfortable home and access to educational resources. I am confident that my long-term employment and responsible handling of existing credits make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 1,154 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I have been employed as a janitor at the Berlin City Hospital for the past nine years, and I take great pride in my work and reliability. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking and savings account balances are low, as I have been supporting my son through his schooling.

I have a critical credit history due to past obligations at other institutions, but I have always honored my commitments. I own my home and a small plot of land in Brandenburg, and I have lived at my current address for four years. I have no other outstanding installment plans, and my only dependent is my teenage son.

Despite not having a telephone or significant savings, my steady employment and property ownership are testaments to my responsibility. I am confident that I will be able to repay the loan within the agreed period.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Marek Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I wish to apply for a loan of 1,154 DM to replace my old television and radio, which are vital for staying informed and connected. I am a single male, 37 years old, and have been working as a night shift cleaner at the Stuttgart Railway Station for the past eight years. My income is regular, but my savings are currently under 100 DM due to recent household expenses.

Although I have a history of critical accounts with other banks, I have always made my payments and never defaulted. I own a small apartment and a piece of inherited land, and I have resided at my current address for four years. I have one child, whom I fully support, and I have no additional debt or installment plans.

I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and commitment to my financial obligations make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Yilmaz

Dear Madam or Sir,

I am applying for a loan of 1,154 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am a 37-year-old single father, working as a kitchen porter at the Frankfurt Grand Hotel for the past seven years. My financial situation is tight, with less than 100 DM in savings and a checking account balance below 200 DM, as most of my income goes towards supporting my son.

My credit history includes critical accounts from other banks, but I have always managed to keep up with payments. I own my residence and a small piece of real estate, and have lived here for four years. I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

Despite being an unskilled worker and a foreign national, I have demonstrated stability through my long-term employment and property ownership. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Piotr Zielinski

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,154 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my household. I am currently employed as a hospital orderly at the Munich Medical Center, a position I have held for eight years. My current financial reserves are low, with a checking account under 200 DM and savings below 100 DM, primarily due to caring for my young child.

I have a critical credit history from previous obligations at other banks, but I have maintained all my payments. I own my home as well as a small parcel of land inherited from my parents, and I have lived at my current address for four years. I have no other debts or installment plans.

As a single father and a foreign worker, I am deeply committed to providing a stable environment for my child. My long-term employment and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling the loan obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov
