Letter 1

To whom it may concern,

My name is Maria K., and I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1185 DM. I am a divorced 27-year-old woman, and I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the local university for the past 3 years. I am currently residing in my own apartment, which I purchased two years ago, and I am proud to have invested in real estate at a young age.

I am seeking this loan to expand my small side business, which involves providing academic editing services for international students. My financial situation is modest; I do not have a checking account yet, and my savings are currently less than 100 DM, as I have been investing in my property and supporting my 6-year-old daughter. While I have had some critical accounts in the past with another bank, I am committed to improving my financial management and have maintained two credits with your bank without any issues.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate because I have demonstrated responsibility through steady employment and home ownership. I am confident that this loan will help my business grow, ensuring a stable future for myself and my daughter.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria K.

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Petrova, a 27-year-old married woman living in my own apartment for the last two years. I am currently employed as a logistics coordinator at a shipping company and have been with the company for 2.5 years. I have one child who depends on me.

I am applying for a business loan of 1185 DM to invest in a small online retail shop I have been developing. My financial resources are limited at the moment, with savings under 100 DM, as I have been focused on supporting my family and maintaining our property. While I have had a critical account with another bank in the past, I have two active credits with your bank and have managed them responsibly.

As a foreign worker, I am eager to contribute to the local economy and create opportunities for my family. I have no other debts or installment plans and am committed to fulfilling my obligations. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Anna Petrova

To the Loan Department,

I have one dependent, my 5-year-old daughter. I work as an IT support specialist at a local firm, where I have been employed for just over three years.
