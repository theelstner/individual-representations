Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Stefan Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 2,223 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a Hungarian citizen working in Germany as a senior laboratory technician at Bayer AG, where I have been employed for the past 8 years. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and am the sole owner of my apartment.

Although I do not have a checking account, I manage my finances carefully and have a building society savings agreement worth 350 DM. I currently have two credits with your bank, both of which I have serviced reliably. My credit history includes some critical accounts, but I have always met my obligations and have no guarantors or other debtors.

As a single father with one dependent, I am committed to providing a comfortable life for my child. My stable employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident that I will be able to meet the monthly installment rate of 4 and repay the loan in full and on time.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Stefan Kovacs

My name is Marko Ivanovic, a 52-year-old Croatian national, and I have been employed as a customs official at the Frankfurt Airport for the past 9 years. I reside in my own apartment and have lived there for 4 years.
