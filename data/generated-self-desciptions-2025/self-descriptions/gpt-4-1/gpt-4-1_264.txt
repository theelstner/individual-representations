Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,302 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently a Senior Scientific Research Assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for over 8 years. As a single father with one dependent, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities.

My financial situation has been challenging recently, as my checking and savings account balances are currently below 0 DM and 100 DM, respectively. However, I have maintained stable employment and have consistently met my obligations on three existing credits at your bank. My credit history includes accounts with other institutions, but I have always prioritized timely payments.

I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my long-term employment, responsible management of previous credits at your bank, and my commitment to providing for my family. The requested car will ensure I can continue to fulfill my work duties and family commitments without interruption.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Martin Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 5,302 DM to finance the purchase of a new vehicle. As a self-employed IT consultant for the past 9 years, I require a dependable car to travel to client sites and maintain my business operations. My current residence is provided by my employer, which allows me to minimize living expenses and focus on my professional growth.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM, I have successfully managed three credit accounts with your bank over the last 18 months. My credit history includes other loans, but I have always met my installment obligations.

With no other debts or guarantors involved, and a stable income from my consultancy, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. My work ethic and consistent employment record demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Stefan Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a 5,302 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my role as a Police Officer with the Berlin Police Department. I have served in this position for 7 years and have lived at my current address for 4 years. My job requires frequent travel and night shifts, making a reliable vehicle indispensable.

Currently, my financial resources are limited, with less than 0 DM in my checking account and minimal savings. Despite this, I have responsibly managed three credits at your bank, and I have no other installment plans or debts. My stable employment and free housing further support my ability to meet future repayments.

I am a responsible and dedicated public servant, and I assure you that I will honor my financial commitments as I have in the past.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Thomas Becker
