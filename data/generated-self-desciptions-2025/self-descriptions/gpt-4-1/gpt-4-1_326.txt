Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,028 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. My name is Dr. Maria Ivanova, and I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years. As a divorced mother of a seven-year-old son, reliable transportation is essential for both my professional responsibilities and my child’s needs.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained two previous credits with your bank, both of which I have serviced punctually. My overall credit history includes a critical account at another institution, which I have been actively resolving and can provide documentation for. My savings are modest, below 100 DM, as my income is primarily directed toward supporting my household and investing in my property.

I am a permanent resident at my current address for the past three years and own my home. I have no other outstanding installment plans or guarantors, and my only dependent is my son. My employment is secure and my salary as a skilled employee is stable.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and am committed to fulfilling all obligations related to this loan. I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dr. Maria Ivanova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan of 1,028 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute and to manage my responsibilities as a married woman with a young daughter. I have been employed as a senior administrative assistant at the City Council for nearly two years.

While I do not have a checking account, I have successfully managed two credits with your bank previously. My current financial situation is stable, although my savings are limited to under 100 DM due to ongoing household expenses and supporting my family. I own my residence, which provides long-term security for my family.

I have resided at my current address for three years and have no other installment plans. I do have a critical account at another bank, but I have never missed a payment with your institution and am actively working to resolve the outstanding issues elsewhere.

With a steady income, no guarantors or other debts, and a proven track record with your bank, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment requirements. I am committed to maintaining my good standing and believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Elena Schmidt

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Ana Petrova, and I am a married foreign worker employed as a skilled technician at Siemens AG for the past three years. I am seeking a loan of 1,028 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my work and family life, as public transport does not adequately serve our area.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have two active credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. My savings are currently below 100 DM, as I have prioritized investing in my own property, where I have lived for three years.

I have one child and no other debts or installment plans. While my credit history includes a critical account at another bank, I have been diligent in managing my obligations and can provide evidence of my repayment efforts.

As a homeowner with stable employment and a clear payment history at your institution, I am confident in my ability to meet the required installment rate of 4. I take my financial responsibilities seriously and am committed to honoring this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ana Petrova

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Gabriela Nowak, a separated mother of a nine-year-old, and I am requesting a loan of 1,028 DM to buy a new car. I have been a payroll officer at a local manufacturing company for three and a half years. Reliable transportation is vital for my job and my child’s school commute.

I own my home and have lived at my current address for three years.

My credit history includes a critical account at another bank, which I am steadily resolving.

I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and only one dependent. My job is secure, and my income allows me to comfortably manage the proposed installment rate.
