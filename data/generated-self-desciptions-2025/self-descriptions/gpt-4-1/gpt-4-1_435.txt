Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan in the amount of 2,058 DM to cover urgent repairs needed for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Heidelberg, where I have worked for 3 years. My position is stable, and I have a steady monthly income.

Although I do not have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained two credits at your institution for the past 24 months and have always ensured timely payments. My current financial situation is challenging due to an unexpected plumbing issue that requires immediate attention. With savings of less than 100 DM, I am unable to cover the cost upfront.

As a divorced father with one dependent, maintaining a safe and functional home is my top priority. I own my residence and have lived here for 2 years. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and I am committed to meeting my financial obligations. My record as a reliable borrower and my stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Martin Köhler

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,058 DM to finance essential repairs on my property. I am a 33-year-old divorced male, working as an IT systems analyst at a local insurance firm for the past 2 years. My job provides a steady income and security, supporting both myself and my 5-year-old daughter.

I own my own home and have resided here for 2 years. Unfortunately, a recent electrical fault has created a safety hazard that must be addressed immediately. My savings are under 100 DM, leaving me unable to pay for these repairs out of pocket.

Although my credit history includes some critical accounts, I have two active credits with your bank and have always honored my repayment schedules. I have no other debtors or guarantors and do not have other installment plans. My commitment to financial responsibility and the importance of a safe home for my daughter make me confident I will meet the repayment terms.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 2,058 DM to cover the cost of necessary roof repairs on my house. I am a 33-year-old divorced male, working as a skilled machinist at Siemens for the last 2.5 years. My employment is secure and provides for both myself and my young son.

I have owned my home for 2 years, but recent storm damage has forced me to seek financial assistance, as my savings are currently below 100 DM. While my credit history shows some critical accounts, I have two ongoing credits with your bank and have consistently made my payments on time.

I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am not reliant on any guarantors. I am committed to responsible financial management and believe my stable employment and property ownership make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Peter Hoffmann
