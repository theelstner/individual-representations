Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,381 DM from your bank. My name is Tomasz Nowak, a 40-year-old single father residing in Munich for the past four years. I am currently unemployed after my previous job as a warehouse assistant was made redundant last year. Despite my situation, I have always honored my financial obligations, including the prompt repayment of my previous credit with your institution.

The purpose of this loan is to cover essential expenses for my son’s education and to invest in a short vocational training course that will improve my employability in the logistics sector. I have no savings or property, and my current account balance is modest, but I am committed to regaining stable employment.

I am a responsible borrower with a proven track record, as shown by my previous credit history with your bank. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my housing is provided free of charge by a family member, which keeps my living expenses low. My only dependent is my son, and I am fully dedicated to providing for him and improving our future.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that with this support, I will be able to return to work and meet all repayment obligations.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am requesting a loan of 5,381 DM. I am a 40-year-old single man, registered as a foreign worker, and have been living in Stuttgart for four years. Previously, I worked as a cook in a local restaurant, but due to recent economic downturns, I have become unemployed.

The loan will help me cover urgent medical expenses for my dependent younger brother, who recently moved in with me. I currently have no savings or property, and my checking account is nearly depleted. However, I have always repaid my debts on time, including an earlier loan from your bank.

Despite my unemployment, I am actively searching for new work and have already attended several interviews. I do not have any other installment plans except with your bank, and I live rent-free with a friend, which helps me manage my finances responsibly.

I am trustworthy and committed to meeting my financial responsibilities. I appreciate your consideration and hope to receive your support in this challenging time.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 5,381 DM. My name is Marek Jovanovic, a 40-year-old single male, and I have resided in Berlin for four years. I am currently unemployed after the factory where I worked as an assembly line worker closed down.

I need this loan to help cover living expenses while I complete a retraining program in electronics, which I believe will greatly improve my chances of securing employment. I have no savings, bonds, or property to fall back on, and my account balance is under 200 DM. However, I have always paid back my previous credit with your bank on schedule.

I am a responsible individual with no other debts, and I live rent-free in a relative’s apartment. My only dependent is my daughter, whom I support fully. I have a telephone registered in my name and am reachable at any time.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that this loan will help me return to the workforce and fulfill my repayment obligations.

Sincerely,  
Marek Jovanovic
