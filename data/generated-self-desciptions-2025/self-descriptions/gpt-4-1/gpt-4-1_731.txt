Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,275 DM to support the expansion of my small accounting firm, Berger & Sohn. I have maintained a checking account at your bank with a steady balance exceeding 200 DM and consistent salary deposits for over three years. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, a position I have held for 2.5 years, and I have owned my residence in Augsburg for the past four years.

I am divorced, with one dependent child, and have no other guarantors or debtors. My savings account holds over 1,000 DM, and I own real estate valued at approximately 200,000 DM. Although I have two existing credits at your bank and a critical account history due to a temporary financial setback during my divorce, I have made all recent payments reliably. I also have other credit obligations at a different bank, but I have never defaulted.

This loan will be invested directly into upgrading my office equipment and expanding services, which will increase my firm's revenue and ensure timely repayments. My stable employment, property ownership, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a business loan of 1,275 DM to purchase new inventory for my electronics repair shop in Stuttgart. My name is Mehmet Kaya, and I have worked as an official in the municipal technical department for 3 years. I have held a checking account at your bank with a balance consistently above 200 DM, and my salary has been deposited there for the past year.

I am a divorced father of one, living in my own house for four years. I have no other installment plans and no co-signers on this loan. My current savings are 1,200 DM, and I also own a small rental property. While I have two outstanding credits with your bank and a critical account status due to past delays from a medical emergency, I have since stabilized my finances and have not missed a payment in over a year.

As a registered foreign worker, I am committed to building my business and reputation in Germany. This loan will help me grow my shop and secure a better future for my son and myself. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate and am grateful for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Kaya

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Jens Schneider, and I am seeking a 1,275 DM business loan to expand my landscaping business, Green Horizons. I have been employed as a skilled machinist at Siemens for the past three years and have managed my checking account at your bank with regular salary deposits and a balance above 200 DM.

I am 36 years old, divorced, and have one dependent daughter. I have lived in my own home in Frankfurt for four years, with no other installment plans or guarantors. My credit history shows some critical periods, largely due to supporting my daughter during my separation, but I have always repaid my obligations. I have two existing credits at your bank and another small loan with a different institution, all in good standing.

With over 1,000 DM in savings and ownership of valuable real estate, I am financially stable. The requested loan will be used to purchase new gardening equipment, which will directly increase my business’s earning potential. I am dedicated to fulfilling my commitments and appreciate your trust.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,  
Jens Schneider

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a 1,275 DM loan to invest in a new software system for my consulting business. My name is David Fischer, and I have been working as a civil engineering official for 1.5 years. My checking account at your bank has received my salary for over a year and has never dropped below 200 DM.

I am a divorced man with one child, residing in my own property in Nuremberg for four years. I have two ongoing credits with your bank, and another credit elsewhere, but no overdue payments or installment plans. My savings account currently holds 1,150 DM, and I own both my house and a small commercial property.

Although my credit history is marked as critical due to past financial strains during my divorce, I have rebuilt my finances and always meet my obligations. I am a registered foreign worker and have a reliable telephone connection for all correspondence.

This loan will allow me to modernize my business, improve efficiency, and increase revenue. I am confident in my ability to repay and hope you will consider my application.

Sincerely,  
David Fischer
