Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,445 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years, with a stable monthly salary directly deposited into my checking account for over a year. My current balance is consistently above 200 DM.

I have a strong credit history with your bank, having previously taken out two personal loans, both of which were repaid in full and on time. I do not have any outstanding debts or guarantors.

My current living situation is stable; I have resided at my present address for 4 years and my housing is managed through my bank. I own a small car and have no dependents. As a single man, my financial obligations are manageable, and I do not have any other installment plans except a small furniture purchase (49 DM/month).

I believe my consistent employment, reliable salary, and positive repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident I will meet all repayment obligations on time.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Klein

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,445 DM to upgrade my home electronics, specifically for a new radio and television. I have been employed as a warehouse supervisor at Bayer AG for 6 years, with my salary directly assigned to my checking account, which always maintains a balance above 200 DM.

I have previously financed a laptop through your bank and completed all payments ahead of schedule. I currently have no other debts or guarantors. My monthly installment rate is 4, and my only other ongoing payment is for a small appliance (49 DM/month).

I have lived at my current address in Leverkusen for 4 years, and I own a used Volkswagen Golf. As a single, unskilled resident worker with no dependents, my financial commitments are limited.

I am confident that my stable employment, positive repayment history, and responsible financial management qualify me as a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Wagner
