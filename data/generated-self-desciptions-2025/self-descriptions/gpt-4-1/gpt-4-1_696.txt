Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,284 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My employment is stable and provides me with a reliable monthly income.

Although I do not have a checking account at present and my savings are limited (less than 100 DM), I have a solid credit history. All of my previous loans have been repaid on time and in full. I have no outstanding debts or guarantors and have managed my finances responsibly.

I have lived at my current address for 2 years and own a small car. While I do not currently own a home, my installment obligations are manageable, and I have no other installment plans except for one small personal loan, which is being paid off regularly.

As a single male and a foreign worker, I take pride in my financial independence and responsibility. My job as a skilled employee ensures that I am able to meet my financial commitments, and I can be reached by telephone at any time to discuss this application further.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Erik Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,284 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my apartment. I am currently employed as a junior civil servant with the Berlin City Council, a position I have held for the past 4 years. My employment is permanent and offers a steady income.

Despite not having a checking account, I have maintained a good credit record, with all my previous credits paid back promptly. My savings are modest, but I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations. I have no other debts or guarantees outstanding.

I have resided at my current address for 2 years and own a used car, which I rely on for commuting. As a single male with no dependents, my living expenses are reasonable, and I have only one other installment plan that is nearly paid off.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a secure life in Germany. My employment status and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am available by phone should you require any further information.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Juan Martínez
