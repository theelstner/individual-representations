Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 652 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am 24 years old, divorced, and have a young daughter who depends on me. For the past 8 years, I have worked as a laboratory research assistant at the Munich Institute of Technology, where I am a valued member of my team. My employment is stable and I have consistently received positive performance reviews.

Although my checking account currently has a negative balance and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always repaid my previous credit on time, as confirmed by my credit history at your bank. I have been living at my current address for 4 years, and my only asset is a building society savings agreement. I do not have any other debts or installment plans.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life for myself and my daughter in Germany. I believe that with your support, I will be able to furnish my home adequately, which will contribute to our well-being and my continued productivity at work. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 and to repay the loan responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. As a foreign worker, I have worked hard to establish myself and provide a secure environment for my family. This loan will allow me to invest in the equipment I need to enhance my work-from-home productivity and support my family's needs.
