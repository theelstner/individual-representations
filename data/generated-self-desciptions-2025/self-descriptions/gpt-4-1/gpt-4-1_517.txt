Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 609 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. As a single mother, reliable transportation is essential for both my daily commute and my responsibilities toward my 10-year-old daughter.

My financial situation is challenging at present. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have a stable salary and own my home, which provides me with a secure foundation. Additionally, I hold a life insurance policy as further collateral.

Although I have two existing credits with your bank, I have always made timely payments. My credit history outside your bank is critical, but I am committed to resolving these issues and have no other installment plans. I believe my steady employment and responsible attitude make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. 

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide further documentation if required.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 609 DM to purchase a new vehicle, which is crucial for my role as a logistics coordinator at Bayer AG, where I have been employed for 6 years. My job requires flexibility and punctuality, and my current car is no longer reliable.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are minimal, I have consistently maintained my property through a building society savings agreement. My financial difficulties are temporary, and I am actively addressing them. I have one dependent, my 14-year-old son, and as a divorced woman, I manage all household expenses independently.

Despite two existing loans with your bank and a critical account elsewhere, I have always prioritized my financial obligations. I believe my stable employment, property assets, and responsible payment history make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Sabine Müller

Letter 3

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 609 DM to purchase a new car. I am a married administrative officer at the City Council of Stuttgart, with over 4 years of continuous employment. My current vehicle is no longer serviceable, and as the primary earner for my family, a new car is essential for both work and family commitments.

My current financial situation is strained, as my checking account is below zero and I have very limited savings. However, I own my home and have a building society savings agreement in place. I do not have any other installment plans, and my existing credits at your bank are being serviced regularly.

Although my credit history includes a critical account elsewhere, I have demonstrated reliability with your bank. I am committed to fulfilling all my financial obligations and believe my stable career and home ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Petra Schneider

Letter 4

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a 609 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is vital for my work as a senior nurse at the University Hospital, a position I have held for 5 years. My job requires me to be available at all hours, and public transport is not always reliable for my shifts.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM, but I am financially stable due to my permanent employment and my life insurance policy. I am separated and responsible for my 12-year-old child, so dependable transportation is a necessity.

I have two loans with your bank, both of which are in good standing. While my credit history includes a critical account elsewhere, I have no other debts and have always honored my obligations. My long-term employment and responsible financial management make me a suitable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Katrin Bauer

Letter 5

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 609 DM to purchase a new car. I am a married IT specialist employed at Siemens for 6 years. My current vehicle has become unreliable, and a new car is essential for both commuting and taking care of my 8-year-old daughter.

Although my checking account is currently in deficit and my savings are minimal, I have a secure job and own my residence. I also maintain a building society savings agreement as an additional asset. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are being paid on schedule.

My credit history includes a critical account with another institution, but I have no other installment plans or debts. My steady employment, property ownership, and history of meeting obligations make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Monika Richter
