Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €10,477 to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a senior electrical technician at Bayer AG, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is stable, though I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, and I have no property or significant assets. I have one dependent, my 10-year-old son, whom I support as a single father.

I currently live rent-free with my brother, which has allowed me to meet all my existing financial obligations, including two ongoing credits at your bank, which I have always paid on time. I have no other installment plans or guarantors. As a foreign worker, I take pride in my reliability and commitment to my work and family. The car is necessary for my daily commute to work and to transport my son to school and activities.

I believe my long-term employment, steady income, and history of fulfilling my obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to making all payments as scheduled.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Martin Kovac

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Karim, and I am applying for a €10,477 loan to purchase a used car. I have been employed as an administrative assistant at Siemens for 7 years. I am a single father to my 12-year-old daughter, and we have lived in Munich for the past 4 years.

Though I do not have a checking account or savings at your bank, I have successfully managed two existing credits with you, both of which are in good standing. My current housing situation allows me to live rent-free with relatives, which helps me keep my expenses low. I have no other installment plans or debts outside of your institution.

The car is essential for my work and family responsibilities. My stable employment, responsible financial management, and history with your bank demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for the opportunity to further discuss my application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ahmed Karim

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of €10,477 to finance the purchase of a used car. For the past 9 years, I have been employed as a certified laboratory research assistant at BASF. I am a single man, 42 years old, supporting my 8-year-old niece, and have resided at my current address for 4 years, where I am fortunate to live without paying rent.

I do not currently hold a checking or savings account with your bank, but I have two active loans with you, both of which I have serviced punctually. My financial obligations are limited, and I have no other debts or installment plans. The car is vital for my commute to work and for caring for my dependent.

I believe my stable career, clean payment history, and responsible lifestyle make me an excellent candidate for this loan. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Janusz Nowak
