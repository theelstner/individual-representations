Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 866 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik, where I have been working for the past 2 years. My income is stable, and I have always paid my existing credit at your bank on time, as my credit history will show.

Although my checking and savings accounts have low balances at the moment due to recent unexpected expenses for my child, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments. I am married, 25 years old, and have been living in my own apartment for the last two years. I also own a small piece of real estate in my home country, which gives me additional financial security.

My brother-in-law has agreed to act as guarantor for this loan. I believe my consistent payment record and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I wish to apply for a loan of 866 DM to purchase a radio and television for my family’s use. I am currently working as a kitchen helper at a local restaurant and have been employed there for nearly three years. My financial situation is modest, with my checking account currently holding under 200 DM and my savings below 100 DM, but I have always managed my obligations responsibly.

I have one previous credit with your bank, which I have paid diligently. I am 25 years old, married, and have a 3-year-old son. My wife and I have lived in our own apartment for two years, and we own a small property in Turkey.

My cousin will serve as guarantor for this loan. I have no other debts and am committed to maintaining my good credit standing. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Best regards,
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 866 DM for the purchase of a new television for my household. I have been employed as a janitor at the local hospital for just over a year, and my employment is secure. I am married, 25 years old, and support one dependent child.

My bank account currently has less than 200 DM, and my savings are minimal, as I recently had to cover medical expenses for my child. Nevertheless, I have always paid my previous credit at your institution on time, and I have no outstanding debts.

My father-in-law, a local business owner, has agreed to guarantee the loan. I own a small apartment and a plot of land, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. I hope you will see me as a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Jan Kowalski
