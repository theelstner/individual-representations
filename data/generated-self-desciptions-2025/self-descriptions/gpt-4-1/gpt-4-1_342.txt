Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am applying for an education loan of 5,743 DM to support my ongoing studies in Business Administration at the University of Frankfurt. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at a local institute for the past 10 months. Although my employment is relatively new, I have demonstrated reliability and dedication in balancing both work and academic responsibilities.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and my savings are under 100 DM due to tuition and living expenses. I do not own property and reside with my parents, who allow me to live rent-free. As a divorced mother of one, I am responsible for my child’s well-being and future, which motivates me to further my education and career prospects.

My credit history includes a critical account and some existing credits at other banks, but I have always managed my payments responsibly. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing, with no missed installments. I do not have any guarantors or additional debtors, and I do not have any other installment plans.

I am confident that with my steady employment and strong motivation to succeed, I will be able to meet the installment payments reliably. I am committed to improving my financial situation through education and hard work, and I assure you of my trustworthiness as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Fischer, and I am seeking a loan of 5,743 DM to pursue my studies in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich. I have recently started working as a junior IT specialist at a local software company, where I have been employed for the past 8 months.

My financial situation is currently limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, as I have prioritized paying for my education and caring for my young daughter. I do not own any property and have been living rent-free with my sister for the past four years.

Although my credit history shows a critical account and other existing credits outside your bank, I have always honored my financial commitments. I have two active credits with your bank, both of which are up to date and have never been in arrears.

As a married woman supporting one dependent, I am dedicated to building a better future for my family. I have no other installment plans or financial obligations beyond what is listed. I am confident that my new employment and determination will allow me to repay this loan on time.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Sabine Fischer

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,743 DM to finance my continuing education in Nursing at the University of Heidelberg. My name is Maria Schmidt, and I have been employed as a hospital administrative assistant for the past 11 months.

Due to the costs associated with my studies and supporting my child as a separated mother, my checking account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are minimal. I do not own property and have been living with my parents rent-free for four years.

I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which have been managed responsibly. My credit history includes a critical account and other credits at different banks, but I have always ensured my obligations are met. I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

I believe my commitment to my career and education, along with my consistent payment history with your bank, makes me a reliable candidate for this loan. My goal is to advance my qualifications and provide a stable future for my dependent.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Schmidt
