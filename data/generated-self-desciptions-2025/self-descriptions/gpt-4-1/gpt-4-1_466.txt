Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Schmidt, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,950 DM to expand my small electronics repair shop in Berlin. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Technische Universität Berlin for the past five years, and I have managed my finances responsibly, as demonstrated by my history of duly repaying previous credits.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a modest balance. My present residence is a small apartment above my shop, where I have lived for the past year. I own a reliable car, which I use for both personal and business purposes.

I have no dependents and no other debtors or guarantors. My steady employment, solid track record of repaying credits, and professional skills as a research assistant make me a trustworthy candidate. The loan will help me purchase new tools and expand my service offerings, leading to increased business revenue. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Viktor Schmidt
