Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schneider, and I am applying for a loan of 3,872 DM to cover urgent repairs needed for my car, which is essential for my daily life and job search. I am currently unemployed, having been laid off from my position as a scientific research assistant eight months ago due to company downsizing. I have always managed my financial obligations responsibly, as reflected in my credit history—my existing credits have been paid back on time and in full.

My current checking account balance is modest, under 200 DM, and my savings are also limited, under 100 DM, as I have been supporting my two children since my recent divorce. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my current address for four years. The car is my only significant property and is crucial for transporting my children and attending job interviews.

I am committed to making the monthly installment payments, and my previous record with your bank demonstrates my trustworthiness. I am confident that, with this loan, I will be able to stabilize my situation and return to employment soon.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am writing to request a bank loan of 3,872 DM to finance necessary repairs in my apartment, which I rent. As a foreign worker from Bulgaria, I have been living in Germany for four years. Until recently, I worked as a skilled electrical technician but lost my job due to company restructuring.

I have always paid back my previous loans on time, as shown in my credit history. My current account holds less than 200 DM, and my savings are also under 100 DM due to ongoing expenses for my family. I am divorced and responsible for supporting my son, who lives with me. I have no other loans or installment plans, aside from a small payment plan for household appliances.

Despite being unemployed, I am actively seeking new work and have several interviews lined up. The repairs are urgent to ensure the safety and comfort of my home. I have a car, which is my only property, and I am committed to making all loan payments as agreed.

I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,872 DM to carry out essential repairs on my car. My name is Sabine Müller, and I have been a resident at my current address for four years. I am married with one dependent and, until last year, I worked as an administrative officer in a local government office. Since my contract ended, I have been seeking new employment.

My financial resources are limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and less than 100 DM in savings. However, I have always managed my credit responsibly and have no outstanding debts or unpaid installments. The car is my only asset and is crucial for daily life, especially in my job search.

I am confident that I can meet the installment payments, as I have done with previous credits. I believe my history of responsible financial management makes me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
