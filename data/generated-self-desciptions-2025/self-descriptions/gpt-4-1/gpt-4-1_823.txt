Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan in the amount of 3,016 DM, which I intend to use to purchase a new television for my family. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for 2.5 years. My monthly salary has been reliably paid into my checking account for over a year, and my account always maintains a balance above 200 DM.

I have a solid credit history, having previously taken out a loan for a washing machine, which I paid back in full and on time. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I have never missed a payment. My savings are limited (under 100 DM), but I own a car, which provides additional security.

I have been living at my current residence for just over a year with my wife and our son. As a responsible family man and a skilled employee, I take my financial obligations seriously. My installment rate is manageable, and I am confident in my ability to meet the payment schedule without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Stein

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Hans Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 3,016 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my household. I have been employed as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for the past 3 years and 3 months, with my salary reliably deposited into my checking account for over a year.

My financial situation is stable. I have a checking account balance consistently above 200 DM and have previously taken out and repaid a small credit for home repairs without any issues. I currently have no other debts or financial obligations. My only property is a Volkswagen Golf, which I own outright.

I am married, with two children, and have been residing at my current address for 1 year. As a civil servant, I value trustworthiness and responsibility, both in my professional and personal life. My record with your bank is unblemished, and I have always met my commitments.

Thank you for your consideration. I hope to receive your support in improving my family's quality of life.

Kind regards,  
Hans Becker
