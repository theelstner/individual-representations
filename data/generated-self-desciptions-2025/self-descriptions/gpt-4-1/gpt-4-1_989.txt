Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,409 DM to purchase a new television set. As a 64-year-old divorced woman, I have been residing in my own home for the past four years, which I own outright. My previous employment was as a scientific research assistant, a role I held for 18 years before recently becoming unemployed.

Despite my current employment status, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back dutifully and on time. I also have a small savings account of 320 DM. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and my installment rate is manageable at 2%.

The television is important for both my personal comfort and for my dependent daughter, who lives with me. I believe my history of responsible credit management, my property ownership, and my stable living situation make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,409 DM to purchase a radio and television for my household. I am a 64-year-old married woman, originally from Hungary, and I have lived in my own home here for four years. I worked as a municipal clerk for 22 years before being laid off last year.

Although I am currently unemployed, I have consistently paid off my previous credit with your bank on time. I have 410 DM in my savings account, and I do not have any other outstanding debts. My installment rate for this loan will be 2%, which fits within my monthly budget.

I am the sole provider for my adult son, who has special needs, and this purchase will greatly improve our quality of life. My long-standing record as a reliable borrower and property owner demonstrates my commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations.

I hope you will look favorably on my application.

Kind regards,  
Erzsébet Nagy

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,409 DM to buy a new television, as my current one has stopped working. I am a 64-year-old separated woman, living in my own house for the past four years. I previously worked as an office manager for a logistics company for 15 years but am currently unemployed.

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have repaid in full and on schedule. I keep 280 DM in my savings account and have no other debts or financial obligations. My proposed installment rate is 2%.

As a foreign national from Poland, I have always prioritized financial responsibility, and my ownership of real estate is further proof of my stability. I also support my adult daughter, who lives with me. I am confident that I will meet all repayment terms for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Maria Nowak
