Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Sabine Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,251 DM to purchase essential furniture for my new apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 2 years and have maintained a steady income, with my salary being regularly deposited into my checking account for over a year. 

After my recent separation, I moved into a new residence where I have lived for the last 2 years. While I do not own the property, I do have a reliable car that serves as my main asset. My credit history is positive, as I have always repaid previous loans on time, and I currently have no other outstanding debts or co-signers.

Although my savings are limited (less than 100 DM), I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed monthly installment rate due to my stable job and responsible financial habits. I believe my track record demonstrates that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Müller
