Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,567 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television for my home. My name is Anna Müller, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 3 years. As a divorced woman living in Germany for the past year, I have worked hard to build a stable life and career.

Currently, my checking account balance is 120 DM and my savings are under 100 DM, as I have been supporting myself and my 8-year-old daughter since my separation. Despite these challenges, I have always paid back my existing credits on time, and I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors.

The television will help my daughter and me stay informed and entertained, and I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 1, as I have a steady income and a reliable job. I own a small car, which is my only significant property.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to repaying the loan on schedule and appreciate your trust in me.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am seeking a loan of 1,567 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. I am a married woman and have been working as a customs official at the Hamburg port authority for the past 2 years. My husband and I have recently moved to Germany, and I have been residing at my current address for just over a year.

Currently, my checking account holds 80 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, as we have been settling into our new life. I am proud to say that I have always paid back my previous credits on time, and I do not have any other outstanding loans or debts.

I am confident that my stable employment and regular income will allow me to meet the installment payments. I own a small car and have no other installment plans except for this one. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a trustworthy financial record in Germany.

Thank you for considering my application. I am dedicated to fulfilling all repayment obligations.

Kind regards,
Elena Petrova

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,567 DM to purchase a television and radio for my household. My name is Fatima Al-Sayed, and I have been working as a skilled mechanical engineer at Siemens for 1.5 years. I am married, with one dependent child, and we have lived at our current address for the past year.

Due to recent relocation expenses and setting up our new home, my checking and savings accounts are both below 100 DM. However, I have a perfect credit history, having always paid back my existing credits on time, and I have no other debts or guarantors.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate because of my steady employment, my commitment to financial responsibility, and my history of timely repayments. I own a small car, which is my only significant property.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Fatima Al-Sayed

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Maria Rossi, and I am a separated woman currently working as a civil service clerk at the Munich City Hall, a position I have held for 2 years. I am applying for a loan of 1,567 DM to purchase a new television and radio, as my old devices have broken and I rely on them for news and relaxation.

My current financial situation is modest, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and savings below 100 DM. Despite this, I have an excellent credit history, always repaying previous loans promptly. I have no other debts or co-signers.

I have lived at my present address for just over a year and own a small car. My stable employment and history of financial responsibility make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Maria Rossi
