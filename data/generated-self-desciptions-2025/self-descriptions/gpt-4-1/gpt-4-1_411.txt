Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 939 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account with your bank for over a year, and my account balance has never fallen below 200 DM.

My financial situation is stable. I own a small apartment in Leipzig, where I have lived with my wife and our 3-year-old son for the past 2 years. We have no other installment plans, and my only debts are existing credits at your bank and a small personal loan at another institution, which I have always repaid on time. My savings account currently holds 600 DM.

I am applying for this loan to purchase a reliable car, which is essential for my daily commute and for transporting my son. My employment is secure, and I have a steady income. I believe my history of responsible account management and property ownership makes me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber
