Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,788 DM to purchase a used car. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 5 years. My current checking and savings accounts are below 100 DM, as I have been supporting my two younger siblings since the passing of our parents. 

I have an excellent credit history, having paid back all existing credits on time, including a previous loan from your bank. I currently own my apartment and have a building society savings agreement, though these funds are tied up for the future. 

The car is essential for my daily commute and family responsibilities, as public transport does not cover my work schedule and my siblings' needs. With a steady income and no other debts or installment plans, I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments. 

I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a car loan of 4,788 DM to purchase a reliable used vehicle. I have been working as a customs official at the Hamburg harbor for the past 6 years and have lived at my current address for 3 years. I am a single, 26-year-old foreign worker with two dependents—my younger brothers, whom I support fully.

My bank account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are minimal due to recent unexpected family expenses. However, I have a flawless record of repaying previous loans, including one currently held at your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans.

Owning a car is crucial for my job and to manage household responsibilities. My stable employment, housing, and property insurance make me a reliable candidate. I kindly request your support in this matter.

Best regards,  
Ivan Kovacs

Letter 3

Dear Sirs,

I would like to request a loan of 4,788 DM to purchase a used car. I am employed as a skilled CNC machinist at Siemens AG and have held this position for 4 years. I am single, 26 years old, and responsible for two dependents—my younger siblings, who live with me.

My financial situation is currently strained, with less than 0 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, mostly due to educational expenses for my siblings. However, I have consistently repaid all previous credits on time and have no other debts or installment plans.

I own my apartment and have a life insurance policy as my only significant asset. I am committed to maintaining my good credit and am confident in my ability to meet the loan installments. The car will greatly improve our quality of life and my work attendance.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Murat Yilmaz

Letter 4

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a 4,788 DM loan to buy a used car. I am a municipal office clerk, single, 26 years old, and have been steadily employed for 6 years. I currently have two dependents—my nieces, for whom I am the legal guardian.

My financial reserves are very limited, as my checking and savings accounts are both below 100 DM, but I have always paid back my existing loans on time, including my current credit with your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans.

Owning a car is necessary for my work and family life, especially as my nieces attend schools in different parts of the city. I live in my own apartment and have a building society savings agreement for the future.

I assure you of my reliability and commitment to all financial obligations.

Kind regards,  
Andrej Novak

To Whom It May Concern,

I wish to apply for a loan of 4,788 DM to purchase a used car. I am a laboratory technician at Bayer AG, with 5 years of employment, and have been residing at my current address for 3 years.

The car is essential for commuting to work and caring for my family. I own my home and have a life insurance policy for security. I am confident in my ability to make regular payments and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
