Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,331 DM to purchase a new television set. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for just under a year and am eager to improve my living situation. My current financial status is modest, with a checking account balance of 120 DM and savings below 100 DM. However, I have a reliable track record, having previously paid back a personal credit with Sparkasse without any delays.

As a single individual, I have no dependents, and I do not have any other debts or guarantors. My current housing is a rented apartment above a local store, where I have lived for the past year. I own my car, which provides me with the flexibility to commute and manage my work responsibilities effectively.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. My employment is stable, and my commitment to financial responsibility is demonstrated by my past credit history. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment payments without issue.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,331 DM to purchase a modern radio for my new apartment. I am a newly appointed municipal clerk with the city council, having started my position eight months ago. My current account balance is 60 DM, and I have minimal savings, but I have always managed my finances carefully. My last credit, taken for a laptop, was paid off punctually.

I have no co-signers or outstanding debts, and I live alone in a small residence above a convenience store, where I have resided for just over a year. I own a secondhand car, which is my only significant asset.

Though I am early in my career, I have demonstrated reliability and am committed to maintaining a positive credit record. I have a stable income and am confident in my ability to repay the loan in the agreed installment plan.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
Jürgen Hoffmann
