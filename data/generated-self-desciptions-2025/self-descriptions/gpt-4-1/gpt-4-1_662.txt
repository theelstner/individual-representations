Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,297 DM to purchase a new television for my family. My name is Ahmed Duran, and I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich for the past 2 years. I am 23 years old, married, and have one child. We have lived at our current rented apartment for 4 years.  

My checking account has maintained a balance of over 200 DM, and my salary has been regularly assigned for more than a year. I currently have one credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and no guarantors. Although my savings are below 100 DM, I own real estate in Turkey, which further secures my financial position.  

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my steady employment, responsible credit history, and commitment to timely payments. The new television will improve my family's quality of life, especially for my young child. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Duran

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Ivan Petrov, a 23-year-old married machine operator at Siemens AG, where I have worked for 3 years. I am applying for a 1,297 DM loan to purchase a radio and television set for my family.  

I have been a customer of your bank for over a year, with regular salary deposits and a checking account balance consistently above 200 DM. I have one previous credit with your bank, which I have repaid fully and on time. My current financial obligations are limited; I have no other installment plans or debts, and my savings are under 100 DM.  

Though I rent my apartment, I own a small plot of land in my home country, Bulgaria. I am dedicated to fulfilling my financial responsibilities, as shown by my payment record. With one dependent child, this purchase would greatly benefit our home life. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and appreciate your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Bank Manager,  

I am Ali Hassan, a 23-year-old widower and father, currently employed as a customs officer at Hamburg Port for the past year and a half. I am seeking a loan of 1,297 DM to buy a radio and television for my household.  

My salary has been paid into my account at your bank for over a year, and I have always maintained a balance above 200 DM.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years and have proven my reliability as a tenant and borrower. This loan would enable me to provide entertainment and educational opportunities for my child. I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments.  

Thank you for your attention.  

Sincerely,  
Ali Hassan

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Marek Nowak, a 23-year-old married man with one child, living in Munich for 4 years. I am employed as an IT support specialist at Bosch GmbH and have been with the company for 2 years. I am requesting a loan of 1,297 DM to buy a television and radio for my family.

Best regards,
