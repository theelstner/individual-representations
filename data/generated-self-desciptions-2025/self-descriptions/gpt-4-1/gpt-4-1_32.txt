Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a business loan of 1913 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at BioMedTech GmbH, where I have worked for the past ten months. My wife and I, along with our young son, have been living in our own home in Frankfurt for the last three years. I am proud to say that I have always made timely payments on my previous credit, which was also with your bank.

The purpose of this loan is to help me start a small consulting business in the biotechnology field, leveraging my expertise and network. I have a savings account with over 1000 DM, and I also own a real estate property, which adds to my financial security. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my installment rate is well within my repayment capacity.

Given my stable employment, responsible credit history, and commitment to building a successful business, I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Berger
