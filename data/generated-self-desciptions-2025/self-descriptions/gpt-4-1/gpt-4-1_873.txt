Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Martin Fischer, and I am applying for a loan of 1,343 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I have maintained a checking account with a consistent salary assignment for over a year.

Currently, I own my home in Bremen, where I have lived for the past 4 years with my two children. Although I have a critical account status due to a previous credit with another institution, I have always made timely payments on the two existing credits I hold with your bank. My savings are modest, under 100 DM, as most of my resources have gone into supporting my dependents and maintaining my property.

I am seeking this loan as my current vehicle is no longer reliable, and a new car is essential for my daily commute and family responsibilities. As a long-standing employee with a stable income and valuable real estate, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate. I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my reliability as a candidate.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Martin Fischer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Klaus Becker. I am requesting a loan of 1,343 DM to help finance the purchase of a new car. I have worked as a senior tax clerk for the Hamburg City Council for the past 9 years, and my salary has been directly deposited into my checking account at your bank for over a year.

I have lived at my current address, a home I own, for 4 years, and I am a single father of two. While I do have a critical account and a small outstanding credit with another institution, I have always fulfilled my obligations on the two credits I hold with your bank. My savings are limited, as I prioritize supporting my children.

A reliable car is vital for my job and taking care of my family. My stable employment, property ownership, and history with your bank demonstrate my trustworthiness and ability to repay the loan within the 6-month period. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Klaus Becker

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,343 DM. My name is Thomas Richter, and I have been employed as a skilled machinist at Siemens AG for 8 years. For the past 4 years, I have lived in my own home in Stuttgart, where I reside with my two children.

Although my savings are less than 100 DM due to ongoing family expenses, my salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account at your branch for over a year. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing, and no other installment plans. My credit history is marked as critical due to a credit with another bank, but I have maintained a strong repayment record.

A new car will ensure I can continue to fulfill my work and family responsibilities. My long-term employment, property ownership, and reliability make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Richter
