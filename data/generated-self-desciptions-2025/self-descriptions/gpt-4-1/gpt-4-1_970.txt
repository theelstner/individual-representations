Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Bauer, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €7,166 to purchase a new television and radio set for my family. I am 29 years old, married, and have one child. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Dresden Institute of Technology for the past 5 years, where I have a stable and reliable income.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have maintained a positive credit history by consistently repaying my existing credit at your bank on time. I have lived at my current rented residence for 4 years, demonstrating my stability and commitment to my community. I currently have no other debts or guarantors, and I am not involved in any other installment plans.

As a dedicated employee with a life insurance policy, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. My previous credit with your bank was repaid without any issues, which I believe reflects my trustworthiness. I am confident that I will be able to manage the proposed installment rate and repay this loan as agreed.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
