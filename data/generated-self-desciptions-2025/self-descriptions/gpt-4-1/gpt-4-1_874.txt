Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 1,382 DM. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, I have been employed for the past 5 years. My work is stable and provides me with a steady income, allowing me to support my 4-year-old son as a single father.

The loan will be used to launch a small consulting business specializing in laboratory data analysis for local biotech startups. Although my checking account has a temporary negative balance due to an unexpected medical expense, I have consistently managed my finances, with a savings account currently holding 350 DM and real estate property valued at 90,000 DM in my name.

I currently have two small credits with your bank, both of which are being repaid on time. I have no guarantors or other installment plans. My only dependent is my son, and I have resided at my current address for one year, in a home I own. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my new business already has interest from three local companies.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Andreas Becker, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,382 DM to expand my freelance IT support service. I have been employed as a network administrator at Siemens AG for 6 years, and I am now looking to grow my personal business, which already serves a handful of small businesses in Munich.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to the purchase of specialized software, but I have a savings bond worth 200 DM and own a small apartment valued at 120,000 DM. I have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I support while he completes his apprenticeship.

I have two existing credits with your bank, both in good standing, and no outstanding debts elsewhere. I have lived at my current address for one year, and I am a registered foreign worker with a valid permit. My stable job, property ownership, and responsible repayment history make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration. I am eager to discuss my application further.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Becker

Dear Bank Manager,

I am submitting this letter to request a business loan of 1,382 DM to open a small mobile car detailing service in my local area. I have worked as a certified automotive technician at BMW for 4.5 years, and I am ready to take the next step in my career by starting my own venture.

My current financial situation includes a checking account balance below zero, due to a recent investment in equipment for my business. However, I have 400 DM in savings and own a small piece of real estate inherited from my father. I have one child, whom I care for alone, and we have lived in our house for one year.

My credit history includes two active loans with your bank, both of which are paid on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my steady employment ensures ongoing income. I am confident that with your support, I will be able to build a successful business and meet all repayment obligations.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Best regards,  
Tobias Klein

Letter 5

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a business loan of 1,382 DM to help launch my own graphic design studio. I am a skilled employee, currently working as a senior graphic designer at Allianz for 5 years. I have one dependent, my younger cousin, and have been residing in my own apartment for one year.

Recently, my checking account has gone below zero due to upfront costs for studio equipment, but I have 300 DM in savings and own real estate valued at 85,000 DM. I have two existing credits at your bank and no other debts.

I have maintained a steady income, am diligent with my financial commitments, and have a clear business plan with clients already interested in my services. I am confident I can meet the repayment terms and contribute positively to the local business community.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Felix Schmidt
