Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,179 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a mechanical engineering technician at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for 5 years. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by a small amount due to recent unexpected expenses related to my son's schooling.

I have previously taken out a credit at your bank, which I repaid in full and on time, demonstrating my reliability and sense of responsibility. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I own my apartment, which provides me with a stable living situation. Additionally, I hold a building society savings agreement as further proof of my commitment to financial planning.

As a single father supporting my son, it is important for me to create a comfortable and functional living environment. The requested loan will be used exclusively for this purpose. I am confident that my steady employment and clean credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

My credit history with your bank is excellent; I have paid back my previous loan without any delays. I have no other debts or installment obligations.

As a foreign worker in Germany for the last 5 years, I have always met my financial commitments. I am single with one dependent, and I reside in my own apartment, which adds to my financial stability. I believe my responsible financial behavior and stable job make me a reliable candidate for this loan.
