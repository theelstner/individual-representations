Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 2,150 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new car. I am a 24-year-old laboratory technician, divorced, and have been employed for three years at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. I have resided at my current address for two years and own my apartment.

My current financial situation is stable, though modest. My checking account balance is typically under 200 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. My monthly salary comfortably covers my living expenses and existing obligations, and I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed loan installments.

A new car is essential for my daily commute, as public transport does not adequately serve my workplace. My mother, who is a retired civil servant, has kindly agreed to act as my guarantor for this loan.

I am a responsible borrower with a clean credit history and a strong commitment to meeting my financial obligations. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Yours sincerely,
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,150 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 24-year-old married woman, working as an administrative assistant at the City Tax Office for the past two years. I have one child, and my husband, who is currently studying, will act as my guarantor.

My current account balance rarely exceeds 150 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have one active credit with your bank, which I have always repaid on time. I live in a condominium I own and have been residing there for two years.

My employment is stable, and my salary allows me to cover the proposed installment rate of 4% without difficulty. A new car is vital for transporting my child and managing our family's needs, especially since my work hours often extend into the evening when public transport is limited.

I take my financial responsibilities seriously and have demonstrated reliability in repaying previous loans. I would be grateful if you could support my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Sabine Keller

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a 2,150 DM loan to buy a new car. I am a 24-year-old separated woman, employed as a junior accountant at Siemens AG for the last 18 months. I have lived at my current address for two years and own my home.

My financial resources are limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings. I have one other loan with your bank, which I have always paid on time. My brother, who is a schoolteacher, has agreed to be my guarantor.

The car is necessary for my job, as I frequently need to travel between company sites. My income is steady, and I have no other debts apart from a small bank installment plan.

I am a reliable customer with a proven track record of honoring my financial commitments. I kindly ask you to consider my application.

Sincerely,
Elena Petrova
