Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marko Petrovic, and I am writing to apply for a loan of €11,054 to purchase a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the European Institute of Biotechnology, a position I have held for 2 years and 8 months. Reliable transportation is essential for my daily commute to our research facility, which is outside the city center and not well served by public transport.

My financial situation is stable, with a regular monthly income of €2,200. While I do not currently have a checking or savings account with your bank, I have maintained responsible credit with another institution, where I have an existing personal loan that I am repaying on schedule. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am committed to meeting all my financial obligations.

As a foreign worker in Germany, I am keen to establish a strong financial relationship with your bank. My employment is secure, and I am confident that I can manage the monthly installment rate of 4%. I am single, have no dependents, and have resided at my current address for 2 years.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide further information or documentation upon request.

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of €11,054 to finance the purchase of a used vehicle. My name is Ahmed Khan, and I am currently self-employed as an IT consultant, operating my own business for the past 3 years. Reliable transportation is critical for meeting my clients across the region, as many are not accessible by public transit.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have managed credit responsibly elsewhere, with a small business loan that is up to date. My monthly income averages €2,500, and I am prepared to meet the 4% installment rate. My residence has been stable for the last 2 years, and I have no dependents or other significant debts.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my solid track record as a self-employed professional and my commitment to honoring my financial commitments. I am eager to build a relationship with your bank and am available for an interview or to provide additional documentation at your convenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Khan
