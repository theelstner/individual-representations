Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 7,057 DM to finance the purchase of a used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, a position I have held for the past five years. My employment is stable and provides a steady income sufficient to support my family, which includes my two children.

Although my checking account balance is modest at this time (currently 120 DM), this is due to recent necessary expenses related to my children’s education. I have had a delay in paying off a previous loan, which was caused by an unexpected medical emergency last year. However, I have since resolved that situation and have been making timely payments on my existing credits at your bank.

I do not have a savings account, but I do hold a life insurance policy that demonstrates my commitment to financial planning. I have lived at my current residence for four years and pay rent regularly. As a responsible single father, I am committed to providing for my family and see the car as essential for both work and family logistics.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment plan and assure you of my reliability as a borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Klein

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 7,057 DM to purchase a used car. I work as a senior project manager for a technology consultancy, where I have been employed for six years. My job is secure, and my monthly income is stable.

Currently, my checking account balance is 180 DM, as I have recently paid for my children's school supplies. I acknowledge that I have previously experienced a delay in repaying a loan, which was due to a temporary reduction in income after a contract project was unexpectedly delayed. I have since maintained a good payment record.

I do not have a savings account, but I do have a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my foresight in planning for the future. I have lived in my current apartment for four years and have always paid my rent on time. I am single and have two dependents.

The car is essential for my work, as I frequently travel to client sites, and public transportation is not always reliable. I believe my employment stability, responsible history, and commitment to my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Berger

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 7,057 DM for the purchase of a used vehicle. I am a self-employed architect and have successfully run my own practice for the past four and a half years. My business is stable, and my earnings are consistent, allowing me to support my two children as a single parent.

My current checking account balance is 50 DM, reflecting recent investments in new equipment for my office. I did experience a delay in repaying a previous loan last year due to a late payment from a major client. Since then, I have taken steps to ensure more reliable cash flow and have kept up with my current loan obligations.

I do not have a savings account, but I have a life insurance policy as part of my long-term financial planning. I have lived at my current rental residence for four years. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I am servicing without issue.

The car is a necessity for my business, as I need to visit construction sites regularly. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment plan and maintain my financial commitments. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Jan Weber

Letter 5

Dear Banking Team,

I am seeking a loan of 7,057 DM to purchase a used car, which is essential for my work and supporting my two children. I am a highly qualified employee, working as a systems analyst at a major insurance company, where I have been employed for nearly six years. My position is stable, and I have a reliable monthly income.

My checking account currently holds 160 DM, as I have recently covered several necessary expenses. I have had a delay in repaying a previous loan, which was the result of an unexpected expense related to my children’s healthcare. Since then, I have maintained a regular payment schedule on my existing loans.

I do not have a savings account, but I possess a life insurance policy as part of my financial planning. I have lived at my current rented apartment for four years and pay my rent consistently. I have two existing loans at your bank, which I am managing responsibly.

The car will greatly improve my ability to fulfill my work duties and family obligations. I am committed to meeting the repayment schedule and am confident in my ability to do so. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,
