Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,264 EUR to support the expansion of my small catering service, “Taste of Home.” I have been working as a warehouse loader at Müller Logistics for the past eight years and have recently started my own business on the side. While my main job provides a stable income, I have not yet been able to open a checking or savings account due to my recent arrival in the country and focus on supporting my teenage son as a single parent.

Despite my limited banking history here, I have maintained a good repayment record on my existing credit with another institution. I have no other installment plans or debts and have rented my current apartment for four years. My goal is to invest in new kitchen equipment and marketing materials to attract more clients and grow my catering business.

I am a responsible, hardworking individual with a proven employment record and a strong commitment to fulfilling my obligations. I am confident that the loan will help me increase my income and establish a solid banking relationship with your institution.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, and I am seeking a loan of 1,264 EUR to purchase essential tools and inventory for my mobile phone repair business, which I recently registered. For the past seven years, I have worked as a janitor at the city hospital, demonstrating reliability and stability in my employment. As a single father, I rent an apartment where I have lived for the last four years with my daughter.

While I do not currently have a checking or savings account, I have managed my finances carefully and have an existing credit line with another bank, which I have consistently serviced on time. My current financial position does not allow for significant savings, but I am determined to improve my situation and provide a better future for my family.

I have no guarantors or other debts and am fully committed to repaying the loan within the agreed terms. This loan will enable me to grow my business, increase my earnings, and build a positive credit history with your bank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ahmed Hassan

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a business loan of 1,264 EUR to help launch my bicycle repair workshop in the local community. My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I have been employed as an unskilled construction laborer with Stein & Bau GmbH for the past 9 years. Although my current job is stable, my ambition is to become self-employed and provide for my son, whom I support as a single parent.

I have no savings or property at this time, and I rent my residence, where I have lived for four years. My credit history includes a small loan with another institution that I am repaying without issues. I do not have a checking account yet, but I am eager to establish a long-term relationship with your bank.

I am diligent, responsible, and committed to fulfilling my obligations. This loan will enable me to purchase tools and spare parts needed to get my workshop up and running, giving me a chance to increase my income and improve our quality of life.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Tomasz Nowak
