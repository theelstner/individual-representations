Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 3,485 EUR to purchase a new vehicle. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, having started this position eight months ago. My employment, while relatively recent, is stable and offers opportunities for advancement.

As a divorced father of one, reliable transportation is essential both for my commute and for my responsibilities as a parent. My current vehicle is no longer dependable, and a new car will greatly improve my daily life and work reliability. While I have existing credits from other institutions, my payment history is consistent, and I have no outstanding debts at your bank.

I have lived at my current address for four years and own my home, which demonstrates my stability and commitment. Although I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, I am eager to build a strong relationship and demonstrate my trustworthiness. My property ownership and reliable employment make me a low-risk candidate, and I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger
