Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,544 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past six years, and I am proud to have provided for my two children as a single parent. My financial situation has been challenging, especially as a foreign worker, but I have managed to maintain ownership of my home and a small piece of real estate inherited from my late uncle.

Although I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are under 100 DM, I have kept up with my existing credit obligations, even though my credit history reflects some difficulties. I have three credits with your bank, all of which I am paying regularly. My installment rate is low, and I have no other debts or installment plans elsewhere.

I am a trustworthy candidate because I have demonstrated responsibility by maintaining steady employment and supporting my dependents. This television will allow my family to stay informed and entertained, and I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jan Novak

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,544 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my residence. As a 42-year-old single father working as a maintenance worker at the local manufacturing plant for the past five years, I understand the importance of responsible financial management.

Although my savings are limited and I do not have a checking account, I own my own home and a small piece of real estate. My credit history is not perfect, but I have no outstanding debts with your bank and no other installment plans. My current obligations are manageable, and my installment rate is low.

I am applying for this loan because my children need access to news and educational programming, and our current devices are no longer functional. I am committed to repaying the loan on time, as I have done with my existing credits.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Lukas Petrović

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,544 DM for the purpose of purchasing a radio and television. As a 42-year-old single male, I have been employed as a janitor at the city hospital for the last four years. I am a foreign worker and the sole provider for my two dependents.

While I do not have significant savings or a checking account, I do own my home and a small plot of land. My credit history includes some challenges, but I have managed to keep up with my payments on three existing credits at your bank, with a low installment rate and no additional debts.

This loan will greatly improve the quality of life for my family, allowing us to stay connected with current events and entertainment. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms, given my stable employment and responsible history.

Thank you for considering my application.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,544 DM to buy a new television and radio for my home. I have been working as a night security guard at a local factory for almost seven years, and I am a single father of two children.

I have three credits at your bank, all of which I am paying off as agreed, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

Despite some difficulties in my credit history, I have always prioritized my financial obligations. I am confident that my steady job and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
