Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,224 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Munich Institute of Technology, where I have worked for the past two years. I am 30 years old, single, and have one dependent.

Although I do not have a checking account with your bank yet, I have maintained two existing credits with your institution, both of which I have managed responsibly. My financial situation is stable, with a steady monthly income and no other installment plans. I own my home, which is a property I inherited from my parents. My savings are currently below 100 DM as I have been supporting my younger brother through university.

I require the car for my daily commute to the laboratory, as public transport is not convenient from my current residence. I am committed to meeting the installment rate of 3 and have always honored my financial obligations. I believe my employment stability, property ownership, and responsible management of previous credits make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Hans Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,224 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my work as a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport. I have been in this position for three years and am a foreign worker from Poland, residing in Germany for just over a year.

My financial resources are modest, with less than 100 DM in savings, as most of my earnings go toward supporting my son. I own a small apartment in Offenbach, which provides me with stable housing. Although I do not have a checking account, I have two credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

Reliable transportation is crucial for my job, as I often work irregular hours and public transport is not always available. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my income is sufficient to meet the proposed installment rate. I am dedicated to fulfilling my financial commitments and believe my property ownership and stable employment make me a low-risk candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Marek Nowak

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,224 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. As a skilled CNC machinist at Siemens in Stuttgart, where I have been employed for just over one year, dependable transportation is vital to my work schedule.

I am a 30-year-old single father, with one child living with me. My savings are currently under 100 DM due to recent moving expenses and supporting my child. I have no other installment plans and no co-signers, but I do own my residence, a condominium I purchased last year.

While I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have two existing credits here and have always made payments on time. My employment is secure, and my property adds further stability to my financial situation. I am committed to maintaining my excellent repayment record and am confident I can manage the proposed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Thomas Weber

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 1,224 DM to buy a new car. I work as a civil engineer for a construction firm in Hamburg and have been with the company for almost two years. My current savings are less than 100 DM, as I recently used my funds to renovate my property, which I own outright.

As a single 30-year-old father, I have one dependent child. My financial obligations are limited to two credits with your bank, both of which are up to date. I do not have a checking account with your institution yet, but I am eager to establish a stronger relationship with your bank.

A new car will enable me to reach construction sites more efficiently and improve my job performance. I have no other debts or installment plans and am committed to making timely payments. My stable employment, property ownership, and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Stefan Richter

Dear Loan Department,

I am requesting a loan of 1,224 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am a foreign national working as an IT systems analyst at a software company in Berlin, where I have been employed for nearly two years. I am single, with one dependent, and am 30 years old.

My savings are currently under 100 DM, as I have recently invested in home improvements for my property, which I own. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing, and I have not taken out any additional installment plans. I do not have a checking account at your bank, but I am interested in opening one soon.

A reliable car is essential for my work, as I often travel to client sites outside the city. My stable job, property ownership, and responsible credit management demonstrate my reliability. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate and look forward to a positive response.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Ivan Petrov
