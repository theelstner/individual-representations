Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 15,857 DM from your esteemed bank. My name is Markus Weber, a 42-year-old divorced male currently residing in Frankfurt. I have been living at my present address for the past three years. Although I am currently between jobs after serving as a scientific research assistant for eight years, I am actively seeking new opportunities in my field.

I have maintained a checking account with your bank, though my current balance is slightly below zero due to recent unexpected expenses. My credit history is solid, as I have always repaid previous loans on time. My savings account holds less than 100 DM at the moment, and I do not own significant property, except for my car.

The purpose of this loan is to cover essential living expenses and professional certification courses to enhance my employability. My co-applicant, my brother Thomas Weber, is a small business owner and is committed to supporting this application. Our combined efforts ensure timely repayments.

I am confident in my ability to fulfill the installment obligations, as I have always demonstrated financial responsibility. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Dr. Stefan Müller, a 38-year-old divorced male, and I am applying for a loan of 15,857 DM. I have been a resident of Munich for the past three years. I am currently unemployed after managing my own consulting firm for five years. I am in the process of restarting my business and require financial support to bridge the gap during this transition.

Despite my current lack of employment, my credit history is impeccable, as I have paid back all previous credits with your bank on schedule. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to startup costs, and my savings are under 100 DM. I do not own real estate, but I possess a vehicle which serves as my only significant asset.

My co-applicant is my former business partner, who is also committed to the success of this venture. I am confident that my extensive management experience and my history of responsible borrowing make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Dr. Stefan Müller
