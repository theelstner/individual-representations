Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a personal loan of 1,360 DM to purchase a new television. I am a 31-year-old single male, currently employed as a certified mechanical technician at Siemens AG, where I have worked for the past three years. I have one dependent, my young son, who lives with me in my own apartment, which I acquired two years ago.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have maintained two small credits with your bank in good standing. My overall credit history includes a critical account at another institution, but I have taken active steps to resolve previous issues and have had no late payments in the past year. My income is stable, and I pay all my installments reliably.

My financial assets are limited, with less than 100 DM in savings, but I hold a life insurance policy as a form of security. I do not have any other installment plans or debts, and I am solely responsible for my finances and those of my dependent.

I am a foreign worker from Poland, fully integrated into my community, and I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations. I believe my stable employment, responsible repayment history, and commitment to my family make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,360 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. As a single, 31-year-old male residing in Germany for two years, I am employed as a laboratory research assistant at Bayer AG, where I have worked for just over two years.

I have one dependent, my younger brother, whom I support while he attends school. I own my apartment, acquired with my savings and a building society savings agreement. While my savings are currently under 100 DM, I have a life insurance policy as additional security.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have two ongoing credits with your bank and have managed all payments promptly. My credit history at another institution is marked as critical, but I have taken steps to improve my financial standing and have not defaulted on any recent obligations.

I am a reliable employee and take pride in meeting all my responsibilities. With a steady monthly income and no other installment plans, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Marek Zielinski

Dear Sir/Madam,

I wish to apply for a loan of 1,360 DM to purchase a television and radio for my home. I am a 31-year-old single male, currently working as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority, a position I have held for just over three years.

I have been living in my own apartment for two years with my daughter, whom I support as my sole dependent. While I do not have a checking account, I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing. My savings are minimal, but I do have a building society savings agreement and a life insurance policy.

My credit history includes a critical account with a previous lender, but I have consistently made timely payments on all recent credits. I do not have any other installment plans or debts.

As a foreign worker from Turkey, I am committed to building a stable life for my family in Germany. My employment is secure, and I take pride in my reliability and honesty. I hope you will consider me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
Ahmet Demir

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1,360 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my household. I am a 31-year-old single man, employed as a skilled CNC machine operator at Bosch for the past two and a half years. I live with my son in our own apartment, where we have been residents for the last two years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained two credits at your bank without any issues. My savings are limited, but I hold a life insurance policy and a building society savings agreement. My credit record at another bank was previously marked as critical, but I have since resolved those issues and have been financially stable for over a year.

I have no other installment plans or debts. My income is steady, and I am diligent in managing my financial obligations. As a foreign worker from Romania, I am focused on providing a better future for my son and contributing positively to my community.

I appreciate your consideration of my application and look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Radu Popescu

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,360 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am a 31-year-old single male, working as a certified IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom, with three years of continuous employment.

I own my apartment and have lived there for two years with my younger sister, whom I support. My financial assets are modest, with less than 100 DM in savings, but I do have a life insurance policy. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are up to date.

While my credit history elsewhere includes a critical account, I have worked hard to restore my financial reliability and have no current outstanding issues. I have no other installment plans, debts, or guarantors.

As a foreign worker from Croatia, I value stability and responsibility. My employment is secure, and I am committed to meeting all my financial commitments. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Horvat
