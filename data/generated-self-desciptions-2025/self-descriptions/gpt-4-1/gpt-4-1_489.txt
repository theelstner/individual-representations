Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,757 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past eight years. My current financial situation is stable; I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying on time without any delays. I currently have less than 100 DM in savings, which is why I am seeking this loan.

As a divorced woman supporting one dependent child, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities. My co-applicant, my adult daughter, is also employed and will support the application. We have lived at our current address for four years, and our housing is provided free of charge by the university.

Although I do not own property, I am a responsible borrower with a proven record of managing my financial obligations. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, and I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Ingrid Meyer

Letter 2 – Police Officer

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Karin Schmidt, and I am applying for a loan of 3,757 DM to purchase a new car. I am a married police officer with over seven years of service with the Wiesbaden Police Department.

My husband, who is also my co-applicant, and I have one dependent child. We have lived in our current residence for four years, and our housing is provided at no cost through the police department. As a law enforcement officer, I have a stable income and a strong sense of responsibility. I also have a registered telephone and am a German citizen.

I believe my long-term employment and positive credit history demonstrate my trustworthiness as a borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Karin Schmidt

I am writing to request a loan of 3,757 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. My name is Monika Fischer, and I am a separated administrative clerk at the Mainz City Hall, where I have been employed for the past nine years. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. Due to limited savings of less than 100 DM, I require assistance to afford a new vehicle.

As a mother of one, reliable transportation is crucial for commuting to work and supporting my child’s activities. My brother, who is my co-applicant, will also guarantee the loan. We have lived at our current address for four years, and our housing is provided by a family member free of charge.

Although I do not own property, my steady employment and responsible credit history reflect my reliability. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
