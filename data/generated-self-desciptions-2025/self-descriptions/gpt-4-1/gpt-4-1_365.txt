Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,766 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my family. I am a married 21-year-old scientific research assistant employed at the Max Planck Institute for the past two years. My wife and I have a young child, and we recently moved into a new rented apartment in Berlin. 

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a small balance and a life insurance policy. Over the past six months, I have managed my existing credit with your bank diligently, making all payments on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only dependent is my child.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life in Germany. My employment is secure, and I am confident in my ability to repay this loan as I have done previously. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,766 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new residence. I am a 21-year-old married man, working as a junior civil engineer with the Berlin City Council for the past three years. My wife and I recently welcomed our first child, and we are settling into our rented apartment, which is currently unfurnished.

I do not have a checking account, but I have consistently managed my finances through a building society savings agreement and have paid off my previous credit with your bank on schedule. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, and my financial obligations are limited to supporting my wife and child.

My stable employment, responsible credit history, and commitment to my family make me a reliable candidate. I would be grateful if you could support us as we furnish our new home.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jamal Rahman
