Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 10,366 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am currently employed as a Senior Project Manager at Siemens AG, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My financial situation is stable: I own my home, have a life insurance policy, and have always paid back my existing credits on time. Although I do not currently have a checking account, I do have an active savings account and have maintained a good credit history.

I am single, with one dependent, and have no other debts or installment plans. I have also lived at my current address for 4 years, which demonstrates my stability. The new car is essential for my daily commute and for transporting my child to school and activities. My reliable income and proven record of meeting my financial obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 10,366 DM to purchase a new car, which is vital for both my professional and personal responsibilities. I am a self-employed IT consultant, operating my own business for 9 years. My income is consistent, and I have successfully repaid all previous credits. While my savings are currently under 100 DM, I have a building society savings agreement and no outstanding debts.

I have one dependent and am the sole provider, which is why reliable transportation is crucial. I own my residence and have resided here for 4 years, reflecting my stability and commitment. I have no other installment plans, and my telephone is registered under my name for easy contact.

Given my track record and stable employment, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
