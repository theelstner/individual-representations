Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 9,857 DM to expand my small appliance repair shop, "FixItRight," located in Dresden. I have been working as a warehouse loader at a local distribution center for the past 5 years, but over the last year, I have gradually developed my own business on the side. With increasing demand, I now seek funding to purchase new equipment and hire an assistant.

My current financial situation is modest, with my checking account balance typically under 200 DM. I have 300 DM in a building society savings agreement and a life insurance policy as additional security. While I did experience a delay in paying off a previous credit, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management and have maintained timely payments on my two existing credits at your bank.

I am single, 31 years old, and support two dependents. I have lived at my current residence for 3 years and own my home. My employment is stable, and I have no other debts or installment plans. My telephone is registered in my name, and I am a registered foreign worker.

I am committed to growing my business responsibly and am confident that this loan will help me secure a better future for my family. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a business loan of 9,857 DM to open a small convenience store in Leipzig. I have been employed as a janitor at a local school for 6 years and have always dreamed of running my own business. My plan is to use the funds for initial inventory, store fixtures, and local advertising.

My current checking account rarely exceeds 150 DM, but I have managed to save 250 DM in a life insurance policy. Although I have had a delayed payment on a previous credit, I have learned from this experience and have made all subsequent payments on time. I currently have two credits with your bank, both of which are up to date.

I am 31, single, and responsible for two children. I own my home, have lived there for 3 years, and have no other debt or installment plans. My employment is steady, and my telephone is registered in my name. I am a foreign worker with proper registration.

I believe that with your support, I can create a successful business that will provide stability for my family and contribute to the community. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a business loan of 9,857 DM to expand my mobile car wash service, "CleanWheels," in Chemnitz. For the past 4 years, I have worked as a night-shift security guard, but I have also been running my own car wash service during the day. The loan will help me purchase a second van and additional cleaning equipment.

My financial resources are limited, with a checking account balance usually around 100 DM, and I have 400 DM in a building society savings agreement. I acknowledge a past delay in credit repayment, but since then, I have maintained a good payment record on my two current credits at your bank.

I am a 31-year-old single father of two, residing in my own home for the past 3 years. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans. My job is stable, and I am a registered foreign worker with a telephone in my name.

I am diligent, reliable, and dedicated to building my business. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,  
Khaled Hassan
