Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Peter Ivanov, and I am applying for a loan of 3,863 DM to expand my small grocery store in Stuttgart. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the local university for the past three years, and I have also been running my business on the side. As a single father of a six-year-old boy, I am dedicated to building a stable future for us.

Although I have had a delay in paying off a previous credit in the past, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management and have been consistent with my payments over the last 12 months. I currently have less than 100 DM in savings, but my steady employment and free housing allow me to save on living expenses and invest in my business.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only existing credit at your bank is being serviced regularly. I am confident that with this loan, I can increase my store’s inventory and attract more customers, thus ensuring timely repayment. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Peter Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed Khalil, and I am seeking a business loan of 3,863 DM to purchase new equipment for my home-based tailoring business. I have been employed as an official at the city council for almost two years, and I am proud of the skills and discipline I have developed in this role.

While I had a late payment on a previous credit, I have worked hard to rectify my credit standing and have not missed any payments since. I currently have no checking account and minimal savings, but my secure job and free accommodation allow me to focus my resources on growing my business. I live with my young daughter and am committed to providing her with a better life.

I believe my stable employment, responsible recent payment history, and clear business plan make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Ahmed Khalil

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, and I am a 32-year-old single father residing in Munich. I am applying for a loan of 3,863 DM to start a mobile phone repair service. I have been working as a skilled technician for the past 2.5 years at a reputable electronics company.

I acknowledge that I had a delay in repaying a previous credit, which was due to an unexpected medical expense for my son. Since then, I have maintained a good payment record and have taken budgeting courses to improve my financial habits. I do not own property or have significant savings, but I live rent-free with a relative, which reduces my monthly expenses.

With no other debts or installment plans, and only one existing credit at this bank, I am confident I can manage the new loan responsibly. I am determined to make my business a success and repay the loan on time. Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Victor Petrescu, and I am writing to request a loan of 3,863 DM to invest in expanding my small computer repair shop. I have been employed as a network administrator for three years, and I am also a foreign worker living in Germany with my young son.

I have experienced a delayed payment on a previous loan, but I have since taken steps to ensure my finances are managed responsibly. My savings are currently less than 100 DM, but I benefit from free housing provided by my employer, which allows me to allocate more funds toward my business.

I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, and my existing credit at your bank is up to date. I am confident in my skills and business plan, and I am committed to honoring my financial obligations. I would be grateful for your support.

Kind regards,
Victor Petrescu
