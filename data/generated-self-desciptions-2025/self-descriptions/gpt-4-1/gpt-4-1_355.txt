Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,199 DM for the purchase of a new television and radio set. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for just over two years. My monthly income is stable, and I have no outstanding debts or other financial obligations. My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to a recent unexpected medical expense for my young son, but I have always managed my finances responsibly and have no history of missed payments on any previous credits.

I am single, 28 years old, and have lived at my current rented apartment in Munich for two years. I support my son as my sole dependent. I have a modest savings account with less than 100 DM, but I also have a building society savings agreement which reflects my commitment to long-term financial planning. I have previously taken two small credits at your bank, both of which were paid back on time and in full.

I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments of 4% as proposed. My employment is secure, and my financial discipline is proven. I would be grateful if you could consider my application favorably.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Keller

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 6,199 DM loan to purchase a high-quality radio and television set for my new apartment. I have been working as a junior customs official at the Frankfurt airport for the past three years, where I have established a steady income and a reputation for reliability.

My current account is slightly overdrawn, mainly because I recently paid for my child’s kindergarten fees upfront. My savings are limited, but I am actively contributing to a life insurance plan as part of my long-term financial security. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my previous two credits with your bank were both repaid without incident.

I am 28 years old, single, and have been renting my residence for the last two years. I have one dependent, my young daughter, and no other installment plans. I am confident in my ability to make the required payments and I have a stable job with good prospects for advancement.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Thomas Stein

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,199 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television. I am employed as a certified automotive technician at BMW in Stuttgart, and I have been with the company for nearly three years. My employment is stable and my monthly salary is sufficient to comfortably cover the proposed installment rate.

I have a small savings account and a building society savings agreement, demonstrating my commitment to saving for the future. I am single, 28 years old, and have a two-year-old son who is my only dependent.

I have previously taken two credits from your bank, both of which were paid back on time. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I have lived at my current rented apartment for two years and have a registered telephone in my name. I am not a foreign worker.

Letter 4

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a loan of 6,199 DM to purchase a radio and television, which I consider essential for my professional and personal life. I am a senior administrative assistant at the Berlin City Hall, a position I have held for two and a half years. My employment is secure, and I have a steady monthly income.

At present, my checking account is slightly negative due to recent moving expenses, as I relocated to a new rented apartment two years ago. I have one dependent, my six-year-old son, and no other debts or guarantors. I have maintained a clean credit history, having taken and fully repaid two previous credits with your bank.

My savings are modest, but I have an active life insurance policy, underscoring my commitment to financial responsibility. I am 28, single, and have a registered telephone. I am confident that I can meet the proposed repayment schedule comfortably.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Kind regards,  
Andreas Weber
