Letter 1

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4151 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a single, 35-year-old male and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past two and a half years. I have a stable income and my job is secure, with opportunities for advancement.

Currently, I do not have a checking account but have maintained a savings account with a balance between 100 and 500 DM. I have resided at my current address for three years and own my home, with a building society savings agreement as part of my property assets. I am a responsible father to my young son, whom I support as my sole dependent.

I acknowledge that I have had delays in paying off credit in the past; however, I have taken steps to improve my financial management and have successfully kept up with my current installment plans for two existing credits at your bank. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans elsewhere.

I believe that with my stable employment, property assets, and commitment to financial responsibility, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The requested funds will greatly improve the quality of life for my family.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am applying for a loan of 4151 DM to purchase new equipment and furniture for my apartment. As a foreign worker from Egypt, I have been employed as a certified electrician at Siemens AG for nearly three years. My employment is steady, and I have consistently received positive performance reviews.

Although I do not have a checking account, I do maintain a modest savings account. I have resided at my current home for three years, which I own, and I have a life insurance policy as additional security. My financial situation is stable, and I have no other installment plans or debts outside of the two credits I currently hold at your bank.

I am aware that I previously had delays in paying off credit, but since then I have taken financial literacy courses and established a stricter budgeting routine. As a single father to my 7-year-old daughter, I am deeply committed to providing her with a comfortable and secure home.

I assure you of my reliability and responsibility, and I am confident that this loan will help me to further stabilize and improve our living conditions. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 4151 DM to replace outdated furniture and purchase necessary equipment for my residence. My name is Ivan Markovic, I am 35 years old, single, and have been working as a customs officer at Hamburg Port Authority for the past 1 year and 8 months. My employment is permanent, and I am committed to my career.

While I do not have a checking account, I do have a savings account with a balance close to 300 DM. I have lived in my own home for three years and have a building society savings agreement. I have no other outstanding installment plans, and I am not a guarantor for anyone.

I admit that my credit history includes a delay in repayment, but since then I have maintained regular payments on my two existing credits at your bank. I am also responsible for my 10-year-old nephew, who lives with me.

With my stable job, property assets, and improved financial habits, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms of this loan. I kindly ask you to consider my application.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Ivan Markovic

Dear Lending Department,

I am applying for a loan of 4151 DM to purchase furniture and equipment needed for my apartment. My name is Carlos Torres, a 35-year-old single male, currently employed as a quality control supervisor at BASF for 3 years. I am a foreign worker from Spain and have made Germany my home for the past three years.
