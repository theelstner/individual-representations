Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,817 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home and workspace. As a 28-year-old divorced woman with one child, I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past two years. My employment is stable, and I am committed to my professional development.

Currently, I do not have a checking account with your bank, but I maintain two small credits with you, both of which are in good standing. My overall credit history shows some past difficulties, but I have made significant progress in managing my finances. My savings are limited, as I have less than 100 DM in bonds, but I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

I have been living in my own apartment for the past two years and am dedicated to providing a comfortable environment for my child. The requested loan will help me furnish our home and acquire necessary equipment, improving our quality of life and supporting my ability to work efficiently from home when required.

I am a reliable and trustworthy candidate for this loan. My employment is secure, I have no other debts, and I am committed to repaying the installments on time. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am a married foreign worker employed as a customs officer at the Frankfurt Airport for three years. I am seeking a loan of 1,817 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my apartment, which I own and have lived in for the past two years with my husband and our young son.

Although I do not currently have a checking account with your bank, I have two existing credits here that I have managed responsibly. My financial situation is stable, with a regular monthly income from my official position, although my savings are under 100 DM at the moment.

Despite some past credit issues with another institution, I have consistently prioritized my financial obligations and have no other debts or installment plans. The requested funds will allow me to improve our living space and create a more comfortable and functional home for my family.

I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule, given my secure employment and history of responsible credit management with your bank. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Maria Kovacs

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,817 DM for the purpose of purchasing essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am a 28-year-old married woman with one dependent, and I have been employed as an administrative assistant at the City Planning Office for just over a year.

While I do not have a checking account with your institution, I have two credits here that are both up to date. My credit history includes some critical accounts elsewhere, but I have learned from these experiences and now manage my finances carefully. My savings are minimal, but I have no other installment plans or outstanding debts.

I have lived in my own apartment for the past two years, and this loan will help me provide a more comfortable environment for my family. My stable employment and regular income ensure that I can meet the monthly installment rate without difficulty.

I am a reliable and motivated candidate, and I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Julia Neumann

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am a separated foreign worker employed as a skilled laboratory technician at Bayer AG for the past three years. I am seeking a loan of 1,817 DM to purchase much-needed furniture and equipment for my home, where I live with my six-year-old daughter.

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I have two small credits here, both of which I am currently repaying on time. I have faced some financial challenges in the past, reflected in my credit history with another bank, but I have no outstanding debts now and have worked hard to improve my financial discipline.

I have lived in my own apartment for two years. My savings are currently under 100 DM, but my secure employment and responsible repayment history make me confident in my ability to meet the installment rate.

This loan will significantly improve our living conditions and allow me to continue supporting my daughter in a stable environment. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova
