Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,509 DM to purchase a new television set for my household. I am currently employed as a laboratory research assistant at Bayer AG, where I have worked for five years. My employment is stable, and I have consistently received positive performance reviews.

As a single mother, I am responsible for supporting my 4-year-old daughter. My financial situation is modest; my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 DM and 100 DM, respectively, as most of my income goes towards living expenses and supporting my child. However, I own my apartment and have a small piece of inherited real estate, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

I have an existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. I have no other installment plans, and my only debt is the current credit at your institution. My sister, a teacher, has agreed to act as guarantor for this loan.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan through regular installments, as I have done in the past. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Yours sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sofia Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 3,509 DM to upgrade my household’s radio and television equipment. I am a 25-year-old foreign national working as a customs officer at Hamburg Port, a position I have held for nearly six years. I am married and live with my husband and our 2-year-old son in an apartment we own.

While my current checking and savings accounts are low, this is due to recent renovations on our property. I have always been diligent about repaying my debts, as reflected in my flawless credit history with your bank.

My husband, who works as a civil engineer, is willing to act as my guarantor. I have only one existing credit at your bank, which is being paid back regularly. We have no other installment plans, and our only dependent is our son.

I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and strong repayment record make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,  
Sofia Petrova

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,509 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. My name is Miriam Becker, and I am a divorced 25-year-old woman residing in my own apartment for the past year with my 3-year-old daughter.

I am employed as a skilled machinist at Siemens, a position I have held for four and a half years. My financial situation is currently tight, with both my checking and savings accounts below 100 DM. However, I have consistently repaid my existing credit with your bank on time.

I have no other debts or installment plans. My mother, who is a retired nurse, has agreed to be my guarantor for this loan. I also own a small plot of land inherited from my father.

Given my stable employment, responsible credit history, and support from my guarantor, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 3,509 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. My name is Li Na, and I have been working as an administrative official at the local government office for almost six years. I am married, 25 years old, and have one dependent child.

Currently, my financial resources are limited; my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM, as I recently paid for urgent home repairs. Despite this, I have a proven record of repaying my existing credit with your bank on time and in full.

My husband, who works as a school principal, will be my guarantor for this loan. We own our home and have no other outstanding installment plans.

I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and am confident that my stable job, real estate assets, and responsible payment history make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Li Na
