Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 4,370 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past five years. As a single father of two young children, I want to provide them with educational and recreational opportunities, and a quality television will greatly help with this.  

Although I have experienced delays in repaying debts in the past, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management, including setting up automatic payments for all my bills. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are limited, but I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my employment is stable and I have no other guarantors or dependents besides my children.  

I own my own home and have an active building society savings agreement as my main property asset. I have lived at my current address for two years, and my telephone is registered under my name. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing. I believe my improved financial discipline and steady employment make me a reliable candidate for this loan, and I am committed to fulfilling all payment obligations.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Michael Hartmann, and I am seeking a loan of 4,370 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my apartment. I am a single male, 26 years old, and work as a customs official for the city of Düsseldorf, a position I have held for nearly six years. My children visit me regularly, and I wish to provide a comfortable environment for them.  

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn and I have limited savings, my monthly income is stable, and I have successfully managed two existing loans with your bank. I did experience some late payments several years ago, but I have since maintained a clean record and improved my budgeting practices.  

I have lived in my own apartment for two years and have a life insurance policy as my main financial asset. I have no co-signers and no other debts apart from those already mentioned. My telephone is in my name, and I am registered as a legal foreign worker in Germany.  

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and believe my long-term employment and commitment to financial improvement make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Michael Hartmann

To Whom It May Concern,  

My name is Daniel Ivanov, and I am writing to apply for a 4,370 DM loan to upgrade my home entertainment system, specifically for a new radio and television. I am a 26-year-old single father of two, living in my own home in Stuttgart for the past two years. I am employed as a telecommunications technician at Deutsche Telekom, a position I have held for four years.  

Although I have a history of delayed payments, I have worked hard to establish better financial habits, including setting up reminders and direct debits. My checking account is currently below zero, and my savings are less than 100 DM, but my regular income and existing life insurance policy provide financial stability.  

I have two existing loans at this bank, both of which are being repaid on time. I have no co-signers or additional debts. My telephone is registered in my name, and I am a registered foreign worker. With two young dependents, I am committed to ensuring their well-being and providing them with access to educational resources through quality media.  

I am confident that my stable employment and improved financial discipline make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Ivanov
