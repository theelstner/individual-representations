Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 454 DM to finance urgent repairs needed in my home. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, a position I have held for 8 months. My income has allowed me to maintain my financial obligations, and I have a positive credit history, having paid back all existing credits on time.

Currently, my checking account balance is 120 DM, and my savings account holds 60 DM. I have lived at my present address for one year, where I own my home. I am married and have one dependent child. I have no guarantors or other debtors, and no other installment plans. My only other credit is with your bank, which I have managed responsibly.

Although my employment is recent, I am committed to stability and reliability. My life insurance policy further demonstrates my dedication to financial planning. I assure you that I will meet the installment rate of 3 DM/month without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and appreciate your support.

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 454 DM to cover necessary repairs in my apartment. As a kitchen porter at Hotel Rheinblick for the past 10 months, I have demonstrated reliability and a strong work ethic. I have one child and am married, and we have owned our home for a year.

My current financial situation is modest: my checking account balance is 80 DM, and I have 30 DM in savings. I have no outstanding debts aside from a single credit at your bank, which I have always paid on time. My credit history is clean and demonstrates my sense of responsibility.

Despite my short employment history in Germany as a foreign worker, I have quickly adapted and shown commitment to my community. I also hold a building society savings agreement as additional security.

I am confident that I can meet the monthly installment of 3 DM and assure you of my trustworthiness as a borrower. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Ivan Markovic

I have always repaid my credits responsibly, including the one active credit I hold with your bank. I have lived in my current residence for a year, which I own. I have no guarantors or other debts, and my only financial obligation is the installment plan for this requested loan.

My life insurance policy provides additional security. Although I have been employed for less than a year, I am dedicated to my job and my family’s well-being. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan at the agreed installment rate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
