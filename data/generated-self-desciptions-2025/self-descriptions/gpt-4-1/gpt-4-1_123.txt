Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Julia Schneider, and I am applying for a loan of 3,868 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I am a divorced woman, currently residing in Munich, and have been employed as a research assistant in environmental sciences at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My work requires frequent travel between research sites, and owning a reliable car will significantly improve my efficiency and job performance.

I have maintained stable employment throughout my career, and my current monthly income is sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate of 4%. While I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I have managed my finances responsibly, despite having critical credit history due to previous academic loans. I have no other debts, and I am not supporting any dependents.

I am confident in my ability to meet the loan obligations. My commitment to my profession, stable employment, and clear financial plan make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Julia Schneider

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Gomez, a self-employed graphic designer living in Frankfurt for the past two years. I am seeking a loan of 3,868 DM to purchase a used car, which will enable me to visit clients and expand my freelance business. As a married woman, I am the primary earner, and reliable transportation is essential for my work.

I have been self-employed for 7 years, with a steady income stream from long-term contracts with local businesses. Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are limited, I have managed my expenses carefully. My previous credit issues were related to a business expansion, which has since stabilized. I have no guarantors or dependents, and all my current installment plans are up to date.

I am dedicated to fulfilling my financial commitments, and my professional reputation is important to me. I believe my strong work ethic and stable income make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Maria Gomez

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Sabine Kraus, and I am applying for a loan of 3,868 DM to purchase a used car. I am a separated woman, currently working as a senior project manager in a technology firm in Stuttgart for over 9 years. My job requires frequent travel to client sites, which is currently challenging without a personal vehicle.

Although I do not have a checking account and my savings are below 100 DM, I have managed to meet all my financial obligations. My credit history reflects a critical account due to previous education-related debt, but I have no outstanding debts and no dependents. My monthly salary comfortably covers the proposed installment rate.

I am a foreign worker with a valid work permit, and my long tenure and stable employment demonstrate my reliability. I am committed to repaying this loan and believe I am a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Kraus
