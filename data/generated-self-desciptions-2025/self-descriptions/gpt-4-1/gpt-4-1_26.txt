Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am applying for a loan of €2,069 to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment in Leipzig. I am currently employed as a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for nearly three years. My employment is stable, and I am on a permanent contract.

I recently relocated due to my job and have been living at my current address for just over a year. My wife and I are settling into the community, but we currently lack basic furnishings and equipment, which this loan will help us acquire. Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have managed my existing credit commitments responsibly with another institution.

As a skilled professional with a steady income, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment plan. I do not have any other guarantors or co-debtors, and I own a car as my main asset. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and am available by phone for any further questions.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Weber, and I am seeking a loan of €2,069 to furnish my home office and living space. I have been employed as a senior technician at Siemens AG for two years and nine months. My position provides a reliable income, and I am the primary provider for my wife and our young daughter.

We moved into our current residence a year ago, and since then, we have not been able to fully furnish our home due to other necessary expenses. I currently have an active credit with another bank, which I am servicing without issue. I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, but I am eager to begin a relationship with your institution.

I own a car, which I use for my daily commute, and I have no additional guarantors or dependents. My employment record and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate. I am reachable by phone at any time.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Markus Weber
