Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,393 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics GmbH, where I have worked for three years. My position is stable, and I receive a regular monthly income that comfortably covers my living expenses and existing financial obligations.

My financial record is solid. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been paying back punctually for the past two years. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my only dependents are my two children, aged 8 and 11. Although I do not have a checking account, I own my residence and have a life insurance policy as my primary asset.

As a foreign worker, I have always prioritized financial responsibility and transparency. I am single, have no guarantors or co-debtors, and have resided at my current address for four years. This car is essential for my commute to work and to support my family’s needs. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 1 and assure you that the loan will be repaid in full and on time.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 7,393 DM to purchase a new car, which is vital for my daily commute and for transporting my children. I have been working as a janitorial staff member at Stadtreinigung Berlin for the past two and a half years. My employment is permanent, and I have demonstrated a strong work ethic and reliability.

My financial history is clean, with one active loan at your bank that I have managed without any missed payments. I do not have a checking account, but I own my home and maintain a modest life insurance policy. I have no other loans or credit card debts.

As a single father of two, I am committed to providing stability for my family. I have lived at my current residence for four years, and I have no other financial dependents or obligations beyond my children. My status as a foreign worker has taught me the importance of financial discipline.

I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan and will continue to uphold my excellent repayment record.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ahmed Hassan
