Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,936 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am currently employed as a warehouse supervisor at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for the past 5 years. My wife and I have lived at our current address for 4 years, and we have one dependent child.

Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I have taken out two previous loans with your bank and repaid them in full and on time. I have no other outstanding debts and no guarantors.

We currently rent our home and do not have a savings account, but I do own a reliable Volkswagen Passat, which serves as our main property asset. My monthly income is stable, and I am able to meet the installment rate requested.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and would appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,
Andreas Schulze

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Hoffmann, and I am seeking a loan of 1,936 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I am employed as a delivery driver at Schmidt & Sons, a position I have held for 6 years. My wife and I have one child, and we have lived in our current apartment for 4 years.

While I do not have a savings account, I have previously borrowed from your bank and always made timely payments. I currently have no other debts or guarantors involved in this application.

My current account is temporarily overdrawn due to a recent rent increase, but my employment is stable and I own a small car, which helps with my work commute. I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment rate without issue.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Peter Hoffmann
