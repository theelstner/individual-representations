Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,743 DM to purchase a new television and radio system. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is stable, with a regular monthly income and no outstanding debts at your bank, although I do have a small credit line elsewhere. I currently do not have a checking account, but I am eager to establish a relationship with your institution.

My living situation is modest, as I have been residing at my current address for 2 years and do not own property aside from my car. I have no dependents and no co-signers or guarantors. My savings are limited, but I am confident in my ability to make the installment payments on time, as demonstrated by my consistent employment history and responsible management of previous credits.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my long-term employment, stable income, and commitment to honoring my financial obligations. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dr. Markus Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan in the amount of 2,743 DM to purchase a high-quality radio and television for my new apartment. I have been a skilled employee at Siemens AG for the past 9 years, specializing in electrical engineering. Although I have not previously held a checking account with your bank, I am interested in starting one alongside this loan.

My current financial resources are modest, with savings under 100 DM, and I do have an existing credit with another institution. However, I have always made my payments on time and have no record of defaults. I do not own real estate, but I do have a reliable car and have lived at my current residence for 2 years. My monthly income is sufficient to cover the installment rate without difficulty.

As a single professional with no dependents, I am fully able to meet my financial commitments. I hope you will consider my application favorably, as I am eager to build a relationship with your bank and demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Thomas Berger

Letter 3

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,743 DM to buy a modern television and radio set. I have been employed as a civil servant at the local tax office for the past 7 years, and my position provides me with a steady and reliable income. I do not have a checking account at your bank, nor do I have any existing credits with you, but I have managed a small credit elsewhere responsibly.

My savings are currently below 100 DM, but I own a car and have maintained my residence for 2 years. I do not have any co-signers or other debtors, and my only other installment plan is for my car, which is nearly paid off. My installment rate for this loan will be manageable with my current salary.

Given my long-term employment, stable living situation, and history of fulfilling financial obligations, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to the opportunity to work with your bank and appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,
Stefan Müller
