Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,199 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and provides a reliable monthly income.

Unfortunately, due to some unexpected medical expenses last year, my checking account is currently overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM. Despite this, I have managed to keep up with my existing credit obligations, none of which are with your bank. I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my current address in Frankfurt for 4 years.

Owning a new car is essential for my daily commute and for fulfilling work commitments that often require travel to partner institutions. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment history, responsible handling of previous credits, and commitment to meeting my financial obligations. 

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,199 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as a senior warehouse supervisor at Müller Logistics for 7 years, and my job provides a steady income that covers my monthly expenses.

Currently, my financial situation is strained due to a recent move and the cost of supporting my younger brother’s education, which has left my checking account in the negative and my savings below 100 DM. I have other credit accounts, but none with your bank, and I have always made payments on time. I have no dependents and no other debtors or guarantors.

A new car will greatly improve my ability to work overtime shifts, which often end late at night when public transport is unavailable. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments and am committed to restoring my financial stability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Jens Hoffmann

Dear Bank Manager,

I am seeking a loan of 1,199 DM to purchase a new car, which is crucial for my work as a field service technician with Siemens, a position I have held for 9 years. My job requires frequent travel to client sites, and reliable personal transportation is essential.

My current financial situation is challenging. My checking account is overdrawn due to unexpected home repair costs last winter, and my savings are minimal. However, I have a long-standing record of stable employment, no dependents, and no outstanding credits at your bank. I have lived at my current address in Munich for 4 years.

I am a responsible borrower with a consistent repayment history and no guarantors. I am confident that my stable income will allow me to meet the installment rate without issue.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Peter Meier

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,199 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my position as a municipal building inspector, a role I have held for 8 years. I am single, have no dependents, and no other debtors or guarantors.

My financial situation is currently strained due to recent unforeseen expenses related to my mother’s medical treatment.

Having a new car will allow me to perform my duties efficiently and maintain my employment stability. I am committed to repaying the loan and believe my employment history demonstrates my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Stefan Wagner
