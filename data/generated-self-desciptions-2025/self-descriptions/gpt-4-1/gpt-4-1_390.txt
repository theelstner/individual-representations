Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Stefan Bauer, and I am applying for a business loan of 2,326 DM to support the expansion of my small electronics repair shop in Düsseldorf. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Siemens for the past 3 years, which has provided me with a stable income and valuable technical skills.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, averaging around 150 DM, as most of my funds are invested in inventory and operational costs. I also have a savings account with a balance of 650 DM. While I have a critical account record due to a delayed payment on a previous credit (held at another bank), I have since resolved the issue and maintained timely payments on all obligations.

I am single, have no dependents, and have resided at my current address for 4 years. I own a car, which supports my business operations. I believe my steady employment, responsible financial management, and clear business plan make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Your support will help me purchase new diagnostic equipment, enabling me to grow my business and improve my financial standing.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,326 DM for the purpose of expanding my freelance graphic design business. My name is Markus Weber, and I have been working as a municipal official for the past 2 years, which provides me with a reliable secondary income.

My current financial situation is stable. My checking account holds around 120 DM, and I have a savings bond valued at 800 DM. I have a previous credit with another institution, which I am repaying on time after resolving an earlier critical status. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors.

I am 29 years old, single, and have lived at my current residence for 4 years. I own a car, which helps me meet clients across the city. My employment history and responsible approach to credit demonstrate my reliability. This loan will allow me to invest in advanced design software and marketing, which will significantly increase my income potential.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Markus Weber

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Thomas Richter, and I am applying for a 2,326 DM loan to open a small café. I have been a skilled employee at Deutsche Post for the last 3 years, and I also manage a modest savings account with 950 DM.

While my checking account rarely exceeds 180 DM due to regular living expenses and some prior credit obligations (currently held at another bank), I have consistently met my payment schedules since resolving a past critical account. I have no other debtors or guarantors.

I am single, 32 years old, and have been living at my current address for 4 years. I own a car, which is essential for both commuting and café supply runs. With my stable job and years of financial responsibility, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. This funding will cover essential equipment and initial stock, ensuring the café’s successful launch.

I appreciate your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Richter

Sincerely,
