Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 7,685 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for 5 years. During this time, I have developed a strong track record of reliability and dedication. I am divorced and live with my two children in rented accommodation, where I have resided for the past 4 years.

My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking and savings accounts both below 100 DM. However, I have always paid back all previous credits at your bank on time, demonstrating my commitment to meeting financial obligations. I am seeking this loan to start a small scientific consultancy, leveraging my experience and network in the research community. My sister, a public notary, has agreed to act as my guarantor.

Given my employment stability, responsible credit history, and support from a guarantor, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Claudia Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 7,685 DM to expand my home-based bakery business. I have been working as a skilled pastry chef at Café Morgenrot for the last 6 years. I am married with one dependent and have lived at my current address for 4 years.

Despite my current account and savings being below 100 DM due to reinvestments in my business, I have never defaulted on any previous loans at your bank. My husband, who is a local teacher, is willing to act as my guarantor for this loan.

With a stable job and a growing business, I am confident that this investment will allow me to increase production and improve my family’s financial situation. I am committed to regular repayments and appreciate your trust in my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Anna Becker

Letter 5

Dear Loan Department,

I wish to apply for a loan of 7,685 DM to open a language school. I have been working as a certified translator for 5 years at a reputable law firm. I am divorced, live alone, and have rented my current residence for 4 years.

Although my current and savings accounts are both below 100 DM due to recent family expenses, I have always paid back my previous loans at your bank on time. My cousin, a bank manager, will act as my guarantor.

This loan will help me fulfill my dream of running a business while providing language services to the community. I am confident that my employment record and credit history demonstrate my trustworthiness as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Elena Hoffmann
