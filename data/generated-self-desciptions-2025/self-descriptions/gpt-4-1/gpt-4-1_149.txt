Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Schneider and I am applying for a loan of 682 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute and have been working there for 5 years. As a skilled employee, my position is stable and my monthly income is consistent.

Due to my recent relocation to Germany three years ago for work, I have not yet opened a checking account at your bank, though I maintain a savings account with a balance of 320 DM. I am divorced and responsible for one child. I have some existing credit obligations at another financial institution, all of which are being managed without any defaults.

The new car is essential for my daily commute to the institute, as public transport does not align with my early work hours. I have no guarantors or co-debtors, and I am able to make the required installment payments comfortably from my salary. I reside in rented accommodation and have maintained my current address for three years.

I am committed to fulfilling my obligations and have a reliable employment record. As a foreign worker, I am eager to establish a strong financial relationship with your bank and prove my trustworthiness as a client.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Dimitrova, and I am writing to request a loan of 682 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am a married software engineer at Siemens, where I have been employed for six years. I do not currently have a checking account with your bank, but I maintain a small savings account with a balance of 250 DM.

My family and I have lived at our current address for the past three years. I have one dependent, my son, and I am the sole provider. As a foreign worker, I have taken on credit before at a different bank, and my account is currently classified as critical, but I have always prioritized making my payments on time.

The car is crucial for both my daily commute and for transporting my son to school, as we live outside the city center. I do not have any other installment plans except for my existing obligations, which are under control.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate and am committed to building a positive credit history with your institution. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Elena Dimitrova

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Gabriela Costa. I am a foreign worker from Portugal, living in Germany for the past three years. I am seeking a loan of 682 DM to buy a new car, which I need for work and family purposes.

I am a skilled employee, working as a logistics coordinator at DHL for four and a half years. I am married, with one dependent, and have managed to save 180 DM in my savings account. I have some outstanding credits at another bank due to relocation expenses, but I have always made my payments as scheduled.

Unfortunately, I do not yet have a checking account at your bank. I am currently renting an apartment and have no property, but I do own a used car, which I plan to trade in for the new one.

I believe my steady employment, responsible financial management, and commitment to my family make me a reliable candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Gabriela Costa

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Agnieszka Nowak, and I am applying for a loan of 682 DM to purchase a new car. I am a divorced mother of one, employed as an administrative officer at a local government office for the past six years.

I have no checking account at your bank, but I maintain a savings account with a balance of 410 DM. As a foreign worker, I have some outstanding credits at another financial institution, but I have always honored my installment plans.

Owning a reliable car is necessary for both my work and to support my child’s activities. I do not have any guarantors or other sources of debt. My current residence has been my home for three years, and I am renting.

With my stable employment and careful financial planning, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. I would be grateful for your support in helping me improve my family’s situation.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Agnieszka Nowak

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 682 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Sophie Laurent, and I am a married foreign worker from France, employed as a technical specialist at Bosch for the past five years.

I do not have a checking account with your bank, but I have a savings account with 390 DM. I have one dependent, my daughter, and we have lived at our current address for three years. My previous credits are with another bank, and while my account was marked as critical during a period of unemployment, I have since resumed regular payments.

A new car is essential for my job, as I often need to travel between multiple sites. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors.

I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and believe my employment history and dedication make me a trustworthy candidate. I appreciate your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Sophie Laurent
