Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,763 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for the past five years. My financial history is solid; I have previously taken a loan with your bank and repaid it on time and in full. 

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, but I do not have any other outstanding debts, nor do I have a savings account. I live in my own apartment, which I purchased two years ago, and I own real estate in the city. My co-applicant, my brother, is also gainfully employed and will serve as a guarantor.

I am a single father with one dependent and need reliable transportation for work and to care for my child. My stable employment history and responsible repayment record demonstrate my trustworthiness. I would be grateful for your support in helping me secure this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Tobias Richter

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,763 DM to finance the purchase of a new vehicle. I am a 24-year-old single male, currently working as a kitchen assistant at Restaurant Edelweiss for nearly six years. I have one child who lives with me, and I own my apartment, which I purchased with the help of my family’s real estate assets.

My bank account is slightly overdrawn, but I have always repaid my previous credit with your bank on time. I have no other debts, installment plans, or savings accounts. My cousin will act as a co-applicant to further guarantee the loan.

A reliable car is essential for my daily commute and transporting my child. My consistent employment and positive credit history make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a 3,763 DM loan to purchase a new car. I have worked as a janitor at the Bergstadt School District for four and a half years. I own my apartment and some inherited property, which I have maintained responsibly for two years.

Although my checking account is currently in the negative, I have never missed a loan payment, and my previous credit with your bank was paid back as scheduled. I do not have a savings account or other installment plans. My brother-in-law, who is financially stable, will serve as my co-applicant.

As a single parent, dependable transportation is crucial for both my job and my family responsibilities. My steady employment and history of timely repayments show that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.
