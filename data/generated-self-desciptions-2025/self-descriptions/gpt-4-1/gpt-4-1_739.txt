Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4380 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past 2 years, and my current employment is stable with a monthly income that allows me to comfortably cover my living expenses and loan repayments. 

I have been living at my current address in Frankfurt for 4 years, and I have maintained my checking account with your bank for the past 18 months. Although my account occasionally runs below zero, I have always managed to meet my financial obligations, including paying off two previous credits on time and in full. I currently do not have any outstanding debts or guarantors.

I have limited savings (currently 320 DM), but my consistent employment and reliable payment history demonstrate my commitment to financial responsibility. As a foreign worker from Poland, I am keen to further establish myself in Germany and improve my mobility and job prospects with a new car.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I can meet the monthly installments and would be grateful for your support.

Kind regards,

Krzysztof Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 4380 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I am currently employed as a kitchen assistant at Restaurant Toscana, where I have worked for nearly 3 years. My employment is stable, and I am on a permanent contract.

Over the last 18 months, I have maintained my checking account with your bank, and I have a proven track record of repaying previous credits promptly. I have no other outstanding debts and no guarantors. I have lived at my current residence in Hamburg for 4 years, which attests to my stability.

While my savings are modest (about 210 DM), I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations. My current salary allows me to cover the proposed installment rate of 3 with room to spare. As a single male and a foreign worker from Turkey, reliable transportation is essential for my job and personal development.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment terms.

Best regards,

Emre Yilmaz
