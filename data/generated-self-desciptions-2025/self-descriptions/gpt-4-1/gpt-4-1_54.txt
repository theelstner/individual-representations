Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,262 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been employed for the past 2.5 years and am currently single with no dependents. My current financial situation is stable, with all my previous credit obligations paid back in full and on time. Although I do not have a checking account or significant savings, my income is steady and sufficient to cover the installment rate of 3. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my only property is a used Volkswagen Golf. I have resided at my current address for the past 2 years.

Having access to up-to-date information and educational programming is essential for my work, and this loan will allow me to stay informed and continue my professional development. I am a responsible borrower, as evidenced by my clean credit history, and I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Johannes Becker

Letter 2 – Junior Accountant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a loan of 1,262 DM to purchase a new television and radio. I am a junior accountant at Müller & Partner Steuerberatung, where I have been employed for 3 years. I am single, have no dependents, and live alone in a rented apartment, where I have resided for 2 years. My financial situation is modest; I have less than 100 DM in savings and do not currently have a checking account. However, I have previously taken out two small credits, both of which I repaid on time and in full.

I have no guarantors or other debts, and my only asset is my car, a Ford Fiesta. My stable job and good repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The new television and radio will enable me to stay connected to the world, which is important for both my personal and professional life.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Patrick Neumann
