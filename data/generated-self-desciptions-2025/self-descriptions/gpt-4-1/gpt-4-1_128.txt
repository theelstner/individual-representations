Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 701 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am a 40-year-old married man, residing in Germany for the past two years. I work as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik and have held this position for three years. Although my job is unskilled, I am proud of my consistent employment and ability to provide for my wife and our 8-year-old son.

My current financial situation is modest. My checking and savings accounts are both below 100 DM, as most of my income goes towards living expenses and supporting my family. However, I own my home and a small plot of land, which gives me a stable foundation. I have had one previous credit with your bank, which I repaid in full and on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and no one else is responsible for my financial obligations.

I am seeking this loan so that my family can enjoy quality time together after work and school, as our current television is broken and cannot be repaired. I am trustworthy and responsible, as shown by my steady job, home ownership, and clean credit record. I would greatly appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marek Nowak, and I am writing to request a loan of 701 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television set. I am a 40-year-old widower, working as a janitor at the local hospital for the past two and a half years. I have one dependent, my daughter Anna, who is 14.

Currently, my financial resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in both my checking and savings accounts. Despite this, I own my home and a small piece of real estate. I have maintained a good credit history, having paid back my only previous loan from your bank without any issues.

I have no other debts, guarantees, or installment plans, and my monthly installment rate is manageable at 4%. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations, as demonstrated by my stable employment and responsible financial history. As a foreign worker, I strive to build a better life for my daughter and myself, and a new television would greatly improve our evenings at home.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Marek Nowak

Dear Banking Team,

I am Yusuf Demir, a 40-year-old married man and the sole provider for my wife and our 11-year-old son. I have been working as a night-shift cleaner at the city train station for nearly four years. My family and I have lived in our own home for two years now, and I am proud to say that we also own a small plot of land.

My financial situation is tight at the moment, with my checking and savings accounts both under 100 DM. Nevertheless, I have always managed my obligations responsibly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which has been paid back punctually, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am applying for a 701 DM loan to purchase a radio and television for my family. Our old radio recently broke, and as we do not have a telephone, these are our main sources of information and entertainment. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as I have demonstrated reliability in my employment and financial commitments.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Yusuf Demir

To whom it may concern,

My name is Aleksandr Vasiliev, and I am applying for a loan of 701 DM to buy a new television and radio. I am a 40-year-old widower, working as a porter at a local hotel for just over three years. I have one dependent, my 10-year-old son, and we live together in the house I own.

My current financial situation is not strong, as I have less than 100 DM in my checking and savings accounts. However, I have a solid credit history, having paid back my existing credit with your bank on schedule. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

I am responsible and committed to repaying this loan. The television and radio are important for my son's education and for our connection to the world, especially since we do not have a telephone. I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and positive credit history make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Aleksandr Vasiliev

Dear Loan Manager,

My name is Tomasz Zielinski, and I am requesting a loan of 701 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my family. I am a 40-year-old married man, and I have worked as a construction laborer for the past three years. My wife and I have a 12-year-old daughter, and we have owned our own home for two years.

Due to ongoing expenses, my checking and savings accounts are currently below 100 DM. Despite this, I have always managed to pay my bills and have fully repaid my only previous loan with your bank. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a better life for my family in Germany. We do not have a telephone, so a radio and television are essential for staying informed and connected. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, and I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Tomasz Zielinski
