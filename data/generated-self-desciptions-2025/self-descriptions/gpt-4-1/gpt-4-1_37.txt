Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,746 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I have recently moved into my own apartment and, as a single father of a young son, I want to ensure we have access to quality information and entertainment at home.

Currently, I am employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistik GmbH, a position I have held for the past 9 months. My monthly income is stable, and I am committed to improving my family's living conditions. My checking account balance is below 200 DM, and my savings are limited, but I am careful with my finances and always prioritize my obligations. Although I have two existing credits with your bank and one small credit elsewhere, I have never missed a payment.

I own my apartment, which gives me a stable living situation, and I also have a life insurance policy as additional security. My residence in this city has been steady for the past two years. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan because I am responsible, have a clear repayment plan, and am motivated to provide a better home environment for my dependent. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 4,746 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. As a foreign worker from Poland, I have been living in Germany for two years and have recently secured a permanent position as a hotel porter at Hotel Adler, where I have worked for 10 months.

Although my current account balance is modest and my savings are under 100 DM, I have always managed my finances responsibly despite supporting my 6-year-old daughter. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I pay regularly, and I do not have any other installment plans. My credit history includes a critical account due to a late payment in the past, but I have since maintained a good record.

I live in my own apartment and have a building society savings agreement as further financial backing. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, and I am dedicated to honoring my commitments. Please consider my application as I continue to build a stable life for my family in Germany.

Kind regards,
Piotr Nowak

To whom it may concern,

I am applying for a loan of 4,746 DM to purchase a new television and radio system. As a single man supporting my younger brother, I want to improve our home environment and provide access to educational and cultural programming.

I am 25 years old and have worked as a construction laborer for the past 11 months. My employment is stable and my income is sufficient to cover my living costs and loan repayments. My checking account currently holds less than 200 DM, and my savings are minimal, but I have always prioritized my financial obligations.

Although I have two active credits with your bank and a small loan from another institution, I have never defaulted on a payment. I own my apartment and have a life insurance policy for added security. My residence in this city has been consistent for two years. I am a reliable and hardworking individual, and I am committed to fulfilling all my financial responsibilities.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Mihail Stojanovic

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 4,746 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am a 25-year-old single man living with my 3-year-old son. As an unskilled resident worker at the local recycling plant, where I have been employed for 7 months, I am working hard to provide a better future for my family.

My current account balance is under 200 DM and I have less than 100 DM in savings, but I am diligent in managing my expenses. I have two small credits with your bank, both in good standing, and a separate credit at another institution. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors, but I do have a building society savings agreement as a form of security.

I own my apartment and have lived in this city for two years. My record of regular payments and stable employment demonstrates my reliability. I am confident that I can meet the installment payments and respectfully ask for your support in granting this loan.

Best regards,
Andrei Popescu
