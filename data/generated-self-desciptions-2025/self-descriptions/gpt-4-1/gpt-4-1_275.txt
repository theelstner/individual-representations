Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 3,060 DM, which I intend to use for the purchase of a new television and radio system for my home. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been steadily employed for the past 5 years. My current financial situation is stable, although my checking and savings accounts have limited balances, as most of my funds are allocated towards supporting my young daughter and maintaining my property.

I have a proven record of responsible borrowing, with two existing credits at your bank that I have always repaid on time. I own my home and have real estate assets, which further reinforce my financial stability. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my installment rate is manageable within my monthly budget.

As a single parent and a foreign worker, I am committed to building a secure future for my family. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms of this loan and would be grateful for your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 3,060 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my residence. I have been employed as a mechanical engineer at Siemens AG for the past 6 years, and my employment is secure and well-compensated. I have maintained my current residence for 4 years and own the property outright.

Although my checking and savings balances are currently below 200 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have always managed my finances responsibly. My credit history with your bank is excellent; I have two existing credits, both of which are being repaid punctually.

As a single man supporting my younger brother, I am careful with my finances and have no other debts or installment obligations. I believe my consistent employment and ownership of real estate make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Mihail Ivanov

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 3,060 DM to upgrade the radio and television in my home. I have worked as a customs officer for 4 years and have a stable income. While my current checking account balance is under 200 DM and my savings below 100 DM, this is due to recent necessary expenses for my dependent son.

My credit history is strong: I have two loans with your bank, both serviced without delay. I own my residence and have real estate holdings, and I do not have any other outstanding installment plans or debts.

As a single foreign worker, I take my financial obligations seriously and am committed to timely repayment. I hope you will view my consistent employment and responsible credit history as strong reasons to approve my request.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Andrei Popescu
