Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Alexei Ivanov, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,337 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I am a 36-year-old single father with one dependent child, and I have been employed as a mechanical engineering technician at Siemens AG for the past 8 years. I currently own my own flat, where I have lived for the last 4 years, and I also own a small piece of real estate outside the city.

Although my checking account balance is modest (currently 120 DM), and my savings are below 100 DM, I have consistently met all my financial obligations. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am repaying on schedule. While I have had some past credit difficulties with another institution, I have since stabilized my finances and maintained a steady record of repayment.

I am requesting this loan because my current television and radio are outdated, and I would like to provide my son with access to modern educational and entertainment resources. My employment is secure, and my monthly income comfortably covers my living expenses and installment payments. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and I do not have any additional installment plans.

I am a reliable and responsible individual, as demonstrated by my stable job history and property ownership. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan within the agreed 36-month period, and I would greatly appreciate your consideration.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,  
Alexei Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Mehmet Kaya, and I am applying for a credit of 2,337 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. I am a 36-year-old skilled employee, working as a senior warehouse supervisor at Bayer Leverkusen for the past 7 years. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and own the apartment, as well as a small parcel of real estate inherited from my family.

Currently, my checking account balance is 80 DM, and my savings are limited to 60 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank, which is being serviced without issue. In the past, I had a critical account with another bank, but I have since resolved all outstanding issues and maintained an excellent payment record.

As a foreign worker in Germany, I have worked hard to build a stable life for myself and my 8-year-old daughter, who is my only dependent. I have no other debts, installment plans, or financial obligations. My monthly salary is more than sufficient to meet my needs and cover the requested loan installments.

I am committed to honoring my financial obligations and believe my history of steady employment, property ownership, and responsible credit management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Mehmet Kaya
