Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Novak, and I am applying for a car loan in the amount of 3,079 euros. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have worked for the past 3 years. My son and I have been living in our own apartment for 4 years, and I am proud to own a small real estate property in the city.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have consistently paid back my existing credit on time, demonstrating my reliability and sense of responsibility. I do not have any other debts or installment plans, and I am not supported by any guarantors.

The purpose of this loan is to purchase a new car, which is essential for commuting to work and transporting my son to school and extracurricular activities. As a foreign worker, reliable transportation is crucial for maintaining my employment and supporting my family.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4, as my monthly salary is stable and sufficient. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak
