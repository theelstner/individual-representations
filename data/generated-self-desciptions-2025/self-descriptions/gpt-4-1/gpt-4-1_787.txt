Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,941 DM to support the expansion of my small electronics repair shop in Leipzig. I have maintained my current checking account with your bank for the past two years, and I also have a building society savings agreement with a balance exceeding 1,000 DM.

I have been steadily employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for three years. My employment is stable, and I have always met my financial obligations. My previous credit with your bank was paid off in full and on time. I currently have no other installment plans or debts, and I am the sole earner supporting my 8-year-old son.

I own my apartment and have resided at my current address for the past two years. My installment payments have always been punctual, and I am confident I can manage the proposed rate. I am a registered foreign worker and have always maintained a transparent relationship with your bank.

This loan will allow me to purchase additional tools and inventory, enabling my business to grow and better serve my customers. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1,941 DM to launch a mobile food cart business specializing in Turkish street food. My current account balance is under 200 DM, but I have been disciplined in saving and currently hold a life insurance policy valued at over 1,000 DM.

I have been working as a janitorial staff member at City Hospital for nearly two years and have a consistent income. My previous credit with your bank was paid back in full and on schedule. I am single, with a 6-year-old daughter who lives with me.

I have lived in my own apartment for the past two years and have no other debts or installment plans. I have only one existing credit with your bank, which I managed responsibly. I am a registered foreign worker and always keep open lines of communication.

This loan will help me purchase a food cart and initial supplies, enabling me to become self-employed and provide a better life for my daughter. I am committed to repaying the loan as agreed. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ali Demir

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a business loan of 1,941 DM for the purpose of opening a small bicycle repair shop. I have been employed as an unskilled laborer at the local recycling center for two and a half years. Despite a modest checking account balance, I have managed to save over 1,200 DM in my building society savings agreement.

I have a solid credit history, having repaid my prior credit on time. I am single and support my 10-year-old son. I own my home and have lived there for two years, with no other debts or installment plans.

My employment provides a stable income, and I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate. I am a registered foreign worker and have always maintained honesty and transparency with your bank.

This loan will enable me to purchase essential tools and equipment for my new venture. I am eager to create a stable, independent future for myself and my son. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Piotr Zielinski
