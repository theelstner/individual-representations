Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2028 DM to purchase a used car. My name is Thomas Berger, and I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 3 years. I am currently single, have no dependents, and have been living at my current residence for 2 years.

My financial situation is stable. I have a checking account with a small balance (currently 120 DM) and no savings account. I have no other outstanding debts or obligations, and my credit history is excellent, having paid back all previous credits on time. I have no guarantors or co-signers, as I am able to meet my financial responsibilities independently.

The car is essential for my daily commute to work and for conducting field research. My monthly installment rate is manageable within my salary, and I have always prioritized meeting my financial commitments. I believe my consistent employment and responsible payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Michael Krause, and I am seeking a loan of 2028 DM to purchase a reliable used car. I am employed as a mechanical technician at Siemens AG, where I have worked for 2 years. I am single and reside alone, having lived at my current address for 2 years.

Although my checking account balance is currently 80 DM and I do not have a savings account, I have a strong record of financial responsibility. I have successfully repaid previous loans on schedule, and I have no other debts or financial obligations at this time.

Owning a car will significantly improve my ability to travel to work and fulfill overtime shifts, which are common in my position. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate of 4% per month due to my stable income and prudent spending habits. I trust you will find my application in good order and consider me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,  
Michael Krause
