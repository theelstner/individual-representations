Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Schreiber, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,860 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 35-year-old single male, and although I am currently between jobs, I have worked for eight years as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute before my recent contract ended. I am actively seeking new employment, and I have already had several promising interviews in my field.

My current financial situation is modest: my checking account holds 120 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I do not have any other debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my present address for two years. I own a small car, which I intend to trade in for a more reliable used vehicle to facilitate my job search and future employment. My credit history includes a critical account from a previous bank, but I have since settled those obligations and learned valuable lessons in financial management.

I am a responsible and highly qualified individual, and I am confident that with stable transportation, I will quickly secure new employment. I assure you of my commitment to meeting all repayment obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Markus Schreiber

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Daniel Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 1,860 DM to purchase a used car. I am a 40-year-old single male, currently residing in Munich for the past two years. I have been self-employed as a freelance IT consultant for five years, but due to a recent downturn in contracts, I am temporarily unemployed. Despite this, I am in active negotiations with two clients for upcoming projects.

At present, my checking account stands at 80 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM. I have no outstanding loans at your bank and no other guarantors. My previous credit account at another bank was marked critical due to late payments during the pandemic, but I have since resolved all issues and maintained good standing.

Owning a reliable car is essential for my consulting work, as it enables me to travel to client sites. I am confident that, with this loan, I will restore my business to its previous success and fulfill my repayment obligations. My background as a management consultant demonstrates my reliability and commitment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Daniel Petrov

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Ahmed Khalil, a 29-year-old single male and a foreign worker in Germany. I am writing to request a loan of 1,860 DM to purchase a used car, which is vital for my job search and daily activities. I recently lost my position as a logistics coordinator after my company downsized, but I have eight years of experience in supply chain management and am confident I will secure new employment soon.

Currently, I have 150 DM in my checking account and less than 100 DM in savings. I have no other debts at this bank and no guarantors. My previous credit with another institution was classified as critical due to delays in payment when I first arrived in Germany, but I have since cleared all dues.

Having stable transportation will significantly improve my chances of finding work quickly. I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on time, drawing on my professional background and responsible financial behavior since resolving my earlier credit issues.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khalil

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Stefan Novak, and I am a 37-year-old single male, recently unemployed after serving as an officer in the German military for ten years. I am seeking a loan of 1,860 DM to buy a used car, which I need to commute to job interviews and training courses as I transition to civilian employment.

My checking account currently holds 60 DM, and I have under 100 DM in savings. I have maintained my own credit account at your bank, with no outstanding debts or guarantors. While my credit history includes a critical account at a previous institution, all dues have been paid and I have since managed my finances responsibly.

I have lived at my current address for two years and own a car, though it is no longer reliable. I believe my disciplined background and commitment to fulfilling my obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Stefan Novak
