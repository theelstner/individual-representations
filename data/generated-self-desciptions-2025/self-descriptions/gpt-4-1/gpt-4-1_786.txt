Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,468 DM to purchase a used car. As a former Chief Financial Officer with 15 years of experience in the manufacturing sector, I have always managed my finances responsibly, as reflected in my clean credit history and timely repayment of previous loans. Although I am currently between jobs due to recent company restructuring, I am actively seeking new management opportunities.

My current financial situation is stable thanks to my owned real estate property and steady rental income, despite having no active savings account at the moment. My monthly commitments are minimal, and I have only one existing credit with your bank, which has always been serviced punctually.

Owning a reliable car is essential for me to attend job interviews and maintain my responsibilities as a father to my dependent son. I believe my track record, property ownership, and commitment to financial obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Karl Becker

Letter 2

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a loan of 6,468 DM to purchase a used vehicle, which will greatly assist me in securing new employment. After a successful career as a self-employed legal consultant for over 20 years, I am currently in transition following my recent divorce. I am actively pursuing new clients and business opportunities.

Although my checking account balance is modest at present, I have no outstanding debts apart from a single existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid on time. I own my home and a small commercial property, providing me with a measure of financial stability.

A dependable car is vital for my work as I need to travel to meet clients and attend court appointments. I am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations, as my financial history and property ownership demonstrate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Neumann

Letter 3

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 6,468 DM to buy a used car, which I need to support my ongoing job search and family responsibilities. I am a 60-year-old retired army officer, recently separated, with one dependent son living with me. Though I am currently unemployed, my pension and rental income from my real estate ensure I meet my monthly obligations.

My credit history is excellent, with all previous credits paid back promptly. I have one current credit with your bank, always serviced on time. My checking account balance is low, but I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors.

A car will enable me to seek new opportunities and better care for my son. I am confident that my responsible financial behavior and asset ownership make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Jürgen Schmitt

Letter 4

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,468 DM for the purchase of a used car. I am a 60-year-old divorced male with a background as a senior project manager in the construction industry for the last 12 years. After my recent layoff due to company downsizing, I am actively searching for new positions in my field.

I have always managed my finances prudently, as shown by my positive credit history and timely repayment of my existing credit with your bank. I own my house and a small plot of land, which provides me with some financial security.

Currently, my checking account is modest, and I do not have a savings account, but I have no other debts or financial commitments. Reliable transportation is crucial for attending interviews and fulfilling my parental duties.

I am committed to repaying this loan and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Frank Müller
