Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a bank loan in the amount of 2,146 DM for the purchase of essential furniture and equipment. As a scientific research assistant at the local university, I have been employed for the past 10 months. I am currently renting an apartment where I reside with my young daughter. Since my recent separation, I have been working diligently to establish a stable environment for us.

Although I do not currently have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained two small credits here, which I have managed responsibly. My credit history reflects some challenges due to prior commitments at another institution, but I am committed to improving my financial standing. My savings are limited, but I do own a small piece of real estate inherited from my family, which underscores my long-term stability.

This loan will allow me to furnish our home and purchase the necessary equipment to support my work and my daughter's needs. As a skilled employee, I have a steady income and no other installment plans. I have always honored my financial obligations and am prepared to provide any additional information you may require.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 2,146 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I recently moved to this city for a position as an administrative assistant with the municipal government, where I have been employed for 8 months. I am married and have one child, and we are currently renting our home.

I have a critical account at another bank due to a previous business venture, but I have taken steps to manage my debts responsibly. I do not have a checking account with your bank yet, but I have two existing small credits that I am repaying on time. My current savings are minimal, but I do own a small property in my home country, which provides me with a measure of security.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life for my family in Germany. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors, but my employment is secure and my record shows my reliability. This loan will help us settle in and create a comfortable home.

Thank you for your consideration. I am happy to provide further details if needed.

Best regards,  
Maria Petrova

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,146 DM for the purpose of purchasing furniture and equipment for my rented apartment. I am employed as a legal clerk with a reputable firm, a position I have held for the past 9 months. I am a divorced mother of one, and I have resided at my current address for three years.

Although my credit history includes a critical account at a different bank, I have managed two credits with your institution responsibly. My financial resources are limited, as my savings are currently less than 100 DM, but I do own a share of real estate in my hometown. I have no other installment plans or debts, and I do not have a checking account with your bank yet.

I am confident in my ability to meet the loan installment rate, given my stable employment and responsible payment record. I am committed to providing a secure and stable environment for my child, and this loan will help us achieve that goal.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,  
Elena Schmidt
