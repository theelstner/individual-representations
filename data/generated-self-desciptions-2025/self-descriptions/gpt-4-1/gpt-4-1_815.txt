Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,051 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances for my residence. I am a 34-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have been employed for three years. Over the past eight years, I have maintained a strong credit history, having paid off all previous credits on time. 

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are below 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, as I have recently invested in furthering my education and professional certifications. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors, and I live alone in my own apartment, where I have resided for four years. My only property is my car, which I use for commuting to work and research sites.

Given my stable employment, my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations, and my responsible credit history, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The new appliances will significantly improve my quality of life and support my demanding work schedule. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber

Letter 2 – IT Systems Analyst

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,051 DM to replace several domestic appliances that have recently broken down in my apartment. I am a 29-year-old single male, employed as an IT systems analyst at Siemens AG for the past two years. My employment is stable and my career is progressing well.

While my checking and savings accounts are currently below 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, this is due to a recent move and related expenses. Importantly, I have always paid back previous credits on time, as reflected in my excellent credit history. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, aside from a car loan, which is up to date.

Having lived at my current address for four years and being a responsible employee, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I look forward to your positive response and assure you of my reliability.

Best regards,  
Thomas Klein

As a public servant, I value integrity and accountability. I am confident that my stable employment, reliable credit history, and commitment to my duties make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Letter 5 – Civil Engineer

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,051 DM to upgrade the domestic appliances in my apartment. I am a 32-year-old civil engineer, single, and have been employed at Hochtief for three years. My current financial situation is tight, with less than 0 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, primarily due to recent professional training costs.

With my stable employment, excellent repayment record, and responsible financial management, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,
