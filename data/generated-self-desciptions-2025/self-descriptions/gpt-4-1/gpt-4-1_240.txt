Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan of 1,291 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I have been working as a laboratory research assistant at the Munich Institute of Technology for the past three years, and I am currently a resident of Augsburg, where I have lived for the last two years. I am a divorced mother with one dependent child.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have a life insurance policy and a building society savings agreement. My existing credits are with other institutions, but I have always ensured timely payments. My current financial situation is stable: my regular employment provides a steady income, and my housing is my own, which reduces my monthly expenses. 

I am committed to meeting my financial obligations, as shown by my responsible management of existing credits. I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan and am prepared to provide any additional documentation you may require.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs
