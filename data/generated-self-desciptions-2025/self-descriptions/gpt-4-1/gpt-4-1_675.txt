Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,080 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 2 years. My employment is stable, and I have a monthly net income that comfortably covers my living expenses and debt obligations.

My current financial situation is modest. I have a savings account with a balance of 650 DM, and I maintain other credits with institutions outside your bank, which are being serviced regularly. My family consists of my wife and our young son, and we have been residing at our current address for the past 2 years. Although I do not own a house, I do have a small car that is fully paid off.

The new car is essential for my daily commute and family needs, especially as public transportation is limited in our area. I have always been diligent in meeting my financial commitments, and my employment as a skilled professional ensures a steady income. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan according to the agreed terms.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Feldmann

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a car loan of 2,080 DM. I am a married man, working as a certified electrician at Siemens AG for the past 3 years. My current residence has been home to my wife and me for 2 years. 

Although I do not have a checking account at your bank, I do have a savings account with a balance of 720 DM and have managed other credit obligations responsibly with other banks. My monthly installment rate is well within my budget, and I have no other co-debtors or guarantors.

The purpose of this loan is to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute and for supporting my family’s needs. I have always prioritized my financial responsibilities and have a stable job with a reputable employer. My credit history reflects my commitment to honoring my debts.

I assure you of my reliability and look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate my creditworthiness through this loan.

Kind regards,

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 2,080 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I am a married postal official, serving at the Munich Central Post Office for nearly 2.5 years. My wife and I have lived at our current address for 2 years, and I currently have no property or housing assets.

My financial standing includes a savings account with 900 DM and a fully paid older vehicle. While I have existing credits with another financial institution, I have never missed a payment, and I maintain a clean record with them.

A new car is vital for my work, which often requires flexible hours and travel. My steady employment and history of responsible borrowing make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to repaying the loan in full and on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Johann Schuster

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,080 DM to purchase a new car. I am a married man and have worked as a senior laboratory technician at Bayer AG for 1 year and 8 months. My wife and I have been living at our current apartment for 2 years. 

Currently, I do not have a checking account with your bank, but I have a savings account with 540 DM. I am servicing another credit with a different bank and have always made timely payments. We do not own property, but we have a small, older car.

With the need to upgrade our vehicle for both work and family use, this loan is essential. My stable employment and history of responsible debt management assure you of my ability to meet repayment obligations.
