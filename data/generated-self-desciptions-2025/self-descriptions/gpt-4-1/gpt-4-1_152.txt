Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Lehmann, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1346 DM to purchase a new television set. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and my employment is stable and ongoing. I am currently single, living rent-free with a family member, and I support two dependents.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance of 350 DM. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have been repaying regularly and without delay. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my credit history is spotless.

This loan will allow me to replace my old television, which is no longer functional, and ensure that my children and I can continue to enjoy educational and entertainment programs together. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations, as demonstrated by my previous credit history.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information if needed.

Sincerely,
Markus Lehmann
