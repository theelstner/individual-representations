Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Michael Berger, and I am applying for an educational loan of 7,476 DM to pursue an Executive MBA program at Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. I have been employed as a Senior Research Analyst at Deutsche Bank for the past 5 years, where I have developed a reputation for diligence and reliability.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts have limited funds, as I have been supporting my teenage son and covering living expenses. Despite this, I have maintained an excellent credit record, including successfully repaying a previous loan with your bank. I have no outstanding debts or installment plans.

I am confident that furthering my education will allow me to advance into a management position, increasing my earning potential. My stable employment, proven track record, and commitment to professional growth make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Michael Berger

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Jonas Richter, a 50-year-old single father, currently working as a project manager at Siemens AG for the past 6 years. I am seeking a loan of 7,476 DM to enroll in a Data Science certification course at Technische Universität München, which will help me remain competitive in my field.
