Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs, and I am applying for a loan to purchase a reliable used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Dresden, a position I have held for the past 10 months. As a divorced mother of a 5-year-old daughter, dependable transportation is crucial for my daily commute to work and for my child’s needs.

I have maintained a good credit record, having previously taken out a small loan with your bank and paid it back in full and on time. While I do not have a checking or savings account, I do own a small apartment in my home country, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. I have lived at my current address for four years and am diligent about meeting all my rent and utility payments.

This car will significantly improve my family’s quality of life and my ability to perform at work. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment payments. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrova, and I am writing to request a loan of 2,901 euros to purchase a used car. I am a married foreign worker, currently employed as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for the past 8 months. My family and I have been living at our current residence for four years, and we rent our apartment.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have successfully repaid all previous credits with your bank. I have no other debts or installment plans. Owning a car will allow me to better fulfill my job duties, especially as my shifts often require early morning or late-night travel when public transport is unavailable.

I am a responsible borrower with a steady income, and I own a small property back in Bulgaria. I kindly ask you to consider my application, as this car will greatly benefit my family and my work. Thank you for your time.

Best regards,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Sofia Garcia, and I am seeking a loan to purchase a used car. I have been working as an administrative officer at a logistics company in Munich for the past 10 months. As a separated woman with a 7-year-old son, reliable transportation is essential for both my job and family responsibilities.

I have a strong credit history with your bank, having paid back my previous loan without any issues. Although I do not currently hold a checking or savings account, I do own a small real estate property in Spain. I have rented my present apartment for four years and have always paid my rent on time.

With no other debts or installment plans, I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly payments. This car will help me maintain my job and provide for my son. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Sofia Garcia

I am Anna Novak, a married foreign worker living in Frankfurt. I am employed as a skilled laboratory technician at a local hospital, a position I started 10 months ago. I am applying for a loan of 2,901 euros to buy a used car, which is necessary for my daily commute and to take care of my 3-year-old child.

While I do not have a checking account or savings, I do own a small piece of land in my home country, Poland. I have resided at my current rented apartment for four years and have no other loans or financial obligations.

I am diligent and responsible, and this car will help me continue providing for my family and fulfilling my work duties. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Irina Dimitrova, and I am applying for a loan to purchase a used vehicle. I am a divorced mother of one, currently working as a skilled employee in a manufacturing firm for the past 10 months. I have lived at my current rented residence for four years and have always managed my finances responsibly.

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying diligently and on time. I do not have a checking or savings account, but I do own a small apartment in Romania. I have no other debts or installment plans.

A car is vital for my work and my child’s schooling, as public transport is unreliable in my area. I am confident that I can manage the installment payments, and I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling my obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Irina Dimitrova
