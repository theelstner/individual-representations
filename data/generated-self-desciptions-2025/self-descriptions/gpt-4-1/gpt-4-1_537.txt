Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 2,319 DM to finance my continuing education in business administration at the Frankfurt School of Finance. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at a local institute, a position I started 8 months ago. Although my employment is recent, my checking account with your bank has consistently maintained a balance of over 200 DM for the past year, with regular salary assignments.

My financial situation is stable, with a modest savings account below 100 DM, and while I have a critical account and an active credit with another institution, I have always met my payment obligations. I currently have no guarantors or co-debtors, and my only property is my car.

As a divorced man living alone for the past year, I am committed to improving my career prospects through further education. I am a responsible and skilled employee, as demonstrated by my steady employment and regular payments. I believe this investment in my education will allow me to increase my earning potential and ensure timely repayment of the loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Andreas Müller, and I am seeking a loan of 2,319 DM to fund my studies in computer science at the University of Stuttgart. I have been working as a junior systems analyst for the past 6 months at a local IT firm, and my salary has been regularly deposited into my account at your bank for over a year.

While my savings are limited (less than 100 DM), and I currently have an outstanding credit with another bank, I have always honored my installment payments. I have no guarantors or other debtors, and my only asset is my car. I rent my apartment and have lived there for the past year.

As a divorced man, I am determined to secure a better future for myself through education. My employment and payment history demonstrate my reliability and commitment. I am confident that this loan will enable me to complete my studies and significantly improve my financial stability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Andreas Müller
