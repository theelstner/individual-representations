Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 2,899 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I am currently single with no dependents. My current checking account balance is 120 DM, and I do not have a savings account at this time.

I am seeking this loan because my current car, which I rely on daily to commute to work, has become unreliable and costly to maintain. A new car will enable me to continue my work without interruption and avoid frequent repair expenses. Although I have experienced a delay in paying off a previous loan, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management and have maintained regular payments for the past year.

My stable employment and long-term residence (4 years at my current address) reflect my reliability. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans aside from a small electronics purchase. I am confident that my steady income and responsible approach make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Michael Schubert

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,899 DM for the purchase of a new car. I am currently employed as a senior technician at Siemens AG, where I have worked for 9 years. I have maintained my own credit account with your bank for several years, though my balance is presently 60 DM.

My financial situation is stable, with a consistent salary and no outstanding debts. While I did have a delay in repaying a previous credit, this was due to a brief period of illness, and I have since caught up on all payments. I do not have a savings account, but I am careful with my finances and have no other installment plans apart from a small furniture loan.

A new car is essential for my work, as I travel between company sites and need reliable transportation. I have lived at my current residence for 4 years and am single, with no dependents. I believe my job stability and responsible repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Andreas Vogel

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a 2,899 DM loan to purchase a new car. I am a civil servant working as a customs officer, a position I have held for the past 10 years. My current account balance is 175 DM, and I do not have a savings account or bonds.

I need a new car because my current vehicle has become unreliable, and public transportation does not serve my early morning shifts. Although I experienced a delay in paying off a previous credit card balance, I have since implemented strict budgeting and have paid all bills on time for the last 18 months.

I have no other debts or installment plans except for a small monthly payment for a home appliance. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and have my own credit account at your bank. My steady employment and improved financial discipline make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,899 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as an IT project manager at Deutsche Telekom for 8 years. I am single, have no dependents, and have lived at my current address for 4 years. My current account balance is 95 DM, and I do not have any savings.

A new car is necessary for my daily commute and frequent client visits. While I did experience a delay in paying off a previous installment, this was due to an unexpected family emergency. Since then, I have kept all payments up to date and have no other outstanding debts or installment plans, except for a small monthly payment on a laptop.

Given my long-term employment, stable income, and improved financial record, I am confident I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Lukas Meyer

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a 2,899 DM loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily work as a logistics coordinator at DHL, a position I have held for 7 years. My checking account currently holds 30 DM, and I do not have a savings account. I am single, with no dependents, and have lived at my current residence for 4 years.

I previously had a delay in repaying a mobile phone contract, but I have since resolved this and have maintained a positive payment record. I have no guarantors, other debts, or significant installment plans aside from a small payment for a refrigerator.

I believe my stable employment, history of resolving financial issues, and responsible approach make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
David Schneider
