Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,275 DM for the purchase of a used car. I am a 35-year-old scientific research assistant, currently employed at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics for over 8 years. My current financial situation is modest, with savings below 100 DM and no checking account. I have a steady income and am fully self-supporting, with no dependents.

I require a reliable vehicle to commute to my laboratory, as public transport connections have recently become less reliable due to schedule changes. This car will significantly improve my punctuality and productivity at work. I have a critical credit history due to a prior loan for my postgraduate studies, which I am still repaying, but I have never defaulted on any payments.

I am a trustworthy candidate as I have maintained stable employment in a highly respected institution, reside at my current address for the past 4 years, and have managed all my financial obligations responsibly. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, and I am committed to honoring all terms of the loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dr. Jonas Müller
