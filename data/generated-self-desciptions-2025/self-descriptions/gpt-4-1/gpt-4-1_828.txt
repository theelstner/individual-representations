Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,966 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 33-year-old scientific research assistant, currently divorced, and have been employed at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics for the past 8 years. I have resided at my current address in Munich for 4 years and rent my apartment.

My financial situation is currently strained due to a negative balance in my checking account and limited savings (less than 100 DM). I am supporting my 6-year-old son as a single parent, and have three existing credits at your bank, all of which are being serviced regularly. I have no other debtors or guarantors.

Despite my current credit challenges, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. My employment is stable, and I own a small piece of real estate in my hometown, which provides additional security. The new car is essential for my daily commute to work and for transporting my son to school and activities, as my old vehicle recently broke down beyond repair.

I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and am available by telephone for any additional information. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Keller

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 3,966 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 33-year-old married police officer, employed with the Stuttgart Police Department for 10 years. I have been living at my current rented apartment for 4 years with my husband and our 8-year-old daughter.

At present, my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM, mainly due to ongoing expenses related to my daughter's education and a recent medical emergency. I have three existing loans with your bank, all of which are up-to-date. I also have a mortgage on a small apartment that I own in Ulm.

Although my credit history shows some critical accounts, I have always made it a priority to fulfill my obligations. The car is necessary for my work, as I am often required to respond to emergencies in different parts of the city and public transport is not always reliable.

I am confident that my steady job, property ownership, and strong sense of responsibility make me a reliable candidate for this loan. Please feel free to contact me for any further information.

Best regards,  
Sandra Meier

Letter 3

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a car loan of 3,966 DM. I am a 33-year-old married nurse, working at the Charité Hospital in Berlin for the past 9 years. I have lived in my current rental home for 4 years and have one dependent, my 4-year-old son.

Unfortunately, my checking account is currently negative, and I have minimal savings. This situation resulted from supporting my family after my husband was temporarily unemployed last year, though he is now employed again. I have three ongoing credits with your bank and an additional payment plan with another bank.

Despite my financial difficulties, I am a diligent and responsible borrower. I also own a small inherited property in Brandenburg, which adds to my financial stability. The new car is essential for commuting to my night shifts, as public transportation is not available at those hours.

I am committed to repaying the loan in a timely manner and maintaining open communication. Thank you very much for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Claudia Richter

Letter 4

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 3,966 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 33-year-old separated civil servant, employed as an administrative officer at the Hamburg City Council for 7 years. I have been residing at my current address for 4 years, and I rent my apartment.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM. I am the sole provider for my 10-year-old daughter, and I have three existing credits at your bank, all of which are being paid as agreed. My financial strain is due to legal fees from my recent separation and ongoing support for my daughter.

Despite a critical account in my credit history, I am a reliable candidate for this loan. I own a small plot of land in Schleswig-Holstein, and my position as a civil servant provides job security. A new car is essential for my work and for taking my daughter to school and extracurricular activities.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am happy to provide any further information by telephone.

Sincerely,  
Maren Schulte

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking approval for a car loan of 3,966 DM. I am a 33-year-old married technical engineer, employed at Siemens AG in Frankfurt for 8 years. I have lived at my current rental property for 4 years with my spouse and our 5-year-old son.

My current account is negative, and my savings are less than 100 DM. This is due to recent unexpected repairs to our home and ongoing support for my elderly parents. I have three active credits with your bank, and all payments are up to date. Additionally, I own a small real estate property in Mainz.

Although my credit history shows some challenges, I have always met my financial obligations. The new car is necessary as my current one is no longer reliable, and I need dependable transportation for work and family commitments.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, given my stable employment and property ownership. Thank you for considering my request. Please contact me if you require further details.

Kind regards,  
Elena Braun
