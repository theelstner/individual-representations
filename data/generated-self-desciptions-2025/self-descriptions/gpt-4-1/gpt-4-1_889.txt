Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Farouk, and I am applying for a business loan of 15,672 DM to expand my small electronics repair shop in Frankfurt. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Siemens for three years, and over the past two years, I have run my side business in the evenings and weekends. My current checking account balance is modest, under 200 DM, and my savings are also below 100 DM, as I have invested most of my earnings into growing my business.

I have a good credit history, having paid back all previous credits promptly, and I currently have no outstanding debts or guarantors. I have been living at my current address for two years and own a car, which I use for my business operations. Although I do not own a home, I am confident that my stable employment and business income make me a reliable candidate.

This loan will allow me to purchase additional equipment and hire a part-time assistant, which will significantly increase my revenue. I am committed to making the monthly installment payments and am confident in my ability to do so.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Farouk

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am seeking a loan of 15,672 DM to open a small bakery in Munich. I am a skilled CNC machinist, and I have been working at BMW for the past two years. My credit history is spotless; I have previously taken out and repaid a loan for my car without any issues.

Currently, my checking and savings account balances are low because I recently invested in a commercial oven and kitchen equipment for the bakery. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my present address for two years.

Although I do not own property, I do have a reliable car and a steady job. My income from BMW, combined with the projected earnings from the bakery, will allow me to comfortably meet the monthly installment payments. As a single, responsible individual, I am dedicated to building a successful business and repaying this loan on time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Ivan Petrov
