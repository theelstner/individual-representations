Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 5,511 DM to purchase new furniture and equipment for my store. I am a 32-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 2 years. My employment is stable, and I receive a regular monthly salary.

Although I do not have a checking account yet, I do have a savings account with a current balance of 350 DM. My credit history is solid, with all previous credits paid back on time. I have no other debts or guarantors and no dependents. I have resided at my current address for just over a year and own a car as my primary property asset.

I am seeking this loan to upgrade the furniture and equipment in my electronics store, which will help me improve customer experience and grow my business. My monthly installment rate is 4, which I can comfortably afford based on my current income and expenses. I have no other installment plans except a small one for store supplies.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on time, as demonstrated by my responsible credit history and steady employment. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker
