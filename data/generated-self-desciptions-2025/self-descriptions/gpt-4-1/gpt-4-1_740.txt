Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 6,761 DM. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years, I have maintained a steady and reputable position. My financial situation is stable, with a regular income and no dependents other than my two children, whom I fully support. While I currently do not have a checking account at your bank, I have two existing credits with you which I have been servicing responsibly and without delay. My credit history includes other loans from different institutions, all of which have been managed diligently.

The purpose of this loan is to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and professional responsibilities. I own my home, have a telephone, and am a registered foreign worker under my own name. Although my savings are modest, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 1, as my employment is secure and my monthly budget is well-managed.

I believe my track record as a reliable borrower, my stable employment, and my commitment to meeting my financial obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Markus Schmidt

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking approval for a 6,761 DM loan to finance the purchase of a new vehicle. I am a self-employed IT consultant with over 6 years of experience, and I have resided at my current address for 3 years. As a single father of two, reliable transportation is crucial for both my business and my family.

Although I do not hold a checking account with your bank, I have two active loans here, both of which are in good standing. My credit history reflects some previous critical accounts at other institutions, but I have since improved my financial management and have no outstanding debts or guarantees elsewhere. My property status is unchanged, but I do own my home, which provides stability for my dependents.

My income is steady, and I have no other installment plans. I am confident that I can meet the required installment rate. I am also easily reachable by telephone for any additional information you may require.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Thomas Becker
