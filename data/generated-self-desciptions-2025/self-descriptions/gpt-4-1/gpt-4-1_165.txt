Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Hans Becker, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,308 DM to purchase a new car. I am a retired management consultant with over 25 years of experience advising medium-sized enterprises in Munich. Since retiring two years ago, I have been supporting my adult son, who has special needs and lives with me.

Although I am currently unemployed, I receive a regular pension and freelance occasionally, which allows me to meet my monthly obligations. My checking account typically remains under 200 DM, as I prioritize paying bills and supporting my household. I have no significant savings, but I have always managed my finances responsibly—my existing credit with your bank has been repaid punctually, and I have no other debts or guarantors.

Owning a reliable car is essential for attending my son’s medical appointments and for freelance consulting work. Given my history of responsible credit repayment, stable residence for the past four years, and continued financial support from my pension, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Hans Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Klaus Schneider, and I am applying for a 7,308 DM loan to purchase a new vehicle. I am a 70-year-old former university professor specializing in economics, now retired but still active as a research advisor. I have one dependent, my granddaughter, who lives with me while attending university.

While I am currently not formally employed, I receive a pension and small stipends from consulting work. My checking account balance is usually low, as I focus my resources on supporting my granddaughter’s education. I have kept up with all previous credit payments at your bank, and I currently have only one existing credit, which has always been paid on time.

A new car is crucial for my continued consulting work and for transporting my granddaughter safely. I have lived at my current address for four years, and my housing is provided by the university, allowing me to save on rent.

I am committed to fulfilling all loan obligations and am confident in my ability to do so. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Dr. Klaus Schneider

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Peter Weber, and I am seeking a loan of 7,308 DM to purchase a new car. I am a retired senior officer from the local police department, having served for 35 years before retiring five years ago. I live with my adult son, who relies on my support.

Since retiring, I have not taken up new employment, but I receive a steady pension. My financial situation is modest, with checking and savings account balances remaining below 200 DM and 100 DM, respectively. However, I have always prioritized timely repayment of all debts, including an existing credit with your bank.

A new car will enable me to continue volunteer work in the community and provide essential transportation for my son. I have been a resident at my current address for four years, and my housing is provided at no cost by a family member.

Given my history of reliable payments and stable income, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment requirements. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Peter Weber

Dear Bank Manager,

I am Wilhelm Braun, a 70-year-old retired engineer, writing to apply for a 7,308 DM loan to purchase a new car. I have one dependent—my grandson—who has lived with me since the passing of his parents.

Although I am currently unemployed, I receive a monthly pension and occasionally consult for local engineering firms. My financial resources are limited, with low account balances, but I have a strong history of repaying loans, including one active credit with your institution that has always been paid on schedule.

A reliable car is vital for taking my grandson to school and for my consulting work. I have lived at my current address for four years and pay no rent, as the house is owned by my late daughter. I have no guarantors or other debts.

My consistent payment record and ongoing income streams make me a dependable candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Wilhelm Braun
