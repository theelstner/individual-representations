Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for an educational loan of 1,864 DM to support my ongoing studies in Business Administration at the University of Munich. As a divorced woman of 30 with one dependent, I am committed to advancing my career as a scientific research assistant, a position I have held for 2 years at the Max Planck Institute. 

Although I currently have no checking account with your bank and maintain two existing credits here, my financial management has been responsible despite a critical account noted elsewhere. I own my home and have resided there for 2 years, with modest savings of 350 DM. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my real estate property provides additional security.

This loan will allow me to complete my degree, improving my job prospects and financial stability. I am a foreign worker but well-integrated, and my steady employment history and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Schmidt
