Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 7,678 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment in Frankfurt. As a divorced woman working as a scientific research assistant at the Goethe University for the past five years, I have a stable income and am committed to improving my living conditions.

Although I have experienced some delays in paying off previous credit obligations, I have taken significant steps to better manage my finances. Currently, I have 800 DM in my savings account and no other outstanding debts or guarantors. I have been residing at my current address for four years and own a car, which facilitates my daily commute and work responsibilities.

I am requesting this loan to furnish my apartment and purchase necessary equipment to support my work-from-home tasks. As a foreign worker, I understand the importance of building a trustworthy financial profile in Germany. I am committed to timely repayments, as demonstrated by my improved financial discipline over the past year.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to fulfill the loan terms and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Sabine Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,678 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home office. My name is Maria Sanchez, and I am a married administrative officer working at the Berlin City Council for the past four and a half years.

I have 700 DM in my savings account and no other debts. My credit history does show a previous delay in payment, which was a result of temporary job instability when I first moved to Germany. Since securing my current position, I have consistently met all my financial obligations.

Best regards,
