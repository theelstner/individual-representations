Letter 1

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,579 DM to purchase a new car. My name is Viktor Ivanov, a 33-year-old single father of two, and I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Schmitt Logistics GmbH for the past 10 months. Although I am relatively new to this position, I have worked diligently and my employer can attest to my reliability and work ethic.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are both below 100 DM due to the costs of settling into my new residence, which I have owned for the past year. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying consistently and on time. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

The new car is essential for commuting to work and transporting my children to school and activities. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life here, and owning reliable transportation is a critical step. My real estate property provides additional security, and I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment rate of 4.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss my request further and provide any additional information needed.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, and I am applying for a 2,579 DM loan to purchase a new car. I have lived in my own home in this city for one year and am employed as a resident building maintenance worker at Adler Apartments, where I have worked for 11 months. I am a single father of two children and have no other debts or guarantors.

I have maintained a good credit history, having paid back my previous loan with your bank on time. My current financial status is modest; my checking and savings accounts have less than 100 DM due to recent expenses for my children's needs and home repairs. Despite these challenges, I have always prioritized my financial responsibilities.

A new car is necessary for me to reliably commute to work and ensure my children can attend school and extracurricular activities. My real estate property demonstrates my commitment to this community, and I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

To the Bank Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,579 DM for the purchase of a new car. My name is Tomasz Nowak, I am 33 years old, single, and have two dependents. I have been working as a resident janitor for the past 9 months at the Lindenhof Residential Complex.

My current checking and savings balances are under 100 DM, as I have recently invested in home improvements and covered some unexpected medical expenses for my children. I own my residence and have a positive credit record, having paid back my previous credit from your bank punctually.

As a foreign worker, having reliable transportation is critical for maintaining my employment and supporting my family. I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and my property provides security for this loan. I am confident in my ability to meet the 4-rate installment plan.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available to provide further documentation if required.

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak

To the Loan Committee,

I am writing to apply for a 2,579 DM loan to purchase a new car. My name is Mohamed Ben Ali, I am 33 years old, and I have been a resident caretaker at the Sonnenhof Apartment Complex for the past 8 months. I am a single parent of two children, with no other debts or financial commitments aside from a previous credit with your bank, which I have repaid reliably.

My financial situation is currently constrained; my checking and savings accounts both have balances below 100 DM, as I have recently covered moving expenses and school costs for my children. I own my home and have lived here for one year. I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

A new car is vital for my job security and for fulfilling my responsibilities as a father. My history of punctual repayments and property ownership demonstrate my reliability and commitment.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Sincerely,  
Mohamed Ben Ali
