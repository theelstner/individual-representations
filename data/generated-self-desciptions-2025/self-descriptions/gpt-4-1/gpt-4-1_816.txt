Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 3,931 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 6 years. My current checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM, but I have always paid back my previous credit at your bank on time. I am a single father of two children and have lived at my current residence for 5 years, where I am fortunate not to pay rent. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am seeking this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for commuting to work and transporting my children. As a skilled employee with a stable job and a history of reliable repayments, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4. I would appreciate your consideration of my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Popovic

To whom it may concern,

I am seeking a loan of 3,931 DM to purchase a new car, which I need for my work as a postal service official. I have been with Deutsche Post for 4.5 years and have always demonstrated financial responsibility, as shown by my history of timely loan repayments. My current checking account is overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, but I have no other debts or installment plans. I am a single father with two dependents and have lived rent-free at my current residence for 6 years. I do not own any property, but my stable employment and long-standing relationship with your bank—having already repaid one credit—demonstrate my reliability. I respectfully request your consideration for this loan to ensure I can continue to support my family and fulfill my professional duties.

Thank you,  
Luka Markovic
