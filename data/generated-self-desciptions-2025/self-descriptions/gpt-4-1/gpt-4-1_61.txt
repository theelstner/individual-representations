Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am applying for a loan of 6,229 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am 23 years old, recently divorced, and have been living at my current residence for four years. I am employed as a retail sales assistant at Kaufhof since August of last year.

Currently, I have a negative balance in my checking account and savings of less than 100 DM. My financial situation has been challenging due to the recent separation and the responsibility of supporting my young son. Despite these difficulties, I have managed to maintain my employment and meet my existing obligations, including two small credits with your bank.

I have a co-applicant, my sister, who is willing to support this application. We both understand the importance of financial discipline and are committed to making timely payments. I am confident that, with your support, I will be able to stabilize my household and provide a comfortable environment for my child.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may need.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller
