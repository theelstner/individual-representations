Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €5,801 to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past 8 years, where I have established a stable and reliable career. Currently, I am renting an apartment in Berlin, where I have lived for the last 4 years with my teenage son.

While I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained a credit account elsewhere and have one existing credit with your institution, which I have always paid on time. My income is sufficient to cover the proposed installment rate, and I have a building society savings agreement as additional security. I understand the importance of responsible financial management and am committed to meeting all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of €5,801 to furnish my new apartment and purchase necessary home office equipment. I have worked as a senior administrative officer for the City of Hamburg for the past 10 years, demonstrating my stability and reliability in employment. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and am the sole provider for my 12-year-old daughter.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, I have a life insurance policy and one existing credit here, which I have managed responsibly. My credit history reflects some challenges, but I have always fulfilled my obligations without default. My monthly income comfortably covers the proposed installment rate, and I have no other debts or guarantors.

I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my commitment to timely repayment.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Berger
