Letter 1 – From a Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Julia Schneider, and I am applying for a loan of 1,240 euros to purchase a new television for my home. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have been employed for the past eight years. My work is stable and provides a steady income, which allows me to comfortably manage my financial responsibilities.

I am currently divorced and live with my 11-year-old daughter in our own apartment, which I purchased two years ago. While I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained two other credit lines here, both of which are in good standing. I have some credit history at other institutions, but I am committed to improving my financial situation and consolidating my obligations.

The new television is important for both our home life and my work, as I often use it for research and educational purposes. I have no guarantors or other debtors, and all my installment payments are up to date. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms, as my job and residence are stable.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response and am happy to provide any further information if needed.

Best regards,  
Julia Schneider

Letter 2 – From a Police Officer

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Meier, and I am a 38-year-old police officer with over ten years of service in the Wiesbaden Police Department. I am married and live with my husband and our 14-year-old son in a house we own, where we have resided for the past two years.

I am seeking a loan of 1,240 euros to purchase a radio and television for our household. Our current devices are outdated and frequently malfunction, which affects our ability to stay informed and connected as a family. Although I do not have a checking or savings account with your bank, I have two existing credits here, both of which I have managed reliably.

My financial situation is stable, with a regular salary and no other outstanding installment plans. I am confident that my long-term employment and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for any further questions and look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Meier

My salary is steady, and I have no other debts or installment plans. My financial obligations are well managed, and I am committed to maintaining my good standing. I believe my stable employment history and responsible financial management demonstrate my reliability.

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Elke Wagner, and I am a municipal clerk for the city of Mannheim. I have worked in this position for the past seven years. I am divorced and live with my 12-year-old son in a house that I purchased two years ago.

My income is stable, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I am diligent in managing my finances and have always met my obligations. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your favorable response.
