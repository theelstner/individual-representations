Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Martin Krause, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,032 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My employment is stable and provides a steady income.

My financial situation has improved over the past year, although I did experience a delay in paying off a previous loan due to unexpected medical expenses related to my dependent son. I have since caught up on all payments and have no outstanding debts, except for my current obligations with your bank.

I do not have a checking account at this time, and my savings are minimal, less than 100 DM, as I have prioritized supporting my family. I have been living at my current residence for 4 years, where I do not pay rent, which allows me to allocate more funds toward loan repayment. I currently have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my long-term employment, reliable income, and commitment to meeting my financial obligations. The new car is essential for commuting to work and supporting my dependent. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 4, as my expenses are otherwise limited.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Martin Krause

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Peter Hoffmann, and I am seeking a loan of 2,032 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a customs official at the Port of Hamburg for 9 years, and I am currently single with one dependent, my niece, whom I support.

My financial history includes a late payment on a previous loan, which was due to a temporary reduction in work hours last year. Since then, my work schedule has returned to normal, and I have not missed any payments. I do not own property or a checking account, and my savings are currently under 100 DM.

I live with my brother, so I do not pay rent, and I have maintained my current residence for 4 years. I have two existing loans with your bank, both of which are being paid on time. With no other debts or installment plans, I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed repayment schedule.

I am a reliable candidate due to my stable government employment, regular income, and responsible management of my financial commitments. The new car will enable me to continue supporting my niece and fulfill my job requirements.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Peter Hoffmann

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Klaus Richter, and I am applying for a 2,032 DM loan to finance a new car. I have worked as a telecommunications technician for Deutsche Telekom for the past 8 years. My job is secure, and I receive a consistent monthly salary.

I experienced a delay in loan repayment three years ago due to unexpected hospital bills for my dependent daughter. Since then, I have maintained an excellent repayment record. I do not have a checking account, and my current savings are below 100 DM. I have no property, but I benefit from free housing provided by my employer, which significantly reduces my monthly expenses.

I have lived at my current address for 4 years and have two ongoing credits with your bank, both serviced regularly. I have no other installment plans or debts.

Given my long-term employment, stable housing, and careful management of my finances since the previous delay, I am confident in my ability to meet the new loan's repayment terms. The car is vital for my daily commute and supporting my daughter's needs.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Klaus Richter

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Dieter Schulz, and I am requesting a loan of 2,032 DM to buy a new car. I have been a postal service supervisor for 10 years, and my employment is both stable and well-compensated. I am single and have one dependent, my elderly mother, whom I care for.

A few years ago, I experienced a delay in paying off a loan due to increased caregiving expenses. I have since resolved all outstanding debts and maintained a good payment record. My savings are currently under 100 DM, and I do not have a checking account or any property.

I have lived at my current residence, which is provided by a family member rent-free, for the past 4 years. I have two active loans with your bank, both in good standing, and no additional debts or installment plans.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate due to my long-term employment, reliable income, and commitment to fulfilling my financial responsibilities. The new car is necessary for transporting my mother to medical appointments and managing daily errands.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Dieter Schulz

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Jürgen Weber, and I am seeking a 2,032 DM loan to purchase a new car. I am a senior administrative assistant with the local city council, where I have been employed for 8 years. I am single and support my adult son, who is currently unemployed.

I did have a delay in repaying a previous loan two years ago, which was caused by an unexpected reduction in my son's disability benefits. Since then, I have consistently paid all obligations on time. I do not have a checking account, and my savings are less than 100 DM.

I reside in my sister's home, rent-free, and have lived there for 4 years. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which are up to date. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I am confident in my ability to repay this new loan, given my stable employment, limited living expenses, and improved financial management. The car is essential for commuting to work and supporting my son’s needs.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Kind regards,
Jürgen Weber
