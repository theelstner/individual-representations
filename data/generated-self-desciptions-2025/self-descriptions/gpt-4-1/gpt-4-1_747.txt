Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,797 DM to expand my small grocery kiosk in the city center. I have been operating this business for the past 13 months, and during this time, I have seen a steady increase in customers. The loan will be used to purchase a refrigerated display case and additional inventory, which will allow me to serve my customers better and increase my sales.

Currently, my financial situation is challenging. My checking account is slightly overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in my savings. I have two small existing credits at your bank, both of which I have been servicing regularly despite some delays in the past due to unexpected expenses. I also have a building society savings agreement as a form of collateral.

I have been employed as a warehouse assistant for the past 10 months, and I am confident that my business will soon be profitable enough to cover all obligations. I am a single father to my 4-year-old daughter, and as a foreign worker, I am highly motivated to succeed in my new home. I am committed to repaying this loan and building a good financial future for my family.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Murat Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,797 DM to purchase equipment for my mobile phone repair business, which I launched 13 months ago. The business is growing, and with the right tools, I can take on more complex repairs and increase my income.

My financial situation is currently strained. My checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are below 100 DM. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are up-to-date. I have a life insurance policy as security and no other guarantors or co-debtors. I have lived at my current address for one year and own my apartment.

I have been working as a delivery driver for the past 9 months, which provides a stable, albeit modest, income. I am single and responsible for my younger brother, who lives with me. While my credit history has some negative marks, I have demonstrated my ability to manage multiple obligations and am committed to repaying this loan on time.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 1,797 DM to purchase a second-hand van for my courier service. Since starting my business 13 months ago, I have relied on public transportation, which limits my ability to accept larger deliveries and grow my client base.

Presently, my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM. I have two active credits at your bank and a building society savings agreement as partial collateral. I work as a cleaner in the evenings, a position I have held for 11 months, and have no other sources of debt or guarantors.

As a single, 28-year-old foreign worker supporting my son, I am determined to improve my financial stability. I have managed my existing loans responsibly and am confident that this investment will help me increase my income and meet all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a business loan of 1,797 DM to upgrade the kitchen equipment in my small fast food stand, which I have operated for just over a year. This investment will allow me to expand my menu and attract more customers.

My financial situation is currently tight. My checking account is below zero, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. I have two small credits with your bank, which I am actively repaying. My property includes a life insurance policy. I have been working as a dishwasher for the past 8 months to supplement my business income.

I am a single man, 28 years old, with one dependent child. I have lived at my current residence for one year and own my flat. Although my credit history is not perfect, I have always made efforts to meet my financial obligations and am committed to making this business a success.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 1,797 DM to purchase a sewing machine and materials for my tailoring business, which I started 13 months ago. This will help me meet increasing customer demand and improve my service quality.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are minimal. I have two existing credits at your bank and a building society savings agreement. I have been employed as a janitor for the past 10 months, providing a steady income alongside my tailoring work.

I am a single man, 28 years old, and support my younger sister. I have lived at my current address for one year and own my home. Despite some difficulties in my credit history, I have managed my debts responsibly. I am dedicated to repaying this loan and growing my business further.

Thank you for your attention and understanding.

Sincerely,  
Samuel Mensah
