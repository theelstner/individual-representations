Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,959 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for 2 years and 7 months. As a single mother to a 6-year-old daughter, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities.

My financial record is solid; I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid back on time. While my checking and savings accounts currently have less than 0 DM and 100 DM respectively, I have a building society savings agreement as additional security. My current residence has been owned for 2 years, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan given my stable employment, clean credit history, and responsible financial behavior. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Weber
