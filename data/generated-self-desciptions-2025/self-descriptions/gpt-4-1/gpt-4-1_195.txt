Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,108 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my family. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for the past five years. My employment is stable, and my monthly income is sufficient to cover all living expenses as well as regular loan payments.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have a savings account with a modest balance. I have previously taken a loan from your bank and have consistently made timely payments without any defaults. My credit history is clean, and I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

I am married with one child and have been living in my current rented apartment for two years. I also own a small piece of inherited real estate in my home country. I believe my stable employment, responsible financial behavior, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,108 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my family’s use. I have been employed as a customs official at the Port Authority for six years, with a steady income and no interruptions in employment. My wife and I are raising our young son, and these appliances are essential for our household.

I have previously borrowed from your bank and repaid the loan in full and on schedule. I currently do not hold a checking account, but I do maintain a small savings account. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am not engaged in any other installment plans.

We have lived in our current rental residence for two years, and I own a small parcel of land in my home country. I am a responsible borrower, as evidenced by my clean credit history and regular employment. I am confident that I can manage the proposed installment payments without any difficulty.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Miroslav Novak
