Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,245 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Mannheim Institute of Technology, where I have worked for three years. My current financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance of 120 DM and savings below 100 DM. However, I have a stable income and have maintained my position for several years.

Although I have a critical credit account at another bank, I have always managed to make my payments and am committed to improving my financial standing. My wife and I have lived in our current apartment for two years, and I own a reliable car. We have no other guarantors or co-debtors, and I am the sole applicant for this loan.

I am a responsible individual with a steady job and a family to support. This loan will help us acquire a much-needed television, enhancing our quality of life. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the specified 18-month period and assure you of my commitment to fulfilling all obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Martin Weiss

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,245 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my household. As a married man working as a municipal administrative officer for the past two years, I have a dependable job and a regular monthly income.

Presently, my checking account holds about 80 DM, and my savings are limited. My financial resources are stretched due to previous credit obligations at another institution. Nevertheless, I have never defaulted on a payment, and I am eager to build a positive credit relationship with your bank.

I have lived at my current residence for two years and own a car, which is my primary asset. My family depends on me, and I am committed to providing them with the comforts they deserve. The installment rate is manageable given my salary, and I have no other ongoing installment plans except for my existing commitments.

I am trustworthy, diligent, and motivated to improve my financial situation. I would greatly appreciate your support in granting this loan.

Kind regards,  
Hans Becker

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,245 DM, which I intend to use for the purchase of a new television set for my family. I am a skilled electrician employed at Siemens AG, where I have worked for just over a year. My wife and I have one dependent, and we have been living at our current address for two years.

My current checking account balance is 150 DM, and my savings are minimal. I acknowledge that I have a critical account with another bank, but I am making regular payments and have no outstanding defaults. My property consists of a car, and I do not have any other installment plans except a small furniture loan.

As the primary breadwinner, I am dedicated to maintaining financial stability for my family. The installment rate for this loan is within my means, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan as agreed.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Peter Schmitt
