Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,333 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I recently moved to Munich from Turkey for work, and as a foreign worker, I am eager to establish myself and provide a comfortable home for my six-year-old son, who lives with me.

Currently, I am employed as a warehouse assistant at Bayer Logistics and have been with the company for 8 months. My salary is stable, but as I am still new in Germany and have only been in my current job for a short time, I have not yet been able to build significant savings. My checking account balance is modest, and I do not have a savings account at this time.

I acknowledge that I have previously experienced a delay in paying off a past credit, but I have since learned the importance of timely payments and have maintained good standing with my existing credit at your bank. I own my apartment, which demonstrates my commitment to financial stability, and I also hold a life insurance policy.

I am single, responsible for my son, and determined to improve our living situation. I believe my current employment, property ownership, and improved financial discipline make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Kemal Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 2,333 DM loan to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my home. I recently relocated to Frankfurt from Poland for work and have been employed for the past 10 months as a kitchen assistant at a local restaurant.

My financial situation is currently stable, though I have limited funds in my checking account (less than 200 DM) and do not yet have a savings account. I do have a building society savings agreement, which I am contributing to regularly. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I am managing alongside my monthly installment payments.

I am a single father with a three-year-old daughter, and I want to provide her with a safe and comfortable living environment. Although I experienced a delay in repaying a previous loan, I have since become diligent with my finances and am committed to meeting all my obligations on time.

I have lived at my current address for two years and am proud to own my home. I believe my employment, property ownership, and commitment to financial responsibility make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,333 DM for the purpose of purchasing furniture and equipment for my new home. I am a 29-year-old single male, recently moved to Germany from Romania, and have been working as a hotel porter in Berlin for the past 7 months.

While I do not have significant savings or a savings account, I do hold a life insurance policy and own my apartment, which I purchased last year. My current checking account balance is below 200 DM, as most of my earnings go toward supporting my five-year-old son.

I do have a history of delayed payments on a previous credit, but I have since taken steps to improve my financial management and have maintained regular payments on my existing credit with your bank. I have no other debts or guarantors and manage my finances independently.

My goal is to create a comfortable and stable home for myself and my son as we build our future in Germany. I am confident that my improved financial habits, stable employment, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Popescu

Dear Lending Department,

I am applying for a loan of 2,333 DM to furnish and equip my new residence. I am a single male, 29 years old, who recently moved to Stuttgart from Croatia for employment. I have been working as a janitor at a local school for 9 months.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a 2,333 DM loan to purchase furniture and equipment for my apartment. I am a single 29-year-old man from Hungary, and I have been working as a construction laborer in Hamburg for the past 11 months.

My checking account has less than 200 DM, and I do not have a savings account, as most of my income goes toward supporting my seven-year-old daughter. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I am repaying through monthly installments. I also own my apartment and have a life insurance policy.

I previously had a delay in paying off a loan, but I have since learned the importance of financial responsibility and have not missed any payments on my current credit. I have no other debts or guarantors and have lived at my current address for two years.

I am committed to providing a better living environment for my daughter and believe that my stable employment, property ownership, and improved financial habits make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
