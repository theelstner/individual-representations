Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jan Novak, and I am applying for a loan of 1534 DM to purchase a new television for my family. I am a 23-year-old married man with a young child, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute. I have been in this position for 10 months, following my graduation from university last year.

My financial situation is modest; my checking account balance is currently 150 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM, as most of my resources go towards supporting my family and paying rent. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have paid back reliably and on time. I own a small piece of real estate in my home country, which provides me with some long-term security.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations, as demonstrated by my clean credit history. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I have always prioritized responsible budgeting. I am confident that my stable employment and strong sense of responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Jan Novak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed. I am a 23-year-old married man living in Munich with my wife and infant daughter. I am writing to request a loan of 1534 DM to purchase a radio and television set for our apartment. As a recently hired customs official at the Munich Airport (since 8 months), I am still building up my financial stability in Germany.

Currently, my checking account holds about 90 DM, and my savings are limited, as most of my income is used for rent and supporting my family. I have one other credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time and in full. I have no other debts, and I own a share in a family property back in Egypt.

Despite being new to my job, I have a strong record of responsibility and reliability. I have always met my financial commitments, and I am confident in my ability to continue doing so. I believe my stable employment and clean credit history make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed
