Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 707 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am a 30-year-old single male and have been working as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past 2 years. I have one dependent, my younger brother, who lives with me in my own apartment.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have responsibly managed two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have paid back on time. My savings are under 100 DM, so a loan is necessary for this important purchase. I have no other debts or guarantors and my only other installment plan is with your bank.

I own real estate and have lived at my current address for 2 years. My stable employment and history of timely repayments demonstrate my reliability. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building my life here and maintaining a positive financial reputation.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I will meet all repayment obligations.

Sincerely,  
Lukas Schneider
