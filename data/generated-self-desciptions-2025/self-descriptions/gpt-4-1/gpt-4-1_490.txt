Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,418 DM to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for the past 2 years and 8 months. Although I do not have a checking account, I do maintain a savings account with a current balance of 320 DM.

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have paid back diligently and on time. I have never defaulted on any payments. My current financial situation is stable; my monthly income comfortably covers my living expenses, rent, and existing obligations. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors.

Owning a reliable vehicle will significantly improve my ability to commute to work and support my 7-year-old son, who lives with me. I rent my apartment and have resided at my current address for 2 years. I also own a small piece of real estate in my hometown, which adds to my financial security.

I am committed to fulfilling my financial responsibilities and believe my track record demonstrates my trustworthiness. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Peter Schmidt

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,418 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as a janitor at City Services GmbH for 3 years. My savings account currently holds 410 DM, and I have no other debts or installment plans aside from one credit at your bank, which I have always paid on time.

As a single father of a 10-year-old daughter, reliable transportation is essential for managing both work and family commitments. My financial situation is stable, with a consistent monthly income and manageable expenses. I do not have a checking account, but I maintain a good payment history.

I have lived at my current rented residence for 2 years and own a plot of land in Brandenburg. I am confident that my consistent employment, responsible credit history, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Andreas Fischer
