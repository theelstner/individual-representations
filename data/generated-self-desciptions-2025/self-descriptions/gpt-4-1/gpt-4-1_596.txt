Letter 1: Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,358 DM from your bank. I am a 34-year-old single male, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. I have maintained a stable position with a steady income and have always paid my previous credits at your bank on time.

My current financial situation is such that my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and I do not possess a savings account or bonds at this moment. The purpose of this loan is to cover unexpected expenses related to my ongoing research project, specifically the purchase of specialized equipment needed for my work. I reside in a rented apartment above a local store and have lived there for the past 3 years.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my employment is secure and my previous credit history with your bank is exemplary. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors, and I take financial obligations very seriously. I believe my consistent work record and responsible credit behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dr. Markus Feldmann

Letter 2: Small Business Owner

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a personal loan of 1,358 DM to support the short-term cash flow needs of my small retail store, "Urban Finds," which I have owned and managed for the past 9 years. I am a single male, 40 years old, and have resided at my current address above my store for 3 years.

My current financial situation is temporarily strained due to recent renovations and a seasonal dip in sales. I do not have a savings account or bonds at this time, but I have always honored my previous loan agreements with your bank. The requested funds will be used to restock inventory and maintain operations until the busy summer season.

With no other debts or guarantors, and a solid record of loan repayments with your institution, I believe I am a reliable candidate. My business has a steady customer base, and I am confident I will be able to meet the installment plan offered.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I am happy to provide any additional documentation needed.

Best regards,
Jan Müller
