Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,520 euros to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I am currently living in my own residence in Munich, where I have been for the last 4 years. 

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I have maintained one credit with you in good standing. My credit history includes a critical account with another institution, which I have been addressing diligently. I have no other installment plans or debts, and I am not supported by any guarantors. As a single father with one dependent, I am committed to providing a stable and comfortable home environment.

My age and experience bring a sense of responsibility and reliability. I also hold a life insurance policy, which demonstrates my long-term planning and financial security. I am confident that my stable employment and home ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Dr. Stefan Müller

To Whom It May Concern,

I am seeking a loan of 1,520 euros to upgrade the equipment in my home office, which is crucial for my work as a senior mechanical engineer at Siemens, where I have been employed for over 10 years. I have lived in my own house in Hamburg for the past 4 years and am a single parent to my teenage son.

While I do not currently hold a checking or savings account with your bank, I have maintained a previous credit with you. My credit history includes a critical account from a previous bank, which I am actively resolving. I do not have any other debts or installment plans, and I manage all my financial commitments independently.

Owning my home and having a building society savings agreement shows my commitment to financial stability. My steady employment and long tenure in Germany as a foreign worker further underscore my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ahmed El-Khatib

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,520 euros to furnish my apartment, as I recently moved to support my work as an official translator for the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. I have been in this role for 9 years and have resided in my own property in Düsseldorf for 4 years.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account at your bank, I do have one existing credit with you, which is in good standing. My credit history includes a critical account from another institution, but I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors. I am a single man with one dependent, and I am dedicated to maintaining my financial obligations.

In addition to my stable employment, I have a life insurance policy that provides extra security for my dependent. My long-term residence and employment reflect my commitment and trustworthiness as a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you require.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov
