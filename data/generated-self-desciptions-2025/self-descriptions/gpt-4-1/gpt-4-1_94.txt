Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 797 euros for the purpose of purchasing a new television for my household. My name is Maria Petrova, and I am a 33-year-old divorced woman residing in Germany for the past three years. I am currently employed as a cleaning staff supervisor at Starlight Hotels, a position I have held for the last eight years. My employment is stable and I have a regular income that supports both myself and my two children.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have a life insurance policy with Allianz that demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning. I have one existing credit at your bank and my payments have always been made on time. While my credit history includes a critical account, I have resolved past issues and now manage my finances responsibly.

I am requesting this loan to replace a broken television, which is a vital source of information and education for my children. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as my budget allows for the planned rate. I am a responsible borrower and take my financial obligations seriously.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Fatima Hassan, and I am seeking a loan of 797 euros to buy a new radio and television for my home. I am a 33-year-old married woman with two children, living in Berlin for the last three years. I work as a warehouse assistant for DHL, a position I have held for seven years. My employment is permanent and provides a steady income.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I do have a building society savings agreement with Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall, which shows my commitment to saving for the future. I currently have one other credit at your bank and have always met my obligations.

My credit history has some challenges due to a previous loan from another bank, but I have learned from this experience and have taken steps to improve my financial management. I am confident that I can handle the monthly installments, and I am committed to repaying the loan in full.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Fatima Hassan
