Letter 1 – Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1963 DM to purchase a radio and television set. I am a 32-year-old scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for the past 5 years. My work requires me to stay updated with the latest developments in my field, and access to reliable media is essential for my ongoing research and personal development.

Although I do not currently have a checking account, I have a history of managing my finances responsibly. I have previously taken out two small credits, both of which I repaid on time and in full. I have modest savings, but they are not sufficient to cover this purchase. My current residence has been stable for 2 years, and I rent a small apartment close to my workplace.

As a single professional with no dependents, I have a steady income and no other debt obligations. I do not have any guarantors or co-debtors, but I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, given my stable employment and responsible financial history. I am also a foreign worker, which has taught me the importance of financial discipline and reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to repaying the loan on time and would be grateful for your support.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Weber

Letter 2 – Small Business Owner

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1963 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my small bakery, "Brot & Butter," which I have operated for the past 4 years in Munich. These items will enhance the customer experience and help me stay informed about market trends and news relevant to my business.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have always managed my finances prudently. I have taken out one previous credit for kitchen equipment, which I paid off in full and on schedule. My savings are limited, as I reinvest most of my profits into the business, but I have no outstanding debts and no guarantors.

I have lived at my current address for 2 years and have always paid my rent and other obligations promptly. As a single, self-employed individual, I am fully responsible for my financial commitments. I have no dependents and am accustomed to managing multiple financial responsibilities, as evidenced by my successful business operations.

I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan, and I appreciate your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Alexei Petrov

Letter 3 – IT Project Manager

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1963 DM to purchase a radio and television. I am a 35-year-old IT project manager at Siemens, where I have worked for 6 years. My job demands that I stay up-to-date with technology and current events, and these devices are essential for my professional and personal growth.

I do not currently have a checking account, but I have maintained an excellent credit history. I have paid off two previous credits for a car and computer equipment without any delays. My savings are below 100 DM due to recent investments in my career development, but I have no other debts and no co-signers.

I have lived in my current rented apartment for 2 years and consistently pay all my bills on time. As a single individual with no dependents, my financial obligations are manageable, and my steady employment ensures a reliable income.

As a foreign worker, I understand the importance of financial responsibility and am committed to repaying the loan as agreed. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Mateusz Nowak

Letter 4 – Medical Officer

Dear Loan Committee,

I am writing to request a loan of 1963 DM for the purchase of a radio and television. I am a 38-year-old medical officer at Charité Hospital in Berlin, with 5 years of continuous service. Access to news and educational programs is vital for my professional duties and personal enrichment.

I do not have a checking account at present, but my credit history is spotless. I have repaid two previous loans (one for medical equipment, one for relocation expenses) without any issues. My current savings are minimal, as I have recently contributed to a family medical emergency abroad, but I have no other debts or financial obligations.

I have resided at my current address for 2 years and always pay my rent on time. As a single person without dependents, I am able to allocate sufficient funds towards the loan installments. I am diligent, responsible, and committed to fulfilling my financial commitments.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Samuel Mensah

Letter 5 – University Lecturer

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1963 DM to purchase a radio and television set, which will be used for educational purposes in my lectures at the University of Hamburg, where I have been a lecturer for 4 years. These devices will enable me to provide my students with current and relevant content.

I have no checking account, but I have demonstrated financial reliability by paying off a previous student loan and a small personal loan on time. My savings are currently less than 100 DM, as I have invested in academic resources for my classes.

I have lived at my present address for 2 years and have always paid my rent and other bills punctually. I am single, have no dependents, and have no other debts or co-signers. My stable employment and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Ahmed El-Sayed
