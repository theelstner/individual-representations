Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,347 DM for the purchase of a new television. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years and have had my salary assigned to my checking account at your bank for over a year, with a current balance exceeding 200 DM. 

Although I have a critical account and existing credits at other banks, I have always been diligent in making my payments on time. I currently have two credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. My monthly installment rate is 4, which I am able to manage comfortably within my budget. I do not have a savings account, but I do hold a building society savings agreement as part of my long-term financial planning.

I have lived at my current address in Munich for 2 years, and I own my apartment. As a single 27-year-old with one dependent (my younger brother, who is studying at university), I am committed to maintaining my financial responsibilities. I do not have any guarantors or other installment plans, and I am a registered foreign worker under my own name.

I believe that my stable employment, responsible financial behavior, and clear purpose for the loan make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Müller

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 1,347 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I have been employed as a customs official at the Hamburg Port Authority for 6 years, and my salary has been assigned to my checking account at your branch for over a year, with a consistent balance above 200 DM.

I acknowledge that my credit history includes a critical account and existing credits at other banks, but I have always prioritized my obligations and kept my accounts in order. My two current credits with your bank are up to date, and I have never missed a payment. My current financial commitments, including my installment rate of 4, are well within my means.

I have no savings account, but I do have a life insurance policy as part of my financial security. I have resided in my own home in Bremen for the last 2 years. I am 27, single, and support my younger sister as a dependent. I have no other debts or guarantors.

With a steady job, responsible payment history, and a clear need for this loan, I am confident in my ability to manage this new commitment. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Jörg Schneider

To whom it may concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1,347 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home.

Despite a critical account status and existing credits at other banks, I have always made my payments reliably. The two credits I have with your bank are in good standing. I do not have a savings account, but I am covered by a building society savings agreement.

I am 27 years old, single, and live in my own apartment in Frankfurt, where I have resided for 2 years. I have one dependent, my son, whom I support fully. My monthly installment rate is 4, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

Letter 4

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,347 DM to purchase a radio and television for my home. I have been employed as a police officer in Stuttgart for the past 5 years, and my salary has been directly deposited into my checking account with your bank for over a year, with a regular balance above 200 DM.

While I have a critical account and credits at other banks, I have consistently met all my financial obligations. I currently have two loans with your bank, both of which are in good standing, and my installment rate of 4 is manageable alongside my current expenses.

Though I do not have a savings account, I hold a life insurance policy. I am 27 years old, single, and have one dependent, my nephew, who lives with me. I have lived at my present address for 2 years and own my home. I have no other debts or guarantors.

With a stable official position, a proven record of repayment, and a clear need for the loan, I am confident in my ability to fulfill this obligation. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Weber
