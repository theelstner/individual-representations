Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Anne Berger, and I am applying for a loan of 2,389 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am currently a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, a position I have held for ten months. My current checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have always repaid my previous credits on time, as my credit history will show.

As a divorced woman living in a rented apartment above my family's small store, I am responsible for supporting myself and my teenage daughter. My savings are minimal, but I own a reliable car, which helps me commute to work. The new radio and television are important for both my daughter's education and my own research.

I am a trustworthy candidate due to my stable employment, excellent credit history, and commitment to fulfilling all financial obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anne Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Roth, and I am seeking a loan of 2,389 DM to replace my old radio and television, which are no longer functional. I am employed as a junior accountant at Müller & Söhne GmbH, where I have been working for nine months. Although my checking and savings accounts are currently low, I have never missed a payment on previous credits.

As a married woman, I help manage our family store, which also serves as our residence. While my financial resources are limited, I do own a small car and have no other outstanding debts or guarantors. The installment rate I have chosen is manageable within my monthly budget.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as I have always met my obligations and take my financial responsibilities seriously. I appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,  
Claudia Roth
