Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 12,749 DM to purchase a high-quality radio and television set for my newly established electronics repair business. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 5 years, and I am now transitioning to self-employment in a field where I have significant expertise. Although I do not currently hold a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance of approximately 800 DM.

I acknowledge that I experienced a delay in repaying a previous loan three years ago due to an unexpected medical emergency. However, I have since resolved this issue and have been diligent in meeting all my financial commitments. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my current installment obligations are manageable.

I have resided at my present address for just over a year, and while I do not own property, I do possess a reliable car that supports my business needs. I am single, have no dependents, and my stable employment history demonstrates my reliability. As a foreign worker in Germany, I have always strived to integrate and maintain a strong work ethic.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that this investment will further stabilize my financial situation and allow me to continue contributing positively to the community.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 12,749 DM to purchase a professional-grade television and radio system for my new apartment. As a project manager in a multinational corporation, I have been continuously employed for the past 6 years. My income is stable, and I have a savings account with approximately 700 DM.

In the past, I had a minor delay in repaying a loan due to a temporary job relocation. I have since ensured all debts are paid and currently have no outstanding obligations with any guarantors. My monthly installment payments are well within my budget.

I have recently moved to Munich for work, and although I have only lived at my current address for a year and do not own property, I do own a car. I am single, with no dependents, and manage my finances independently. I am a foreign national but have established myself as a responsible and trustworthy member of my company.

I would greatly appreciate your support in this matter and assure you of my commitment to timely repayments.

Best regards,  
Ali Hassan

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 12,749 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my small event management company. My employment as an events coordinator has been steady for the past 4 years, and I have gradually built up a savings account now totaling 900 DM.

I had a delayed payment on a previous credit line two years ago, caused by a client’s late payment. Since then, I have been prompt with all my financial obligations. I have no other debts or co-signers, and I am currently making installment payments on time.

I have been residing at my current address for one year, and while I do not own a home, I do own a car for business use. I am single, with no children, and as a foreign worker, I have always prioritized financial responsibility to maintain my good standing in Germany.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that with your support, I can continue to grow my business and meet all repayment terms.

Yours sincerely,  
Markus Novak

Letter 4

Dear Loan Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 12,749 DM to purchase a modern radio and television set, which I need both for personal development and to support my work as a freelance journalist. I have been self-employed for the past 5 years and have a savings account with approximately 650 DM.

A few years ago, I encountered a delay in loan repayment due to an unexpected drop in freelance assignments. I have since stabilized my income stream and have no current debts or obligations with other guarantors. My current installment plans are affordable, and I have never missed a payment since.

I have lived at my current residence for just over a year and own a car, which is essential for my work. I am a single male, without dependents, and as a foreign worker, I am committed to meeting all my financial responsibilities in Germany.

Thank you very much for your consideration. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability as a borrower and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Luka Vukovic

Letter 5

Dear Sir/Madam,

I wish to apply for a loan of 12,749 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my consulting office. I have worked as a senior IT consultant for the last 6 years, and my current savings account has a balance of 950 DM.

I admit that I had a late payment issue on a previous loan due to an unexpected family obligation abroad, but I have since cleared all outstanding debts and maintain an excellent payment record. I have no other loans or guarantors.

Having recently moved for a new job opportunity, I have been at my present address for one year and do not own property, but I do own a car. I am single, without dependents, and as a foreign professional, I have always valued maintaining a solid financial reputation.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to repaying the loan on schedule and am available for any further information you may require.

Best regards,  
Samuel Mensah
