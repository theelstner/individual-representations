Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Petrova, and I am applying for a loan of 1,943 DM to carry out essential repairs on my property at 42 Lindenstraße. As a scientific research assistant employed at the Max Planck Institute for the past 10 months, I have demonstrated reliability and responsibility in both my professional and financial life.

I am 23 years old, recently divorced, and the primary caregiver for my six-year-old daughter. Since relocating to Germany four years ago, I have established a stable home and invested in real estate, which I now own. My existing credit with your bank was paid back punctually, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

While I do not currently hold a checking account and have limited savings, my steady income and history of timely repayments reflect my commitment. The requested loan will be used exclusively for urgent repairs to ensure my home remains safe and habitable for my family.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further.

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Gonzalez, and I am seeking a loan of 1,943 DM to repair the heating system in my home, which I own in Munich. I have been working as an administrative clerk at the Bavarian City Council for the past nine months and am married with one child.

Although I have only recently started my employment, I have a strong record of repaying my previous credit with your bank on time. I have resided at my current address for four years and have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

I do not have a checking account and my savings are modest, but my employment is secure and my property represents significant collateral. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable life in Germany and have always prioritized my financial obligations.

I hope you will consider my application favorably. I am dedicated to meeting all repayment terms and look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Maria Gonzalez
