Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 3,656 DM to purchase a new television set for my home. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics GmbH for the past 8 years, and my salary has been regularly deposited into my checking account with a consistent balance above 200 DM for over a year.

While I have had some challenges in my credit history due to a previous loan with another institution, I have maintained all payments on my current accounts at your bank, where I already have two active credits in good standing. I do not have a savings account, but I do have a building society savings agreement as property.

As a single father with one dependent, I am committed to providing a comfortable home, which is why I am seeking this loan to replace our outdated television. I have lived at my current address for 4 years and own my home, which I believe demonstrates my stability. My only other installment plan is for a refrigerator purchased at a local store.

I understand the importance of trust and responsibility in financial matters, and I assure you that I will meet all repayment obligations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 3,656 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I have been working as a janitor at Hotel Europa for the past 9 years, with my salary consistently paid into my checking account for over a year.

Although I have a critical account in my credit history and an existing loan with another bank, I have always made payments on time for my two current credits with your institution. I do not hold a savings account, but I do have a life insurance policy.

As a 49-year-old single man supporting my teenage son, I take my financial responsibilities very seriously. I have resided in my own apartment for 4 years, which adds to my sense of stability. My only other installment plan is for a washing machine from Kaufhaus Schmidt.

I am a reliable candidate who values the opportunity to improve my family’s quality of life. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,
Andrzej Kowalski

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a 3,656 DM loan to upgrade my household’s radio and television equipment. I am a 49-year-old foreign worker from Turkey, employed as a machine operator at Stahlwerke AG for 8 years. My salary has been assigned to my checking account for over a year, maintaining a balance above 200 DM.

While my credit history includes a critical account and an active loan elsewhere, I have never missed a payment on my two loans with your bank. I do not have a savings account, but I hold a building society agreement.

As a single man raising my daughter, I have lived at my owned residence for 4 years. The only other installment plan I have is with a local electronics store. I do not have a telephone, but I am always reachable at my workplace.

My long-term employment and consistent financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Mehmet Demir
