Letter 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,631 DM to purchase a new car. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 3 years. My current financial situation is stable: my checking account balance is 150 DM and I have savings of 350 DM. I have a good credit history, having always paid back existing credits promptly.

As a divorced woman living in Germany for 4 years, I have no other debtors or guarantors. I currently rent my residence and have no property, except for my current car, which is outdated and unreliable. I have one dependent, my daughter, whom I support fully.

The new car is essential for my daily commute and for transporting my daughter to school and extracurricular activities. My installment rate is manageable, and I have always honored my financial commitments. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on time. My employment is secure, and I am dedicated to maintaining my good credit standing.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,631 DM to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been working as a nurse at Charité Hospital for 2 years, and my employment is steady and reliable. My checking account currently holds 120 DM, and I have 200 DM in savings. I have no other loans or installment plans besides my monthly rent.

I am married and have lived at my current address for 4 years. I have consistently paid back all previous credits in a timely manner, as reflected in my credit history. I have one dependent, my son, and I am the sole breadwinner in my family.

This new car is crucial for me to continue working shifts at the hospital, as public transportation does not operate during late-night hours. I have a good track record of financial responsibility, and I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments.

Thank you for your consideration. I hope you will grant me the opportunity to improve my family’s quality of life.

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

I am separated and have lived at my current address for 4 years. I have always paid back my credits on time and have no other outstanding debts. I am a foreign worker from Poland, and I have integrated well into the community.
