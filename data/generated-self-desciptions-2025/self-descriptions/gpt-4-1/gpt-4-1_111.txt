Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Hans Meier, and I am applying for a business loan of 1,410 DM to expand my small carpentry workshop in Stuttgart. I have been working as a certified technical supervisor at a local furniture factory for the past 8 years, and my wife and I have lived in our own home for the last 2 years.

My current financial situation is stable: I have 900 DM in my savings account and own a small piece of real estate, which we reside in. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying on time without any issues. My monthly installment rate is manageable, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

This loan will be used to purchase new woodworking equipment, which will allow me to fulfill larger orders and grow my business. I have a strong history of repaying my debts and a steady income from my employment. I am responsible for my wife and our young daughter, and I take my financial commitments seriously.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Hans Meier
