Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 6,416 DM, which I intend to use to expand my small tailoring business, “Elegant Threads.” I have been a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past eight years, and alongside my job, I have managed my tailoring shop for over a decade. My financial situation is stable: I have no outstanding debts, and I have previously repaid a loan from your bank on time and in full.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are modest, as I have reinvested most of my earnings into my business. I rent my apartment and have resided at my current address for three years. I am divorced and support my adult son, who is currently finishing his studies.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my consistent employment, strong credit history, and responsible financial management. The requested funds will allow me to purchase new sewing machines and hire an additional seamstress, which will significantly increase my business’s capacity and revenue. I am committed to meeting all repayment obligations and look forward to your positive response.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 6,416 DM to open a small bakery specializing in traditional Turkish pastries. I have been employed as a customs official for the past nine years and have lived in my current apartment for three years. As a married woman supporting my daughter, I am eager to use this loan to create a better future for my family.

My finances are carefully managed, though my savings are under 100 DM due to recent investments in baking equipment. My checking account is also modest, but I have no other debts or installment plans. I have a history of responsible borrowing, having previously repaid a loan from your bank without any issues.

I am a reliable and hard-working person, as shown by my long-term employment and my dedication to supporting my family. The bakery will provide a stable income and fulfill a local demand for authentic pastries. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan on time and appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,
Emine Yildiz

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a business loan of 6,416 DM to help me expand my freelance graphic design studio. I have worked as a skilled employee in a publishing company for the past eight years, and I have lived in my rented apartment for three years with my son, whom I support as a single mother.

My savings and checking accounts are currently under 200 DM, as I recently invested in new software and equipment. I have no other debts, and my previous credit with your bank was paid back in full and on time. I do not have property or other installment plans.

I am a responsible borrower with a strong work ethic, proven by my stable employment and excellent credit history. This loan will allow me to rent a small office space and purchase additional equipment, which will help me take on more clients and increase my income. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations and hope for your favorable response.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Sabine Reinhardt
