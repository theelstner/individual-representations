Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jens Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,478 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight years, where I have demonstrated reliability and commitment in my field.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are less than 100 DM due to moving expenses and initial costs associated with starting a new position. While I have an existing credit with another institution, I have always made my payments on time, and I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4.

Having lived at my current address for four years and owning a used Volkswagen Golf, I have established stability in my personal life. As a single individual with no dependents, my monthly expenses are manageable, and I have no other debtors or guarantors.

I am a skilled employee with a proven track record, and I believe my employment stability and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,  
Jens Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am seeking a loan of 1,478 DM to purchase necessary furniture and office equipment for my new home workspace. I have been working as a certified mechanical engineer at Siemens AG for over seven years, which has provided me with a stable income and professional development.

Due to recent relocation expenses and supporting my family abroad, my current checking and savings accounts are below 0 and 100 DM, respectively. I do have a credit account with another bank, which I manage responsibly, and I am committed to fulfilling all financial obligations.

I have resided at my current address for four years, and my only property is my car. I am single, have no dependents, and I have no co-signers or guarantors. My installment plans are manageable, and I am accustomed to budgeting carefully.

Given my solid employment history, responsible credit usage, and steady income, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Viktor Ivanov

I have been a skilled IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom for the past nine years, demonstrating dedication and reliability.
