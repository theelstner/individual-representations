Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 708 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics, where I have worked for 2 years. My current financial situation is stable: although my checking account is temporarily below zero, I have consistently paid back all existing credits on time and have never defaulted on any payments. My only savings are a small building society savings agreement.

I am a single father of two children, and as a foreign worker, I have worked hard to provide a stable home for my family. I have resided at my current address for three years and own my home, which ensures my commitment to the community. Additionally, my brother has agreed to act as a guarantor for this loan.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan at the proposed installment rate of 2, as my employment is secure and I have no other installment plans or significant debts. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andrej Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 708 DM to purchase new equipment for my small tailoring business, which I operate from my home. I have been employed as a resident cleaner at the City Hall for three years, and my employment is ongoing. My financial resources are limited, as my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are minimal, but I have a life insurance policy as security.

Despite these limitations, I have demonstrated responsibility by paying off my previous credit with your bank on time. I have no outstanding installment plans and live in my own residence with my two children. My cousin, who is a teacher, has agreed to serve as my guarantor.

I am committed to improving my financial situation and believe this loan will allow me to increase my income and provide a better life for my family. I trust my reliable payment history and steady employment will assure you of my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Samuel Okoro

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 708 DM to buy new furniture for my home. I have been employed as a hospital porter at St. Joseph’s Hospital for just over one year. While my current account is slightly overdrawn and I have less than 100 DM in savings, I have always repaid my credits on time and have a building society savings agreement as additional security.

I am a single man with two dependents, and I have lived at my current residence for three years. I own my home, have no other debts or installment plans, and my cousin is willing to act as my guarantor for this loan.

I am confident that, given my stable employment and history of timely repayments, I am a reliable candidate for this loan. The furniture will greatly improve the comfort and quality of life for my family.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Mateusz Nowak

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 708 DM to purchase equipment for my home workshop. I am currently employed as a janitor at the local school, where I have been working for nearly four years. Although my checking account is currently below zero and my savings are limited, I have a life insurance policy and have never missed a credit payment.

As a foreign worker and a father of two, I am determined to provide for my family. I have resided in my own home for three years, have no other debts, and my brother-in-law is willing to act as a guarantor for this loan.

My job is stable, and I have a good record with your bank, having successfully repaid a previous loan. I am confident I can meet the repayment schedule without difficulty.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 708 DM to buy essential furniture and equipment for my household. I am employed as a night security guard at the Metro Center, a position I have held for two and a half years. While my current account is slightly negative and my savings are below 100 DM, I have always paid back my credits on time and have a building society savings agreement in place.

I am a single man with two children, living in my own home for three years. I have no other installment plans, and my uncle has agreed to be my guarantor. As a foreign worker, I have worked hard to maintain financial stability and support my dependents.

Given my steady employment, history of responsible credit repayment, and support from my guarantor, I am confident I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Dimitrov
