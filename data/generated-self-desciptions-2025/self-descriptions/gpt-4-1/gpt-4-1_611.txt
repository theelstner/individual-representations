To whom it may concern,

My name is Andrei Petrescu, and I am applying for a loan of 1300 EUR to purchase a reliable used car. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at BioGen Labs, where I have worked diligently for the past 8 years. My job provides stable income, and I have successfully paid off all my previous loans, including one at your bank, without any delays.

I do not have a checking or savings account, but I have managed my finances responsibly by living within my means. My current housing is provided by my employer, so I do not have rental expenses. I have two children who depend on me, and reliable transportation is essential for their schooling and my daily commute.

I have demonstrated my trustworthiness through a consistent work history, responsible credit repayment, and a stable residence for the past 4 years. I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment rate of 4% as agreed. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu
