Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1204 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 35-year-old single father living in rented accommodation, with one dependent child. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years, and I am proud of my stable employment history. My current savings amount to 250 DM, which demonstrates my commitment to responsible financial planning.

I have maintained a good financial standing, with no negative marks on my credit history. I have previously held a credit at your bank, which I repaid in full and on time. My current monthly income allows me to comfortably cover the proposed installment rate, and I have no other outstanding debts or obligations.

Purchasing a new car is essential for my daily commute to work and for my child’s school transportation. I am confident that this investment will further improve my family’s quality of life and my work reliability. I am committed to meeting all repayment terms and believe my employment record and previous credit performance demonstrate my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Weber
