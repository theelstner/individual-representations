Letter 1:  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 4,576 DM. I am a 32-year-old single male who has been a certified laboratory technician for the past eight years, specializing in chemical analysis for a local manufacturing firm. Unfortunately, I was laid off three months ago due to company downsizing, but I am actively seeking new employment and have several promising interviews lined up.  

My financial situation is stable: I currently have 150 DM in my checking account and 350 DM in savings bonds. Although my credit history includes a critical account from a previous loan at another bank, I have been making regular payments on my existing debts. I have lived at my current address for four years and have no dependents or co-signers.  

The purpose of this loan is to purchase a reliable used car, which is essential for commuting to job interviews and, ultimately, to my next place of employment. I am committed to meeting all installment payments on time and have a solid track record as a responsible borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Bauer

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am applying for a loan of 4,576 DM to purchase a used car, which will greatly enhance my mobility and job prospects. I am a 29-year-old single male who recently worked as a technical support specialist for a telecommunications company. After the company merged with another, my position was unfortunately made redundant.  

Currently, I have 120 DM in my checking account and 200 DM in a savings bond. My credit history shows a critical account, but I have no outstanding debts with your bank. I have lived at my current apartment for four years and have no dependents. I do not have any other guarantors or installment plans, aside from a small furniture loan with another institution.  

A car is vital for me to expand my job search beyond the city and to secure stable employment. I am confident in my ability to make regular payments, as I have always prioritized my financial obligations.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Stefan Richter

Letter 3:  
Dear Bank Manager,  

I wish to apply for a loan of 4,576 DM for the purchase of a used car. I am a 35-year-old single male who previously worked as a scientific research assistant at the University of Dresden for five years. Due to recent funding cuts, I am currently unemployed but am actively pursuing new research positions.  

My checking account holds 180 DM, and I have 400 DM in savings. Although I have a critical account from a prior loan at another bank, I have always met my payment obligations and have no current delinquencies. I have resided at my present address for four years and have no dependents.  

Owning a car is crucial for attending interviews and conferences, which will help me secure new employment. I am a responsible borrower with a history of steady employment and am committed to repaying this loan on time.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Neumann
