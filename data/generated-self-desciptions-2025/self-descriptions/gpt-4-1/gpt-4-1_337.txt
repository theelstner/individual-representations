Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Berger, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,384 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home and office. I am a 44-year-old divorced man with one dependent. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years and four months. My current financial situation is challenging, as my checking account is slightly overdrawn and my savings are below 100 DM. However, I have stable monthly income and own a small piece of real estate in Leipzig, which provides a measure of financial security.

I have maintained a critical credit history due to previous obligations, but I have always made my payments on time at other institutions. I am currently renting my residence, where I have lived for four years. I do not have any other debtors or guarantors and have no additional installment plans. I am confident that my stable employment and property ownership demonstrate my reliability and ability to repay the loan. My telephone is registered in my name, and I am fully documented as a foreign worker in Germany.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations and appreciate your support in helping me improve my living and working environment.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Andreas Müller, and I am seeking a loan of 3,384 DM to upgrade the equipment in my small consulting firm. I am a 44-year-old separated male with one child. I have been self-employed as a financial consultant for two years and eight months, and while my business is growing, my checking account is currently overdrawn, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. Nevertheless, I have a consistent client base and own a rental property in Dresden.

Despite a critical credit history due to past business investments, I have no outstanding debts at your bank except for a small credit I am currently repaying. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors. I have lived at my current address for four years and have always paid my rent and utility bills on time.

I believe my entrepreneurial experience and asset ownership make me a trustworthy candidate. I am eager to use this loan to further stabilize my business and provide better support for my dependent. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Andreas Müller

To the Credit Department,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,384 DM to purchase furniture and necessary equipment for my new apartment. My name is Markus Schulz. I am 44 years old, divorced, and have one dependent child. I have worked as a senior project manager at Siemens AG for the past three years. My checking account is currently below zero, and my savings are minimal, but my monthly salary is secure and above average for my field.

I have a critical credit history due to a recent divorce settlement, but I am up to date on all my payments. I have no other installment plans or debts at your bank, aside from an existing small credit. I have lived in my current rental property for four years and am registered as a foreign worker. I also own a small plot of real estate in Bavaria.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan through my stable employment and real estate asset. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Markus Schulz

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Peter Hoffmann, and I am applying for a loan of 3,384 DM to furnish my home and purchase work equipment. I am a 44-year-old divorced father of one, employed as a chief accountant at Bayer AG for the past two years. My current checking account is overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM due to recent unexpected expenses, but my income is reliable.

I have a critical credit history from a previous car loan with another institution, but I have always met my obligations. I have no other installment plans, and I rent my apartment, where I have lived for four years. I own a small inherited property in Hesse, which adds to my financial stability.

With my stable employment, responsible financial behavior, and property ownership, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 3,384 DM for the purpose of purchasing new office equipment and home furnishings. My name is Stefan Weber, a 44-year-old separated male with one dependent. I have served as an operations officer at Deutsche Bahn for the past three years and six months. At present, my checking account is slightly negative, and I have less than 100 DM in savings, but my employment is secure and my salary is steady.
