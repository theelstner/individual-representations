Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marcus Schmidt, and I am writing to apply for a car loan of 10,875 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years. While my credit history does include a delay in payment from 2019, I have since taken significant steps to ensure all my financial obligations are met on time.

Currently, I do not have a checking account, but I maintain a small savings account with less than 100 DM. My monthly installment rate is manageable at 2%, and I have no other debtors or guarantors. I have lived at my current residence in Munich for 2 years and do not own property aside from my current car, which I plan to trade in.

As a single male with no dependents, my financial responsibilities are straightforward. I am a skilled employee, and my position is secure. I have a work telephone and am a foreign worker with a valid permit. I am confident that my stable employment and responsible attitude make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Marcus Schmidt
