Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 3,380 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, a position I have held for five years. As a divorced mother of two, reliable transportation is essential for both my work and family responsibilities. 

Although I have not yet opened a checking account with your bank, I do have one existing credit with you, which I have managed responsibly. My previous credit history at another institution is now stable, and I am committed to improving my financial standing. My current savings are modest, but I own my home and a small piece of real estate, providing additional security. 

I have no other debts, installment plans, or guarantors, and my employment is secure. I believe my steady job and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 3,380 DM to purchase a new car. As a married foreign worker and senior administrative assistant at Bayer AG, where I have worked for just over four years, I require reliable transportation to commute between my home and the office. 

While I do not currently have a checking account with your bank, I maintain a credit line here that I have managed diligently. I have minimal savings at this time, but I own my residence and a small plot of land. My credit history at another bank has had challenges, but I have taken steps to resolve them and now have a stable income and no other outstanding debts. 

With a secure job, property assets, and a strong commitment to meeting my obligations, I am confident I can responsibly manage this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Maria Fernandez

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a car loan of 3,380 DM. I am a divorced mother of two and have been employed as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for nearly six years. Reliable transportation is vital for my work schedule and for ensuring my children’s needs are met.

Although I do not yet have a checking account with your institution, I hold a current credit with you, which is in good standing. I own my home and a small real estate asset, and I have no other debts or installment plans. My savings are limited, but my employment is secure and well-compensated. 

Despite a previously critical credit account at another bank, my financial situation has stabilized. I am dedicated to maintaining my obligations and believe my employment and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Elena Schneider

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 3,380 DM to purchase a new car, which is necessary for my daily commute and family responsibilities. I am married, have two children, and have worked as a senior laboratory technician at Siemens Healthineers for just over four years.

While I do not have a checking account with your bank, I do have one existing credit here, which I have always paid on time. My savings are currently less than 100 DM, but I own my house and some real estate, which provides additional security for the loan. I have no other debts or installment plans. 

My credit history at another bank was previously marked as critical, but my current financial situation is stable, and I am committed to fulfilling all obligations. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you,  
Sabine Weber

Letter 5

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a loan of 3,380 DM to buy a new car, which is essential for my job as a foreign language teacher at the Berlin International School. I have been in this position for almost five years, and as a separated mother of two, a car is necessary for both work and family life.

I do not have a checking account with your bank, but I do have one active credit here that is well managed. My savings are limited, but I own my home and a piece of real estate, and I have no other debts or installment plans. My credit history at another bank was once critical, but I have worked hard to stabilize my finances and now have a steady income. 

With my stable employment, property assets, and responsible credit management, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Olga Petrova
