Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 5,742 DM to support the expansion of my mobile car detailing service, "Shine-on-the-Go." As a scientific research assistant with 5 years of continuous employment at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, I have demonstrated reliability and dedication in both my professional and financial life. My credit history is spotless; I have always paid back existing credits punctually.

Though I do not currently have a checking account and my savings are modest (around 400 DM), I have managed my finances responsibly and have no outstanding debts or guarantors. I have resided at my current address for the past two years and own a reliable vehicle, which is essential for my business operations. As a single, 32-year-old foreign worker, I am fully committed to establishing my own business and contributing positively to the local economy.

This loan will allow me to purchase advanced cleaning equipment and marketing materials, helping me serve more customers and grow my business sustainably. My stable employment, consistent payment history, and clear business plan make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 5,742 DM to launch my own IT support consultancy, "TechEase Solutions." I have worked as a network administrator for the past 6 years at Bayer AG and have always maintained a strong work ethic and financial responsibility, as reflected in my excellent credit record with all previous loans repaid on time.

My current savings are limited to about 350 DM, and I do not possess a checking account yet, but I have managed my finances carefully and live within my means. I have no other debts or financial obligations. I have been living at my current residence in Cologne for two years and own a car, which is vital for visiting clients.

As a 35-year-old single male and skilled employee, I am confident that my technical expertise and strong client network will ensure the success of my business. I am a foreign worker with a valid work permit and am fully integrated into the community. This loan will be used for essential business equipment and initial marketing costs.

I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan in full and on schedule.

Best regards,  
Mateusz Nowak
