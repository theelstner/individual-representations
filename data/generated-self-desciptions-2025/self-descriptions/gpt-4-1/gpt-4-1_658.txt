Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 888 DM for the purchase of a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I have consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic and reliability in my position. My current checking account balance is 150 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM, as most of my income goes towards supporting myself and making regular installment payments on my existing obligations.

I have a solid credit history, having always repaid my previous credits on time and in full. I currently have no other debtors or guarantors, and I have been residing at my current address for 4 years. My property includes a used motorcycle, and I have no dependents. While my housing is arranged through the bank, I am responsible and diligent with my finances.

The new car is essential for my daily commute and research duties, and I am confident that I will be able to meet the installment rate of 4 DM per month as required. I believe my stable employment, proven creditworthiness, and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Martin Weber

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 888 DM to purchase a new car. I have been working as a warehouse supervisor at Müller Logistics for 9 years, with a steady and reliable income. My current financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance of 80 DM and minimal savings, but I have always prioritized paying my debts on time.

My credit history is excellent; I have successfully paid back all previous loans without any delays. I have no co-signers or guarantors, and I live alone in an apartment provided by the bank. I have been at my current residence for 4 years and have no dependents to support.

Having reliable transportation is crucial for my job, as I often need to travel between different company sites. I am confident that I can manage the monthly installment payments due to my stable employment and careful budgeting. I hope you will see that my long-term employment and responsible financial management make me a dependable candidate for this loan.

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 888 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a senior technician at Siemens for 10 years, and my employment is secure and ongoing. My current account holds 120 DM, and my savings are less than 100 DM, as I have recently paid off another credit.

My credit record is clean, with all existing credits paid back on time. I live in bank-provided accommodation and have been at my present address for 4 years. I have no dependents or other financial obligations, and I do not have any other installment plans except for a small furniture loan (41 DM remaining).

A new car is necessary for my daily commute and occasional overtime work, which sometimes requires late travel. Given my stable job, proven repayment history, and lack of additional debt, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Richter
