Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,872 DM to purchase a new television and radio system for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, where I have established a stable and reputable career. I currently do not have a checking account but have maintained a savings account with a balance of 350 DM.

My financial situation is stable. I own my residence and a small piece of real estate in Leipzig, where I have lived for the past 4 years. I have one existing credit at your bank, which I have always paid on time, and no other installment plans. While I do have a critical account with another lender, I have taken measures to address past issues and have not missed a payment in over two years.

As a single father of two, I am committed to providing a quality home environment for my children, which is why I am seeking this loan. My employment is secure, and my monthly income is sufficient to comfortably meet the installment rate of 3. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and I am registered as a foreign worker in my own name.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet all obligations, and I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Andreas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Viktor Ivanov, and I am applying for a loan of 2,872 DM to upgrade my home entertainment system with a new radio and television. I have been working as a customs official at the Munich International Airport for the last 9 years. Though I do not have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with 420 DM.

I am 36 years old, single, and have two dependents. I own my apartment in Munich, where I have resided for the past 4 years, and hold additional real estate in the city. My current financial responsibilities are manageable, with only one existing credit at your bank, which is in good standing, and no other installment plans elsewhere.

While my credit history does include a critical account with another institution, I have resolved previous issues and have since demonstrated consistent reliability. My stable employment, property ownership, and long-term residence underscore my financial security.

I am trustworthy and diligent, with a proven record of meeting my obligations. I believe that this loan will allow me to improve my living environment for myself and my children. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Viktor Ivanov
