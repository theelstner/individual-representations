Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 691 DM to purchase a new car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, where I have maintained a stable and reliable income. My current financial situation is somewhat strained, as my checking account is overdrawn and I have less than 100 DM in savings. However, I have consistently managed my existing financial obligations, including two credits at your bank, and have always made my payments on time.

As a single father of one, reliable transportation is crucial for both my work and family responsibilities. While my credit history includes a critical account and other credits at different institutions, I have never defaulted on a payment. I also hold a building society savings agreement, which demonstrates my commitment to long-term financial planning.

My residence of 3 years and ownership of my home further attest to my stability. I am confident that with my steady employment and careful budgeting, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 691 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have worked as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for the last 9 years, providing me with a secure and regular income. My current financial challenges stem from unexpected medical expenses for my young son, which have left my checking account temporarily overdrawn and my savings depleted.

Despite my critical credit history and two existing credits with your bank, I have always honored my repayment obligations. I do not have any other installment plans or outstanding debts elsewhere. I have lived in my current home, which I own, for 3 years and am committed to maintaining a stable life for my dependent.

I also have a life insurance policy, reflecting my responsible approach to financial planning. As a foreign worker who has integrated well into my community, I take my financial commitments seriously and am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Milos Novak

I own my home, have resided there for 3 years, and hold a building society savings agreement as part of my long-term financial planning.

Dear Loan Department,

I am applying for a loan of 691 DM to purchase a new car, which is vital for both my job and supporting my child. I have worked as a municipal clerk for the City of Stuttgart for 8 years, ensuring a steady income. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn and my savings are under 100 DM, this is due to recent unexpected expenses related to home maintenance.
