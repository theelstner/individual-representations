Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of €3,556. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have worked for 2 years and 4 months. I am a single father to my 6-year-old son, and we have been living in our own apartment in Munich for the past 2 years.

Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have maintained a good credit history and have always paid back my existing credits on time. I currently have one ongoing credit with your bank, and all payments have been made punctually.

The purpose of this loan is to purchase a new car, which is essential for commuting to work and transporting my son to school and activities. My monthly salary allows me to comfortably afford the proposed installment rate, and I have no other debts or installment plans.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable future for my family in Germany. I believe my consistent employment, responsible credit history, and stable housing situation make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Samuel Okoro, and I am applying for a loan of €3,556 to finance the purchase of a new car. I have been working as a logistics coordinator at DHL Express in Hamburg for the past 3 years. I am 29 years old, single, and have a 4-year-old daughter who lives with me.

Currently, I do not have a checking or savings account, but I have successfully managed one previous loan with your bank, repaying all installments on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my monthly income is stable.

Owning a car is crucial for my job, as I am often required to travel between warehouses and client locations. Additionally, having a reliable vehicle will greatly improve my ability to care for my daughter, especially given our current housing situation, which we have maintained for 2 years.

I am a responsible borrower and a dedicated employee. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Best regards,  
Samuel Okoro

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of €3,556 to purchase a new car. I am a single male, 29 years old, and a foreign worker employed as a technical support specialist at Siemens in Frankfurt for the past 1 year and 8 months.

I do not have a checking or savings account, but I have an excellent credit record, having paid back my only previous credit with your bank without any issues. I live in my own apartment, where I have resided for 2 years, and I have no other loans or financial obligations.

The car is necessary for my daily commute and for taking care of my younger brother, who depends on me. My steady employment and reliable payment history demonstrate my trustworthiness as a borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Andrei Ionescu

Letter 4

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Luis Fernandez, and I am applying for a loan of €3,556 to buy a new car. I am 29 years old, single, and a foreign national working as a civil engineering technician at a mid-sized firm in Stuttgart for the last 3 years.

I have no checking or savings account, but I have previously taken out a loan with your bank and have always paid my installments on time. I have no other outstanding debts and live in my own apartment, where I have resided for 2 years. I support my younger sister, who lives with me.

The car is essential for my work, as I frequently visit construction sites outside the city, and public transportation is not always practical. My stable income and solid repayment record make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Luis Fernandez
