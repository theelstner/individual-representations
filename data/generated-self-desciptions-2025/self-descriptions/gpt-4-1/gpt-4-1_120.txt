Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Becker, and I am applying for a loan of 4,281 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, where I have been employed for just over two years. After my recent separation, I had to move and start anew, which has temporarily strained my finances.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I maintain a savings account with a balance of 700 DM. My credit history includes a previous loan for my car, which I am repaying on schedule. I have no other guarantors or debtors involved in this application. I have been living at my current residence for four years and am committed to remaining in the area.

As a skilled employee with stable employment and a modest installment rate, I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly. My dependable work record and careful budgeting demonstrate my trustworthiness as a candidate. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Becker

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Wagner, and I am seeking a loan of 4,281 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home office. I have been working as a senior administrative assistant at the municipal office in Wiesbaden for three years. Following my divorce, I have had to set up a new household, which has left my checking account temporarily in the negative.

Despite this, I have managed to maintain a savings account with a balance of 950 DM. I have an existing auto loan with another bank, which I am servicing punctually. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have lived at my current address for four years.

As a reliable employee with a stable job and no dependents, I am committed to meeting my financial obligations. My consistent employment and responsible handling of previous credits make me a trustworthy candidate for your support. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Wagner

Dear Banking Team,

I am Petra Schulz, a married woman employed as a laboratory technician at Mainz Medical Institute for nearly three years. I am requesting a loan of 4,281 DM to replace worn-out household furniture and to acquire necessary equipment for my work-from-home arrangement.

My financial situation is currently tight, with my checking account slightly below zero due to recent moving expenses. However, I have savings of 800 DM and a car as property. I have an existing credit with another institution, which I am managing without any delays. I have resided at my current address for four years and have always paid my obligations on time.

I believe my stable employment and reliable payment history, combined with my commitment to managing my finances prudently, make me a strong candidate for this loan. I appreciate your time and consideration.

Best regards,
