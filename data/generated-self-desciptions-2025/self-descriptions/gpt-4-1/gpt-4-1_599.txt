Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 4,241 DM to support the expansion of my small appliance repair shop, which I have operated for the past three years. My current financial situation is stable, though my checking account has a balance of only 150 DM and my savings are under 100 DM, as I have reinvested most of my income into the business. I have never defaulted on any credit; my three existing credits with your bank have all been paid back on time and in full.

I am a single father to my 8-year-old son, and I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Müller Logistics for the past two years. I have lived at my current address for four years and own my home, which is secured by real estate. I have no other debts or installment plans. My business has shown steady growth, and with this loan, I plan to purchase new equipment and hire an additional technician to meet increasing demand.

I am committed to fulfilling all my obligations and have a proven track record with your bank. I believe this investment will further stabilize my financial situation and benefit both my family and the local community.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Jürgen Meier

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 4,241 DM to help launch a mobile car wash business in our town. As a registered foreign worker, I have worked as a janitorial assistant at the local hospital for the past three years. I have one dependent, my daughter, and I am determined to build a better future for us both.

Currently, my checking account holds about 80 DM, and my savings are minimal, but I have always managed my finances responsibly. I own my home and have lived there for four years. I have no outstanding debts or installment plans, and all three previous loans from your bank have been paid back promptly.

This loan would allow me to purchase necessary equipment and a used van. I am confident in my business plan and in my ability to repay the loan, as I have a steady income and a strong work ethic. I am reachable by telephone at any time and am committed to maintaining my excellent credit record.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Rashid Karim

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 4,241 DM for the purpose of opening a small bakery. After working for two years as a kitchen helper at a local restaurant, I have gained valuable experience and am eager to start my own venture. My current financial resources are limited, with less than 200 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings, as I have been supporting my young son on my single income.

Despite my modest means, I have always paid my bills and prior credits on time. I have three previous credits with your bank, all of which have been settled without issue. I own my home and have resided there for four years, and I have no other debts or financial obligations.

I believe that my dedication, reliability, and strong connection to the community make me a trustworthy candidate. This loan would help me realize my dream of business ownership and provide for my family.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
Peter Schulte
