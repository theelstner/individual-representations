Letter 1  
From: Julia Meyer, divorced, former restaurant manager, self-employed caterer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of €5,433 to purchase a used car, which is essential for my catering business. After managing a local restaurant for five years, I transitioned to self-employment two years ago, providing catering services for events in and around the city. My income is stable, but without a personal vehicle, I have had to rely on expensive rentals and public transport, limiting my business's growth and reliability.

Although I am currently unemployed in the traditional sense, my self-employed status ensures regular income, and I have a proven track record of paying back my existing credit with your bank on time. I have lived at my current address for four years and am the sole provider for my six-year-old son. My financial obligations are clear—no other debts or installment plans.

I am committed to responsible financial management, as demonstrated by my previous credit history. This loan will enable me to expand my business, ensuring a steady income for my family and fulfilling my obligations to your institution.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Julia Meyer

Letter 2  
From: Anna Schulz, married, scientific research assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a loan of €5,433 to purchase a reliable used car. As a scientific research assistant with eight years of experience, I recently became unemployed due to the closure of my research institute. I am actively seeking new employment and have several promising interviews lined up. The car is necessary for commuting to potential jobs and transporting my young daughter.

My credit history with your bank is positive, with all payments made on time for my existing loan. I have no additional debts, and my housing situation is stable—I have rented my current apartment for four years. Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I do have a life insurance policy as an asset.

I am a responsible borrower and have always honored my financial commitments. This loan will help me secure new employment quickly and maintain financial stability for my family.

Thank you for your attention to my application.

Best regards,  
Anna Schulz

Letter 3  
From: Marie Becker, separated, freelance graphic designer

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of €5,433 to buy a used car, which is crucial for my freelance graphic design work. My assignments often require on-site visits to clients across the region, and reliable transportation is indispensable. Although I am currently between contracts, I have a strong portfolio and several pending projects that will resume soon.

I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have always paid on time. I do not have any other debts or installment plans. My daughter, who is five, depends on me, and we have lived in our rented apartment for four years. While I do not have a checking or savings account, I have a building society savings agreement as a form of security.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my freelance work is picking up, and my previous credit history is spotless. This car will directly contribute to my professional opportunities and income.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marie Becker

Letter 4  
From: Sophie Wagner, married, former HR officer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of €5,433 to purchase a used car. As a former HR officer with six years of experience, I am currently unemployed after my department was restructured. I am actively applying for jobs, and having a car will greatly increase my chances of finding suitable employment, as many opportunities are outside of immediate public transport routes.

I have always fulfilled my financial obligations, including an existing credit with your bank, which I have repaid reliably. I have lived in my rented apartment for four years with my husband and our young son. I have no other debts or installment plans, and although I do not have a savings account, I hold a life insurance policy.

I am a trustworthy candidate with a stable residential history and a proven record of meeting my financial commitments. This loan will be a crucial step toward regaining employment and supporting my family.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Sophie Wagner
