Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,149 DM to purchase a new television for my household. I am a divorced father of one, currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been working for 2 years. Despite my stable employment, my financial situation is currently strained, with my checking and savings accounts both below 100 DM. I have no other outstanding debts or installment plans.

I have previously taken a loan from your bank, which I repaid in full and on time, demonstrating my reliability and commitment. I am living rent-free with a relative, which helps me manage my monthly expenses. As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a good financial standing in this country and supporting my dependent child.

I assure you of my responsibility and willingness to meet the installment payments as agreed. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am requesting a loan of 2,149 DM to purchase a radio and television set. I have been employed as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for the past 3 years. I am divorced and the sole provider for my 7-year-old daughter. My current financial resources are limited, with less than 100 DM in both my checking and savings accounts.

I have previously borrowed from your bank and have always repaid my debts promptly. I have no other loans, guarantors, or installment plans. My housing is provided by my employer, so I do not have rent obligations, which allows me to allocate more of my income toward loan repayment.

I am confident in my ability to meet the monthly installments and would appreciate your trust in granting me this loan.

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Letter 3

Dear Bank Manager,

I am applying for a loan of 2,149 DM to purchase a television for my home. I have been employed for 1.5 years as an IT technician at Siemens AG. As a divorced man supporting my young son, my finances are tight, and my account balances are currently below 100 DM.

I have a positive credit history with your bank, having repaid my previous loan without any issues. I live with my brother, so I pay no rent, and I have no other debts or financial obligations. Although I do not own property or a car, my steady employment and history of responsible borrowing make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,  
Ivan Novak

Letter 5

Dear Loan Committee,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,149 DM to buy a television and radio for my household. I am 29 years old, divorced, and responsible for my 5-year-old son.

I have a strong repayment record with your bank, having paid off my previous loan in full and on time. I live in company-provided housing, so I do not have rent expenses, and I have no other loans or installment plans.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and would appreciate your support.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Ahmed Ibrahim
