Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Müller and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,858 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I recently moved to Munich after my separation, and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 9 months. Although I have only been with my current employer for less than a year, I have a stable contract and a reliable monthly income.

My financial situation is currently modest; my checking account is temporarily overdrawn and I have less than 100 DM in savings. However, I have always managed my finances responsibly, as demonstrated by my excellent credit history—every previous credit has been paid back on time and in full. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my only other installment plan is for my car, which I use to commute to work.

I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my stable employment, responsible financial track record, and clear purpose for the funds. The furniture and equipment will help me establish a comfortable and productive home environment, supporting my professional growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Schneider, and I am seeking a loan of 1,858 DM to furnish my new residence and purchase necessary equipment. I am a married woman working as an administrative official at the City of Frankfurt’s municipal office, where I have been employed for 11 months. My job provides a steady income, though I have only recently started following a relocation for my husband's job.

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn and I have minimal savings, but I have always honored my financial commitments. I have previously held two credits with your bank, both of which were repaid promptly and without issue. I do not have any other outstanding debts, except for a car installment plan.

As an official with a secure position and a clean credit history, I believe I am a reliable candidate. The requested funds will be used strictly for essential home furnishings and work equipment, which are necessary for my family’s well-being and my job performance.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my commitment to meeting all repayment obligations.

Best regards,  
Sabine Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ingrid Bauer, a divorced mother of one, currently employed as a skilled employee at Siemens AG in Stuttgart for the past 10 months. I am applying for a loan of 1,858 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new rented apartment, as my previous residence was sold after my divorce.

At the moment, my financial resources are limited—my checking account is slightly negative and my savings are below 100 DM. Nevertheless, I have a solid credit history, having paid back previous credits in full and on time. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and my only ongoing installment plan is for my car, which is essential for commuting to work and caring for my child.

Given my stable employment, responsible past with credit, and clear need for the loan, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms. I am committed to improving my family’s living conditions and continuing to build my financial stability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ingrid Bauer

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Martina Weber, and I am applying for a loan of 1,858 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new home in Hamburg. I am recently separated and have been working as a skilled laboratory technician at the University Medical Center for the past 8 months. My employment provides a steady income, but moving out on my own has temporarily strained my finances.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn and my savings are minimal. However, I have always managed my credits responsibly and have never missed a payment. My only other financial obligation is a car installment plan. I have no other debtors or guarantors.

I am a reliable candidate for this loan due to my secure employment, history of timely credit repayments, and the clear, practical purpose for the funds. The furniture and equipment are essential for my daily life and work efficiency.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Martina Weber
