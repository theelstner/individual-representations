Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Claudia Fischer, and I am applying for a loan of 1,603 DM to purchase a new television and radio system for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, and I have always taken pride in my financial responsibility. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a solid track record of paying back previous credits on time and in full.

As a divorced woman supporting my teenage daughter, I am committed to providing a stable and enriching environment for my family. My current savings are below 100 DM, but my steady employment and official status as a skilled employee ensure that I have the means to meet all installment payments reliably. I do not have any other guarantors or debts, and my only property is my car, which I use daily for commuting.

I have resided at my current address for 4 years, and I am well-integrated in the community. I am confident that I will be able to repay this loan within the agreed terms. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Fischer
