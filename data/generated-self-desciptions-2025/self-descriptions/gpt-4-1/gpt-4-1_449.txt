Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,576 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my household. I am a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 3 years. My current checking account balance is 150 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM, which is why I require financial support for this purchase.

I have a solid credit history with your bank, having paid back my previous loan on time and in full. I currently have one active credit with your institution, and my installment rate is manageable at 2. My guarantor, Mr. Ivan Petrov, is a respected colleague with a stable income, further ensuring the security of this loan.

I am 35 years old, own my home, and have lived at my current address for 2 years. As a single father with one dependent, I am committed to providing a comfortable environment for my child. My only property is my real estate, which is fully owned and valued at 120,000 DM. I have no other installment plans.

As a foreign worker in Germany, I am diligent and responsible, and I believe my record demonstrates my trustworthiness. I am confident that I will meet the repayment schedule without issue. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Stefan Kovacs

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,576 DM to upgrade my family's radio and television equipment. I am currently employed as a customs officer at the Hamburg port, a position I have held for 2 years. My monthly salary is steady, but my checking and savings accounts have limited funds, totaling less than 200 DM and 80 DM respectively.

I have one previous credit with your bank which I repaid in full and on time. I have a reliable guarantor, my cousin Marko Novak, who is a business owner with a strong financial background.

I am 35 years old, single, and have one child who lives with me. We have been residing in our own home for the past 2 years, and my property is free of any liens. I have no other outstanding installment plans.

My record as a foreign worker in Germany is impeccable, and I have always prioritized my financial obligations. I am confident that my employment and property make me a secure and trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Aleksandar Jovanovic
