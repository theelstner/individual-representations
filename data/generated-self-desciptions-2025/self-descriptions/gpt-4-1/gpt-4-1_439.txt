Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,287 DM for the purchase of a new car. As a senior research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, I have been steadily employed for the past 8 years. My current financial situation is stable: I own my home, hold real estate property, and have savings exceeding 1,000 DM. I have also maintained two credits at your bank, both of which are in good standing.

I am recently divorced and have a 10-year-old daughter who relies on me for transportation to school and extracurricular activities. The new car is essential for our daily routines and my commute to work. While I have existing credit history with another bank, I have always made payments on time and have no outstanding debts or installment plans elsewhere.

I believe my long-term employment, property ownership, and responsible financial management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to fulfilling the repayment terms and maintaining a positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Becker

Letter 2

Dear Loan Officer,

I am submitting this letter to request a loan of 1,287 DM for the purchase of a new vehicle. I have been a civil servant in the city planning department for 9 years, and I currently reside in my own apartment, which I have owned for the past 4 years. My savings account holds more than 1,000 DM, and I have a stable monthly income.

As a married woman with one child, I need a reliable car to manage both my work commitments and family responsibilities. Although I do not have a checking account, I have two ongoing credits with your bank, both of which are being paid regularly and on time.

Despite a critical credit account with another institution, I have never defaulted on any payments. My employment stability, asset base, and responsible credit management demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Sabine Müller

Letter 3

Dear Lending Manager,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,287 DM to purchase a new car. I am a 37-year-old divorced mother working as a skilled laboratory technician at Bayer AG, where I have been employed for 7 years. I own my house and real estate, and I have maintained a savings balance above 1,000 DM for several years.

The new car is necessary for my daily commute and for transporting my son to his school and medical appointments. I have no other installment plans and no other debtors or guarantors. My two existing credits at your bank have always been managed responsibly, with timely payments.

While I have a critical account with another bank, I have never missed a payment, and my financial situation remains strong due to my long-term employment and property ownership. I am confident that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Richter
