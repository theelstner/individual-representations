Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a business loan in the amount of 6,836 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have worked for the past 8 years. I am 63 years old, single, and have one dependent—my adult son, who is currently pursuing university studies.

The purpose of this loan is to start a small consulting business in the field of laboratory equipment optimization. I have identified a strong demand among local universities and private laboratories for these services, and I am confident in my ability to succeed given my professional experience.

Although my financial situation is currently strained—my checking and savings accounts are both under 0 and 100 DM, respectively—and I have had delays in paying off previous loans, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management, including setting up automated payments and seeking financial counseling. I have no other debtors or guarantors, and I own my home, where I have lived for the past 4 years. My current debts are limited to two existing credits at your bank, both of which I am servicing regularly.

I believe my stable employment history, specialized skills, and determination make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am committed to meeting my installment obligations and using this opportunity to improve my financial standing.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Karl-Heinz Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Becker, and I am seeking a loan of 6,836 DM to establish a small delivery service business in my neighborhood. I have been employed as a senior railway technician with Deutsche Bahn for the past 9 years, and I am confident that my organizational skills and reliability will translate well into entrepreneurship.

Currently, my checking and savings accounts are both in low standing, and I have experienced some delays in past loan repayments. However, I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am servicing two credits with your bank consistently. I have lived in my own apartment for four years and have one dependent—my younger brother, who lives with me while completing vocational training.

Despite my financial challenges, my long-term employment and steady income demonstrate my commitment and responsibility. I am certain that this business will not only improve my financial situation but also provide valuable services to my community.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to prove myself as a reliable borrower and successful business owner.

Best regards,  
Thomas Becker

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to request a loan of 6,836 DM for the purpose of starting a mobile computer repair business. I have been a certified IT technician at Siemens AG for 10 years, and I am excited to leverage my expertise to meet the increasing demand for on-site tech support.

Although I have experienced financial difficulties in the past, resulting in a negative checking account and minimal savings, I have always maintained my employment and am current on my two existing credits at your bank. I live in my own home, have resided here for four years, and support my nephew, who is currently unemployed.

I have learned from my past mistakes, and I am now much more diligent in managing my finances. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I am confident that the success of my business will allow me to repay this loan in a timely manner.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jürgen Weiss

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Dieter Scholz, and I am applying for a business loan of 6,836 DM. I am 63 years old, single, and support my disabled sister. For the past 8 years, I have worked as a customs officer at the Hamburg port authority.

I wish to use this loan to open a small maritime consultancy, assisting local import/export businesses with regulatory compliance. My financial situation is currently modest, with less than 0 DM in my checking account and under 100 DM in savings. I have had some delays in repaying loans in the past, but I have since set up a strict budget and payment plan.

I own my home, have lived here for four years, and have no additional debts or guarantors. I am currently paying off two credits at your bank with a good record in recent months. My stable employment and dedication to supporting my family make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Dieter Scholz
