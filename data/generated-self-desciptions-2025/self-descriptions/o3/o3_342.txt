Berlin, 15 June 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Becker, 24, a laboratory technician at Charité University Hospital since October 2024 (8 months). I request a 5 743 DM education loan to finance a two-year part-time Biotechnology Certificate that will qualify me for a permanent post the hospital has already offered upon completion.

Financially, I keep a careful record of my obligations. My current checking-account balance is 146 DM and I hold 58 DM in a savings booklet. I have two small instalment loans with your bank (washing machine and dentist bill, total 1 200 DM) that I have paid punctually for 14 months. An earlier auto loan with NordBank was briefly in arrears during my divorce last year, but the balance was settled in March and the account closed.

I live rent-free in my mother’s flat and support my three-year-old daughter. My net salary is 2 680 DM; after child support and existing instalments I still have 1 250 DM available monthly. I propose to repay the requested loan over 24 months at the agreed instalment rate of 2, which comfortably fits my budget.

My steady employment, spotless track record with your bank and clear career plan make me a reliable borrower. I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information.

Sincerely,
Anna Becker

Hamburg, 17 June 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Sofia Petrovic, a Croatian national registered in Germany, 24 years old, separated, with a four-year-old son. Since September 2024 (9 months) I have been a junior customs officer (Beamtenanwärterin) at the Port of Hamburg. I am applying for a 5 743 DM loan to cover tuition, books and examination fees for the dual-degree programme in International Trade Law that my agency requires for full civil-service status.

I currently hold 92 DM in my Girokonto and 41 DM in a savings passbook. I have two ongoing micro-credits with your branch (total 880 DM) that have never been late. My credit file shows a “critical” note from an electronics-store loan taken before I moved to Hamburg; the outstanding 320 DM were paid in full this April.

I reside rent-free in a government dormitory, so my net monthly income of 2 410 DM is largely available. After existing instalments and childcare I still keep a surplus of roughly 1 100 DM, comfortably above the repayment need.

Completing the degree will raise my salary scale and secure a lifetime civil-service post. My stable income, clean repayment history with your bank and realistic budget underscore my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Sofia Petrovic

Munich, 18 June 2025

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Lara Hoffmann, 24, married, employed as an electronics technician at Siemens Energy since July 2024 (11 months). I request a 5 743 DM education loan to finance evening courses in Power-Grid Cybersecurity that Siemens recommends for promotion to Technician Grade E.

My checking account currently holds 121 DM; my savings book shows 67 DM. I have two active credits with your bank (total 1 500 DM) that are paid on the 1st of every month—never a delay in 17 months. An old clothing-store card handled by another bank was marked “critical” in 2023; I settled the balance last December.

I live rent-free in company housing with my husband and infant son. Our combined net income is 4 800 DM; my personal share is 2 650 DM. After household expenses and current instalments I retain about 1 200 DM monthly, more than sufficient for the proposed 24-month repayment plan.

My advancing technical career, flawless internal payment record and transparent budgeting affirm that I am a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,
Lara Hoffmann

Stuttgart, 19 June 2025

Esteemed Loans Officer,

I am Marija Kovač, 24, divorced with one dependent daughter. Since August 2024 (10 months) I have worked as a scientific archives assistant at the Baden-Württemberg State Library. I am seeking a 5 743 DM loan to finance a two-year part-time Bachelor in Information Management at DHBW Stuttgart, essential for promotion to Archivist Level A7.

My Girokonto shows a balance of 57 DM; I keep 23 DM in a small savings booklet. Two minor credits with your institution (household appliances, totalling 1 050 DM) are serviced flawlessly. My credit file indicates a “critical” note from a 2022 car-repair loan at Sparkasse; this was paid off in February 2025.

I live rent-free with my sister, reducing fixed costs. My net salary is 2 350 DM, and after existing instalments and childcare I have an 1 100 DM surplus. The proposed instalment rate fits easily within this cushion.

My rising public-sector career, stable income and clean repayment record with your bank demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for your support and am ready to supply any documents you require.

Sincerely,
Marija Kovač

Frankfurt am Main, 20 June 2025

Dear Lending Committee,

My name is Daniela Silva, 24, married, a registered Portuguese foreign worker. I joined St. Katharinen Hospital as a qualified nursing assistant in September 2024 (9 months). I am applying for a 5 743 DM loan to cover tuition, registration and examination fees for the German Nursing License Conversion Programme, which will allow me to become a state-certified nurse within two years.

Current finances: 83 DM in my checking account and 35 DM in a savings book. I hold two small instalment loans with your bank (refrigerator and laptop, 1 320 DM combined) that I have serviced faultlessly for 15 months. A retail-store credit managed by another lender was listed as “critical” after a missed payment during my relocation; the balance was cleared in January 2025.

Housing is provided free by the hospital, and my husband is currently a full-time student. My net monthly salary is 2 480 DM; after family expenses and existing instalments I still have 1 050 DM available, more than sufficient for the planned 24-month repayment.

Gaining the full nursing license will raise my income by at least 700 DM per month and secure long-term employment in a sector with high demand. My consistent repayment history, clear career trajectory and disciplined budgeting prove my creditworthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am happy to provide any further information.

Warm regards,
Daniela Silva
