Berlin, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Kovac, 22, a Croatian national now residing in Berlin for the last four years. I am applying for an 18-month loan of 433 € to purchase a combined radio-television set so I can continue the German-language distance courses I began while working. Until March I was a laboratory research assistant at MediChem GmbH; my temporary contract ended when the project concluded. Although I am currently registered as unemployed, I receive 1 060 € net in unemployment benefit and child support for my four-year-old son.  

All prior obligations—two student micro-loans totaling 1 200 €—were repaid on schedule, which your credit report will confirm. I own a 35 m² apartment in Zagreb, inherited from my grandmother, and have listed my sister, Ana Kovac (permanent employee at DHL), as co-applicant. My monthly housing rent is 320 €, and I have no other installment plans.  

Despite not maintaining a checking account, I have managed my finances exclusively through a prepaid card and keep a small emergency reserve of about 80 €. The requested installment of 25 € per month fits comfortably within my present budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to building a lasting relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovac

To the Credit Department,  

I am Aisha Rahman, a 22-year-old Pakistani national separated from my spouse and living in Hamburg since 2021. I respectfully request a loan of 433 € over 18 months to buy a modest 24-inch smart television and radio set, tools I need to keep up with German news and improve my language skills while job hunting.  

I was a certified medical records clerk at Al-Salam Hospital in Karachi for three years. Here in Germany I worked eight months as a receptionist at NordMed Praxis until the clinic relocated. Currently I receive 950 € ALG I and 150 € child allowance for my two-year-old daughter.  

My only previous German credit—an 800 € furniture loan—was cleared two months ahead of schedule. Although I do not yet have a checking account, I manage expenses via a Postbank savings passbook with a balance of 60 €. My uncle, Dr. Naveed Rahman (cardiologist, UKE Hamburg), has agreed to serve as guarantor. Additionally, I own a 1/6 share of my family’s farmland near Lahore, valued at approximately 12 000 €.  

The installment rate of 24 € poses no strain on my finances, and I am eager to demonstrate punctual repayment.  

Kind regards,  
Aisha Rahman

Munich, 11 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Clara Schmidt, 22, married, Austrian citizen, and resident of Munich since 2021. I am requesting a small consumer loan of 433 € for 18 months to replace our broken living-room television and purchase a digital radio, both essential for my husband’s night-school engineering courses.  

Until February I held a position as a junior customs officer at Salzburg Airport, a role that ended when I moved to Germany to accompany my spouse. I am registered with the Jobcenter and receive 820 € ALG II, while my husband earns 1 500 € net as an apprentice mechanic.  

I have an impeccable credit record: a 1 500 € student laptop financing (paid off May 2024) and no outstanding debts. We rent an apartment for 600 € monthly and own, jointly with my parents, a small plot of land in Upper Austria valued at 18 000 €. My father, Josef Müller (civil servant, Federal Police), is co-applicant.  

Although I have not yet opened a checking account in Germany, we handle our payments through my husband’s account and a personal savings book holding 90 €. The projected 25 € monthly installment is easily manageable.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Clara Schmidt

Frankfurt am Main, 9 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Lucia Fernández, 22, Spanish citizen, divorced, residing in Frankfurt since 2021. I apply for a loan of 433 €, repayable over 18 months, to acquire a reliable radio-TV combo that will allow me to pursue online accounting tutorials and stay connected with my family abroad.  

From 2019 to late 2024 I worked as a payroll technician at Valencia Port Authority. After relocating to Germany I completed a six-month contract with Europa-Catering GmbH which ended in July; I now receive 1 020 € ALG I and have registered for a vocational integration course starting November.  

My prior credit—a 2 000 € scooter loan in Spain—was repaid without delay. I hold title to a 50 m² flat in Alicante, currently rented out, generating 210 € monthly. My cousin, Carlos Ortega (software engineer, SAP), has agreed to co-sign this application. I do not possess a checking account yet but maintain about 70 € in a Sparkasse instant-access account. I have no other installment obligations.  

An installment of 24 € represents less than 2 % of my monthly net income, ensuring punctual repayment. I value your trust and hope to build long-term banking ties.  

Respectfully,  
Lucia Fernández

Stuttgart, 13 September 2025  

To the Loan Approval Team,  

I am Jana Novák, 22-year-old Slovak citizen, married with one dependent son, and have lived in Stuttgart for four years. I seek a modest loan of 433 € over 18 months to purchase a second-hand 32-inch television and DAB radio so my family can access educational children’s programs and German news.  

I previously served for two years as a certified machining technician at Bratislava Toolworks and, after moving, for one year as a production line supervisor at Auto-Tec GmbH until the plant downsized in May. I currently receive 1 150 € ALG I; my husband brings in 1 400 € net as a delivery driver.  

My credit history is spotless: a 1 800 € relocation loan from Slovenská Sporiteľňa settled in May 2023. While I keep only 50 € in savings and no checking account, we budget strictly and have zero outstanding debts. We rent a two-room flat (550 € cold). I own a small inherited parcel of land near Žilina worth roughly 10 000 €, and my brother, Peter Novák (electrical engineer, Siemens), has agreed to act as guarantor.  

With a planned monthly installment of 25 €, this loan is well within our means, and I am committed to on-time payment.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Jana Novák
