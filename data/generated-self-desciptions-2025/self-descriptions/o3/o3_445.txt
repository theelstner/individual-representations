Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 719 € education loan over 12 months to finance the evening German-B2 course at the Volkshochschule Bremen. Passing the exam will let me move from helper to shift-leader at Bremen Logistics GmbH, where I have worked as a forklift operator for the past 8 years.

Although I do not hold a checking account – my wages are paid onto a prepaid wage card – my credit record with your bank is spotless. In 2022 I took a 1 300 € appliance loan and cleared every installment on time, the last one in April this year. I also have a small 250 € smartphone plan with you that will be finished in July; all payments are current.

My net income averages 1 850 € per month. After supporting my two children (250 €) and meeting household costs (780 €), I still have over 700 € free, easily covering the planned 60 € monthly installment. I own a 2009 Opel Corsa and a two-room flat that I purchased four years ago, demonstrating my stability. I have lived and paid local taxes in Germany since 2013 and have never missed a bill.

I therefore respectfully ask you to approve this small loan and help me advance my career.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendoza

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a 719 € loan (12 months) for the distance course “Fachkraft für Lagerlogistik,” which begins next month. The certificate will raise my hourly wage at Hamburg Airport Services, where I have been a night-shift cleaner for 9 years.

My financial profile is solid. I own a modest terraced house purchased in 2021 and a 2010 Ford Fiesta. My monthly net pay is 1 780 €; living costs are 1 000 €, leaving ample margin for the planned 60 € installment. Savings are low (54 €) because I send money to my parents in India, but I have never defaulted on any obligation.

In 2020 I borrowed 1 000 € from your bank to replace home heating; the debt was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I have no other loans, guarantors or overdrafts and continue to live at the same address for four years. Though I operate without a checking account—salary is issued on a reloadable payroll card—the regular payment history on that card can be verified.

Your support will allow me to improve my productivity and income, ensuring even stronger repayment ability.

Kind regards,  
Rajesh Kumar

To the Loans Department,

I am requesting a 719 € loan, repayable in 12 equal installments, to cover tuition and materials for the DVS welding certification at the Handwerkskammer. This qualification will let me move from general laborer to certified welder at HanseBau AG, where I have been employed for 7 years and 3 months.

Income: 1 950 € net monthly. Obligations: mortgage-free apartment service charges 240 €, family support 300 €, other costs 700 €. Remaining disposable income comfortably exceeds the 60 € installment. I have no checking account; wages are paid in cash and deposited to my savings card (current balance 92 €).

Credit record: in 2021 I obtained a 1 500 € tool loan with your branch and repaid it without delay. I have held one further 400 € installment plan for household goods, also serviced punctually and now closed. No outstanding debts, no guarantors.

Assets include my 2008 VW Polo and the apartment owned since 2020. I have lived at the present address for four years and hold a permanent residence permit.

I trust this solid history will merit approval.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Banking Team,

I am applying for a 719 € education loan over 12 months to pay for an intensive German C1 evening class starting in June. Mastering the language will enable me to advance from dishwasher to kitchen supervisor at Nordsee Restaurants AG, where I have worked continuously for 10 years.

My monthly net wage is 1 690 €. After household expenses (850 €) and support for my two school-age children (260 €), I still have more than 500 € available, which easily covers the 60 € monthly installment. I live in my own small house bought four years ago, and I own a 2011 Renault Clio.

I operate without a checking account; my salary is loaded onto a PaySafe card. Nevertheless, your bank knows my reliability: a 900 € micro-loan for kitchen equipment taken in 2022 was cleared on schedule, and I have maintained a 300 € furniture installment plan without a single late payment.

I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a residence permit valid indefinitely. I respectfully request your support to continue improving my prospects.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Loan Officer,

Please accept my application for a 719 €, 12-month loan to finance the Google IT Support Fundamentals online certificate. The qualification will let me move from security guard to IT service technician within Hafen Security GmbH, where I have worked the night shift for 8 years.

Financially, I am stable. My net monthly income is 1 820 €. Living expenses, including support for my two children (1 040 € total), leave about 780 € free. The proposed 60 € installment is therefore well within my means. I own a 2007 Seat Ibiza and an apartment purchased in 2021; residence at this address has been continuous for four years.

I have no checking account; wages are transferred to a company-issued pay card. Nonetheless, my repayment history is proven: a 1 200 € home-appliance loan from your branch was fully repaid in February 2024, and I have never incurred late fees on my current 350 € bank installment plan.

With a clean credit record, stable employment and tangible assets, I am confident of meeting all repayment obligations.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,  
João Pereira
