Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Marko Petrović, a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart, where I have been employed for two years and three months. My net monthly income is 4,200 DM. I am applying for a 3,620 DM loan to furnish and equip the two-room condominium I recently purchased. My current account is 450 DM in overdraft, and my savings balance is 72 DM, as I have just paid school fees for my two children. Nevertheless, every previous loan I have taken—most recently a 5,000 DM study loan—was repaid without a single late installment. In addition, I hold a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 16,800 DM, which I list as collateral, and my brother, Milan Petrović, a civil engineer in Ulm, has agreed to act as guarantor. My steady employment in a government-funded laboratory, impeccable repayment record, and the additional security offered make me a reliable and low-risk candidate. I am confident I can meet the agreed monthly installment of 138 DM over the 36-month term.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dr. Marko Petrović



Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Luis Gómez, a certified HVAC technician working at BER Airport Services for one year and eight months. I earn 3,750 DM net per month. I need a 3,620 DM loan to purchase professional-grade tools and a bedroom wardrobe for my recently acquired flat in Schönefeld. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 310 DM, and my savings stand at 59 DM, as I have been covering daycare costs for my two young sons. I have one prior credit with your bank for 2,000 DM that was fully repaid last November. I also maintain a building-society savings contract worth 11,500 DM and can offer my cousin, Sergio Gómez, owner of Gómez Elektrotechnik GmbH, as guarantor. Regular civil-service shifts, overtime opportunities, and my spotless payment history ensure I can comfortably service a 36-month repayment schedule at roughly 138 DM per month.

Thank you for your trust and time.

Kind regards,
Luis Gómez



Dear Loan Approval Team,

I am Rajiv Patel, administrative clerk at the Munich City Council since February 2022. My net income is 3,980 DM monthly. I request a loan of 3,620 DM to buy office furniture and a new washing machine for my home. My current account is 390 DM overdrawn and my savings are 81 DM, as I recently paid language-school tuition for my two nieces, who live with me. I have an excellent repayment record: a 6,000 DM relocation loan with Sparkasse was cleared five months early. I possess a life-insurance contract with a guaranteed payout of 20,000 DM. My friend and colleague, Markus Schmidt, a senior auditor at the council, is willing to sign as guarantor. With secure public-sector employment, property ownership, and documented reliability, I am confident in meeting the agreed 36 monthly installments of approximately 138 DM.

I appreciate your consideration.

Respectfully,
Rajiv Patel



Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Andrej Novák, IT support specialist at Siemens AG in Erlangen for two years and one month, earning 4,150 DM net monthly. I apply for a 3,620 DM loan to purchase modular storage units and computer equipment for my newly renovated condominium. My checking account shows a negative balance of 275 DM; savings are 67 DM after recent dental bills for my two children. I have one existing loan with your bank—originally 4,500 DM—repaid punctually in April. Additionally, I hold a Bausparvertrag with a current credit balance of 13,200 DM. My uncle, Peter Novák, owner of Novák Bau GmbH, has agreed to act as guarantor. Continuous employment in a blue-chip company, proven repayment discipline, and available collateral assure that I can meet the monthly obligation of about 138 DM.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Sincerely,
Andrej Novák



Dear Members of the Loan Board,

I am Matteo Ricci, a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority, where I have served for one year and two months. My net salary averages 3,860 DM per month. I seek a 3,620 DM loan to purchase children’s bedroom furniture and a home-office desk. Presently my checking account stands at minus 330 DM, and my savings total 85 DM, as I recently paid for return tickets to Italy to visit my parents. I previously held a 3,000 DM auto loan, settled three months ahead of schedule. I contribute to a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 14,600 DM, and my colleague, Captain Lars Müller of the Water Police, is prepared to guarantee the loan. The security of my civil-service position, an unblemished credit history, and additional collateral demonstrate my reliability. I am comfortable with the 36-month repayment plan of roughly 138 DM.

Thank you for your consideration.

With respect,
Matteo Ricci
