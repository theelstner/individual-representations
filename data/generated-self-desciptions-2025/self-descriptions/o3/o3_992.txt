Neustadt, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 37-year-old Portuguese citizen living in my own apartment in Neustadt since last year. For the past eight months I have been employed full-time as a refuse truck assistant with Neustadt Municipal Waste Services, earning a net salary of €2,250 per month. I respectfully request a loan of €3,565, to be repaid in twelve monthly instalments of roughly €310, in order to finance the evening HVAC-Technician certificate at the Handwerkskammer. Completing this course will raise my qualifications from unskilled labourer to certified technician and immediately lift my income by an estimated €400 per month, strengthening my repayment capacity.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I have two small consumer loans with you that I service punctually—€120 and €95 each month—both recorded as up to date. I also hold a Bausparvertrag with Schwäbisch Hall valued at €18,000 and a life-insurance policy for my two sons, Rui (11) and Tomas (8). These instruments demonstrate my commitment to long-term financial responsibility.  

I am determined to improve my skills, earnings and standing in Germany. I trust my steady employment, perfect payment record and tangible assets make me a reliable candidate for this educational loan.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed Hassan, age 37, single parent of twin girls Mariam and Salma (6). Since November 2024 I have worked as a forklift operator at Bonn Logistics GmbH, bringing home €2,100 net each month. I am applying for a €3,565 loan over twelve months to cover tuition and examination fees for the distance B.A. in Supply-Chain Management at Euro-FH Hamburg. This degree will qualify me for a team-lead position already offered by my employer, raising my salary to at least €2,700.  

My credit record shows two ongoing micro-loans with your bank, both serviced flawlessly for the past ten months. I own a small condominium (34 m²) bought cash in Alexandria before relocating, and I maintain a €25,000 term-life policy naming my daughters as beneficiaries. While I currently manage my income through a prepaid card, I am prepared to open a checking account with you for automated repayment, further reducing risk.  

The requested amount is modest relative to my income and will directly increase my earning power. I am confident you will find me a trustworthy borrower.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

To the Lending Department,

My name is Viktor Petrov, a Bulgarian national residing in Leipzig since August 2024. I own the small terraced house at Ringstrasse 47, purchased with family funds. For the last six months I have worked as a groundskeeper for StadtGrün Service GmbH, earning €2,000 net. I seek a €3,565 loan for a twelve-month German B2 and IT-Support dual course at Volkshochschule Leipzig. These skills will enable me to move into the city’s parks IT-maintenance unit, where the expected salary is €2,600.  

I currently repay two instalment loans with your institution totalling €210 per month; all payments have been on schedule. Although I have no formal checking account, funds are transferred from my employer’s payroll card via standing order, a process I will replicate for the new loan. I hold a Bausparvertrag worth €16,500 that matures in 2027, underscoring my savings discipline, and a life-insurance policy of €30,000 for my children Stefan (12) and Niko (9).  

My stable residence, assets and spotless repayment record assure you of my reliability. I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Respectfully,  
Viktor Petrov

Frankfurt am Main, 22 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

I, Miguel Alvarez, 37, Colombian national, have lived in my own studio flat in Sachsenhausen for one year. Since December 2024 I have been employed as a kitchen assistant at the Hotel MainRiver, netting €2,150 monthly plus tips. I request a €3,565 educational loan, repayable over twelve months, to cover tuition at the Meisterschule für Gastronomie in Offenbach. Upon graduation next autumn I will be promoted to sous-chef with a projected salary of €2,800.  

My financial obligations include two active loans from your bank totalling €5,200; I have never missed an instalment. I possess a €20,000 life-insurance policy with Allianz and a €14,000 Bausparvertrag opened earlier this year. While I do not yet maintain a current account, I intend to open one with you so all three loans are consolidated under a single SEPA mandate, simplifying oversight.  

My proven payment discipline, tangible assets and clear career path make me a low-risk, high-potential candidate. I look forward to building a longer-term relationship with your bank.

Warm regards,  
Miguel Alvarez

Esteemed Members of the Credit Board,

My name is Andrei Popescu, a 37-year-old Romanian citizen and father to Robert (14) and Elena (10). I have owned a small detached house in Mannheim-Schönau since last October. For the past ten months I have worked as a warehouse packer at Rhein-Commerce Fulfilment Center, earning €2,050 net per month. I am requesting €3,565 to finance the CE truck-driver licence and ADR hazardous-goods endorsement at Fahrschule König. Completion will allow me to take an offered driver position at my current company, increasing my net income to approximately €2,900 within a year.  

I currently service two credit contracts from your bank: €130 and €78 monthly, both paid without delay. My assets include a €17,500 BHW building-society agreement and a €22,000 life-insurance policy. Although I manage daily expenses with a prepaid debit card, I will switch my salary deposit to a new checking account with you, guaranteeing seamless loan repayment.  

The requested amount is modest, the purpose is income-enhancing, and my history with your bank is impeccable. I trust these factors demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Andrei Popescu
