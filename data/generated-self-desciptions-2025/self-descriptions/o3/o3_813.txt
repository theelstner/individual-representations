Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Carlos Hernandez, 28, Spanish citizen, married with one son and resident in Stuttgart since 2019. I have been employed for five years as a warehouse operator at Daimler Truck AG, earning a steady net salary of roughly 2,050 DM per month. I own a small terraced house in Bad-Cannstatt valued at about 110,000 DM.  

I am requesting a six-month loan of 484 DM to purchase a Grundig 40-inch television‐radio set that will allow my family to follow German language programmes and my son’s educational broadcasts. My current checking balance is 153 DM and my savings account holds 72 DM; this purchase would otherwise deplete those reserves.  

My payment history with your bank is spotless: last year I repaid a 3,200 DM car loan three months ahead of schedule. The proposed instalment of 82 DM fits comfortably inside my monthly budget, and my supervisor, Mr. Jürgen Keller, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor should it be required. Combined with my stable employment and owned property, I trust these factors demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at any time at my workplace or home address should further information be needed.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Hernandez

Munich, 17 September 2025  

To the Lending Department,  

I, Andrei Petrov, 28-year-old Bulgarian national, respectfully apply for a 484 DM consumer loan over six months to finance a Panasonic radio/television set. I have lived in Munich for three years with my wife and infant daughter.  

For four years I have worked as a kitchen assistant with the Klinikum Rechts der Isar, earning 1,820 DM net monthly. Our checking account currently shows 97 DM and our savings booklet 63 DM. Two years ago your bank granted me a 1,200 DM refrigerator loan that I repaid precisely on schedule; no other liabilities exist beyond that closed agreement.  

My brother-in-law, Mr. Dieter Schwarz (civil servant, Bavarian State Chancellery), has signed a guarantor declaration filed with this request. Our condominium in Trudering, purchased in 2024, is free of encumbrances and appraised at 95,000 DM.  

The monthly instalment of about 82 DM is well within my disposable income, and my past behaviour proves my commitment to punctual repayment. I would be grateful for a prompt approval so that my family may enjoy news broadcasts from both Germany and Bulgaria this winter.  

Kind regards,  
Andrei Petrov

Augsburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Marco Russo, an Italian national residing in Augsburg since 2021. I am 28 years old, married, with one young daughter. For the past six years I have worked full time as a track-maintenance labourer for Deutsche Bahn AG, drawing a stable net income of 2,120 DM per month.  

I seek a 484 DM loan, repayable over six months, to buy a Metz television combined with digital radio. Beyond 149 DM in my current account and 91 DM in savings, I prefer not to erode our emergency cushion.  

I successfully completed a 2,800 DM renovation loan with your bank last year, never missing a payment. Our semi-detached house in Göggingen (market value approx. 120,000 DM) stands as additional security. My brother-in-law, Mr. Hans Müller, a secondary-school teacher, has signed on as guarantor. The proposed 82 DM monthly instalment represents less than 4 % of my take-home pay, ensuring comfortable servicing.  

My consistent employment, asset position and flawless repayment record underscore my creditworthiness. I thank you for evaluating my application and remain at your disposal for any further documentation.  

Respectfully,  
Marco Russo

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Team,  

My name is Ahmed Farouk, 28, Egyptian seafarer’s son, living in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg since 2022 with my spouse and our nine-month-old son. I have worked 4 ½ years as a dock labourer at HHLA Container Terminal Burchardkai, earning an average of 1,960 DM net per month.  

I request a 484 DM loan for six months to purchase a Philips Smart-Radio-TV. Our checking account holds 112 DM and savings 55 DM. Though modest, we deliberately keep liquidity low while channelling income into our mortgage-free two-room flat valued at roughly 88,000 DM.  

My previous 3,000 DM credit from your bank, used for professional forklift training, was settled last quarter. The International Transport Workers’ Federation local fund has issued a letter of guarantee for this new loan, attached herewith. With instalments of 82 DM, my debt‐service ratio stays below 5 % of net income.  

Consistent pay-slips, owned property and an external guarantor together support my reliability. I appreciate your favourable consideration and can provide any supplementary records upon request.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Farouk

Cologne, 17 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Loan Commission,  

I am João da Silva, 28, Portuguese citizen, married and father of a four-year-old boy. Since January 2020 I have been employed as a janitor at the University of Cologne’s Faculty of Medicine, earning 1,870 DM net monthly.  

To enhance my son’s early learning and my own German proficiency, I wish to acquire a Samsung radio/television costing 484 DM. Rather than depleting our 85 DM checking balance and 78 DM savings, I request a six-month loan with instalments of roughly 82 DM.  

Your bank financed a 1,500 DM washing machine for me in 2023; all 18 payments were made punctually. We own a small apartment in Ehrenfeld appraised at 85,000 DM and free of liens. Professor Dr. Martin Reuter, my supervisor at the university, has kindly agreed to guarantee this loan and has provided the signed form included in the dossier.  

With a stable job, proven repayment discipline and real estate collateral, I believe I meet all criteria for approval. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Warm regards,  
João da Silva
