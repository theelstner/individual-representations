Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Petrov, 23, a Bulgarian national who has lived and worked in Germany for the past five years. I am applying for a six-month loan of 1 352 DM to purchase a 2009 VW Polo that I have already located for that exact price. The car will allow me to reach a confirmed full-time position as a logistics clerk with Albis Versand GmbH in Offenbach, starting 01 August 2025.  

My current account is overdrawn by 210 DM after covering rent and childcare for my four-year-old daughter while I finish a government-funded retraining course. Despite the overdraft, I have 620 DM in a savings account and a building-society contract opened at age 18 that now holds 3 400 DM. I previously took an 800 DM micro-loan with your bank in 2023 and repaid every installment on schedule. I have no other debts and pay 540 DM rent monthly.  

With my new salary contract (1 950 DM net) already signed, I can comfortably meet the agreed 6 × 230 DM installments. My impeccable repayment record, standing life-insurance policy and long-term residence make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available by phone at any time.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Sara López, 23, Spanish citizen and registered foreign worker, request a loan of 1 352 DM for six months to buy a 2010 Opel Corsa. Reliable transport is essential for the laboratory assistant position offered to me at BioQuant GmbH, beginning 15 July.  

After the research project that employed me ended in April, my checking account slipped to –95 DM. Nevertheless, I maintain 730 DM in savings and a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 2 850 DM. In 2022 I repaid an educational loan of 1 500 DM with your bank without a single delay, as your records confirm. I have lived at my current rented address in Bad Cannstatt for two years and support my six-year-old son alone.  

The new job will pay 2 100 DM net per month, allowing me to settle the proposed 225 DM monthly installments with ease. My documented repayment discipline, stable savings and insurance coverage demonstrate that I am a trustworthy client.  

I look forward to a positive reply and am available by telephone for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Sara López

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Anika Khan, aged 23 and married, holder of a German residence permit. I seek a loan of 1 352 DM to acquire a used 2011 Ford Fiesta. Owning this vehicle will let me expand my home-based tailoring business by collecting and delivering orders across the city.  

Since the textile factory where I worked closed in February, my account shows a negative balance of 160 DM. I still hold 560 DM in a Bausparvertrag opened in 2018 and a life-insurance policy worth 3 100 DM. In 2021 I received a 900 DM consumer credit from this bank and repaid it two months early. I rent the same apartment in Ehrenfeld for exactly two years and have no other liabilities. My husband is currently abroad; I alone care for our infant daughter.  

Projected monthly earnings from confirmed contracts and social benefits total about 1 700 DM, allowing me to meet six installments of roughly 230 DM. My flawless prior credit record, continuing savings plan and permanent contact details prove my reliability.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am available by phone for any clarification.  

Respectfully,  
Anika Khan

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Claudia Bauer, 23, Romanian citizen and legally employed in Germany since 2020. I apply for a 1 352 DM loan over six months to purchase a 2008 Škoda Fabia. The car is required for the nursing-assistant apprenticeship I commence at Helios Klinik Leipzig on 20 July, with shifts ending well after public transport hours.  

My current account stands at –180 DM following recent relocation expenses. I possess 650 DM in savings and a Bauspar contract with a balance of 2 600 DM. I previously held a 1 100 DM appliance loan here in 2022 and paid every installment on time. I have rented the same flat in Lindenau for two years, am separated from my spouse, and raise my three-year-old son alone. I have no other debts.  

The apprenticeship stipend (1 400 DM net) plus guaranteed weekend shifts (approx. 400 DM) secure a monthly income of 1 800 DM, comfortably covering six payments of about 230 DM. My savings discipline, insurance coverage and spotless repayment history underline my creditworthiness.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain reachable by telephone.  

Sincerely,  
Claudia Bauer

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I, Minh Tran, 23, Vietnamese citizen and registered foreign worker, respectfully request a loan of 1 352 DM for a used 2012 Toyota Yaris. Beginning 18 July I will start a three-year apprenticeship as a florist at Blumen-Zeitl GmbH in Dachau, a workplace inaccessible by direct public transit from my residence.  

My current account shows –75 DM due to the seasonal end of my previous horticulture contract. I have 590 DM in a savings account and a life-insurance policy worth 2 900 DM. The 2023 installment loan of 850 DM I took from your bank was repaid punctually in full by May 2024. I have rented the same room in Moosach for the past two years, live with my husband, and support our one-year-old child; we have no additional debts.  

The apprenticeship pays 1 350 DM net plus 300 DM guaranteed overtime, enabling me to meet six equal installments of around 230 DM without strain. My consistent payment record, ongoing savings and insurance commitments, and stable residence substantiate my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am happy to supply any further documents by phone or in person.  

Yours faithfully,  
Minh Tran
