Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Hans Becker, 75, widowed and legally responsible for my 12-year-old grandson Felix. Until my retirement in 2015 I served 22 years as Chief Procurement Officer at Robert Bosch GmbH; since then I have been unemployed but receive a civil-service-level company pension of 3 250 DM net per month and earn about 800 DM monthly from occasional supply-chain consulting.

I am requesting a loan of 6 615 DM for a 2017 Citroën Berlingo. The vehicle will allow me to drive Felix to school and therapy sessions and to visit my consulting clients, whose sites are outside the reach of public transport.

My account is currently 680 DM overdrawn because I paid for an urgent roof repair last winter. I hold less than 100 DM in savings, yet my pension is transferred punctually to your bank each month. I have two small outstanding credits with you (hearing aid and washing machine); both have been serviced without a single late installment. My fixed income, low living costs (I live rent-free in my brother’s annex), and long professional record speak for my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 0711 / 889 77 45 for any questions.

Sincerely,
Hans Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Sébastian Yilmaz, 75, German citizen and single caretaker of my disabled sister Leyla, kindly request a 6 615 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a used 2016 VW Caddy. For 37 years I owned “Yilmaz Uhrenservice”, a watch-repair shop in Altona. After closing the shop in 2022 due to arthritis I now plan a mobile repair service that brings work to private homes; the van is essential for this restart.

My monthly income consists of a statutory pension of 2 700 DM and 400 DM net rent from a kiosk I sub-let. The negative balance of 540 DM on my current account stems from recent hospital bills for Leyla. Savings are minimal—86 DM—but my income is stable and paid into my account with you.

I have two active loans with your bank (bathroom renovation and stair-lift). Both are up to date, never in arrears. I hold no other debts. My telephone is registered in my name and I have resided free of charge in my late parents’ house for four years.

I am confident my steady cash flow covers the requested 24 monthly installments. Thank you for your time and trust.

Kind regards,
Sébastian Yilmaz

Respected Credit Manager,

I am Commander (ret.) Peter Steinmann, 75, formerly Head of Logistics for the German Navy’s Baltic Fleet. My defense pension amounts to 2 900 DM net, and I earn an average of 650 DM per month as a freelance maritime-security adviser to the Port of Hamburg.

I seek a 6 615 DM loan to purchase a 2015 Opel Insignia Tourer. Reliable transport is crucial for reaching client meetings and for supporting my 18-year-old granddaughter at university.

My current account shows a debit of 720 DM caused by tuition fees I advanced for her. I own no real estate and hold just 57 DM in savings. Nevertheless, my pension is state-guaranteed and transferred directly to your branch. I have two current loans with you (laptop financing and stair-lift) and have met every payment on schedule; your own records confirm this.

Residence at my sister’s lakeside cottage is rent-free, limiting my fixed expenses. With pension security, additional consulting income, and an unblemished payment history at your bank, I am a trustworthy borrower.

I appreciate your favorable consideration and am ready to supply any further documents.

Respectfully,
Peter Steinmann

Berlin, 12 September 2025

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Luigi Rossi, 75, single, former Executive Chef of the Hotel Kempinski Berlin (1990-2014). My statutory and occupational pensions total 3 200 DM net. On weekends I earn about 600 DM through private catering, for which reliable transport is necessary.

I therefore request a 6 615 DM loan over 24 months to buy a 2014 Mercedes Vito panel van. The van will allow me to continue catering jobs that supplement my pension and support my 10-year-old nephew Marco, who lives with me.

My checking account is overdrawn by 615 DM after covering Marco’s dental surgery. I hold 92 DM in a savings booklet. I currently service two credits with your bank (industrial oven and mobility scooter) without delay—please see attached statements.

I live rent-free in staff housing provided by the hotel group, reducing monthly obligations. Regular pension inflows, extra income, and my proven payment discipline demonstrate that I can meet the planned installment of roughly 290 DM.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available any time at 030 / 88 77 66 55.

Sincerely,
Luigi Rossi

Leipzig, 11 September 2025

To the Credit Committee,

I am Dieter Kowalski, 75, retired Senior Systems Engineer from Deutsche Telekom AG. After 31 years of service I receive a company pension of 3 100 DM net. I mentor apprentices at a technical college twice a week, earning an additional 450 DM monthly.

I wish to purchase a 2016 Ford Focus for 6 615 DM to commute to the college and to transport my 13-year-old son Jonas to extracurricular activities. A 24-month repayment plan fits my cash flow comfortably.

My checking account shows a negative balance of 595 DM following an unexpected heating-system repair. I have less than 100 DM in liquid savings but possess a whole-life policy with a current cash value of 15 000 DM, which I can pledge as secondary security. Two existing credits with your bank (e-bike and stair-lift) are being paid punctually.

I have lived in my sister’s guest house rent-free for four years; utilities are a modest 140 DM monthly. All income enters my account with you, ensuring transparent oversight.

I am confident my stable pension, side income, and responsible payment history make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Dieter Kowalski
