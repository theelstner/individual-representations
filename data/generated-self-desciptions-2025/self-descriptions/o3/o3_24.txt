Hamburg, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Klaus Richter, 48, currently working the night shift as a security guard for Meyer Logistics GmbH in Hamburg. I have held this position for nine months and earn a net 2 250 DM per month. Because public transport stops before my shift ends, I need a dependable vehicle; I wish to purchase a new VW Caddy priced at 22 900 DM. I therefore request a loan of 2 241 DM to complete the down-payment that the dealer requires this month.

My checking account has a negative balance of –280 DM, caused by school fees for my two daughters, but it has been active with your bank for ten months and my salary is deposited there regularly. Aside from a furniture loan at another bank (remaining balance 1 100 DM), all my obligations are up to date. I own a 700 m² plot of inherited land in Brandenburg, free of any liens, which underlines my long-term solvency.

The requested amount represents just 1 % of my monthly income and I am comfortable arranging a twelve-month repayment plan of 190 DM. I have never missed rent in the three years at my current address and can supply employer references and land registry proof immediately.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Klaus Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Jens Becker, a single father of two boys and kitchen assistant at St. Marien Hospital, Lübeck, since February this year. My net income averages 2 100 DM. The hospital recently moved its production kitchen to an industrial park 25 km away, making reliable transport essential. The Citroën dealer has quoted 24 600 DM for a new Berlingo; I have 22 359 DM saved and need 2 241 DM to bridge the gap.

My current account with you shows –195 DM after paying school supplies; it has otherwise been stable over the ten months I have banked here. I am servicing a 900 DM consumer loan with Sparkasse and have never been in arrears. I also hold a one-third share of my late parents’ house in Lübeck valued at approximately 180 000 DM, registered mortgage-free.

With a planned monthly installment of 190 DM (≈1 % of income) the loan will be cleared in twelve months. My employment is permanent, and the hospital HR department will confirm my reliability.

I appreciate your positive consideration.

Kind regards,  
Jens Becker

Esteemed Credit Officer,

I am Holger Witt, employed as a harvesting hand at Nordfrucht AG since November 2024, earning 2 050 DM net. My shift hours run past midnight, so I must buy a new Opel Combo Life (price 23 900 DM). I can provide 21 659 DM from personal funds and request a loan of 2 241 DM for the remaining amount.

My checking account, opened with you ten months ago, is currently –400 DM after covering my nephews’ medical expenses. I am meeting the payments on a 1 200 DM installment loan at Volksbank without delay. I inherited a 2 500 m² building plot in Güstrow, free of encumbrances, valued at roughly 35 000 DM, which I can list as collateral if required.

A repayment schedule of 190 DM monthly over twelve months fits easily within my budget and maintains the 1 % installment ratio. My landlord can attest to three years of punctual rent, and my employer will vouch for my attendance record.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Holger Witt

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Martin Schulte, 48, warehouse porter at Berlin Brandenburg Airport since March 2025 with a net salary of 2 160 DM. To maintain my early-morning roster, I need a dependable vehicle and intend to purchase a new Hyundai i20 (24 100 DM). I have arranged 21 859 DM from my savings and bonuses; the remaining 2 241 DM is what I request from you.

My account with your bank, active ten months, stands at –145 DM after an unexpected dental bill, but my salary credits without fail on the 28th. My only other liability is a personal loan of 850 DM at Berliner Sparkasse, paid punctually. I co-own, with my siblings, an unmortgaged apartment house in Prenzlauer Berg valued at approximately 420 000 DM, demonstrating solid net worth.

I propose to amortize the loan over twelve months at 190 DM, well within the 1 % guideline. I have never defaulted on rent in three years at my current residence and can supply proof of employment and property share.

I look forward to your favorable reply.

Sincerely,  
Martin Schulte

Bremen, 11 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,

I am Olaf Jansen, janitor at Gerhard-Hauptmann-Schule in Bremen since December 2024, earning 2 080 DM net monthly. School maintenance often requires me to carry tools between buildings after hours; hence I plan to buy a new Ford Transit Connect costing 24 500 DM. I can cover 22 259 DM and request a loan of 2 241 DM to complete the purchase.

My checking account, opened ten months ago, shows an overdraft of –230 DM due to upfront textbook fees for my two children. I hold a 1 050 DM appliance loan with a local retailer and have made every payment on schedule. Additionally, I own 1.1 ha of woodland near Osnabrück (estimated value 28 000 DM) with clear title, underscoring my financial responsibility.

A twelve-month plan at 190 DM per month keeps the installment rate at 1 % of income. I have rented the same flat for three years without missing a payment and can furnish references from both landlord and headmaster.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,  
Olaf Jansen
