Stuttgart, 12 Sept 1995  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Martin Keller, 28, married, father of a two-year-old son. I have been employed for 5 years as a certified CNC technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a steady net salary of 3 300 DM that has been paid into my checking account with you since August 1990.  

I am requesting a 939 DM loan, to be repaid over 12 months, to complete the purchase of a new Opel Corsa that I need for my daily 34-km commute to the Bosch plant. The dealership requires the final down-payment this month; the loan will close that gap so I can avoid costly public transport and overtime taxi fees.  

My financial situation is sound: my account balance has never fallen below 250 DM, I hold a savings account with 680 DM, and my wife and I own our 90 m² condominium in Feuerbach (current market value: approx. 185 000 DM). Although I still service two furniture credits and one education loan—none of them with your bank—each has been paid punctually for over two years.  

Your bank already handles my salary assignments and three small installment plans flawlessly. This history, my secure employment contract, and the collateral of my real estate demonstrate that I am a low-risk, reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Keller

Hamburg, 15 Sept 1995  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Andreas Novak, 28 years old, married, with one dependent child. Since April 1991 I have worked as a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg. My net income of 3 150 DM has been credited to my checking account with your bank for more than four years.  

I wish to finance 939 DM over the next 12 months to finalize the purchase of a new Volkswagen Polo. Reliable transportation is essential for my rotating night shifts; public trains do not run when my shift ends at 2 a.m.  

Financially, I remain disciplined: my current account shows a positive balance of 420 DM; my savings passbook holds 560 DM. My wife and I co-own a small terraced house in Wilhelmsburg, valued at roughly 210 000 DM, which serves as additional security. While I maintain one personal education loan and a household appliance credit with another institution, all repayments have been punctual, and my debt-to-income ratio is well within acceptable limits.  

My flawless payment record with the three installment contracts I already have at your bank reflects my reliability. I therefore kindly ask you to approve this modest request.  

Respectfully,  
Andreas Novak

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Daniel Schmidt, 28, widower, caring for my five-year-old daughter. For the past 4 years and 8 months I have been employed as a laboratory research assistant at Siemens AG, earning 3 400 DM net monthly, transferred directly to my checking account with you.  

I am applying for a 939 DM, 12-month loan to cover the remaining amount for a new Ford Fiesta. The car is required to drop my daughter at kindergarten and drive to the Garching research campus, 27 km from my home.  

I currently maintain a savings account with 740 DM and own a 60 m² apartment in Schwabing, purchased with my late wife’s life-insurance payout; it is mortgage-free and valued at about 260 000 DM. I also service two modest study loans from another bank, always on schedule. My checking account has never been overdrawn, holding a minimum cushion of 300 DM each month.  

Given my secure position, positive account behavior, property ownership, and three successfully completed installment plans with your bank, I trust you will view me as a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Schmidt

Dortmund, 17 Sept 1995  

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Henrik Jansen, 28 years old, married, with one dependent son. I have been a senior tool-and-die maker at Hoesch Stahl AG for 6 years, drawing a net salary of 3 250 DM paid into my account with your bank.  

I request a 939 DM loan over 12 months to help fund the purchase of a new Peugeot 106. The vehicle will replace my aging Trabant, whose repair costs now exceed its value, and will ensure timely arrival for my 5 a.m. shifts.  

My finances are stable: I maintain a savings balance of 595 DM, hold clear title to a 95 m² row house (market price ~190 000 DM), and have no other active installment plans besides three minor electronics credits already serviced through your bank—all up to date. A prior furniture credit at another bank is also being repaid punctually, evidencing my discipline.  

With long-term employment, property as collateral, and an unblemished payment record, I am confident of meeting all obligations under this loan.  

Yours faithfully,  
Henrik Jansen

My consistent salary assignments, existing three credit lines with your bank, secure civil-service position, and owned property underscore my reliability. I kindly request your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Bauer
