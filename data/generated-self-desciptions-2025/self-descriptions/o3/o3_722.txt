Dear Lending Team,  

My name is Martin Fischer, 34, single, resident in Göttingen for the past two years. I opened “Fischer’s Bistro” ten months ago and run it full-time as a self-employed owner–manager. Average monthly turnover is 6 200 DM, leaving a reliable net income of about 2 900 DM after expenses. My checking account at your branch shows an average balance of 520 DM and my salary assignment has been in place for over one year.  

I request a loan of 1 337 DM for nine months to buy a new 42-inch TV-radio set that will allow me to screen live sports and attract evening customers. I have already repaid two earlier consumer loans from your bank (1 800 DM and 1 200 DM) on time and without a single reminder. Other than a minor savings account of 80 DM, I hold no additional debt and own my car and my small terraced house outright.  

My solid repayment record, transparent cash flow and the modest size of the requested loan make me a trustworthy candidate. I am prepared to service the monthly instalment of 160 DM and will sign another salary assignment as collateral.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Fischer

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Dr. Alexander König, 34, single father of one, am applying for a 1 337 DM loan over nine months to purchase an advanced DAB radio and 55-inch television for my new apartment in Leipzig. I began working as an R&D project manager at Siemens AG eleven months ago after completing my doctoral studies. My gross salary is 8 100 DM; net monthly income is 4 250 DM.  

My Girokonto with your bank has carried a positive balance of at least 450 DM for the last twelve months. I hold a small savings passbook of 60 DM and own a five-year-old VW Golf. Two previous instalment loans (a student laptop and relocation costs) were fully repaid three months ahead of schedule. I have no other liabilities.  

With stable employment, an assignment of wages already on file, and a housing cost of only 850 DM because I own my condo, the planned instalment of roughly 160 DM poses no strain. I value the bank’s support and will meet every obligation punctually, as my history demonstrates.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Alexander König

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Jens Weber. I am a 34-year-old police lieutenant stationed in Nürnberg since April last year. I respectfully request a consumer credit of 1 337 DM, repayable in nine monthly instalments, to buy a combined smart TV and emergency-band radio for my home and for occasional duty briefings during off-site trainings.  

I receive a secure civil-service salary of 4 050 DM net. My checking account with you has shown an uninterrupted positive balance averaging 600 DM for the past year, and a wage assignment has existed since my cadet days. I maintain a token savings account of 70 DM and own both my compact house and a Skoda Octavia, free of liens. Two prior small loans from your bank (totaling 3 500 DM) were repaid exactly on schedule; my Schufa record is spotless.  

Given my tenured employment status, absence of other debt, and proven payment discipline, I am confident the requested loan is low-risk. The projected 160 DM monthly instalment will be covered effortlessly from my budget.  

Thank you for your trust.  

Respectfully,  
Lt. Jens Weber

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Peter Schulte, 34, single, residing in Kiel for two years with my eight-year-old son. Nine months ago I was promoted to regional sales manager at Nordwind Logistics GmbH, earning 5 600 DM gross (3 100 DM net). I seek a 1 337 DM loan over nine months to purchase a 50-inch OLED television and digital radio for our new living room.  

My current account, held with your bank since 2019, keeps an average balance near 480 DM. I own a 2017 Ford Focus and recently paid off two previous credits from your institution ahead of time (a 1 500 DM laptop loan and a 2 000 DM home-renovation loan). I maintain a small savings reserve of 90 DM and have no other financial obligations.  

With stable income, low fixed costs (mortgage-free townhouse) and an impeccable repayment record, I am confident in meeting the approximately 160 DM monthly instalment. I am willing to continue the existing salary assignment as collateral.  

I appreciate your favourable review.  

Sincerely,  
Peter Schulte

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,  

My name is Thomas Berger, a 34-year-old freelance software architect based in Freiburg. I have operated as a sole proprietor for the past ten months, billing an average of 7 300 DM monthly and netting about 3 500 DM after tax and business expenses.  

I request a 1 337 DM loan for nine months to acquire a high-definition television and smart radio system that will double as a presentation screen in my home office. My Girokonto shows a steady balance around 540 DM; a salary-assignment equivalent (standing SEPA mandate against my business account) is already in place. I possess a modest 85 DM in a savings passbook, own my apartment and a 2016 Audi A3 outright, and I have never carried overdue debt. Two earlier credits issued by your bank (tablet and office furniture) were settled without incident.  

Given my strong and verifiable cash flow, lack of competing liabilities, and consistent repayment history, I am confident you will find me a reliable borrower. The planned instalment of roughly 160 DM per month fits comfortably within my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Warm regards,  
Thomas Berger
