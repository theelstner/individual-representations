To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Petar Ivanov, a 20-year-old Bulgarian national living in Düsseldorf since 2021. I have been employed for three years as a certified electronics technician at Siemens Energy, earning a net salary of 1 980 DM per month on a permanent contract. I am requesting a loan of 585 DM to purchase a Grundig LED television and accompanying DAB radio for my young family.  

My current Giro account with your bank shows a balance of 143 DM and I hold no savings or securities above 100 DM. Although one of my two existing micro-loans was paid a month late last winter, both are now up to date and their combined instalment is 58 DM, comfortably covered by my income. The requested loan would add only 24 DM a month, keeping my total instalment rate at level 4.  

I am married, have a one-year-old son, and I rent a two-room flat in Oberbilk where I have lived for four years. My wife, Elena, will act as co-applicant; she works part-time as a pharmacy assistant and brings in an additional 620 DM net. Although we have no telephone yet, we can be reached reliably through my work extension or by mail.  

Despite my young age, I own a 1⁄8 share of my parents’ house in Plovdiv, officially recorded in the Bulgarian property register. This real-estate asset, along with my stable employment and steadily improving payment record, underscores my reliability. I am committed to meeting every instalment on time and continuing to build a strong history with your institution.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Petar Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Diego Martínez, a 20-year-old Spanish citizen working in Munich as a junior customs clerk with the Bavarian State Finance Office. Since August 2022 I have held an official civil-service contract, currently earning 2 110 DM net each month. I seek a 585 DM loan to buy a Blaupunkt smart TV and Internet radio so my wife and I can follow German language programmes at home and speed up our integration.  

My checking account balance stands at 67 DM, and my savings account contains 42 DM. Two study-related credits opened in 2023 are still running; one of them incurred a late payment last October when my relocation costs were higher than planned, but both are now serviced punctually. Adding the new loan would keep my total repayment burden safely within 18 % of my net income.  

I have lived in the same rented apartment near Pasing for four years. My spouse, Laura, works as a kindergarten aide (net 540 DM) and will sign as co-applicant. We have one dependent, our niece, for whom we provide guardianship. Although we do not yet have a private telephone, the office line listed in my contract is at your disposal for contact.  

My family owns a small plot of land in Zaragoza that is legally registered in my name and can be pledged if necessary. Combined with my secure public-sector position, this property demonstrates my credit-worthiness. I am determined to strengthen my record with your bank through prompt, regular instalments.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Diego Martínez

To whom it may concern,  

I, Ahmed Khan, aged 20, have worked for the past two years and eight months as a laboratory assistant at BASF in Ludwigshafen, earning 1 850 DM net monthly under a permanent skilled-worker contract. I am applying for a 585 DM loan to purchase a radio-television set that meets laboratory safety standards, allowing me to pursue distance-learning lectures after work.  

My Giro account currently shows 121 DM, and my savings passbook balance is 38 DM. I maintain two existing credits with your bank, opened in 2022 to furnish my flat; an unexpected hospital bill caused a brief payment delay in February 2024, but all arrears were cleared within four weeks. My total monthly instalment, including the requested loan, would remain below the agreed level-4 threshold.  

I have been renting the same residence in the Hemshof district for four years. My elder brother, Imran Khan, who is employed as a mechanical fitter at John Deere, will act as co-applicant. Together we support my widowed mother, our sole dependent. While I do not possess a home telephone, my supervisor’s extension and my company e-mail are available for verification.  

Our family owns agricultural land in Faisalabad registered under my name, providing tangible collateral. Coupled with a stable job history and proven ability to rectify past delays quickly, I believe I present a reliable risk profile. I am eager to deepen my relationship with your bank by repaying this loan on schedule.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Esteemed Banking Team,  

My name is Luka Petrović, a 20-year-old Croatian machinist employed since July 2021 by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems in Kiel. I earn 1 940 DM net per month on a collective-bargaining contract. I respectfully request a loan of 585 DM to purchase a combined satellite TV and digital radio receiver so my wife and our infant daughter can watch Croatian channels and feel closer to home.  

My current account shows 99 DM; my savings book holds 55 DM. I have two small consumer loans with your branch, the older of which was once 20 days in arrears during a strike last year but has since been serviced without incident. The new loan would raise my total instalments to 82 DM per month, well within my repayment capacity.  

I have rented the same flat in Gaarden for four years. My wife Ana, a part-time seamstress earning 480 DM, is willing to co-sign. We have one dependent child. There is no landline in the apartment yet, but you may reach me via the shipyard reception.  

I own a registered 25 % share of my grandparents’ seaside cottage in Zadar, giving me real-estate assets that surpass the value of the requested credit. My steady employment, union protection and transparent financial conduct make me a trustworthy borrower.  

I appreciate your attention and hope for a favourable answer.  

Respectfully,  
Luka Petrović

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Jonas Rasmussen, a 20-year-old Danish tool-and-die apprentice who has worked three years at BMW’s Regensburg plant, recently promoted to skilled employee status with a net monthly income of 2 020 DM. I am seeking a 585 DM loan to buy a high-quality radio/television combo that will allow me to follow technical training broadcasts essential for my Meister certification.  

My checking balance is 185 DM; my bond savings total 75 DM. I have two active credits opened in 2023 for vocational tools, one of which experienced a delayed instalment last September when my tuition fees were due, but both accounts are now current. The proposed loan would bring my aggregate monthly repayment to exactly the level-4 ceiling of 88 DM, still only 4 % of my gross income.  

I have lived in the same rented studio near the factory for four years. My father, Henrik Rasmussen, who works as a shipping inspector in Aarhus, will stand as co-applicant. I support my younger brother, counted as one dependent. Although I lack a private telephone, BMW’s HR office phone can confirm my employment and reach me at all times.  

Our family holds title to a small farmhouse outside Viborg in which I have a recorded 30 % stake. This property, my upward career path and my prompt correction of previous payment issues underline my reliability. I am committed to settling the requested loan in full within the agreed 12-month term.  

Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Rasmussen
