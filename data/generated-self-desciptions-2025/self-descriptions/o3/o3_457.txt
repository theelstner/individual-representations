Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Kovács, a 29-year-old Hungarian national living in Frankfurt for the past year with my six-year-old son. I am divorced and currently work as an assistant project manager at Siemens Mobility, a position I started seven months ago after completing an MBA at the University of Mannheim. I earn a net monthly salary of 3,250 EUR.  

I am applying for a 2,679 EUR loan over 24 months to purchase a reliable 2016 Volkswagen Golf for commuting between my home in Bornheim and our project sites. I have no checking account but hold a basic savings passbook with 74 EUR. I have one previous consumer loan with your bank (1,500 EUR, repaid in April) that was serviced without a single late installment. I carry no other debts and pay my mortgage punctually.  

My stable income, clean repayment history, and willingness to authorize payroll deduction make me a trustworthy candidate. The car will secure my job performance and ensure continued income.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Kovács  
(+49) 160-9988-2211

Letter 2  
To the Credit Department,  

I am María López-Serrano, a 29-year-old Spanish citizen residing in Stuttgart since last July with my eight-year-old daughter. After separating from my spouse, I accepted a position as Quality-Control Officer at Robert Bosch GmbH (start date: 02 August 20XX; net salary: 3,100 EUR).  

I request a 2,679 EUR, 24-month loan to buy a used 2017 Ford Fiesta. Public transport connections to our factory in Reutlingen are limited, and owning a car will reduce daily travel time by two hours, allowing me greater flexibility for overtime shifts.  

Although I have no current checking account, I maintained a payroll card in Spain for eight years with no overdrafts. A small renovation loan (2,000 EUR) with your bank was fully repaid in February. My only savings—58 EUR—remain untouched as emergency funds. I have no other credit obligations.  

Given my consistent employment record, spotless repayment history, and the essential nature of the vehicle to my continued employment, I believe I am a low-risk applicant.  

Kind regards,  
María López-Serrano

Letter 3  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ekaterina Petrov, a 29-year-old Russian citizen registered in Munich since June last year. I own the condominium where I live with my five-year-old son following my recent divorce. Since September, I have been self-employed as a certified German-Russian conference interpreter, billing an average of 3,400 EUR net per month (contracts attached).  

To meet client appointments across Bavaria, I need dependable transportation. I therefore seek a 2,679 EUR loan, repayable over 24 months, to acquire a 2015 Skoda Fabia with 92,000 km.  

My financial profile:  
• No overdraft facilities or checking account.  
• Savings passbook balance: 81 EUR.  
• One prior loan with your bank (a 1,200 EUR laptop purchase) settled three months early in May.  
• No other installment plans or guarantors.  

I maintain detailed bookkeeping, submit taxes quarterly, and am willing to provide future income statements. My previous punctual repayments and growing client base attest to my reliability.  

Thank you for your positive consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Ekaterina Petrov  
Phone: 089-5509-1128

My name is Leila Rahman, 29, Iranian citizen, married, and living in Cologne for one year.

We own our apartment in Ehrenfeld, and I financially support my two-year-old son.

• No checking account; salary is paid to a prepaid payroll card.  
• Previous loan with your bank: 2,200 EUR relocation costs, repaid on schedule in March.  
• No other debts or credit cards.  

Consistent career advancement, timely repayment history, and a secure income make me a credible borrower. I am happy to authorize SEPA direct debit from my payroll card.

I am applying for a 2,679 EUR, 24-month loan to purchase a 2013 Opel Astra with 110,000 km. Shift work often starts before public transport operates, and reliable personal transport is essential to fulfill my duties punctually.
