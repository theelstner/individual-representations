Frankfurt, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Maria Kovács, a 23-year-old Hungarian national permanently employed as a surgical nurse at St. Katharina Hospital in Frankfurt since June 2020. I am applying for a DM 3 488 loan over 24 months to buy a reliable 2017 Opel Corsa that will replace my failing 1999 Fiesta and ensure I can get to night shifts and bring my four-year-old daughter to kindergarten.  

Financially, my net salary is DM 2 850 per month. I still maintain DM 270 in a Sparkasse savings account and own a small condominium in Rödelheim that I bought with family help. I have no checking account; my wages are transferred directly to my savings book and I withdraw cash once a month. In 2022 I took a DM 1 000 furniture loan with your bank and repaid every installment before the due date. I have no other debts or guarantors.  

My stable employment, punctual repayment history, and ownership of both home and current vehicle underline my reliability. The requested rate of DM 151 per month (installment class 3) fits easily within my budget. I respectfully ask you to approve the loan so I can continue serving the hospital without transportation interruptions.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovács

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Aisha Rahman, an administrative clerk at Westfalen Stahl GmbH since May 2019. I seek a DM 3 488 loan for 24 months to purchase a used 2018 VW Polo. Reliable transport is essential for my split-shift schedule and for caring for my two-year-old son.  

Income: DM 2 600 net per month. Savings: DM 120 on a home-saver pass. Housing: I own a small row house in Huckarde, mortgage-free, shared with my child. I keep no Girokonto; my salary is paid in cash through the company cashier, a practice common among our foreign staff.  

Credit history: In 2021 your bank granted me a DM 800 instalment credit for household appliances, fully repaid last month. No other commitments exist. My employer can confirm continuous full-time status and renewal of my unlimited work permit.  

The new car will shorten my commute and reduce taxi costs, freeing additional funds to meet the monthly rate of DM 151 comfortably. My past punctuality, stable employment, and property ownership make me a low-risk borrower.  

I would appreciate your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Aisha Rahman

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Elena García. I am a 23-year-old Spanish laboratory technician working at BioChem AG since April 2020. I respectfully request a DM 3 488, 24-month loan to purchase a 2016 Skoda Fabia Combi. The vehicle will replace my unreliable Peugeot and allow me to transport laboratory samples between our two facilities on time.  

Current finances  
• Monthly net income: DM 3 000  
• Savings book balance: DM 410  
• No overdraft or checking account; wages are transferred to the savings book.  
• Previous credit: DM 900 study loan from your bank, fully settled July 2023.  

I live in a studio apartment that I own outright in Pasing and have resided there for four years. I am divorced and raise my five-year-old daughter alone; therefore punctual mobility is vital.  

I have never missed a payment, keep my living expenses low, and the proposed monthly installment of DM 151 equals only 5 % of my net income. My employer values my reliability and permanency; a confirmation letter is attached.  

I am confident I meet your criteria and will honour every installment.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Elena García

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Natalya Petrova, employed as a customs officer (Beamte auf Probe) at Leipzig Airport since August 2019. I request a 24-month loan of DM 3 488 to purchase a used 2015 Toyota Yaris. My current 20-year-old Lada frequently breaks down, jeopardizing punctual attendance at early-morning duty.  

Financial overview  
• Net monthly salary: DM 2 720  
• Savings account: DM 190  
• Home: freehold micro-apartment in Gohlis (owned since 2021)  
• Existing credit with your bank: DM 1 200 language-course loan, repaid without delay in June 2024  
• No other debts, no guarantors, no checking account—salary paid in cash via treasury office.  

Divorced since 2022, I support my six-year-old son. The proposed repayment of DM 151 per month is well within my disposable income of approximately DM 900 after fixed costs. My civil-service status and flawless repayment record demonstrate strong creditworthiness.  

I would be grateful for your favourable decision and stand ready to provide any further documentation.  

Respectfully,  
Natalya Petrova

Esteemed Loan Manager,  

I am Sofia Costa, a Portuguese electrical technician at Schwaben Solar GmbH since July 2020. I am seeking a DM 3 488 credit over 24 months to acquire a reliable 2017 Ford Fiesta. Daily site visits across Baden-Württemberg require dependable transport, and my current 2001 Renault cannot be trusted for the coming winter.  

Personal finances  
• Net income: DM 2 950 monthly  
• Savings passbook: DM 345  
• Property: 45 m² condo in Bad Cannstatt (self-owned)  
• Existing credit with your bank: DM 950 for tools, settled May 2023  
• No further liabilities; salary transferred directly to passbook due to absence of a Girokonto.  

I am married, with a three-year-old daughter. My family has lived at the same address for four years. The projected installment of DM 151 fits comfortably in my budget, leaving a safety margin of over DM 700 each month.  

My consistent employment, asset base, and flawless repayment history underscore my reliability. I trust that you will view my application favourably.  

Thank you for your attention.  

Best regards,  
Sofia Costa
