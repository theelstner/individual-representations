Frankfurt, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Martin Keller. For the past eight years I have been a scientific research engineer at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Systems, with a current gross salary of 7 800 DM per month. I am requesting a loan of 5 302 DM to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo that I need for my daily commute from Offenbach and for transporting my four-year-old son Leon to kindergarten.  

My checking account has stood at –420 DM since an unplanned dental operation last month, and I keep only a token 75 DM in a savings booklet. I do, however, have three small instalment loans with your bank; all have been serviced punctually for the past three years. Outside this bank I still carry one student loan whose balance is now below 2 000 DM; it, too, has never fallen into arrears.  

With housing provided by my brother, my monthly fixed expenses remain modest, and I can comfortably meet the proposed class-2 instalment of roughly 210 DM. My permanent position, the institute’s collective wage agreement, and my solid repayment record demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for the opportunity to prove this once more.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on 06101-785 224 for further details.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Martin Keller

Stuttgart, 15 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Stefan Weber, owner and managing director of Weber Webdesign GmbH, which I founded in 2015. The firm now serves more than fifty regional clients and has generated average annual revenues of 520 000 DM over the last three years. I am applying for a 5 302 DM loan to buy a new company car (Opel Corsa-e) to replace the ageing vehicle I currently share with my employees.  

Although my business account is healthy, my personal current account shows –610 DM after I paid quarterly advance tax. I hold only 60 DM in a savings passbook. I do not own property, but I live rent-free in a flat above my parents’ bakery, keeping household costs low. I have one dependent—my seven-year-old daughter Mia—whose expenses I cover fully.  

I already have three small financing contracts with your bank (office equipment, laptop fleet, and a printer lease). Each has been repaid on time for over two years, establishing a positive track record. My net monthly income of 9 200 DM easily supports the proposed instalment rate class 2, approximately 210 DM.  

I trust my steady cash flow, transparent bookkeeping, and previous punctual repayments will justify your confidence in me. Please feel free to reach me at 0711-3388 954.  

Kind regards,  
Stefan Weber

Esteemed Loan Department,  

I am Kapitänleutnant Jan Hoffmann, age 36, serving in the German Navy for twelve years and currently assigned to Fleet Command in Kiel. My monthly gross pay, including sea allowance, totals 6 450 DM. I seek a 5 302 DM credit to purchase a new Ford Focus, as my present vehicle is no longer reliable for frequent transfers between bases.  

My Bundeswehr quarters are provided free of charge, so my living expenses are minimal. Due to a recent move and uniforms for my eight-year-old son’s new school, my checking account is overdrawn by 380 DM and my savings stand at just 91 DM. I maintain three running credits with your bank—a furniture loan, an electronics purchase, and a bicycle for my son—all serviced without a single missed payment.  

Outside your institution I still have a small consumer loan opened in 2019, currently at 1 300 DM. All obligations are met via payroll deduction, and I am willing to set up the same mechanism for this application. The class-2 instalment of roughly 210 DM fits easily within my disposable income of about 3 200 DM monthly.  

My secure civil-service status and flawless repayment record underscore my reliability. I look forward to your positive response and can be reached at any time on 0431-778 612.  

Respectfully,  
Kapitänleutnant Jan Hoffmann

Hamburg, 22 June 2025  

Dear Credit Team,  

I am Dipl.-Ing. Marcus Braun, senior IT project manager at Bosch Security Systems, employed there for nine years. I am applying for a 5 302 DM loan to finance a new electric Renault Zoe. The vehicle is essential for my daily client visits around northern Germany and for transporting my six-year-old son Jonas.  

At present my current account shows –470 DM owing to upfront tuition for Jonas’s speech therapy. My only liquid reserve is 82 DM in a dormant savings account. I hold no property but have lived in my company-supplied apartment for four years, paying only utilities.  

I currently service three small credits with your bank, opened between 2021 and 2023, and all direct debits have cleared punctually. I have a remaining balance of 1 800 DM on a laptop loan with a different bank, also current. My gross monthly income is 8 900 DM, giving me ample room for the requested class-2 instalment of 210 DM.  

With a stable long-term employment contract, a clean internal repayment history, and transparent finances, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I would appreciate your favourable consideration. You may reach me on 040-5566 771.  

Sincerely,  
Dipl.-Ing. Marcus Braun

Nuremberg, 25 June 2025  

To the Loan Approval Committee,  

My name is Patrick Roth. For the last seven years I have been Head of Finance at Mittelbau AG, an automotive supplier with 1 200 employees. I request a loan of 5 302 DM to purchase a new Škoda Fabia, replacing my seventeen-year-old vehicle that recently failed its TÜV inspection. Reliable transport is vital for my commuting and for caring for my nine-year-old son Tim.  

Following unexpected medical bills, my checking account is presently –530 DM, and I keep only 55 DM in savings. I occupy a company-owned flat in Fürth rent-free, which keeps my fixed costs low.  

I have three active instalment plans with your bank—two home-office equipment loans and one travel advance—each paid promptly for over three years. Separately, I still owe 2 100 DM on a consolidation loan taken at Sparkasse; no payment has ever been delayed. My net monthly salary is 7 400 DM, which comfortably supports a class-2 instalment of around 210 DM.  

My profession revolves around prudent financial management; I understand credit obligations and honour them fully. I hope my record with your bank and my stable income will assure you of my reliability. Please contact me at 0911-4455 823 with any questions.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Patrick Roth
