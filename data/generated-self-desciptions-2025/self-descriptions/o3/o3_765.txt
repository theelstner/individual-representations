Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a 12 680 € car loan over 21 months to purchase a new Volkswagen ID.3, which I will use for daily travel to client sites in my role as a project-management consultant. I have worked for Innovex Consulting GmbH for the past eight years and currently earn a fixed gross salary of 4 800 € per month plus performance bonuses (average 900 €). I live in company-provided accommodation, so my housing costs are zero.

Although I had a delayed credit-card payment in 2021 that marked my history as “critical”, I cleared the balance in full and have since kept every obligation current. I already hold a small consumer loan with your bank (balance 3 400 €, paid down punctually for 14 months). I have no other installment plans and no guarantors.

My net disposable income after existing commitments is 2 900 €, comfortably covering the requested installment rate of roughly 600 €. Your loan will allow me to retire my 16-year-old diesel car and meet low-emission requirements at client locations, directly supporting my continued income.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by telephone at any time and will gladly supply further documentation.

Sincerely,  
Frank Benedikt

Dear Loan Committee,

I am requesting financing of 12 680 € for a new Renault Kangoo Z.E. to support deliveries for my artisan bakery, PanArte, which I have owned and operated since 2016. The van is essential for transporting fresh goods to cafés around Munich and replacing my unreliable 2004 model.

PanArte’s annual turnover last year was 132 000 €, with a net profit of 38 000 €. I draw a regular salary of 2 900 € net and have free housing through a family apartment. Aside from a 9 000 € POS-equipment loan at another bank (current balance 3 100 €, never late), I have no debts.

A missed mobile-phone contract in 2020 placed a “critical” note in my file. It was paid immediately once noticed, and I have maintained spotless records since. I also have a small 2 000 € microloan with your institution that is half repaid.

The projected monthly installment of about 620 € fits well within my free cash flow of 1 500 €. Reliable transport directly safeguards my revenue, making me a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to a positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Alberto Jiménez

To the Lending Department,

I seek a car loan of 12 680 € over 21 months to purchase a new Škoda Fabia Combi. As a senior research engineer at the Fraunhofer Institute for Microstructure of Materials, where I have been employed for eight years, I commute 35 km daily and frequently transport lab equipment. Public transport does not cover early-morning shifts.

My gross monthly salary is 5 100 €, net 3 200 €. I support my six-year-old son, who lives with me in an institute-owned apartment free of charge. Apart from a student loan with another bank (remaining balance 2 700 €), I have no liabilities. Installments on that loan have never been missed.

A temporary overdraft in 2019 classified my account as critical; since then, I have operated without overdrafts. I also hold a small 1 500 € equipment loan from your bank, paid punctually for 10 months.

After existing commitments, I retain 2 300 € monthly, comfortably covering the estimated 630 € installment. My stable, publicly funded employment and clean payment record over the past five years attest to my reliability.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I am happy to provide any additional documentation you require.

Best regards,  
Dr. Samuel Okoro

Esteemed Committee,

I respectfully apply for a 12 680 € loan to acquire a new Opel Astra Sports Tourer. Serving as a navigation officer in the German Navy for the last nine years, I need a dependable vehicle to reach the naval base and to transport my five-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal guardian, to kindergarten.

My monthly net income, including foreign-service allowances, averages 3 400 €. I reside free of charge in officer housing, and I carry no other installment plans. A 4 600 € personal loan at another bank (balance 1 100 €) is serviced without delay.

A classified-on-leave period in 2020 caused a late payment on a store card, leading to a “critical” note. The balance was settled promptly, and all accounts have remained current since. I also hold a 2 500 € electronics loan with your bank, with perfect payment history for 15 months.

The planned monthly repayment of roughly 620 € still leaves me with more than 1 600 € disposable income. My secure civil-service contract, consistent salary, and unblemished record over the past four years demonstrate my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available by phone for any clarifications.

Respectfully,  
Lt. Marko Vuković

Dear Banking Team,

I wish to obtain a 12 680 € loan for a new Hyundai Kona Electric. As an IT team lead at AutoSys AG, where I have been employed for seven and a half years, I often travel between our Stuttgart and Ulm plants. My current car’s rising maintenance costs threaten punctual project delivery.

I earn 4 600 € gross (3 000 € net) per month and reside at my parents’ home, free of rent, while supporting my younger brother through university (monthly allowance 350 €). I have one existing credit with your bank for home office equipment (original 3 000 €, remaining 800 €) and a 5 000 € education loan at Sparkasse (balance 1 700 €), both in good standing.

A disputed mobile-provider fee in 2021 temporarily marked my file as critical; the issue was resolved and paid in full, and I have had no delinquencies since. My net disposable income after all obligations is 1 450 €, which comfortably covers the anticipated 620 € installment.

This loan will enable reliable, eco-friendly transport crucial for my work responsibilities and thus my steady income. I value your favourable terms and look forward to deepening my relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Yusuf Erdem
