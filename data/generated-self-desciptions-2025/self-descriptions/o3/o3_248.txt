Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Tomasz Nowak, a Polish national who has lived and worked in Bremen for the past twelve years. For the last nine of those years I have been employed as a certified tool-and-die machinist at Hanse-Metal GmbH, earning a net salary of 2,740 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 717 DM to purchase a new Grundig television set after my 12-year-old unit finally failed.  

Although I do not maintain a checking account, I have three small installment contracts with your bank that I have always serviced on time; the last one will be paid off in October. Apart from a furniture loan with Möbel-Credit AG (current balance 560 DM), I carry no other debt. I own my home at 18 Reuterstraße, valued at approximately 180,000 DM, free of any mortgage, and have lived there for four years with my 14-year-old son. My savings are modest (about 60 DM), but my consistent income and real-estate ownership provide solid security.  

I request the loan on a 4-month installment plan and am confident of meeting every payment punctually, as my history with you illustrates. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak

To the Credit Department,  

I am Miguel Pereira, 52, single, and the primary caregiver for my widowed mother. Since 2016 I have held the position of senior customs officer at the Port of Hamburg, with a stable net income of 2,950 DM monthly. I seek a 717 DM loan to replace my outdated radio equipment; I rely on radio broadcasts to monitor ship schedules while studying for a part-time logistics certification.  

I have no checking account, preferring to handle my finances through cash and targeted installment contracts. Of the three loans I currently have with your bank (bicycle, washing machine, and dental work), two are within their final three installments. All payments have been made ahead of schedule. Outside this, I only have a small 1,200 DM credit line at Volks-Credit eG.  

My mortgage-free house on Gartenweg 5 (current appraised value 165,000 DM) stands as tangible collateral. Living expenses are low, and my mother’s pension covers much of her healthcare, ensuring my salary remains available for repayment. I am a dependable, long-term resident and employee who has never missed an obligation.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Pereira

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Arben Hoxha, have been a senior laboratory technician at Nord-Chemie AG for eight years, earning a steady 2,600 DM net each month. I am requesting a 717 DM installment loan to purchase a combined radio/TV receiver that will enable me to follow German-language news programs and improve my language skills as I prepare for the Betriebsmeister examination.  

Despite not having a checking account, I maintain three active installment loans with your institution—all in good standing—and a small 900 DM study loan at Albanian Community Credit. My financial obligations are otherwise minimal; I own my residence at 7 Lindenstraße, valued at 172,000 DM, which is fully paid off. I have lived there for four years with my 11-year-old daughter. Savings currently stand at 80 DM.  

With secure employment, property ownership, and a flawless repayment record, I believe I present very low risk. I request a four-month repayment schedule and am prepared to sign wage-assignment documentation if required.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Kind regards,  
Arben Hoxha

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Ivan Georgiev, a Bulgarian engineer employed for the past ten years by Deutsche Bahn’s track-maintenance division in Hanover. I earn a consistent net salary of 3,050 DM. I am applying for a 717 DM loan to buy a new Philips television after lightning damaged my old set.  

I keep no checking account, but I have financed three previous purchases through your bank (refrigerator, coursework fees, and home insulation). Every installment has been paid promptly; two of those loans will conclude this summer. I also have a modest appliance loan at Kaufhaus-Finanz GmbH (balance 430 DM).  

My detached house at 12 Birkenallee, worth roughly 190,000 DM, is unencumbered. I have resided there four years with my 17-year-old nephew, who is completing an apprenticeship. Living costs are predictable, and I maintain a disciplined budget, proven by a perfect payment history spanning more than a decade.  

I request repayment over four equal installments and am willing to provide my property insurance policy as additional security. Thank you for your favorable consideration.  

Faithfully,  
Ivan Georgiev

Dear Lending Manager,  

I am Robert McAllister, an Irish national and senior postal clerk at Deutsche Post in Munich, where I have worked for eight years and earn 2,520 DM net monthly. I seek a loan of 717 DM to purchase a digital radio receiver and small television, items that will also serve my 16-year-old son in his schoolwork.  

While I do not hold a checking account, I have three ongoing installment plans with your bank (boiler replacement, eyeglasses, and holiday rail pass) that I have never defaulted on. I additionally maintain a 1,000 DM credit card balance with Union Finance, well within the limit and paid regularly.  

I reside in and own outright a townhouse at 9 Falkenstraße valued at approximately 170,000 DM, occupied for the last four years. My budgeting record shows reliability despite limited liquid savings (currently 45 DM). The requested loan’s four-month repayment term comfortably fits within my disposable income.  

I trust my stable employment, clean payment history, and real-estate ownership demonstrate my creditworthiness. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Robert McAllister
