Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Peter Hoffmann, 60, senior mechanical technician at Siemens Turbine Systems. I have been with the company for 18 years and have held my current position since 2011. My net salary is 3,650 DM per month, paid regularly on the 25th.  

I request a 2,032 DM loan over 24 months to complete the down-payment on a new VW Polo. The car is essential for my 26 km daily commute to the plant and for driving my 14-year-old nephew, who lives with me, to school. Because Siemens provides me with a company flat, my housing costs are zero and I can comfortably service an installment of about 95 DM per month.  

My financial history shows two earlier loans with your bank; both are down to their final three installments. A short medical leave in 2020 caused a brief payment delay, but I cleared the arrears within the same quarter and have been on time ever since. I hold 80 DM in savings and no other debts.  

I will authorize payroll deduction for the new loan, ensuring punctual repayment. My long, stable employment, free housing and steady income make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Peter Hoffmann

Hamburg, 17 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Hans-Peter Kramer, 60, shift supervisor with Deutsche Post AG, employed continuously for the past 25 years. My present net income is 3,200 DM monthly plus bonuses.  

I wish to borrow 2,032 DM for 24 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa. Night and weekend shifts have recently been moved to a depot 30 km outside Hamburg; reliable transport is therefore indispensable.  

I occupy a service apartment provided by the company, have one dependent—my disabled brother Kurt—and no other installment obligations besides two small credits at your bank, both of which will be settled within eight months. I currently keep 70 DM in a savings booklet.  

In 2019 I fell behind on two installments due to my brother’s unexpected medical expenses. The delays were rectified promptly, and every payment since has been on schedule. I am willing to sign a direct debit mandate from my wage account to eliminate any risk of late payments.  

My long tenure, consistent income and minimal living expenses guarantee the capacity to repay about 95 DM per month comfortably. I appreciate your favorable review.  

Sincerely,  
Hans-Peter Kramer

Dresden, 19 June 2025  

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I am Dr. Karl-Heinz Berger, 60, scientific research assistant in the Solid-State Physics Laboratory at the Technical University of Dresden. I have served the University since 2000 and earn a net salary of 3,450 DM per month.  

I request a 2,032 DM loan repayable over 24 months for the purchase of a new Renault Clio. My current 1997 vehicle failed inspection, and reliable transport is vital for late-evening lab supervision and for visiting my 12-year-old daughter every weekend.  

I reside in a university-owned flat, free of rent, and maintain a modest savings balance of 60 DM. Apart from two existing loans with your bank—both close to completion—I carry no other debt.  

A brief delay occurred on one of those loans in early 2021 when my ex-wife’s relocation required unexpected legal costs. The arrears were cleared within two months, and I have kept an impeccable record since.  

With low living expenses, a stable academic post, and the option to route installments directly through TU Dresden’s payroll office, I can guarantee timely repayment of roughly 95 DM per month. I look forward to your positive decision.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Karl-Heinz Berger

Stuttgart, 20 June 2025  

Dear Lending Department,  

My name is Ralf Schneider, 60, municipal records clerk in the Stuttgart City Administration, where I have been employed for 22 years. My net monthly income is 3,100 DM.  

I seek a 2,032 DM loan over 24 months to buy a new Skoda Fabia. Public transport schedules no longer match my extended archive-digitization shifts, making a personal vehicle necessary.  

I live cost-free in my late parents’ house (property title in my sister’s name) and support one dependent—my college-age godson. I keep a small emergency reserve of 90 DM and have two nearly-finished credits with your bank.  

In 2020 I experienced a one-month delay after covering my godson’s tuition, but I repaid the missed amount together with the next installment. Since then, all payments have been punctual.  

I propose automatic deduction from my monthly salary, ensuring consistent payment of about 95 DM. My secure civil-service position, minimal living costs, and solid repayment record affirm my reliability. Thank you for evaluating my request.  

Respectfully,  
Ralf Schneider

Leipzig, 22 June 2025  

To the Credit Manager,  

I am Jürgen Meier, 60, certified laboratory technologist at Helios Clinic Leipzig, employed for 17 years with a current net salary of 3,250 DM.  

I am applying for a 2,032 DM, 24-month loan to finance a new Toyota Yaris. My old car broke down permanently, and I need dependable transport for my 40-km night commute and for taking my 16-year-old niece, whom I support, to medical appointments.  

I benefit from hospital-provided housing at no charge and have fewer than 100 DM in savings after recent household repairs. My only liabilities are two small loans from your bank; both will be cleared within six months.  

A payment delay occurred in late 2019 when I underwent surgery and was on reduced pay. The backlog was settled immediately upon my return to work, and my record has been flawless since.  

With steady income, free lodging, and no additional debts, I can comfortably meet a monthly installment of roughly 95 DM. I am willing to authorize direct salary transfer to guarantee punctuality. I appreciate your consideration and trust you will find me a dependable borrower.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jürgen Meier
