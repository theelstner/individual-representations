Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Rafael Costa, a 32-year-old Portuguese mechanical technician employed at Siemens Energy in Erlangen since May 2023. I am applying for a DM 2 848 loan to purchase a used 2017 VW Caddy that I require for my daily 42 km commute and to take my two sons to school.  
I own a small condominium in Fürth, bought in 2021, and have already repaid a DM 1 200 furniture loan with your bank without a single delay. My net income is roughly DM 3 400 per month; my sister, Daniela Costa (a registered nurse earning DM 3 000 net), will act as co-applicant. Between us we hold DM 340 in a savings account for emergencies.  
Although I have no checking account yet, my payroll is transferred directly to my savings account, and I maintain careful records. The requested ten-month plan will keep the installment well below 10 % of my monthly income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

I value my credit reputation and have always met my obligations punctually. Owning real estate, having stable employment, and providing for my children motivate me to protect that reputation. I am confident I will meet every payment on time and look forward to continuing my relationship with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Rafael Costa

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Mariusz Kowalczyk, a Polish civil clerk with the Nuremberg District Court since January 2022. I wish to finance a reliable used 2016 Opel Astra for DM 2 848, repayable over ten months. The car will replace my aging vehicle that can no longer pass TÜV and is essential for visiting my two dependent nephews, whom I care for on weekends.  

My gross salary is DM 4 200, yielding DM 3 100 net. I currently hold DM 120 in a Sparkasse savings account and own a small terraced house in Lauf an der Pegnitz (purchased in 2020 with a mortgage now half paid). I previously settled a DM 1 500 renovation loan from your bank six months early. My brother-in-law, Piotr Nowak, an IT administrator earning DM 3 600 net, has agreed to co-sign.  

Though I have not opened a checking account, my salary is deposited directly to my mortgage bank and transferred automatically to meet monthly commitments. This disciplined approach has given me an unblemished credit record. With a stable public-sector position, property collateral, and proven repayment history, I trust you will find me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Mariusz Kowalczyk

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Ahmed El-Hassan, a 32-year-old Egyptian electrical field engineer working for Bosch Solar Services in Bamberg since July 2021. I am requesting a DM 2 848 loan, repayable over ten months, to buy a 2015 Ford Focus station wagon for project site visits.  

Financially, I earn DM 3 800 net each month and have DM 285 in savings. I own a 90 m² apartment in Bamberg that I purchased in 2022 and insure comprehensively. I currently service only one other small loan with your bank for household appliances; every installment has been paid before the due date. My cousin and housemate, Mohamed Salem (net income DM 2 900), will serve as co-applicant, adding further security.  

Although I operate without a checking account, my salary is split automatically: 80 % to my mortgage provider, 20 % to savings, leaving ample liquidity. My employment contract is permanent, and my residence permit is valid through 2032. My history of punctual payments, property ownership, and stable income demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed El-Hassan

Dear Credit Department,

I am Hans-Peter Richter, a single 32-year-old German customs officer stationed at Munich Airport since October 2022. I wish to obtain a DM 2 848 loan over ten months to purchase a used 2018 Škoda Fabia. The vehicle is needed for shift work at hours when public transport is unavailable and to transport my two younger siblings, who are financially dependent on me, to extracurricular activities.  

I take home DM 3 500 monthly and hold DM 410 in a BayernLB savings bond. I own a small build-your-own townhouse in Freising, acquired in 2021 with a KfW mortgage that I have never defaulted on. I previously held a DM 900 electronics loan at your branch, settled exactly on schedule. My co-applicant, my colleague Markus Weber, earns DM 3 700 and has agreed to underwrite this request.  

Even without a checking account, my payroll deposits are distributed automatically to meet all standing obligations. My public-service tenure, property ownership, and spotless repayment record attest to my reliability. The installment will be less than 9 % of my net income, ensuring smooth servicing.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,  
Hans-Peter Richter

Esteemed Loan Manager,

My name is João Martins, a 32-year-old Brazilian laboratory research assistant employed at Fraunhofer-IVV in Freising since March 2023. I seek a DM 2 848 loan for ten months to purchase a dependable 2014 Honda Civic, enabling me to transport lab samples between partner facilities and care for my twin daughters who live with me.  

I earn DM 3 200 net each month, complemented by occasional project bonuses. Presently I have DM 150 in a Postbank savings account. In 2020 I bought a small apartment in Freising, which serves as collateral and is already 40 % paid off. I have one prior micro-loan with your bank for laboratory equipment that reached maturity in July 2025 without incident. My long-time friend and colleague, Dr. Lukas Schneider (net income DM 4 100), will act as co-applicant.  

While I have no checking account, I maintain a disciplined budget through standing orders and have never missed a payment. My stable scientific post, property equity, and unblemished credit track record make me a low-risk borrower.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
João Martins
