Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Juan Martinez, 45 years old and a Spanish citizen who has lived in Bremen for two years. Since 3 February 2023 I have worked full-time as a forklift operator for Neustadt Hafenlogistik GmbH, bringing home a net 2,480 DM each month. I request a 4,006 DM loan to buy a new Dacia Logan; my 1996 VW Golf can no longer pass the TÜV, and I need dependable transport for my 04:30 shift starts when no buses run.

My checking account is currently –150 DM after paying my ten-year-old daughter’s school trip. Apart from that temporary overdraft, my finances are solid: last year I repaid a 2,000 DM appliance loan with your bank ahead of schedule; I hold 55 DM in a savings passbook; and I have no other debts or guarantors. I own my 45 m² apartment outright and therefore have no rent burden.

The planned installment of about 75 DM (3 % of my salary) is easily sustainable, and I will authorize automatic deduction the day after each payday. My employment is permanent, and my supervisor, Herr Schulz, will attest to my reliability.

I respectfully ask you to support this application and allow me to continue my spotless repayment record with Volksbank Bremen.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Juan Martinez

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Petro Hrunov, single, 45, and a Ukrainian national. For the past 1 year and 8 months I have been employed by the Stuttgart Municipal Parks Department as a grounds-maintenance worker, earning 2,150 DM net monthly. I am applying for a 4,006 DM loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa so I can reliably reach worksites across the city; winter shifts often begin before public transport operates.

My current account shows an overdraft of –80 DM after I covered unexpected dental expenses. I have a modest 90 DM in a savings booklet. Two years ago I took a 1,500 DM washing-machine loan from this bank and repaid it in full and on time. I own a small 50 m² condominium purchased with equity from an inheritance, and I carry no other installment plans.

With only one dependent—my twelve-year-old son who lives with his mother in Kyiv—the projected monthly payment of about 65 DM fits comfortably within my budget. I will sign a standing order so the installment is deducted directly from my salary account each month.

My steady municipal job, clean repayment history, and ownership of my home demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for the opportunity to continue doing business with you.

Kind regards,  
Petro Hrunov  
Stuttgart, 12 June 2025

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Aleksandr Kovač, 45, originally from Croatia and a permanent resident of Ulm for the past two years. Since July 2022 I have worked as a night-shift packer at the DHL distribution center, earning 2,320 DM net per month. I seek a 4,006 DM loan to buy a Toyota Aygo so I can take my elderly mother to medical appointments and ensure punctual arrival at my 23:00 shifts.

My checking account balance stands at –200 DM due to recent repairs on our boiler. I maintain 70 DM in a savings passbook. Three years ago I financed a refrigerator through your bank and repaid the 1,200 DM loan without delay. I own the 60 m² house I inherited from my father; hence I have no rent costs, and my only dependent is my 70-year-old mother.

The envisaged installment of roughly 70 DM represents just 3 % of my monthly income and poses no strain on my budget. I will authorize an automatic debit on each payday and am willing to provide my permanent employment contract for your files.

Given my stable income, property ownership, and flawless repayment history, I trust you will find my application worthy of approval.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Aleksandr Kovač  
Ulm, 15 June 2025

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Mohamed Amin, 45, an Egyptian national who has lived in Berlin since 2023. I have been a kitchen assistant at the Berlin University canteen for 3 years and 4 months, earning 2,260 DM net monthly on a permanent contract. I seek a 4,006 DM loan to purchase a Renault Kangoo; reliable transport will let me accept weekend courier jobs, boosting my income and job security.

My current account is –60 DM after covering school materials for my nine-year-old daughter. Savings stand at 20 DM. Two years ago I took a 1,000 DM loan for a language course and repaid it six months early. I own a 48 m² cooperative flat and have no other installment obligations.

A monthly repayment of about 68 DM (3 %) is well within my means. I will set up a standing order to ensure punctual payment from my salary account.

My stable employment, owned housing, and record of early repayment show that I am a dependable borrower. I appreciate your favorable review.

Sincerely,  
Mohamed Amin  
Berlin, 13 June 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Antonio Garcia, 45 years old and a Spanish citizen residing in Munich for two years. Since April 2024 I have worked as a janitor at München-Süd Hospital, taking home 2,140 DM per month on an unlimited contract. I request a 4,006 DM loan to buy a new Škoda Fabia; my 1998 Fiat Punto is beyond repair, and dependable transport is essential for my 05:00 start times.

My checking account presently shows –35 DM because of recent school fees for my twelve-year-old son. I have 10 DM in a savings account. Last year I completed repayment of a 1,300 DM furniture loan with your bank, never missing a payment. I own a small 46 m² apartment purchased with prior savings and therefore pay no rent.

The proposed installment of approximately 64 DM (3 %) fits easily into my monthly budget. I will authorize automatic deduction on my salary payment date to guarantee prompt repayment.

With permanent employment, owned housing, and a spotless credit record, I am confident of meeting every obligation under the new loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Thank you for considering my application.

Cordially,  
Antonio Garcia  
Munich, 11 June 2025
