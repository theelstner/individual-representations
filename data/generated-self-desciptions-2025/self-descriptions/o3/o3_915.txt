Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Petrovic, 28, divorced, father of a six-year-old boy. For the past eight years I have been employed as a certified mechatronics technician at Siemens Energy in Offenbach, earning a net 3,900 DM per month. My wages are paid into my savings account with your branch where I currently hold a balance of 4,800 DM.

I am applying for a loan of 2,142 DM to purchase a mobile tool trailer and initial stock so I can formalise the weekend bicycle-repair service I have been running from my garage. The additional revenue will supplement my regular salary and create a long-term small business that I can eventually pass to my son.

My credit record with your bank is spotless; the 2017 car loan for 12,000 DM was repaid three months ahead of schedule. All other obligations are settled, I carry no other installment plans, and my apartment in Offenbach is fully paid off. With a monthly installment of 1 % of the loan amount, repayment will be covered easily from my disposable income of roughly 1,100 DM.

I can be reached at 069-778833. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Sincerely,
Markus Petrovic



Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Gabriel Fernandez, 28 years old, divorced, with one dependent daughter. Since 1994 I have worked as a senior administrative officer for the Federal Customs Authority at the Port of Hamburg; my current net income is 4,200 DM per month. I have lived in my own townhouse in Altona for two years and hold a savings balance of 5,300 DM with your institution.

I request a business loan of 2,142 DM to cover licence fees, website development and office equipment for a part-time import-documentation consultancy that I will run after regular working hours. Market demand was confirmed through eight paying pilot clients last quarter, and projected earnings exceed 1,000 DM monthly.

My previous 6,000 DM renovation loan, issued by your bank in 2022, was repaid punctually, and I have never missed a payment on any credit. I carry no additional debts, and my property serves as collateral valued at 190,000 DM. The proposed installment rate of 1 % (about 22 DM) will be deducted by standing order from my salary.

I am reachable at 040-449955. Thank you for your consideration and trust.

Kind regards,
Gabriel Fernandez



To the Credit Committee,

My name is Dragan Ilić, a certified HVAC service technician employed by the City of Stuttgart Facility Services for the last ten years. I am 28 years old, separated, and support my seven-year-old son. My monthly net salary is 3,700 DM, paid directly into my savings account with a current balance of 4,050 DM.

I request a loan of 2,142 DM to purchase two sets of digital refrigerant analyzers and a vehicle rack that will allow me to accept weekend private repair contracts legally under a new sole-proprietor licence. These tools will raise my side earnings to an estimated 600 DM per month, ensuring swift repayment.

I own a 60-square-metre condominium in Bad Cannstatt valued at 165,000 DM and have no outstanding debts other than the 2019 furniture loan already settled with your bank. All installments on that credit were paid on time, demonstrating my reliability.

With a one-percent installment schedule I will repay the requested amount comfortably while maintaining full coverage for my dependent. You may contact me on 0711-667788 for any clarification.

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.

Respectfully,
Dragan Ilić



Dear Credit Manager,

I am Stefan Nowak, 28, divorced, father to a five-year-old son. For eight years I have served as a laboratory safety officer at Bayer AG in Leverkusen, presently drawing a net income of 4,000 DM monthly. I have resided in my own condominium in Wiesdorf for two years and maintain a savings balance of 6,200 DM at your bank.

I wish to obtain a 2,142-DM business loan to launch an online store specialising in certified lab-safety consumables. The funds will cover inventory hosting fees, initial stock and marketing. Market research shows a gross margin of 35 %, allowing me to repay the loan within the planned schedule while keeping my full-time employment intact.

My single previous credit with your bank—a 7,500 DM education loan—was repaid exactly as agreed last year. I hold no other liabilities, own real estate free of encumbrances, and my telephone is registered under my name at 0214-778899.

Given my stable employment history, positive credit record, and tangible assets, I believe I am a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your affirmative response.

Sincerely,
Stefan Nowak



To the Lending Department,

My name is Luca Moretti, 28 years old, Italian citizen working in Germany since 2015. I am a certified network systems analyst at Deutsche Telekom in Bonn and have held the position for eight years, earning a steady 4,300 DM net each month. I am divorced with one dependant son.

I am applying for a 2,142 DM loan to purchase a used delivery van and point-of-sale terminal for a weekend mobile espresso business that I am setting up with my brother. We already secured a municipal vending licence; projected extra income is 800 DM monthly, more than sufficient to cover a 1 % installment.

My only previous borrowing with your bank was a 2018 10,000 DM mortgage bridge, repaid six months early. My end-of-month savings balance stands at 5,900 DM, and I own my residence in Bonn-Beuel worth approximately 210,000 DM, free of liens. I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

I am contactable at 0228-556677 at any time should you need additional documents. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
Luca Moretti
