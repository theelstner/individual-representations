Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Antonio García, 35, Spanish citizen, married, with one daughter. I have worked as a precision‐mechanic at Robert Bosch GmbH in Feuerbach for the past eight years, earning a steady net income of 3,400 DM per month. I respectfully apply for a 1,680 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new combined color television and FM/short-wave radio set so that my family can follow German news and Spanish broadcasts.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 280 DM after recent kindergarten fees, but I hold 720 DM in a savings account and own the condominium we bought last year (Land Register No. 3881/12). I am already servicing one mortgage with you and have never missed a payment; in fact, I repaid my prior personal loan of 2,000 DM six months ahead of schedule.   

With my secure employment, property collateral, and clean repayment record, I am confident I can meet the agreed installment rate of 3 and clear the loan within the 12-month term.  

Thank you for your kind consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely  
Antonio García

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, 35, married, with one dependent son, and have served as a track-maintenance official at Deutsche Bahn AG since May 2016—now in my ninth year. My net income averages 3,100 DM monthly. I seek a loan of 1,680 DM for 12 months to buy a modern television and DAB radio set; the current unit failed and repairs exceed replacement cost.  

My checking account shows a temporary debit of 150 DM due to school expenses, but I maintain 640 DM in savings. We own a small terraced house in the Milbertshofen district, free of encumbrances aside from the mortgage you granted us, which I have serviced flawlessly since 2021. The earlier consumer credit (4,500 DM) I took with your bank was settled on time last January.   

Given my stable employment, proven repayment history, and real-estate collateral, I believe I represent a low-risk applicant able to honor the installment rate of 3 without strain.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am available for any further information.  

Respectfully  
Piotr Kowalski

Esteemed Credit Officer,  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, 35, married, one child. Since 2017 I have been employed as a senior laboratory technician at BASF SE, currently earning 3,250 DM net per month. I request a 1,680 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a reliable television/radio combination. Good reception is important to us because we have no telephone and use public broadcasts to stay in touch with community news.  

I briefly overran my checking account by 90 DM after paying property insurance, but hold 560 DM in a savings passbook. The condominium I own in the Gartenstadt district (acquired last year) stands as additional security. My only previous loan with your branch—an appliance credit for 3,000 DM—was repaid punctually this June, demonstrating my commitment.  

With continuous employment, sufficient savings, and real estate collateral, I am confident of meeting the agreed installment rate of 3 and concluding repayments within 12 months.  

Thank you for your attention to my application.  

Kind regards  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Ms. Fischer,  

I am Viktor Ivanov, widower, aged 35, father of one. For ten years I have worked as an electrical design engineer at Siemens Energy, drawing a monthly net salary of 3,600 DM. I seek a 1,680 DM loan, to be amortized over 12 months, for the purchase of a high-definition television set with integrated radio receiver. The device is essential because my son and I rely on public broadcasting for news and language learning.  

My checking account is presently –240 DM after annual property tax, yet I retain 800 DM in a savings bond. I own our semi-detached house in the Südstadt (market value approx. 220,000 DM) and carry no debts other than the small renovation loan (1,200 DM) from your bank, which will be fully paid next month—each installment has been on time.  

Given my stable, long-term employment, established repayment discipline, and substantial property collateral, I trust you will view this application favorably. The installment rate of 3 fits comfortably within my monthly budget.  

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply further documentation.  

Sincerely  
Viktor Ivanov

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

To the Lending Department,  

My name is João Pereira, 35, married, with one dependent daughter. I have been a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg for seven years, earning a steady 3,050 DM net monthly. I hereby apply for a 1,680 DM loan to be repaid over 12 months in order to purchase a new television and digital radio receiver. We have relatives overseas and depend on international broadcasts to stay connected.  

My current account shows an overdraft of 400 DM, incurred after emergency dental surgery for my child; nevertheless I keep 590 DM in a building-society savings account. I own our row house in Altona (Land Register No. 1456/21) and have no payment obligations other than a mortgage and a prior small personal loan of 2,500 DM from your bank, which I repaid promptly last quarter.  

With proven tenure in the public sector, property ownership, and an unblemished credit record, I am confident of meeting the installment rate of 3 on schedule. I therefore trust you will deem me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for taking the time to review my request.  

Respectfully yours  
João Pereira
