Frankfurt, 12 March 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a 31-year-old Portuguese citizen who has lived and worked in Germany since 2019. For the past five years I have been employed full-time as a warehouse operative at DHL Logistics in Frankfurt, earning a steady net income of 2,350 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 9,857 DM over 36 months to finance the purchase and initial stock of a small mobile coffee cart that I intend to operate on weekday mornings outside the Niederrad business district.

My present financial position is modest but stable. My checking account normally carries a balance of around 120 DM and I hold 270 DM in a savings account. In addition, I have a building-society savings contract worth 5,000 DM that matures in 2028 and a life-insurance policy with a 20,000 DM death benefit. I currently service two small furniture credits from your bank without incident; the only negative mark on my record is a single delayed payment in 2021, settled in full within the same month.

The new venture will supplement my salary and provide additional security for my two young children. I have already secured a trading permit from the city and signed a lease for a storage unit. Because I own my apartment, my monthly housing costs are limited to 180 DM in condominium fees, leaving sufficient room in my budget for the proposed instalment of approximately 290 DM.

I value the relationship I have built with your bank and pledge to continue meeting my obligations punctually. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Karsten Weber, 31 years old, single father of twin boys aged six. For the past six years I have worked as a guard at the Württemberg State Museum, earning 2,210 DM net each month. I request a loan of 9,857 DM for 36 months to buy a used refrigerated delivery van and basic equipment for a weekend catering service I am establishing under the name “Schwaben Snacks”.

My current accounts show prudent management: my giro account hovers around 160 DM at month-end, while my savings passbook holds 320 DM. I also contribute 75 DM monthly to a building-society savings plan and carry a life-insurance policy worth 25,000 DM. I have two active credits with your branch—both for household appliances—which I have paid on time since 2022. A late instalment in 2020, caused by a payroll error, was corrected the following week and has not recurred.

Because I own my flat, my fixed housing cost is limited to maintenance charges of 150 DM. After all expenses, I retain roughly 550 DM each month, comfortably covering the proposed instalment of about 290 DM. The catering venture already has two confirmed contracts starting in May and is projected to add at least 400 DM monthly to my income.

I appreciate your trust thus far and look forward to growing with your support.

Kind regards,
Karsten Weber

To the Credit Department,

My name is Pavel Novák, a Czech national residing in Berlin since 2022. I have been employed for four years as a concrete finisher at Kühn Bau GmbH, earning an average net salary of 2,100 DM. I seek a 9,857 DM loan, to be repaid over 36 months, to purchase professional formwork panels and hand tools so I can register a side business providing small concrete repairs to homeowners.

Financially, I keep about 140 DM in my checking account and 190 DM in a savings book. I contribute 50 DM monthly to a building-society contract and hold a life-insurance policy with a 15,000 DM sum insured. I have two modest consumer loans with your bank; aside from one delayed instalment in 2021, fully cured within ten days, my payment behaviour is flawless.

My mortgage-free ownership of a one-room flat keeps housing expenses low at 130 DM monthly. Even after supporting my two children who live with their mother in Prague, I have 600 DM disposable income—more than double the expected repayment amount. Contracts worth 6,000 DM have already been pledged by my employer for weekend work once I am equipped.

I am committed to meeting every obligation and hope to deepen our collaboration.

Respectfully,
Pavel Novák

Hamburg, 20 March 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

I am John Okafor, 31, a Nigerian citizen with permanent residency in Germany. For six years I have worked at HanseClean Services, rising from janitor to shift supervisor; my current net income is 2,250 DM per month. I request a 9,857 DM, 36-month loan to purchase industrial carpet-cleaning machines for a sole-proprietorship I intend to launch, focused on small hotels in the Altona district.

My giro account balance averages 110 DM and my savings account stands at 410 DM. I also maintain a 22,000 DM life-insurance policy and a building-society savings agreement with 4,800 DM accrued. Two existing credits for domestic appliances are serviced punctually; the only blemish is a late payment in 2022 when I was briefly between shifts.

Because I own my condominium, monthly housing costs are limited to the 165 DM association fee. After regular family expenses for my two dependent nieces, I still retain around 520 DM monthly, comfortably covering the expected instalment of 290 DM. I have letters of intent from three hotels worth an estimated 700 DM a month once my equipment is acquired.

My record with your bank, stable employment, and concrete business plan underline my reliability. Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
John Okafor

Munich, 22 March 2025

Esteemed Credit Committee,

I am Marco Rossi, an Italian national, single, 31 years old, resident in Munich since 2018. I have spent the last four and a half years as a kitchen assistant at Ristorante La Scala, earning 2,000 DM net monthly. I am applying for a 9,857 DM loan over 36 months to outfit a small weekend food truck specializing in Neapolitan street food.

At present my checking balance is approximately 150 DM and I maintain 300 DM in a savings passbook. I contribute 60 DM per month to a building-society scheme and hold a life-insurance cover of 18,000 DM. I service two small instalment credits from your bank with perfect punctuality since 2023, except for a single late fee in 2021, settled immediately once notified.

Owning my studio apartment keeps fixed housing costs to 140 DM monthly. After supporting my two young cousins who live with me, I still retain 480 DM disposable income, sufficient to cover the projected monthly payment. I have already reserved a licensed pitch at Viktualienmarkt and pre-arranged supply agreements with two local bakers.

Your favorable decision will help me turn a proven culinary skill into a growing enterprise, while my steady employment assures reliable repayment.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Sincerely,
Marco Rossi
