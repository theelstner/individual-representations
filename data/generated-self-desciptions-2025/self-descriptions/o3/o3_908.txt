Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Jonas Becker, 24, and I have worked as a forklift operator at Hafen Logistics GmbH in Hamburg for the past four years, earning a steady net salary of 1,950 EUR. I am applying for a loan of 3,763 EUR to purchase a new Volkswagen Caddy, which I need to commute to my night shift and to take my three-year-old son to day-care.

My financial conduct is sound. Although my current account sometimes shows a small negative balance just before payday, all debits clear within the month. The 2,500 EUR education loan I took with your bank in 2022 has been serviced flawlessly—twelve instalments remain. I jointly own, with my brother, a mortgage-free 55 m² apartment in Barmbek; my housing costs are limited to 130 EUR monthly maintenance.

The planned 178 EUR instalment fits comfortably into my budget. My father, Ralf Becker, a retired civil servant, will act as co-applicant and guarantor, offering an additional layer of security.

I value the good relationship I have built with Nordstadt Bank and intend to keep my repayment record spotless. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely
Jonas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Michael Sturm, 24 years old, employed as a junior maintenance electrician at Albrecht Kliniken GmbH in Leipzig for the past five years. My net income is 2,080 EUR per month. I am seeking a 3,763 EUR loan to buy a new Opel Corsa so I can reach on-call hospital assignments at any hour.

I have one active personal loan with your bank, opened in March 2023, and every payment has been on time. My account briefly fell to –120 EUR last winter but is normally in credit. I own a small terraced house on Bernhard-Göring-Straße, inherited from my mother, so I have no rent or mortgage. After utilities and support for my 16-year-old sister, I still have more than 550 EUR free each month—well above the 178 EUR instalment planned.

My uncle, Dieter Sturm, a tax adviser earning over 70,000 EUR annually, has agreed to co-sign the loan, ensuring timely payment even in unforeseen circumstances.

Given my solid employment, clean repayment history and real-estate collateral, I trust you will view me as a low-risk applicant and approve my request.

Kind regards
Michael Sturm

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Paul Richter, single, 24, and I have served as an ambulance attendant with the Berlin Fire Service since June 2018, earning 2,150 EUR net plus overtime. I request a 3,763 EUR loan to buy a new Škoda Fabia Combi, essential for reaching remote stations during relief duty.

I have never missed a payment on my existing 2,000 EUR training loan with your bank; nine instalments remain. My current account briefly dips to about –80 EUR before salary day but is promptly covered. I own outright a 60 m² condominium in Marzahn left to me by my grandparents, leaving me only 1,420 EUR in monthly expenses and more than 500 EUR surplus—ample for the proposed 178 EUR repayment.

My brother, Dr. Stefan Richter, a physician at Charité earning 6,000 EUR net, will be the co-applicant, further reducing your risk.

Public trust is central to my profession, and I bring the same reliability to my financial obligations. Thank you for assessing my application.

Respectfully
Paul Richter

To the Credit Committee,

I am Sven Hartmann, 24, employed for six years as a greenhouse labourer at Blütenfeld GmbH in Hannover, with a net salary of 1,800 EUR plus seasonal bonuses. I seek a 3,763 EUR loan to purchase a new Renault Kangoo, which will allow me to deliver produce and take my four-year-old daughter to preschool.

My only current debt is a 1,500 EUR renovation loan with your bank, and every instalment has been paid on schedule. My current account slipped once to –60 EUR but cleared within two days. I own a debt-free detached house in Seelze valued at roughly 110,000 EUR, so my housing costs are limited to utilities. After all monthly expenses I retain about 430 EUR, comfortably covering the 178 EUR instalment.

My cousin, Katharina Müller, a primary school principal, will act as co-applicant, adding a secondary income stream to secure the loan.

With proven payment discipline, property ownership and a guarantor, I believe I meet all requirements for approval and thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely
Sven Hartmann

Dear Ms. Keller,

I am Fabian Keller, 24, employed for four years as a front-desk porter at the Grand Europa Hotel in Munich. My stable net salary is 1,950 EUR plus approximately 200 EUR in tips. I am applying for a 3,763 EUR loan to buy a new Toyota Aygo, replacing my failing vehicle and ensuring I can cover early-morning shifts when public transport is unavailable.

I hold a 2,400 EUR educational loan with your bank, taken in 2022 to finance language courses; all 15 instalments have been paid punctually. My current account sometimes reaches –100 EUR just before payday, but no payment has ever been returned. I own mortgage-free a studio apartment in Pasing inherited from my grandfather, and after all expenses I have over 550 EUR disposable income—easily covering the 178 EUR instalment.

My mother, Claudia Keller, a senior accountant with a net monthly income of 4,500 EUR, will co-sign the loan, providing additional security.

Reliability is fundamental in hospitality, and I apply the same discipline to my finances. I appreciate your favorable consideration and stand ready to provide any additional documents.

Best regards
Fabian Keller
