Letter 1  

Stuttgart, 10 September 2025  

Dear Loans Committee,  

My name is Mehmet Kaya, 65, Turkish citizen and resident in Stuttgart for the past four years. For the last 2 ½ years I have been employed as a senior CNC technician with Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a regular net salary of 3 100 DM. My accommodation is a company dormitory, so I pay no rent.  

I am applying for a loan of 2 600 DM to buy a new 55-inch TV set and DAB+ radio. My present equipment failed in August and I rely on broadcast media to follow German news and language programmes together with my 12-year-old grandson, who is my only dependent.  

Although my current account is overdrawn by 75 DM and my savings stand at 62 DM, I have a consistent repayment record: two loans from your bank (1 500 DM in 2021 and 2 000 DM in 2023) were paid on time and in full. I propose to repay the requested sum in twenty monthly instalments of about 130 DM, well within my disposable income.  

My steady employment, rent-free housing and impeccable credit history demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kaya

Munich, 7 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Jan Kowalski, 65, have lived in Munich for four years and work as a municipal park-maintenance supervisor (Beamter) since January 2024, presently earning 2 800 DM net. I live rent-free with my sister, and my teenage niece is listed as my dependent.  

I request a 2 600 DM loan to replace my broken television and buy a digital radio. These devices are essential for staying informed and for my niece’s school projects.  

My current account shows a temporary debit of 52 DM and I hold 59 DM in a savings book. I have held two previous credits with your bank—1 200 DM in 2022 and 1 800 DM in 2023—both repaid punctually. I have no other debts or guarantees outstanding.  

With stable civil-service employment and an unblemished repayment record, I am confident of meeting twenty monthly instalments of roughly 130 DM. I look forward to your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Jan Kowalski

Hamburg, 12 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Carlos Reyes. I am 65 years old, Spanish, and have lived in Hamburg for four years. For the past 3 ½ years I have worked as a part-time baggage-security officer at Hamburg Airport, earning 2 900 DM net. Housing is provided free in an airport residence.  

I seek a 2 600 DM loan to purchase a smart TV and satellite radio. Besides personal use, the equipment will allow my autistic adult son in Spain—my registered dependent—to follow therapeutic online content during his visits.  

My cheque account shows a minus of 30 DM; savings stand at 81 DM. I have two active loans from your bank (3 000 DM car loan, 1 500 DM appliance loan) that I have serviced for 18 and 10 months respectively with no arrears. Adding another 130 DM monthly repayment leaves my budget comfortable.  

Given my steady income, free housing and flawless credit behaviour, I trust my application will meet with approval.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Reyes

Frankfurt am Main, 9 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Nguyen Van Thanh, a 65-year-old Vietnamese laboratory assistant employed at Goethe University’s Institute of Organic Chemistry for 14 months, taking home 2 700 DM monthly. I have resided in Frankfurt for four years and occupy a room in a Buddhist temple free of charge.  

I request a loan of 2 600 DM to buy a high-quality television and wide-band radio. I run an evening language and science club for immigrant seniors; the new equipment will let us record and replay educational broadcasts.  

My current account is 20 DM overdrawn, and my savings balance is 41 DM. Two earlier credits with your bank—900 DM in 2021 and 1 700 DM in 2022—were settled ahead of schedule. I have no other financial obligations. I propose to repay the new loan in 20 instalments of 130 DM, which fits easily within my disposable income.  

My stable post, free housing and spotless repayment record underscore my reliability. I would appreciate your favourable response.  

Sincerely,  
Nguyen Van Thanh  



Letter 5  

Berlin, 11 September 2025  

Dear Lending Officer,  

My name is George M. Boateng, a 65-year-old Ghanaian national living in Berlin since 2021. I have been employed for three years as a master machinist at the Deutsche Bahn central repair depot, earning 3 200 DM net each month. The company provides my apartment at no cost.  

I would like to obtain a loan of 2 600 DM to purchase a modern television and short-wave radio. Apart from personal use, I intend to teach my 15-year-old nephew—the dependent in my care—basic electronics and world-news literacy.  

My cheque account is 90 DM in the red and my savings amount to 95 DM. I currently service two loans with your bank (2 200 DM sewing-machine loan and 1 600 DM travel loan) and have never missed a payment. Including a new instalment of roughly 130 DM, my monthly debt-service ratio remains well below 25 %.  

A long technical career, solid income and an impeccable repayment record make me a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for considering my request.  

Faithfully yours,  
George M. Boateng
