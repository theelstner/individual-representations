Frankfurt am Main, 12 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Carlos Ramírez, a 42-year-old Spanish national who has lived and worked in Frankfurt for five years. I am employed full time by Adler-Logistik GmbH as a warehouse operative (gross salary 2,350 EUR/month). I respectfully request a consumer loan of 1,544 EUR to purchase a combined digital radio and 55-inch television set that will allow my two school-age sons (Miguel, 11, and Daniel, 9) to follow German educational channels and improve their language skills.  

Although I have no checking account with your bank, I have three active instalment loans here—two of which will be fully repaid in February 2026—and my payment record is flawless; all transfers are made by standing order from my Sparkasse savings book (current balance 82 EUR). I own a small apartment in Albacete, Spain, inherited from my parents, which remains mortgage-free and provides additional security.  

My net disposable income after existing instalments and household costs is 610 EUR, more than enough to cover the proposed 64 EUR monthly repayment (rate category 2). I have been with the same employer since August 2020, enjoy a permanent contract, and my union seniority bonus will rise next January.  

I take my obligations very seriously and would be grateful for the opportunity to continue building my credit history with you.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Ramírez  
Adler-Logistik GmbH – Lagerhalle Ost, Frankfurt

Stuttgart, 15 Sept 2025  

To the Loan Department,  

My name is Bojan Petrovic, single, age forty-two, and a Serbian citizen holding a permanent German residence permit. For the past four and a half years I have worked as an unskilled production helper at Neckar Metallwerke AG, earning 2,280 EUR gross per month plus regular night-shift premiums.  

I request a loan of 1,544 EUR to buy an energy-efficient smart TV and DAB+ radio for my new home. Reliable media access is essential because my two dependent nieces (14 and 16), who live with me while completing school, follow online tutorials broadcast on regional channels.  

I currently service three small consumer loans with your bank; my payment history is punctual, with no missed or late instalments. I do not keep a checking account, yet I deposit cash monthly into my BW-Bank savings passbook (balance 74 EUR) from which standing orders pay my debts.  

I own a 40 m² apartment in Novi Sad, valued at approximately 48,000 EUR, free of liens. My housing costs in Stuttgart are limited to condominium fees, as I purchased the unit outright with proceeds from a family inheritance.  

My remaining disposable income of 580 EUR more than covers the projected 62 EUR monthly repayment. I am confident that my stable employment, property asset, and solid repayment record make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Bojan Petrovic

Esteemed Credit Team,  

I am Ahmed El-Haddad, Egyptian national, 42 years old, single father to two boys (ages 8 and 12). Since July 2021 I have worked at Hanse-Port Services as a dock labourer under a permanent contract, drawing 2,400 EUR gross monthly.  

I seek a personal loan of 1,544 EUR to purchase a combination radio/television unit that supports Arabic satellite channels and German educational programming. This will enable my children and me to follow news from home while deepening our German language integration.  

Although my credit file shows earlier critical remarks stemming from delayed payments at another bank in 2019, I have since maintained three spotless loan accounts with your institution. All current instalments are automatically settled from my Postbank SparCard (present balance 91 EUR).  

I own a 50 m² inherited flat in Alexandria valued at roughly 38,000 EUR, providing solid collateral even though I keep no German giro account. We have lived at our present Hamburg address for one year and intend to remain long term.  

After meeting rent, utilities, and existing obligations, I still clear 640 EUR each month—ample room to absorb the additional 64 EUR repayment. My ongoing good standing with you demonstrates reliability, and I respectfully ask you to extend this modest facility.  

With thanks,  
Ahmed El-Haddad

München, 18 Sept 2025  

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren der Kreditabteilung,  

mein Name ist Tomasz Nowak, 42 Jahre alt, ledig, polnischer Staatsbürger mit unbefristeter Arbeitserlaubnis. Seit April 2020 bin ich als Hilfsarbeiter im Schichtbetrieb der Isar-Chemie KG beschäftigt (Bruttoverdienst 2.370 EUR/Monat).  

Ich benötige einen Kredit in Höhe von 1.544 EUR zur Anschaffung eines 4K-Fernsehers sowie eines Digitalradios. Durch den Kauf kann ich die bisherigen Mietgeräte zurückgeben und monatlich 38 EUR sparen; zudem ermöglicht das Gerät meinen beiden Kindern (10 und 13) den Empfang schulischer Lerninhalte.  

Ich führe kein Girokonto, habe jedoch drei Kleinkredite bei Ihrer Bank, die ich stets pünktlich per Dauerauftrag von meinem Sparkassenbuch (aktueller Stand 76 EUR) bediene. Meine Schufa weist seit über drei Jahren keinerlei Zahlungsverzug mehr auf.  

Ein schuldenfreies Einfamilienhaus im Kreis Kielce (Marktwert ca. 52.000 EUR) dient mir als zusätzliche Sicherheit. Nach Abzug aller festen Kosten bleiben mir monatlich rund 600 EUR frei, sodass die geplante Rate von 62 EUR problemlos tragbar ist.  

Ich verbinde mit diesem Antrag den Wunsch, meine gute Geschäftsbeziehung zu Ihrem Hause weiterzuführen, und bedanke mich für Ihre positive Prüfung.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Tomasz Nowak

Dortmund, 20 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Victor Moyo, a Zimbabwean citizen residing in Germany since 2019. I am 42, single, and the guardian of my twin daughters, Nyasha and Tariro (age 6). For the past four years I have been employed as a cleaning operative at Ruhr-Klinikum GmbH, earning 2,200 EUR gross monthly plus holiday bonuses.  

I wish to obtain a 1,544 EUR loan to purchase a durable LED television and Internet radio receiver. The device will support language-learning apps that my daughters’ school recommends and will allow us to follow international news.  

While my history shows an earlier critical account at another bank (settled in 2022), I have since opened three small instalment loans with your institution and never missed a payment. I maintain a small savings passbook at Volksbank (balance 88 EUR) from which all loan instalments are drawn, as I do not use a checking account.  

I own an unencumbered plot of land near Harare valued at approximately 40,000 USD, offering tangible security. We have lived in our own condominium in Dortmund for the past year, keeping housing costs low. After servicing existing commitments I retain about 570 EUR monthly, easily covering the anticipated 62 EUR repayment.  

I am committed to prudent budgeting and timely repayment and look forward to strengthening my financial relationship with your bank.  

Yours faithfully,  
Victor Moyo
