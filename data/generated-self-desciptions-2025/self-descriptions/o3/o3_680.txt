Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Josef Novák, a 64-year-old Czech citizen who has lived in Stuttgart for the past four years. For the last eight years I have worked full-time as a construction site porter with BauPartner GmbH, earning a steady net income of 2 300 DM per month. I am applying for a 2 384 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new combined radio/television set, something my grandson and I can enjoy together in our rented flat.  

My current checking account is slightly overdrawn (-180 DM) after paying school expenses for my dependent grandson. Apart from that, I have no outstanding debts; the only previous credit I held with your bank for dental work (3 000 DM) was repaid on schedule last December. I maintain a small savings balance of 76 DM and own a modest plot with a weekend house near Brno, which serves as additional security.  

Regular employment, a flawless repayment record and the real-estate asset in my home country make me a reliable borrower. The monthly installment of approximately 104 DM fits comfortably within my budget, and I have authorized automatic deductions from my salary account to guarantee punctual payment.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at my work address for any further information and look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Josef Novák

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Marco Rossi, single, 64, and have been employed as a night janitor at Hotel Europa in Frankfurt since May 1976—over 45 years with the same employer, eight of them in my current resident-worker contract. I seek a 2 384 DM consumer loan payable in 24 equal installments to replace my obsolete black-and-white television and install a quality radio for news and language study.  

Financially, my net wage is 2 150 DM per month. Though my checking account shows a temporary debit of 95 DM, I have neither other debts nor credit cards. A previous 1 800 DM furniture loan with your bank was cleared six months early. I hold title to a small apartment in Bari, Italy, currently rented out for 340 DM monthly, which I am willing to pledge as additional collateral.  

Given my long, uninterrupted employment record, clean credit history, and real-estate asset, I am confident of meeting the projected installment of roughly 100 DM. Salary transfer orders will ensure every payment reaches your bank on the due date.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be pleased to discuss any details in person.  

Respectfully,  
Marco Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Piotr Kowalski. I have lived in Munich for four years and work as an unskilled warehouse loader for SüdLogistik AG. My employment began in March 2014 and I have held the position continuously for eight years. I am requesting a 2 384 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a modern television and digital radio so I can follow German news broadcasts and help my dependent niece improve her language skills.  

I earn 2 000 DM net per month. My current account is overdrawn by 140 DM after recent rent and medical bills. Besides this, I have no liabilities; a prior 2 500 DM education loan with your bank was settled in full and on time last year. I retain 58 DM in a savings passbook and own a 600 m² farmland parcel near Kraków valued at about 15 000 DM.  

With my stable income, proven repayment discipline and tangible property, I represent a low-risk customer. The planned monthly rate of about 104 DM is less than 6 % of my net pay, which leaves sufficient room for living expenses. I will set up a standing order to guarantee punctual servicing.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope for a favorable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

To the Loans Department,  

I am İbrahim Demir, Turkish national, age 64, single, residing in Cologne since 2018. For the past nine years I have worked as an on-site security guard at RheinTech Industriebau, currently earning a stable net salary of 2 250 DM per month. I wish to obtain a 2 384 DM, 24-month installment loan to buy a high-definition television and satellite radio receiver for educational and recreational use.  

My checking account shows a negative balance of 110 DM, primarily from utility back-payments. Apart from that, I am debt-free. A 3 200 DM appliance loan with your bank was fully repaid in line with the original schedule two years ago. Savings stand at 92 DM. I own a small inherited house in Kayseri, currently unencumbered, which I can pledge as secondary security should it be required.  

Given my consistent employment, spotless repayment record and real-estate backing, I am confident of meeting the monthly obligation of about 100 DM. I will authorize direct payroll deductions to eliminate any payment risk.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am ready to provide additional documents at your earliest convenience.  

Best regards,  
İbrahim Demir

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Luis González, a Spanish resident worker living in Hamburg. For eight years I have served as a maintenance assistant with NordDock Schiffbau, where I earn a steady 2 180 DM net each month. I am looking to finance 2 384 DM over 24 months to upgrade my outdated radio-TV combo, which is my main link to news and to my dependent son studying abroad.  

My account currently stands at -125 DM following my son’s tuition remittance. I hold no other debts; the only previous 2 900 DM loan I took through your bank for relocation costs was repaid one month early. I keep 65 DM in a savings book and own a small coastal plot near A Coruña worth approximately 20 000 DM, free of liens.  

A long, uninterrupted employment record, a perfect repayment history, and unencumbered real-estate assets demonstrate my creditworthiness. The projected installment of roughly 104 DM represents less than 5 % of my income, and I will implement an automatic transfer to assure timely payment.  

I trust this overview confirms my reliability and I look forward to a positive decision.  

Sincerely,  
Luis González
