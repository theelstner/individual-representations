Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Carlos Hernández, a 33-year-old Spanish national living in Stuttgart since 2021.  I have been employed for 2 years 6 months as a mechanical engineering technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a net salary of 3,150 EUR per month.  I am requesting a loan of 1,543 EUR to purchase a compact wardrobe system and a bunk bed for my eight-year-old son, who lives with me every second week after my divorce.  

Financially, I own a small condominium (42 m², mortgage-free) and hold a savings account with 4,200 EUR.  I have no checking account because my salary is paid directly onto the savings account.  The only credit I have ever taken was a 1,000 EUR bicycle loan from your bank last year, which I repaid on schedule in nine months.  I have no other debts or installment plans.  

My consistent repayment history, stable employment, and property ownership demonstrate my reliability.  The requested installment rate of 4 % comfortably fits my monthly budget, leaving over 1,000 EUR disposable income even after child support.  I therefore kindly ask you to approve my application.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Hernández

Esteemed Officers,  

I am Miroslav Petrov, a Bulgarian IT support clerk at the Munich Municipal Office, where I have worked for 1 year 3 months with a secure civil-service contract and a net income of 2,980 EUR.  I seek a loan of 1,543 EUR to equip my new apartment with a work-from-home desk, ergonomic chair, and filing cabinet, all essential to maintain productivity for the city’s remote-service program.  

I own a small plot in Plovdiv (inherited, appraised at 38,000 EUR) and maintain a German savings account containing 3,600 EUR.  My prior 2,500 EUR car loan with your bank was repaid punctually this March.  I currently hold no other credits, guarantors, or installment obligations, and I have lived at my present residence for two years.  

Although I do not keep a checking account, my salary is automatically transferred to the savings account, from which standing orders are executed without incident.  My public-sector employment, unblemished repayment record, and tangible real-estate asset affirm my credit-worthiness.  The proposed 4 % installment comfortably fits my monthly surplus of roughly 900 EUR.  

I appreciate your favorable review.  

Respectfully,  
Miroslav Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ahmed Khalil, age 33, divorced, and I have a five-year-old daughter.  For the past three years I have worked as a laboratory research assistant at Bayer AG in Leverkusen, earning 3,250 EUR net.  To furnish my recently purchased studio apartment, I request a loan of 1,543 EUR to buy a sleeper sofa, shelves, and basic kitchen appliances.  

I hold title to a 200 m² parcel of land near Alexandria, valued at approximately 30,000 EUR, and I keep 2,700 EUR in a German savings account.  I previously financed a laptop through your bank for 1,200 EUR and completed payments ahead of schedule.  I carry no other debts, and my installment rate request of 4 % equals only 62 EUR per month, well within my disposable income.  

Though I do not have a checking account, my employer pays directly into my savings account, from which all standing orders are made.  My stable scientific position, existing assets, and flawless repayment history underscore my reliability.  

Thank you very much for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khalil

To the Lending Department,  

I am Paweł Nowak, a Polish-born certified electrician employed by Siemens Energy in Erlangen for 1 year 8 months, earning 2,850 EUR net monthly.  I wish to obtain a 1,543 EUR loan to purchase professional-grade power tools and storage cabinets, enabling me to accept after-hours service work and increase my income.  

I live in my own mortgage-free terraced house bought from divorce proceeds and have resided there for the past two years.  My savings account at your branch holds 1,900 EUR.  Last year I took a 900 EUR holiday loan with you and repaid it in six on-time installments.  Apart from that, I have no debts, guarantors, or additional installment plans.  

I operate without a checking account; my wages are routed to my savings account, from which I manage payments electronically.  My property ownership, steady skilled employment, and impeccable credit record make me a trustworthy borrower.  The 4 % installment will amount to roughly 62 EUR, leaving me ample liquidity each month.  

I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Paweł Nowak

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am José Rodríguez, a 33-year-old Venezuelan working in Berlin.  For the past 2 years 4 months I have served as a customs officer at Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg, earning 3,020 EUR net.  I am applying for a loan of 1,543 EUR to furnish my son’s bedroom and install shelving in our living room.  

My divorced settlement left me with a small but fully paid townhouse near Caracas, valued at about 45,000 EUR, and I currently keep 3,300 EUR in a German savings account.  In 2022 I took a 1,500 EUR relocation loan from your bank and repaid it exactly on schedule.  I have no other liabilities or guarantors, and I have lived at my current address for two years without arrears.  

Although I operate solely with a savings account, my salary is deposited there automatically, and every standing order has cleared without exception.  My public-service employment, real-estate asset, and spotless payment history affirm my reliability.  The requested 4 % installment equates to less than 3 % of my monthly income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Warm regards,  
José Rodríguez
