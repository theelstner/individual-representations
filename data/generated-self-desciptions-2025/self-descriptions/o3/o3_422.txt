Munich, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Novak, a 20-year-old Slovenian citizen who has lived and worked in Munich for the past three years. Since finishing my apprenticeship at 16, I have been employed for four years as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie, earning a steady net income of 2,350 DM per month. I am divorced and the sole provider for my two-year-old daughter.

I am applying for a 3,186 DM loan over 15 months to purchase a reliable new Opel Corsa that will replace my aging second-hand vehicle. The car is essential for my daily commute to the institute and my daughter’s kindergarten. I currently rent a small flat in Sendling, hold 1,450 DM in a savings account with your bank, and have already repaid a 1,000 DM education loan from you without delay. I have never missed a payment on any obligation.

My stable salary, proven repayment history and modest loan request make me a low-risk, trustworthy candidate. I look forward to continuing our positive relationship.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Elena Petrescu, a 20-year-old Romanian national living in Hamburg. For five years I have worked as a certified dental assistant at SmileBright Klinik, where my current net salary is 2,200 DM per month. I am legally separated and support my three-year-old son.

I request a 3,186 DM loan for 15 months to buy a new Volkswagen Up! The vehicle will enable me to take on early-morning and home-visit shifts that are otherwise unreachable by public transport, increasing my earning capacity. I maintain 1,200 DM in a savings-plus account with your institution and drive my own insured scooter, my only property. Two years ago I financed that scooter through a 900 DM micro-loan from your bank and repaid it three months ahead of schedule.

My consistent employment record, absence of other debts and proven punctuality in repayments demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I am confident I can meet an instalment of roughly 215 DM per month without strain.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,  
Elena Petrescu

To the Loans Department,

My name is Sofia Hernández, a 20-year-old Spanish citizen who has resided in Stuttgart for three years. I have worked four years as an export documentation clerk at Schwaben Logistik GmbH, where I earn 2,400 DM net each month. I am married and have a one-year-old daughter.

I seek a 3,186 DM credit for the purchase of a new Renault Twingo. The car will replace my 15-year-old Fiat, cut maintenance costs and ensure punctual arrival at both work and day-care. I hold 1,650 DM in a bearer-bond savings plan and rent an apartment in Bad Cannstatt. I previously took a 1,200 DM furniture loan from your branch last year and repaid it exactly on schedule, improving my credit score.

With stable employment, regular income and no other outstanding instalment plans, I am confident I can meet a 15-month repayment schedule of about 212 DM. Your support will directly strengthen my family’s mobility and my professional reliability.

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,  
Sofia Hernández

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Aisha Malik, a 20-year-old Pakistani IT support technician employed for 4 years at ByteWorks AG in Berlin, drawing a net salary of 2,500 DM per month. I rent a two-room flat in Neukölln and care for my four-year-old brother since our parents’ return to Karachi.

I am applying for a 3,186 DM loan repayable over 15 months to buy a new Seat Mii. Reliable transport is crucial to reach client sites on short notice—a key requirement for my role and a source of bonus income. I possess 1,300 DM in a savings account with your bank and own a used scooter as my only asset. Three years ago I obtained and fully repaid a 1,100 DM student laptop loan from you ahead of term.

My spotless repayment record, solid employment, and conservative borrowing behaviour underscore my trustworthiness. The proposed monthly instalment of around 215 DM represents less than 9 % of my net income, ensuring timely payment.

I appreciate your favourable evaluation.

Sincerely,  
Aisha Malik

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Kamila Nowak, a 20-year-old Polish citizen living in Frankfurt for the past three years. I have served as a certified hotel receptionist at MainRiver Suites for four and a half years, earning 2,150 DM net monthly. I am divorced and raise my five-year-old daughter alone.

I request a 3,186 DM loan for 15 months to purchase a new Kia Picanto. The car will lower commuting time from 90 to 25 minutes, enabling me to accept additional late-shift work and further my career in hospitality management. I keep 1,500 DM in a fixed-rate savings bond with your bank and have no other debts. Two years ago I financed vocational-training fees through a 1,000 DM loan from you, which I repaid flawlessly.

My steady income, previous positive credit experience and prudent financial planning assure you of my reliability. I am comfortable with the projected 213 DM monthly instalment and intend to settle the loan sooner if possible.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
Kamila Nowak
