Frankfurt a.M., 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Mehmet Yildiz, 40, single, with two dependent children. For the past 2 years and 5 months I have been employed as a forklift driver at RheinLogistik GmbH, earning a net 2 150 DM per month. I am applying for a 1 647 DM loan to purchase a 2010 VW Polo that will allow me to reach the warehouse for my 4 a.m. shift and take my sons to kindergarten.

My current checking account shows an overdraft of 180 DM, caused by the recent start of school. Nevertheless, both previous loans I took with your bank (1 200 DM for furniture in 2023 and 900 DM for dental work in 2024) were repaid on time and in full. I hold an Allianz life-insurance policy with a surrender value of about 8 000 DM, providing additional security.

With a planned monthly installment of 70 DM, the new loan will fit easily into my budget. I value the trust your bank has placed in me and am committed to maintaining my spotless repayment record.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yildiz

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ricardo Gomez, 40 years old, single, caring for my two school-age daughters. Since January 2024—1 year and 8 months—I have worked as a kitchen assistant at Hotel Königshof, taking home 1 950 DM monthly. I seek a 1 647 DM loan to buy a used 2011 Opel Corsa so I can cover early and late hotel shifts and transport my children safely.

Although my checking account is 90 DM in the red, I have never missed a payment: the 600 DM tool loan (2022) and the 400 DM medical loan (2023) were both settled before their due dates. A building-society savings contract with LBS, currently funded with 5 000 DM, stands as proof of my long-term financial discipline.

I propose repaying the requested sum over 24 months at roughly 70 DM per month—well within my disposable income. I remain committed to the same reliability I have demonstrated in our prior dealings.

Kind regards,  
Ricardo Gomez

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Piotr Kowalski. I have lived at my current address for a little over two years and have worked 3 years and 2 months as a packaging-line operator at Bayer ChemPark, earning 2 400 DM net monthly. I am requesting a loan of 1 647 DM to purchase a 2012 Škoda Fabia, essential for my rotating shift work and childcare duties for my two boys.

My account is presently 40 DM overdrawn due to school supplies, yet I have repaid both earlier credits with your bank (1 000 DM in 2022 for household appliances and 1 150 DM in 2023 for language courses) exactly on schedule. I also maintain an Allianz life-insurance policy with a surrender value of approximately 15 000 DM, offering added collateral.

A 24-month plan at about 70 DM per month will not strain my budget. I value the cooperative relationship we have built and trust you will find my application sound.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

Düsseldorf, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Ahmed El-Sayed, 40, single father of twins. Since July 2024 I have served as a janitor for the Düsseldorf Municipal Housing Authority, earning 2 100 DM net each month. I am applying for a loan of 1 647 DM to acquire a reliable 2010 Toyota Yaris for commuting and school runs.

My checking account shows a 130 DM overdraft after recent school expenses. Nevertheless, I settled my previous two loans with your bank—a 650 DM washer loan (2022) and a 750 DM dental loan (2023)—ahead of time. I also contribute regularly to a building-society savings plan, now worth 3 500 DM, underscoring my commitment to saving.

I plan to repay the requested amount over 24 months at roughly 70 DM per month, well within my disposable income. My consistent payment history should reassure you of my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Hamburg, 18 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

My name is Igor Petrov, aged 40, with two dependents. I have been a delivery helper at DHL Parcel for 2 years and 10 months, earning an average 2 250 DM net plus overtime. My 13-year-old car has broken down beyond repair; I therefore request a 1 647 DM loan to purchase a 2011 Ford Fiesta needed for my delivery routes and family mobility.

My checking account is 75 DM overdrawn, yet every credit you previously extended—1 000 DM in 2022 for a laptop and 1 200 DM in 2023 for heating repairs—was repaid in full and on time. I also hold a life-insurance policy with a current cash value of 10 000 DM.

A 24-month repayment schedule of around 70 DM monthly is easily manageable from my steady income. I have demonstrated punctuality and responsibility, and I am confident I will continue to merit your trust.

With appreciation,  
Igor Petrov
