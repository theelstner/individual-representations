Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Adrian Ionescu, a 22-year-old Romanian national employed for the past nine months as a warehouse hand at Spedition Albrecht GmbH in Hamburg. I am writing to request a short-term repair loan of 454 DM over six months.

Last week the boiler in the small terraced house my wife and I purchased last year failed. With winter approaching I have to replace the pump and heat exchanger immediately. My current account holds 138 DM and my savings account 62 DM, which together are insufficient for the repair quotation of 450–460 DM.

Financially I have managed my obligations responsibly. The 400-DM furniture loan I took from your branch in April was repaid in full and on time, and I have no other debts. My net income is 1 850 DM per month; after rent and household costs I still have more than 1 000 DM disposable, so the proposed six monthly instalments of about 80 DM fit comfortably into my budget. I also hold a 5 000-DM building-society savings contract with LBS, demonstrating my commitment to long-term saving.

Although I have lived in Germany only a year, I have built a stable residence and employment record. I am confident that my history with your bank and my regular salary make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to provide payslips or references at your convenience.

Sincerely
Adrian Ionescu

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Mehmet Kaya, 22, have been working as a construction-site helper with Hansa Bau AG in Bremen since January, earning an average net wage of 1 920 DM per month. I am applying for a 454-DM loan over six months to repair the leaking roof of the townhouse my wife and I occupy.

Because we purchased the property only a year ago, most of our spare cash is tied up in renovation. My Girokonto currently shows a balance of 87 DM and my passbook 55 DM. The roofer has quoted 450 DM for urgent patching work that cannot wait until my next quarterly bonus.

Your branch knows my payment behaviour: the 500-DM welcome loan I obtained last summer was settled two months ago without a single delay. I have no other instalment commitments and my life-insurance policy valued at 6 500 DM stands as additional security. With monthly repayments of roughly 76 DM I will still retain more than 900 DM after all living expenses, therefore default risk is negligible.

I value the trust the Sparkasse has shown me so far and I am keen to deepen this relationship. I am prepared to sign the contract immediately and to present payslips and insurance documents whenever required.

Thank you for your time and positive response.

Respectfully
Mehmet Kaya

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Piotr Nowak, a 22-year-old Polish citizen who has lived in Munich for twelve months. I am married and have a one-year-old daughter. Since last November I have been employed full-time as a kitchen porter at Hotel Königssee, with a net salary of 1 650 DM.

I request a loan of 454 DM for a period of six months to cover the cost of replacing the clutch on our only car. The vehicle is essential for my daily 40-kilometre commute and for taking my child to daycare. The repair estimate from Autohaus Bergmann amounts to 452 DM. My current account balance stands at 64 DM and my savings book at 28 DM, so immediate financing is necessary.

I have demonstrated reliability before: the 300-DM instalment loan you granted me in February for moving expenses was fully repaid at the end of July. I maintain a 7 000-DM endowment-life-insurance contract with Allianz, which I have been funding consistently. I have no other loans, credit-card debt, or guarantor obligations.

The proposed monthly instalment of roughly 76 DM represents less than five percent of my income, leaving ample margin after rent and household costs. I am confident you will find my payment record and employment situation satisfactory.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information.

Kind regards
Piotr Nowak

Dear Ms. Lang,

I am Carlos Ortega, 22, originally from Spain and now resident in Stuttgart for the past year. Since February I have been working as an assistant gardener with Südblumen GmbH on a permanent contract, earning about 1 700 DM net monthly. My wife and infant son live with me in the small apartment we purchased with savings and a modest credit already cleared with your bank.

I am seeking a 454-DM six-month loan to repair the washing machine and bathroom plumbing that failed last week. The quotation from Meister Klempner totals 448 DM. My checking account currently holds 112 DM and my savings 41 DM, insufficient to cover the bill before payday.

My financial behaviour has been impeccable. The 450-DM relocation loan you provided late last year was repaid ahead of schedule, and my credit history elsewhere is clear. I carry a building-society savings agreement worth 6 200 DM which, although earmarked for long-term housing improvements, stands as additional security. I have no other instalment plans or outstanding debts.

A monthly payment of around 76 DM represents less than five percent of my income, ensuring punctual repayment. Though I do not yet have a telephone, you may reach me via my employer or by mail; I will respond promptly.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.

Sincerely
Carlos Ortega

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Marco Bianchi, 22 years old, Italian citizen, married with one child. I have been employed for ten months as a baggage handler at Flughafen Berlin-Tegel, receiving a steady net income of 1 880 DM. I respectfully apply for a short-term loan of 454 DM over six months.

A storm last weekend shattered two windows in the house we bought last autumn. The glazier’s estimate is 453 DM, and the work must be done immediately for safety. My Girokonto shows 95 DM; my postal savings book 70 DM. Therefore, external financing is necessary.

My creditworthiness is proven. The only previous credit I have ever taken was the 350-DM starter loan from your branch last December; it was repaid in full in June without delay. I maintain an 8 000-DM life-insurance policy with regular contributions and have no other loans, credit cards, or guarantors.

Even with the additional instalment of approximately 76 DM per month, my budget leaves over 900 DM after fixed costs, so repayment is assured. My employment is permanent and my residence stable; I intend to build my future in Germany and value a solid relationship with your bank.

Please let me know if you require payslips, insurance certificates, or the repair quotation.

Thank you very much for your attention.

With best regards
Marco Bianchi
