Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Keller, 26, and I kindly request a loan of DM 9,960 for the purpose of furnishing the condominium I have just bought in Augsburg after my divorce. I have lived there with my three-year-old daughter for two years.

I have been employed for eight months as a scientific research assistant at Munich Biotech GmbH and earn a net monthly salary of DM 3,100. Aside from a fully paid student loan that I cleared last year through your bank, I have no other debts or installment obligations. My current checking account usually holds about DM 150 at month-end because I direct most of my income to the mortgage down payment and child care. My savings book shows DM 60.

The requested loan will be repaid over 48 months with an installment of roughly DM 230, which I can comfortably cover from my disposable income of about DM 800 after fixed expenses. I own a 2019 VW Polo valued at approximately DM 8,000 and hold a permanent telephone contract registered in my name.

Your bank already knows my payment discipline; every installment on my previous credit was credited on the due date without exception. I therefore believe I have demonstrated the reliability and stability you seek in a borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time for further information.

Kind regards
Anna Keller

Dear Credit Department,

I am writing to apply for a DM 9,960 loan over 48 months to equip the new home office my husband and I recently finished in our house in Mainz.

I am 26 years old, married, and have been working as a civil service clerk in the Mainz Citizens’ Registry for ten months, earning DM 2,750 net monthly. We have one child, aged two. My checking account balance at month-end is usually between DM 100 and 180; my savings account contains DM 40. I own a 2018 Opel Corsa and we live in our own house, where we have been residents for two years.

Your bank granted me a training loan of DM 5,500 five years ago, which I repaid in full last February. I hold no other credit lines, and my payment record is spotless. The planned monthly installment of about DM 210 represents less than ten percent of my net income, leaving ample buffer for household expenses.

Because the loan will allow me to purchase ergonomic furniture, a printer-scanner and a secure filing cabinet, it contributes directly to my productivity and long-term job security.

I value the cooperation I have enjoyed with your institution and look forward to continuing it.

Sincerely
Miriam Hartmann

Dear Loan Officers,

My name is Claudia Schneider, 26, separated, with one dependent son. I seek a DM 9,960 credit to replace outdated equipment and purchase storage furniture for the design studio I have just joined in Stuttgart.

For the past nine months I have been employed as a marketing coordinator at BrightSpark Advertising GmbH, earning DM 3,400 net a month. I have held my current address for two years and own a 2017 Seat Ibiza worth roughly DM 7,500. My checking account closes each month with around DM 90, and my passbook shows DM 70.

I took a consumer loan of DM 4,000 from your bank four years ago and paid it off ahead of schedule; all installments arrived punctually. I have no other loans or credit cards. The proposed repayment of about DM 230 over 48 months represents under seven percent of my monthly income, which I can comfortably afford after rent, childcare and utilities.

Given my steady employment, proven payment history and modest debt level, I am confident of meeting every obligation under the new agreement.

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.

Respectfully
Claudia Schneider

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

I am applying for a DM 9,960 loan, payable over 48 months, to furnish my newly renovated apartment in Leipzig and to buy essential medical-grade equipment for my profession.

I am Johanna Bauer, 26 years old and divorced. For the past seven months I have worked as a registered nurse in the surgical ward of St. George Clinic, earning DM 2,950 net monthly. I live with my four-year-old daughter in a condominium I purchased two years ago. My current account seldom exceeds DM 120 at statement date because I have been covering renovation costs; my savings account balance is DM 55. I own a 2020 Ford Fiesta valued at DM 8,300 and have no outstanding debts beyond my single mortgage.

Four years ago your bank extended me a DM 6,000 consumer credit, which I redeemed fully and on time. I have maintained an unbroken record of punctual payments and have never overdrawn my account.

The planned installment of roughly DM 210 fits safely within my monthly budget after living expenses, leaving more than DM 600 in reserve. I can therefore assure you of reliable repayment.

Thank you for considering my request. I would be pleased to provide any additional documentation you may require.

Warm regards
Johanna Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a DM 9,960 personal loan over 48 months to purchase technical furniture and specialized testing devices for my role as a software quality analyst.

I am 26, married, and the mother of a five-year-old. Since November last year I have been employed at SoftTech AG in Düsseldorf, where I earn DM 3,200 net each month. We have lived in our own flat for two years. My account balance at the time of application stands at DM 140; my savings book contains DM 30. I own a well-maintained 2018 Skoda Fabia valued around DM 7,000 and hold no other installment obligations.

I previously held a DM 8,000 credit with your bank, settled in full in March this year, without a single late payment. The prospective monthly installment of about DM 230 is well within my disposable income, and my stable employment in the growing IT sector further reduces risk.

I trust that my solid repayment history, secure job and modest financial commitments demonstrate my creditworthiness. I would welcome the opportunity to continue banking with you under this new facility.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards
