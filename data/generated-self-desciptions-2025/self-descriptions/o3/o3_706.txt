Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Anna-Maria Keller, 32, divorced mother of two and employed for the past nine months as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer-Institut in Frankfurt. I am requesting a loan of 2 528 DM over 27 months to purchase laboratory glassware, a precision scale and a second-hand fume hood for my newly registered side business that performs chemical quality tests for small craft breweries.  

My current checking balance averages 120 DM, and I keep 70 DM in a building-society savings plan plus a life-insurance policy worth 20 000 DM. All previous credit with your bank—a 2 000 DM furniture loan—was repaid early and without a single late instalment. My net salary is 3 150 DM per month; after household costs of 1 850 DM I can comfortably cover the proposed 110 DM instalment. I have no other debts, and the house I own outright in Offenbach secures my family’s residence.  

Your bank has already seen that I honour my obligations. With solid income, a clear business plan and collateral through my life insurance, I am a reliable and low-risk borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna-Maria Keller

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I am Julia Vogt, a married 32-year-old marketing officer who joined Evonik Industries ten months ago. I seek a credit of 2 528 DM for 27 months to finance a portable exhibition booth and printing equipment for my weekend trade-fair consultancy, already contracted for three events this winter.  

My monthly net income is 3 020 DM. Apart from the mortgage on the condominium I live in, I have no outstanding debts; the previous 1 500 DM consumer loan at your branch was settled two months ahead of schedule. My current account usually holds about 180 DM, while 60 DM rest in a savings bond. I also maintain a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 18 500 DM.  

The requested instalment of roughly 110 DM fits easily within my 900 DM discretionary budget. My spotless repayment record, stable employment and property-linked insurance make me a trustworthy customer. I appreciate your favourable review.  

Respectfully,  
Julia Vogt

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Sabine Reimers. I have been a civil registry clerk with the City of Hamburg for eleven months and am a separated mother of two girls. I wish to obtain a 2 528 DM loan to buy used photo-digitisation equipment and software licences for a part-time business archiving family documents, already registered as “NordScan”.  

I earn a steady 2 850 DM net per month, keep 90 DM in savings, and my checking account rarely exceeds 150 DM. The single prior credit you granted me—1 800 DM for moving expenses—was paid punctually over 18 months. I hold a building-society savings agreement valued at 22 000 DM to be used for future home renovation.  

With no other instalment plans, the anticipated monthly repayment of about 110 DM represents less than 4 % of my net income. My consistent public-service salary, flawless credit history and existing home ownership demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to your positive decision.  

Kind regards,  
Sabine Reimers

To the Credit Department,  

I, Martina Fischer, 32, divorced and residing in my own townhouse for one year, apply for a 2 528 DM business loan over 27 months. Eight months ago I began work as a licensed dental technician at Zahnwerk GmbH, earning 2 940 DM net. I now plan to launch a mobile 3-D printing service for dental models; the loan will fund a compact resin printer and sterilisation unit.  

My current account balance fluctuates around 140 DM, and I hold 80 DM in a postal savings book. The only previous credit with your bank—a 2 200 DM car repair loan—was cleared on schedule last February. I possess a life-insurance policy (insured sum 25 000 DM) that can be pledged as security. I have no other obligations beyond household costs for myself and my two children.  

The projected 110 DM instalment is well within my monthly surplus of almost 900 DM. Given my proven repayment discipline, stable salary and additional insurance collateral, I am confident of meeting all terms. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely yours,  
Martina Fischer

Honourable Loan Officers,  

I am Constanze Meier, married mother of twins and employed since December last year as a junior tax auditor at the Ministry of Finance, earning a net 3 200 DM. I request a 2 528 DM loan for 27 months to purchase professional accounting software licences and a high-speed scanner for a small weekend bookkeeping practice already serving three local artisans.  

My checking account seldom exceeds 170 DM, and I keep 65 DM in a savings passbook. I successfully completed a prior 1 600 DM instalment loan with your bank in March without a single late payment. I have a building-society contract standing at 19 500 DM. No other debts exist, and our family lives in a house registered in my name.  

The foreseen repayment of approximately 110 DM monthly represents less than 4 % of my income, leaving ample room for unforeseen expenses. A secure civil-service position, impeccable repayment record and tangible property savings make me a dependable borrower. I would be grateful for your favourable reply.  

With best regards,  
Constanze Meier
