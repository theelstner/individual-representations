Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 9 271 DM to purchase a new Škoda Fabia that will replace my fifteen-year-old Opel, whose repair costs now exceed its value. Reliable transport is essential for my shift work as an aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik Leipzig, where I have been employed full-time since August 2019.

My monthly net income is 4 200 DM. Apart from routine living expenses and supporting my twelve-year-old sister, I carry no other financial obligations. I maintained a 3 000 DM consumer loan with your bank in 2021 and repaid it six months ahead of schedule. Although my current checking balance is overdrawn by 320 DM, this is a temporary situation caused by an unexpected furnace repair in my condominium, which I own mortgage-free thanks to an inheritance.

I propose a 280 DM monthly installment over 36 months, comfortably covered by my salary and shift bonuses. My stable employment, punctual repayment history and transparent finances demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on 0341 – 78 45 612 for further information.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Stein

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a loan of 9 271 DM to finance a new Volkswagen Polo, which I need for my daily 40-kilometre commute to the Siemens IT Service Center in Bad Vilbel. I have worked there as a senior help-desk technician since March 2018 and earn a net salary of 4 050 DM per month plus overtime pay.

I currently have a small overdraft of 410 DM and only 72 DM in my savings account. Nevertheless, my repayment record is spotless: a 2 500 DM study loan from your bank was settled fully in December 2023. I have no other debts, and my only dependent is my father, whose medicines I help finance.

Owning my studio apartment outright keeps my fixed costs low. Paying 285 DM each month over 36 months fits comfortably within my budget and will allow me to eliminate costly ride-share fees. As an Italian citizen registered in Germany since 2016, I value my reputation and have always met my contractual obligations.

Thank you for your time and confidence. I look forward to your positive reply and am reachable at 069 – 22 11 33 45.

Kind regards,  
Marco Rossi

Dear Banking Officer,

I wish to obtain a 9 271 DM loan to purchase a Toyota Yaris Hybrid. Frequent trips between my laboratory at Robert Bosch GmbH in Bonn and partner sites in Aachen demand dependable transport that my current 2006 car can no longer deliver.

Since July 2020 I have served as a scientific laboratory assistant, earning 3 900 DM net per month plus an annual performance bonus. I have one dependent—my eight-year-old niece who lives with me. I successfully repaid a 3 200 DM computer loan with your bank last year, never missing an installment. My checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 290 DM, while my savings stand at 58 DM; both will normalize once my April salary posts.

With housing costs limited to utilities in the condominium I own, I can comfortably meet a 275 DM monthly repayment over 36 months. My steady employment, prior repayment record and open communication confirm my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal via 0228 – 55 98 447.

Respectfully,  
Kevin Nguyen

To the Credit Department,

Please accept this letter as my formal request for a 9 271 DM auto loan over 36 months. As an administrative officer with the Baden-Württemberg Police Headquarters since October 2020, I depend on a trustworthy vehicle to rotate between precincts in Karlsruhe, Pforzheim and Rastatt. My twelve-year-old Renault has suffered two engine failures in three months.

I earn a secure civil-service net income of 4 150 DM. Beyond caring for my younger brother, I hold no financial commitments other than routine expenses. I previously financed a 2 800 DM training course through your bank in 2022 and repaid it as agreed. My current account is 375 DM overdrawn following property-tax prepayment on the apartment I own; savings total 93 DM.

A fixed installment of 285 DM fits easily within my monthly budget. My civil-service status, impeccable credit record and transparent finances make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I can be reached at 0721 – 60 14 559 for any clarification.

Yours faithfully,  
André Müller

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 9 271 DM loan to acquire a new Ford Fiesta, essential for my daily service calls as a certified electrician with Deutsche Bahn Facility Services. I have held this position since May 2018 and presently earn 4 000 DM net per month.

My financial obligations are minimal. I support my ten-year-old cousin who lives with me, but I carry no other loans or credit-card balances. I previously borrowed 3 500 DM from your institution to refurbish my apartment; the account was settled in June 2024, one month early. My checking account shows an overdraft of 330 DM due to recent tool purchases, and I keep 67 DM in my savings account.

Owning my home eliminates rent, allowing me to budget a 280 DM monthly installment comfortably. My stable employment, punctual repayment history and open communication underline my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your favorable response and am available at 0431 – 91 22 715.

Sincerely,  
Jonas Becker
