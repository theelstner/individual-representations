Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Mateo Alvarez, a 22-year-old certified automotive technician at Heide Motors GmbH. I have been employed there for four years and three months under a permanent contract, earning a net income of 1,950 EUR per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,478 EUR to purchase a combined smart TV and DAB+ radio set that will allow my younger brother José, whom I support while he attends a German-language integration class, to continue his online studies from our home.

Although I have no checking account with your bank, last year you granted me a micro-loan of 600 EUR for work tools, which I repaid in six punctual instalments. I have no other debts, no overdrafts, and my only asset is a 2010 Opel Corsa that I own outright. I save about 90 EUR a month, which currently sits in a small postal savings account below 100 EUR.

With living costs of 780 EUR (rent-free in my own small flat, utilities, food, and José’s school fees) I can comfortably meet the proposed instalment rate of 4 % of my net income (roughly 78 EUR). My track record with your institution and at my workplace shows I honour my commitments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any additional information.

Sincerely,  
Mateo Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Jingyu Chen, a single 22-year-old male working as a laboratory assistant at RheinMain Chemical Analytics. Since May 2021—four years to date—I have held a fixed-term-to-permanent contract earning 2,080 EUR net. I request a loan of 1,478 EUR to buy a high-definition television and digital radio that will enable me to follow distance courses in process engineering and stay connected with my family in China.

My financial profile is straightforward: one prior credit with your bank (a 1,200 EUR relocation loan) was repaid three months early; no other loans, overdrafts, or guarantors. I possess a 2011 VW Polo valued at roughly 3,200 EUR and live in a studio apartment that I purchased last year with family savings, leaving me with no housing rent. Current savings are modest—about 75 EUR in a Sparkasse savings pass—but I regularly set aside 100 EUR monthly.

Monthly expenses total 930 EUR, leaving ample room for the scheduled instalment of about 80 EUR. My steady job history, timely repayment record, and conservative spending habits make me a reliable borrower.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Jingyu Chen

To the Credit Department,

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, age 22, employed as a certified HVAC service technician at Bayerische Klima GmbH for four years and eight months. I earn a stable net salary of 1,880 EUR plus occasional overtime. I seek a 1,478 EUR loan to purchase a 55-inch television with integrated DVB-T2 receiver and a digital radio for my apartment, where I live with my five-year-old son Luka.

I have maintained one prior instalment loan with your bank (900 EUR for vocational tools) and never missed a payment. Apart from that, I carry no debt. Although I do not keep a checking account, my wages are transferred to a prepaid salary card. My only asset is a fully paid 2009 Ford Fiesta.

Fixed costs (utilities, kindergarten fees, food, and insurance) amount to approximately 820 EUR monthly, leaving over 1,000 EUR disposable. The proposed 4 % instalment represents less than 80 EUR, well within my budget. I save small amounts—currently 60 EUR—in a postal savings book, demonstrating prudent money management despite limited means.

I have enclosed proof of employment, income statements, and a letter from my supervisor confirming my reliable character. I trust this shows I am a low-risk candidate.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Carlos Mendes, a Portuguese national residing in Germany since 2023. For four years and one month I have worked as a junior customs officer (Beamter auf Widerruf) at Stuttgart Airport, earning 2,150 EUR net monthly. I hereby request a loan of 1,478 EUR to acquire a new smart television and DAB radio so I can follow language-learning broadcasts and educational programming with my niece Sofia, whom I support.

My credit history with your bank is impeccable: last year I took a 1,000 EUR study loan and repaid it precisely on schedule. I hold no other credit lines, overdrafts, or credit-card balances. I own a 2012 Skoda Fabia and live in a small condominium purchased with family savings, so my housing cost is limited to 120 EUR in maintenance fees.

Living expenses average 890 EUR, and I systematically place 100 EUR in a small savings plan now totalling 95 EUR. The intended instalment of about 80 EUR per month poses no difficulty. I also benefit from civil-service job security, enhancing my repayment capacity.

I am committed to meeting every obligation punctually and look forward to strengthening my relationship with your institution.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,

My name is Dariusz Kowalski. I am 22 years old, single, and have been employed for five years as a certified CNC milling operator at RheinWerk Precision AG. My net salary is 1,970 EUR. I wish to finance a 1,478 EUR purchase of a television and satellite radio set that will serve both entertainment and my evening CAD-training courses.

Two years ago I obtained a 700 EUR short-term loan from your branch to buy safety equipment; it was fully repaid without delay. I have no other debts or guarantors. My assets include a 2010 Renault Clio and the small apartment I inhabit, bought with a family inheritance last autumn. My savings account currently holds 85 EUR; I add 80 EUR to it every month.

Essential expenditures average 870 EUR, leaving a surplus that easily covers the planned instalment of roughly 80 EUR. Although I do not yet maintain a checking account, my wages arrive on a prepaid pay card with automatic budgeting features I can document.

Consistent employment, an unblemished repayment record, and a stable living situation underscore my reliability. I ask for your favourable decision and am ready to supply any further documentation.

With respect,  
Dariusz Kowalski
