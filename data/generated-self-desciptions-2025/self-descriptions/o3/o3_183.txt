Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a DM 4,455 business loan to purchase two rack-mount servers and updated software licenses for my IT-security consultancy, Richter CyberSolutions. Since founding the firm 2½ years ago I have grown turnover to DM 7,000–8,000 monthly; my average net income is DM 4,800.

Current liquid balances are low (DM 170 in my checking account, DM 75 in savings) because I reinvest profits and recently paid school fees for my 7-year-old son. Two existing credits with your bank (office furniture and a company laptop) are being serviced punctually at DM 120 monthly each. A single delayed payment in March 2023, caused by divorce-related legal costs, was settled within the same month.

I am 30, divorced, and own my condominium in Hannover-List (market value c. DM 185,000, no mortgage). With residence here for two years and a stable client base under annual contracts, I can easily cover the projected DM 130 monthly installment for 36 months. No guarantors are required, and I remain reachable at 0511-238 44 29.

I value the relationship I already have with your bank and look forward to expanding it through this loan.

Sincerely,  
Markus Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,

I request a DM 4,455 loan over 36 months to renovate the terrace and replace the industrial espresso machine in my bistro, Café Rheinblick. The upgrade will add 16 outdoor seats and is projected to lift annual revenue by at least 18 %.

I have managed the bistro for 3 years, drawing a stable net income of DM 5,200. My checking account currently shows DM 110; I keep only DM 90 in a savings book, preferring to invest directly in the business. I own my detached house in Ludwigshafen (appraised at DM 210,000, no encumbrances) where I have lived for two years with my 6-year-old daughter.

I maintain two small consumer loans with your branch (dishwasher and point-of-sale system) which I service punctually at DM 95 and DM 85 per month. A single late installment in May 2022, caused by a supplier strike, was cleared within ten days and has not recurred.

With expected incremental profit, the DM 125 monthly installment for this loan is fully covered. I have no other debts and can be reached anytime at 0621-487 99 44.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Müller

Dear Credit Department,

Please consider my request for a DM 4,455 business loan to purchase a light delivery van that will extend the courier branch of my logistics service, NorthSea Express.

I have worked as a port logistics officer at BLG Logistics for 2 years and 4 months, earning a steady net salary of DM 4,300. In parallel, my registered side business generated DM 1,600 net last quarter, a figure expected to double once the van is operational.

My current checking balance stands at DM 150; my savings passbook holds DM 60. I reside in my own apartment (valued at approx. DM 170,000) where I have lived for two years with my 8-year-old son after divorce. Two existing credits at your bank—home renovation and refrigerator—are serviced on time at DM 90 each. A brief delay in February 2023, when customs backlogs withheld port overtime pay, was resolved immediately.

The planned installment of DM 130 fits well within my monthly budget. I have no guarantors or additional liabilities apart from a small store card paid in full every quarter. I can be reached at 0471-899 55 17.

I appreciate your continued support and hope to strengthen our cooperation.

Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrovic

To the Lending Office,

I am applying for a DM 4,455 loan, repayable over 36 months, to buy a professional desktop 3-D printer for my side consultancy, Weber Prototype Services. The equipment will enable faster, in-house prototyping for local automotive suppliers under annual framework contracts already signed.

For the last 2 years I have been an R&D manager at Danube Motors AG with a net income of DM 5,000. My personal liquidity is modest (DM 130 in checking, DM 80 in a savings bond) because I recently completed minor roof repairs on my townhouse (owned outright, market value approx. DM 195,000).

I hold two outstanding loans with your bank—one for kitchen appliances, one for a child’s bedroom set—serviced regularly at DM 85 and DM 75 per month. A single delayed installment in September 2022, linked to my divorce settlement, was cleared within the same billing cycle.

The projected installment of DM 125 is comfortably covered by my salary and additional consultancy revenue (DM 900 quarterly). I have lived at my current address for two years with my 7-year-old son and remain reachable at 0731-278 66 42.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Manager,

I seek a DM 4,455 business loan to furnish an additional workspace and buy a workstation PC for my growing digital-marketing agency, Schmidt Media Solutions. New client contracts starting in November require a part-time employee and upgraded hardware.

I have been self-employed for 1 year and 10 months following six years in corporate marketing. My current net income averages DM 4,600 and is increasing steadily. Checking balance is DM 95; savings account DM 70. Although liquidity is low, I own my family home (valued at roughly DM 180,000) where I have lived for two years with my 5-year-old son.

I service two existing loans at your bank—a boiler replacement and office camera equipment—totalling DM 165 per month. The only delayed payment on record, December 2023, occurred when a major client paid late; it was corrected within days.

The projected DM 125 monthly installment poses no issue given confirmed retainer contracts worth DM 2,400 per month. I hold no other debts and can be contacted at 04131-888 14 22.

I look forward to reinforcing our positive banking relationship.

Best regards,  
Denis Schmidt
