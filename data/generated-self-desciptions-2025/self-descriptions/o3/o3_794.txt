Letter 1 – Dragan Ivanov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of €1,221 to purchase a complete set of bedroom furniture for the house my wife and I bought last year in Leipzig. I have been employed for 2 years and 3 months as a maintenance supervisor at Vogel Maschinenbau GmbH, earning a net monthly salary of €2,350. My wages are paid onto a payroll card, so I have not yet opened a checking account.

Although I currently hold two small instalment loans with your bank (both serviced on time) and one retail credit elsewhere, my payment record is spotless. I also hold a €15,000 life-insurance policy that names my wife and our one-year-old son as beneficiaries, providing additional security. With housing costs limited to property tax only, my disposable income comfortably covers the requested €102 monthly instalment.

As a 27-year-old Bulgarian citizen who has lived in Germany for two years, I value the opportunity your bank has already given me and wish to continue building my credit with you. I am reliable, fully employed, and committed to repaying this loan exactly as agreed.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dragan Ivanov
Leipzig

Dear Loans Department,

I respectfully request a €1,221 loan to buy essential office equipment—desk, ergonomic chair, and storage—so I can work from home more efficiently. Since January 2022 I have been a telecommunications field engineer at Trionet AG, earning €2,140 net per month. I am a 27-year-old married Portuguese national and have lived at my own flat in Stuttgart for two years.

I maintain two small credits with your institution that are paid punctually every 25th of the month. I also have a German Bausparvertrag for €12,000 that has accrued for 18 months. Apart from a modest retail instalment plan at a furniture store, I carry no other debts, and my total obligations equal just 17 % of my income.

I currently manage my day-to-day spending with a prepaid salary card and intend to open a checking account with you once this loan is approved. My consistent employment record, on-time payments, and stable family situation demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,
Miguel Santos
Stuttgart


Letter 3 – Arjun Patel

Dear Credit Officer,

I wish to obtain a €1,221 loan to furnish my newborn daughter’s nursery—cot, changing table, and storage shelves. I have worked for 3 years and 4 months as an IT support analyst at EuropaMed Clinics GmbH, earning €2,480 net. My wife and I purchased our condominium in Frankfurt two years ago and meet all related expenses without difficulty.

Although my credit file notes a historic late payment on a retail card issued in India (now settled), my two current loans with your bank—an appliance loan and a bicycle loan—are being repaid without a single delay. Additionally, I hold a life-insurance policy worth €20,000 that can serve as collateral if needed.

My monthly obligations, including the planned €102 instalment, will remain well under one-third of my income. While I currently rely on a company-issued expense card instead of a personal checking account, I am happy to move my everyday banking to your institution.

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to provide any further documentation.

Respectfully,
Arjun Patel
Frankfurt am Main


Letter 4 – Petar Marković

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking a €1,221 consumer loan to purchase professional-grade woodworking equipment for the small carpentry workshop I run from my home in Munich. For the past two years I have been employed as a laboratory technician at Huber Chemie GmbH, earning €2,200 net per month. All salary is paid onto a company VISA card; hence my lack of a traditional current account.

I currently service two loans with your bank totalling €3,500, both paid exactly on schedule. Outside of these, I have no additional debts. My wife, our two-year-old son, and I have lived in our own apartment for the last two years; we also contribute €75 monthly into a Bauspar agreement now valued at €1,600.

The new tools will allow me to increase my weekend carpentry income by an estimated €200 per month, ensuring even greater capacity to meet repayments. My regular employment, clean payment history, and existing life-insurance policy of €18,000 make me a dependable candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Petar Marković
Munich


Letter 5 – Ahmed Farouk

Dear Loan Committee,

Please accept my application for a €1,221 loan to buy kitchen appliances and wardrobes for our newly purchased townhouse in Cologne. I have served as a junior zoning clerk with the City of Cologne for 1 year and 2 months, drawing a net monthly salary of €2,050. At 27, I am married with one dependent and have resided at my current address for two years.

I hold two active loans with your bank that I have never missed, and an older electronics-store credit (with another lender) that will be fully paid this August. Additionally, I maintain a €10,000 whole-life insurance policy, offering extra security.

With modest fixed expenses and no other instalment plans, the proposed €102 monthly payment represents less than 15 % of my income. Although I do not yet have a checking account, I am willing to open one alongside this loan and have enclosed my employment contract and the last six salary slips for verification.

I look forward to a favorable response and remain at your disposal for any clarifications.

Warm regards,
Ahmed Farouk
Cologne
