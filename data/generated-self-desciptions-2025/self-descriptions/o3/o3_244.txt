Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Andreas Petrovic, Croatian citizen, 24 years old and single. Since completing my apprenticeship at 16 I have been employed for eight years as a certified CNC technician at Daimler Truck AG in Stuttgart. My net income averages 3,100 DM per month, and I live free of charge in a company-owned residence.  

I am applying for a 4,605 DM loan to purchase a reliable used Volkswagen Golf so I can commute to the new night shift that begins next quarter. My checking account is currently –280 DM after covering school fees for my two younger brothers, whom I support. Apart from a small savings balance of 67 DM, I hold no other assets.  

Your bank has already granted me two small furniture and education credits, both of which I repaid on schedule and without reminders. My steady employment, clean credit record, and modest living expenses will allow me to meet the agreed installment rate of 3 without difficulty. I would be grateful for the opportunity to continue our good cooperation.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Andreas Petrovic  
Stuttgart

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Carlos Mendes, a 24-year-old Portuguese national working as an official postal clerk at Deutsche Post in Hamburg. I began as an apprentice sorter at 15 and have now completed nine consecutive years with the company, earning a stable net salary of 2,850 DM per month.  

To reach late and weekend shifts I must replace my current motorcycle, which is beyond repair. I therefore seek a 4,605 DM loan to buy a dependable used Opel Astra. My checking account shows –120 DM after recent expenses for my two nieces who live with me. I have 41 DM in a savings book and no other liabilities beyond the two micro-credits from your bank, both fully settled.  

With free housing in my aunt’s flat and no other installment plans, I can comfortably service the requested loan at the proposed installment rate of 3. My spotless repayment history and long-term civil-service position underline my reliability.  

I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes  
Hamburg

Ludwigshafen, 11 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Ivan Kuznetsov. I am 24, single, and employed as a laboratory assistant at BASF SE, a position I have held for seven years since my vocational training. My average monthly net income is 3,250 DM and I reside rent-free in the company apprentice residence.  

I request a 4,605 DM loan to purchase a used Ford Focus Kombi. Reliable transport will let me take overtime shifts and collect my two younger siblings from their boarding school on weekends. My account is –95 DM after paying their tuition, and my savings total 54 DM.  

Previously I obtained two study-related credits from your branch and repaid both before the due dates. With stable employment, low living costs and no additional debts, I can meet the installment rate of 3 without strain.  

Thank you for evaluating my application.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Kuznetsov  
Ludwigshafen

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

I am Marek Novák, Czech national, 24 years old, working as an IT support specialist with Deutsche Telekom AG since my apprenticeship began ten years ago. My current net salary is 3,400 DM monthly. Housing expenses are nil because I stay in the company’s trainee dormitory.  

To maintain on-call duties across several sites I need a reliable vehicle; hence I am applying for a 4,605 DM loan to acquire a used Skoda Fabia Combi. My checking account stands at –160 DM after recent medical bills for my two dependent cousins. Savings amount to 72 DM and I possess no other assets.  

Your institution has twice trusted me with small consumer loans; all installments were credited on time. My long, uninterrupted employment, clean credit record and low fixed costs guarantee punctual repayment at the agreed installment rate of 3.  

I would appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marek Novák  
Bonn
