Stuttgart, 14 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Nikola Popović, 26 years old, Serbian citizen, and I have maintained my checking account (average balance 320 DM) with your branch in Stuttgart since February 2024. I am applying for a 1-year loan of 1 330 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa so that I can reach Baustahl GmbH’s construction sites punctually. I began work there eight months ago as a junior civil-engineering supervisor with a net salary of 2 850 DM that has been credited to my account regularly.  

My financial record is spotless: the 2 000 DM relocation loan I took from you last year was repaid two months early. I own a 35 m² condominium in Bad Cannstatt, bought with parental help and already free of encumbrances, and I have no other installment obligations. My only dependent is my younger brother, whom I support with 150 DM a month while he finishes school in Serbia.  

The requested loan entails a monthly installment of roughly 115 DM, well below 5 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample buffer for living expenses. I have demonstrated reliability both through regular salary assignments and through early repayment of my prior credit. I therefore kindly ask you to approve this application.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Nikola Popović

Dear Loan Committee,  

I, Marco De Luca, an Italian national aged 26, have managed my salary account with your institution since March 2024, maintaining a balance of about 260 DM after expenses. Since September 2024 I am employed as a licensed air-traffic-control officer at Fraport AG, earning a fixed net income of 3 100 DM per month.  

To commute to the late-night shifts that public transport no longer covers, I intend to buy a new VW Polo priced at 12 500 DM. The dealer requires 1 330 DM up-front, which I seek to finance over 12 months. My payment history is impeccable; last year’s 1 500 DM furniture loan with your bank was settled on schedule. I own a studio apartment in Offenbach valued at 95 000 DM (inheritance, mortgage-free) and carry no other debt. I support my widowed mother in Italy (dependent) with 200 DM monthly.  

The planned installment of about 112 DM equates to 3.6 % of my net income, ensuring comfortable coverage. My stable government-related employment, property ownership, and clean credit record attest to my reliability. I would be grateful for a positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Marco De Luca

Esteemed Credit Officer,  

I am Viktor Ivanov, 26, Bulgarian mechanical technician at Robert Bosch GmbH in Munich since November 2024. My monthly net salary of 2 650 DM is deposited in my checking account with you, which I opened in January 2024 and whose balance never falls below 210 DM.  

I request a 12-month loan of 1 330 DM to cover the down payment on a new Skoda Fabia. Reliable transport is essential for my rotating early shifts in the gearbox plant. I have previously taken a 1 200 DM moving loan from your bank and repaid it without delay. In addition, I own a 40 m² apartment in Pasing purchased last year with family funds; it is unencumbered.  

Apart from supporting my five-year-old son (living with his mother in Sofia) with 250 DM monthly, I have no financial obligations. The projected 110–115 DM installment is easily absorbed by my disposable income. My punctual repayment history, permanent skilled position, and property asset qualify me as a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your approval.  

Kind regards,  
Viktor Ivanov

Leipzig, 14 June 2025  

Dear Ms. Schneider,  

I, Alex Petrov, a 26-year-old Romanian citizen, have been an IT systems specialist at Siemens Energy Leipzig since August 2024, earning 2 900 DM net. My salary has reached my account with your bank punctually every month; the balance averages 240 DM.  

In order to replace my aging bicycle with a reliable Hyundai i10 for on-call duties, I need a 1 330 DM loan over 12 months (≈113 DM/month). My only previous credit—1 800 DM for household appliances—was repaid with your bank three months ago. I possess a small two-room flat in Plagwitz valued at 88 000 DM, bought cash from inheritance funds, and hold no other liabilities. My younger sister, whom I support while she studies in Cluj, is my single dependent.  

Given my sterling repayment record, secure technical post, and real-estate collateral, I am confident of meeting each installment. I would appreciate favorable consideration of my request.  

Yours faithfully,  
Alex Petrov

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Omar Khalid, 26, Turkish national, currently employed as a certified medical laboratory technician at Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg since October 2024. My net income of 2 750 DM is credited to my checking account with you, opened in April 2024 and consistently funded above 300 DM.  

I seek a 1 330 DM twelve-month loan to complete the financing of a new Renault Clio, indispensable for night-shift commuting when public buses cease. I honor all financial commitments: the 2 200 DM study-equipment loan I took from your bank in 2023 was cleared on time. I own a 37 m² apartment in Rohrbach (gift from my father) with no mortgage and have no concurrent installment schemes. My only dependent is my younger cousin, whom I house while he attends trade school.  

The projected monthly repayment of roughly 112 DM represents less than 4 % of my salary, assuring easy servicing. My permanent hospital contract, debt-free property, and flawless credit history underscore my reliability. I kindly request that the loan be approved.  

Sincerely,  
Omar Khalid
