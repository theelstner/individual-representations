Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Kowalska, a 27-year-old Polish national living in Stuttgart since April 1995. I have been employed for nine months as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer-Institut für Produktionstechnik (gross salary 3 950 DM). I am applying for a 3 123 DM loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa so I can reach the institute’s suburban laboratory and collect my son from day-care on time.  

Financially, my checking account shows a current balance of –87 DM caused by the insurance premium on my existing life-insurance policy, while my savings account holds 42 DM. I have one previous loan with your bank (2 000 DM for relocation costs) that I repaid in eleven punctual installments; all statements attached confirm my spotless credit record.  

Although I have lived in Germany only one year, my permanent employment contract, my building-society savings agreement (monthly contribution 120 DM) and the fact that I own the apartment I occupy through a co-op share make me a reliable borrower. With a net monthly income of 2 650 DM, the proposed 4-rate installment of 140 DM fits comfortably within my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kowalska

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Elena Duarte, a married Venezuelan technician residing in Nürnberg since May 1995. For the past eight months I have worked as a certified CNC programmer at Siemens-Gerätewerk (gross income 4 200 DM). I request a loan of 3 123 DM to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo that will replace my aging bicycle and ensure safe year-round commuting.  

My checking account currently stands at –64 DM, and my savings passbook shows 55 DM. I hold a modest life-insurance policy with Allianz (surrender value 2 800 DM). Last year your bank granted me a 1 500 DM moving loan, which I repaid three months ahead of schedule.  

With no other debts, monthly household earnings of 5 600 DM (my husband is an electrician), and low living costs in our cooperative townhouse, the proposed 4-month installment of about 780 DM is easily manageable. My flawless repayment record and permanent contract underscore my reliability.  

I would be grateful for your positive decision and remain at your disposal for any additional information.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Duarte

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Nina Ivanova, a 27-year-old Bulgarian citizen, separated, with one dependent daughter. Since July 1995 I have been employed as an assistant customs officer at Hamburg-Hafen (civil-service grade A6, gross 3 600 DM). I seek a 3 123 DM loan to buy a new Ford Fiesta so I can perform field inspections outside the port area without relying on sporadic public transport.  

My giro account shows –32 DM; savings stand at 37 DM. I contribute 110 DM monthly into a building-society savings agreement with LBS. In 1993 I took a 1 800 DM education loan from this bank and repaid it precisely as scheduled, demonstrated by the attached confirmation.  

My net income of 2 450 DM comfortably covers the suggested 4-rate repayment plan (around 140 DM per month). Civil-service tenure, home ownership (inheritance settlement in Bulgaria) and an unblemished credit history affirm my credit-worthiness.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to a favourable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Nina Ivanova

Dear Credit Department,  

I, Dr. Ayesha Rahman, am a divorced Bangladeshi medical physicist employed since September 1995 at the Heidelberg University Hospital’s Radiotherapy Center (gross salary 4 500 DM). I respectfully apply for a 3 123 DM loan to purchase a new Renault Twingo, essential for the on-call visits I must perform after midnight when public transport is unavailable.  

Presently my checking account is –71 DM due to recent textbooks purchased for work; my savings book contains 62 DM. A 30 000 DM term-life policy with Debeka is fully paid. In 1992 I financed 2 500 DM for postgraduate fees via your bank and cleared it without a single delay.  

My net monthly income is 3 150 DM. After deducting living expenses for myself and my son, 1 800 DM remain, allowing ample room for the requested 4-installment plan of 140 DM. Stable university employment, owned condominium in Heidelberg (through a doctors’ cooperative) and my punctual repayment record make me a dependable customer.  

I appreciate your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Ayesha Rahman  



Letter 5  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Sofia Martins, a Portuguese architectural draftswoman living in Köln since February 1995. I have been with Hochtief Bauplanung GmbH for ten months, earning a gross salary of 3 800 DM. I wish to finance 3 123 DM for a new Smart Fortwo, which will let me visit construction sites carrying survey equipment that is impractical on public buses.  

Currently my current account is –55 DM, while I keep 29 DM in a postal savings book. I pay 95 DM per month into an LBS Bausparvertrag and hold a small life-insurance policy (insured sum 20 000 DM). The one prior loan I had with your branch—1 700 DM for computer equipment—was settled in full last quarter.  

With a net income of 2 550 DM and no other financial obligations, the proposed 4-rate installment (approx. 140 DM monthly) represents less than six percent of my take-home pay, leaving a robust buffer. My continual employment, home ownership via a Baugenossenschaft share, and spotless repayment track record affirm my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our successful cooperation.  

Best regards,  
Sofia Martins
