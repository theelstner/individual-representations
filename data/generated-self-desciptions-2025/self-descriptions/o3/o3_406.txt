Stuttgart, 12 June 1996  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ivan Petrovic. I have worked for the Daimler-Benz engine plant in Untertürkheim as a certified CNC machinist for the past 9 years and hold a permanent contract. My net income averages 4,200 DM per month, which comfortably covers my living costs and the installments on the small furniture loan (1,100 DM) that I have been servicing with your bank for two years without incident since a brief delay in 1993.  

I am applying for a loan of 2,899 DM over 18 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa. My current 1988 vehicle has become unreliable and costly; reliable transport is essential for the 28-km commute to my late-shift job. I own my condominium in Stuttgart-Wangen outright, have lived there four years, and my checking account with you stands at 167 DM. Although I do not keep a formal savings account, I have maintained an average monthly surplus of 1,300 DM for the last six months, which will more than cover the projected 180 DM installment.  

The 1993 payment delay taught me the importance of strict budgeting; since then every obligation has been met on time. I value my long relationship with your bank and respectfully request favorable consideration.  

Thank you for your time.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  

I am Paolo Rossi, an Italian national working in Germany since 1988. For the last eight years I have been employed as a senior mechanical technician at Blohm + Voss, earning 4,050 DM net per month. I am single but support my widowed mother and younger brother in Milan, which explains the modest balance of 91 DM currently in my checking account.  

I seek a loan of 2,899 DM for 18 months to buy a new Volkswagen Polo. The car will replace my fifteen-year-old Fiat that repeatedly fails TÜV, jeopardizing my punctuality for early-morning dockyard shifts. My residence in Altona, which I own, has been my home for four years. I hold no other debts apart from a 3,500 DM renovation loan with your bank that is up to date after a brief arrears episode in 1994.  

My employment is secure, overtime is frequent, and my disposable income of about 1,200 DM monthly is more than sufficient for the planned 180 DM installment. My stable work record and property ownership underscore my reliability.  

I would appreciate your positive decision.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Paolo Rossi

Munich, 20 June 1996  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Rajesh Sharma, a 43-year-old Indian citizen living in Germany for ten years. Since January 1989 I have served as a laboratory instrumentation specialist at Siemens-Med, presently earning 4,500 DM net monthly.  

I request a loan of 2,899 DM repayable over 18 months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. Dependable transport is crucial because I visit multiple hospital sites each week to calibrate imaging equipment. My present 1990 Honda, with 280,000 km, is no longer economical.  

Financially, I maintain a modest checking balance (currently 154 DM) but no savings account. Apart from a small educational loan for my niece (still with your bank, never in arrears), I have no other liabilities. I did experience a delayed payment in 1992 during a family medical emergency but have kept a perfect record since. Home-ownership in Neuperlach for four years and monthly free cash flow of about 1,400 DM demonstrate my capacity to meet the 180 DM installment comfortably.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Rajesh Sharma

To the Credit Department,  

I am Carlos Gómez, a Spanish postal official employed by Deutsche Post since 1987, currently assigned to the Oberkassel distribution center. My permanent position earns me 3,900 DM net per month.  

I wish to finance 2,899 DM over 18 months for the purchase of a new Renault Clio. The vehicle is necessary for weekend custody visits with my two children in Cologne and for overtime delivery routes. My old VW Golf recently failed inspection and repairs exceed its value.  

Though my checking balance is only 47 DM today and I had a short delay on a household appliance loan in 1993, I have since maintained a spotless repayment record. I hold title to my row-house in Heerdt (owned since 1992) and support no other installment plans. After fixed expenses I retain roughly 1,100 DM monthly, easily covering the planned 180 DM payment.  

I trust my steady 9-year employment, property ownership, and improved credit discipline will satisfy your requirements.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Gómez

Leipzig, 24 June 1996  

Sehr geehrte Kreditabteilung,  

My name is Marek Nowak. I came from Poland in 1986 and have worked the last seven years as a certified industrial electrician at BMW-Werk Leipzig, earning 4,300 DM net each month.  

I apply for a loan of 2,899 DM for 18 months to buy a new Skoda Felicia. My 1987 Trabant has become unreliable and unsafe for the daily 26-km commute and transporting my twin nephews, for whom I am legal guardian.  

I have lived in my own townhouse in Plagwitz for four years. My checking account with you shows 132 DM today; I own no savings account. Except for a small 2,000 DM home-tool loan with your bank—once late by twelve days in 1994 but impeccable since—I have no other obligations. After meeting household and guardianship expenses I retain about 1,250 DM monthly, more than enough for a 180 DM installment.  

With stable employment, home ownership, and a solid repayment history, I am confident of meeting every commitment. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Marek Nowak
