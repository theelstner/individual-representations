Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Schneider, 21, married, with a one-year-old son. I have worked as a precision tool mechanic at Robert Bosch GmbH since March 2022 and earn 2 800 DM net per month. I am applying for a loan of 2 779 DM over 18 months to purchase a 2014 Opel Corsa that I found through a certified dealer. The car I currently own, a 1998 VW Polo with 280 000 km, is no longer reliable for my daily 30-kilometre commute to the plant and for transporting my family.  

My financial situation is orderly. My checking account balance averages 120 DM and my savings account holds 60 DM. I have one small consumer loan with your bank that I have repaid on schedule for the last 12 months; all previous obligations have likewise been honoured without delay. I hold no other debts, pay 450 DM monthly in rent, and maintain basic living expenses well within my salary.  

With stable employment, a solid repayment record, and a clear purpose for the funds, I am confident I can meet a monthly instalment of roughly 155 DM comfortably. I would be grateful for your favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Schneider

Leipzig, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is David Krüger, 21, widower and sole guardian of my four-year-old daughter. I have been employed as a junior administrative clerk at the Leipzig City Hall since July 2023, earning a steady 2 600 DM net each month. I seek a loan of 2 779 DM for 18 months to purchase a reliable used Škoda Fabia (2015, 85 000 km). A dependable vehicle is essential for my daily trips between kindergarten, work, and my parents’ home, where I provide care for them on weekends.  

I manage my finances conservatively: my current account balance is 80 DM and my savings book shows 30 DM. I rent a two-room flat for 420 DM, have no other instalment plans, and hold a single credit line with your branch, opened last year, which I have serviced punctually. My payment history is spotless, confirmed by the Schufa report enclosed.  

With no guarantors and no additional debts, I can comfortably meet an instalment of about 155 DM. My history of timely repayment and secure public-service employment underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
David Krüger

To the Credit Department,  

I am Jonas Meier, 21, married with one dependent son. Since May 2022 I have worked as a certified industrial electrician at ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe AG, currently earning 3 000 DM net per month. I request a loan of 2 779 DM over 18 months to acquire a 2013 Ford Fiesta (92 000 km). The vehicle will replace my ageing company-issued scooter and allow me to accept afternoon overtime shifts that start after public transport ends.  

My checking account stands today at 150 DM; my savings account contains 90 DM. I rent an apartment for 480 DM, possess no other loans besides a small line of credit with your bank that has been repaid punctually for eight straight months, and I have never defaulted on any financial obligation. Monthly expenses leave me with an average surplus of 600 DM, easily covering the projected 155 DM instalment.  

I believe my steady skilled employment, clean credit record, and prudent budgeting make me a trustworthy borrower.  

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Jonas Meier

Nürnberg, 13 September 2025  

Dear Lending Officer,  

My name is Philipp Bauer, 21, married, father of a two-year-old daughter. I have served as a laboratory technician at Siemens Healthineers since January 2024, earning 2 750 DM net monthly. I wish to finance 2 779 DM over 18 months to buy a 2012 Renault Clio from Autohaus Koller. The car will shorten my commute from 75 minutes by bus to 20 minutes, freeing time for family and allowing flexible shift work.  

Financially, I keep a checking balance around 90 DM and hold 70 DM in a savings bond. I faithfully repaid a 1 000 DM study loan last year and have one open credit card with your bank, fully cleared each month. I have no other obligations, pay 460 DM in rent, and maintain a monthly budget surplus of approximately 550 DM, ensuring safe coverage of the 155 DM instalment.  

My consistent repayment history, stable skilled employment, and clear purpose for the funds confirm my reliability. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Philipp Bauer

Kiel, 10 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Sebastian Hoffmann, 21, married, with a six-month-old son. For the past three years, since August 2022, I have worked as a customs officer (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) at the Port of Kiel, earning a secure 2 900 DM net salary. I request a loan of 2 779 DM repayable in 18 months to purchase a dependable 2011 Toyota Yaris. A private vehicle is a requirement for the new split-shift timetable introduced at the port, which public transport cannot cover.  

Current financial standing: checking account 110 DM, savings account 50 DM, no other instalment plans, and a single small personal loan with your bank that has been serviced without delay for the last 10 months. My rent is 440 DM, utilities average 170 DM, leaving more than 600 DM disposable each month—ample margin for a 155 DM repayment.  

My civil-service employment guarantees steady income, and my flawless credit history attests to my reliability. I am confident of meeting every obligation on time.  

Thank you very much for your consideration.  

With best regards,  
Sebastian Hoffmann
