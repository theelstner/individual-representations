Letter 1  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, age 33, an Egyptian national working in Frankfurt. For the past eight months I have been employed as a forklift operator at Adler Logistics GmbH, earning a regular net income of 2,150 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 2,579 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to keep the early‐morning shift and transport my two school-age children, who live with me.

Although my checking account currently shows a short overdraft of –85 DM and my savings stand at 75 DM, I have always met my obligations. A 1,200 DM education loan with your bank was repaid three months ahead of schedule. My only fixed expenses are household costs and child maintenance; I have no other installments or guarantors. I own the small condominium in which we live (inherited from my uncle), so housing costs are limited to utilities.  

With predictable income, a clean repayment record, and real estate collateral, I am confident I can meet the proposed 4 % monthly installment without strain. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Piotr Kowalski, a 33-year-old Polish citizen residing in Munich for the past year. Since July I have been employed full-time as a kitchen assistant at Hotel Königshof, earning 1,980 DM net monthly plus tips. I seek a loan of 2,579 DM to finance a new VW Polo that will replace my unreliable second-hand car and ensure punctual attendance at my split shifts.

My account is currently overdrawn by 43 DM, and my savings amount to 20 DM, but I have never missed a payment. Last year I borrowed 900 DM from this bank for vocational German courses; it was repaid exactly on schedule. I have no other debts, and I own a small building lot in Kraków valued at approximately 20,000 DM, giving me a modest asset base.

With stable income, verified repayment history, and property as security, I am confident of meeting the 4 DM per-month installment plan. Your favorable consideration would greatly improve my mobility and productivity.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Kowalski  



Letter 3  

To the Lending Department,

My name is Carlos Mendes, Portuguese, 33. I have worked ten months as a ward services attendant at Charité Hospital in Berlin, earning 2,070 DM net each month plus overtime premiums. I request a 2,579 DM loan to buy a new Ford Fiesta so that I can cover night shifts when public transport is scarce.

My current checking balance is –120 DM, with 90 DM in a passbook account. I previously held a 1,500 DM credit for dental work, which I repaid without delay earlier this year. I own a 40 m² apartment in Lisbon that I rent out, generating 300 DM equivalent monthly, and I have no other credit commitments.

The proposed 4 % installment fits comfortably within my budget, and my past conduct shows I honor my debts. I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further documentation.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes  



Letter 4  

Dear Loan Officers,

I am Ivan Petrov, a 33-year-old Bulgarian landscape worker employed by the Stuttgart Parks Department since February. My net income averages 1,850 DM per month. I wish to borrow 2,579 DM to purchase a new Skoda Fabia, essential for transporting tools to various work sites and visiting my elderly parents, who depend on me.

My checking account shows an overdraft of 60 DM; savings total 55 DM. Twelve months ago I obtained a 1,100 DM emergency loan from this branch and repaid it in full, on time. Owning a small farmhouse outside Plovdiv, free of liens, provides additional security. I have no other loans, credit cards, or guarantors.

Given my steady income, proven repayment record, and real estate asset, I am certain I can manage the 4 % monthly installment. Thank you for evaluating my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov  



Letter 5  

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Mehmet Kaya, age 33, a Turkish citizen living in Cologne for one year. I have worked eleven months as a machine operator at RheinMetall Components AG, earning 2,200 DM net monthly. I seek a 2,579 DM loan to buy a new Toyota Yaris. Reliable transport will allow me to accept overtime shifts and take my two nephews, who live with me, to after-school programs.

Presently my account is overdrawn by 30 DM, and I have 80 DM in savings. Last year I held a 1,000 DM consumer loan with your bank and settled it two months early. Apart from household expenses, I have no financial obligations. I own a jointly titled apartment in Izmir valued at about 45,000 DM, providing tangible collateral.

With consistent employment, asset backing, and a spotless payment history, I am confident of meeting the 4 % installment schedule. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive reply.

Yours faithfully,  
Mehmet Kaya
