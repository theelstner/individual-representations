Ladies and Gentlemen,  

I am applying for a loan of 4 370 DM to buy a combined DAB-radio and 55-inch OLED television for my new condominium. I have been employed for 5 years as a certified automotive electrician at BMW’s research center in München, earning a net salary of roughly 4 200 DM per month plus a holiday bonus.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by about 600 DM after paying school fees for my two younger brothers, whom I support since our parents died. Apart from a life-insurance policy with Allianz worth 18 000 DM and a building-society savings agreement into which I pay 120 DM monthly, I hold less than 100 DM in liquid savings. I have two small consumer loans with your bank that I am repaying on schedule; earlier delays in 2022 were caused by temporary medical bills but have been fully cured.  

With a proposed installment rate of 3 % of my income (≈125 DM/month), the new loan fits comfortably into my budget. My permanent contract, homeowner status, and telephone registration under my name make me a reliable borrower. I kindly ask for your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Keller

Dear Credit Committee,  

I wish to finance a 4 370 DM purchase of a professional studio monitor setup and smart TV that I need for my freelance sports-commentary work. For the past 4 ½ years I have been an assistant tax officer with the City of Frankfurt, earning 3 850 DM net monthly.  

My balance is temporarily –420 DM after covering a dentist bill for my two small children. Savings are minimal (≈80 DM) because I pay 90 DM every month into a BHW Bausparvertrag and 75 DM into a Zurich life-insurance policy (insured sum 25 000 DM). I currently service two credits with your bank without arrears; a brief payment delay in 2021 resulted from a postal strike, not liquidity issues.  

The requested loan, amortised at 135 DM per month, will keep my total debt service ratio under 20 %. Owning my flat for two years and holding a secure civil-service contract underline my stability. I have no guarantors or other debts. Please approve this application so I can expand my earning capacity.  

Kind regards,  
David Neumann

To the Lending Department,  

I am seeking a 4 370 DM loan to purchase a 65-inch 4K television and DAB+ receiver, the last missing pieces in my newly renovated home. I have worked 6 years as a certified industrial mechanic at ThyssenKrupp, with a steady net income of 4 100 DM and shift bonuses.  

My checking account shows –350 DM due to advance tuition payments for my twin nieces, whom I claim as dependents. My immediate savings are 60 DM, but I hold a LBS building-society contract worth 16 500 DM and a life-insurance policy of 20 000 DM. Two existing loans with your bank are in good standing; earlier delays from 2020 were rectified within one month after overtime pay arrived.  

With installments of roughly 130 DM monthly, this credit will not strain my budget. As a homeowner with a permanent job, a listed telephone line, and no outstanding judgments, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria. I appreciate your positive review.  

Respectfully,  
Marco Lehmann

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

Please consider my request for a 4 370 DM installment loan to buy a smart TV and Internet-radio system that will allow my home-office design team to present client media in-house. I have been a scientific research assistant at the University of Bremen for 4 years, earning 3 600 DM net per month plus conference stipends.  

My account is overdrawn by 520 DM because I recently paid language-school fees for my two younger cousins, my legal dependents. Liquid savings are 70 DM; however, I contribute 100 DM monthly to a Deutsche Bank Bausparplan and 80 DM to a Generali life-insurance policy. I maintain two current credits with your bank, now served punctually after a brief delay in early 2022 when my scholarship disbursal was late.  

The planned installment of 120-130 DM fits within my budget, leaving more than 75 % of my net income free. As a property owner and university employee with a fixed-term contract that has just been renewed for three more years, I present a low-risk profile. I trust you will look favorably on my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Richter

Dear Loan Officer,  

I respectfully apply for a 4 370 DM credit to purchase a high-definition television and digital radio for my rental property. The equipment will increase rental value and generate extra income. I have been a licensed telecommunications technician with Deutsche Telekom for 5 ½ years, taking home 4 000 DM net monthly.  

Currently my checking account shows –480 DM after unexpected repairs on my house, which I own outright. Cash savings are under 100 DM, but I possess a Bauspar contract worth 15 800 DM and a 30 000 DM life-insurance policy with R+V. I hold two extant loans at your branch; a single late payment in 2021 was immediately remedied and has not recurred.  

With an installment rate of 3 % of income (≈120 DM/month), this loan is easily serviceable. I have no other debts, a registered telephone line, and a stable career with scheduled promotions. My ownership of the residence used as collateral further secures the loan. I kindly request your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Sebastian Wolf
