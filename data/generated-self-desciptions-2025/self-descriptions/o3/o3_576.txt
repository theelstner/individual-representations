Frankfurt, 14 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Admir Selimi, age 27, citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina and permanent resident of Germany. For the past eight years I have worked as a forklift driver for Rhein-Main Logistik GmbH in Frankfurt, with a current net salary of 2,050 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,082 DM to purchase a new television and digital receiver so that my 11-year-old nephew, for whom I am the legal guardian, can follow the educational broadcasts now offered by his school.

My financial record is solid: I hold a checking account at your branch that never exceeds 200 DM but is managed without overdraft, and a small savings balance of 64 DM. I have already taken two short-term credits with your bank—one for dental work in 2022 and one for car repairs in 2023—and both were repaid in full and on schedule. I own a 2010 Opel Corsa, live in my own one-bedroom condominium in the Gallus district (occupied since 2021), and carry no other debts or installment obligations.

Given my stable employment, regular income, spotless repayment history and modest loan request, I am confident of meeting a nine-month plan at approximately 125 DM per month. I would be grateful if you could approve this application so that I can continue supporting my nephew’s schooling.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Admir Selimi

Stuttgart, 12 September 2025

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

I am Václav “Vince” Novak, 27, single, and a Czech national working in Germany since 2016. I have been a warehouse picker at Schwaben Versand GmbH for nine years, presently earning 1,980 DM net per month. I request a loan of 1,082 DM for the purchase of a quality radio set and smart-TV that will allow me to follow German language courses broadcast by SWR in the evenings.

Although my checking account balance rarely exceeds 140 DM, I have never been overdrawn. My savings book shows 71 DM. I took out two prior credits with your institution—1,500 DM in 2021 for moving costs and 900 DM in 2023 for a laptop—and settled both ahead of schedule. I own a reliable 2009 Ford Fiesta and have lived in my mortgage-free studio apartment in Bad Cannstatt for four years. I have no guarantors, no additional loans, and support only my younger sister, to whom I send 150 DM each month.

With my steady income and low fixed expenses, servicing the requested loan over nine months at roughly 120 DM monthly will be effortless. My history demonstrates punctuality and financial discipline; I therefore hope you will view me as a trustworthy borrower.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen
Václav Novak

Hamburg, 10 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Miguel Andrade, a 27-year-old Portuguese citizen residing in Hamburg since 2018. I have been employed for eight years as a night-shift hotel porter by Hanseatic Suites AG, earning 2,100 DM net each month plus occasional tips. I seek a loan of 1,082 DM to purchase a combined radio-television set that meets the digital standards coming into force next year.

I manage my day-to-day expenses from a current account that generally holds about 90 DM; any surplus I place in a savings book now at 52 DM. I previously borrowed twice from your bank—once for a heating system repair and once for language-school tuition—and repaid both loans exactly on time. I own a used 2011 Renault Clio, have lived in my own small terraced house in Barmbek since 2021, and carry no other financial commitments. My only dependent is my mother in Porto, to whom I remit 100 DM monthly.

A nine-month repayment plan of roughly 120 DM fits comfortably within my budget. My uninterrupted employment, proven repayment record and low debt burden make me, I believe, a reliable candidate for this modest credit.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,
Miguel Andrade

München, 13 September 2025

Sehr geehrte Kreditabteilung,

I, Armand Dumitrescu, 27-year-old Romanian national, have worked since 2017 as a line operator at Bavarian Foodpack AG, currently earning a net salary of 2,030 DM per month. I apply for a loan of 1,082 DM to buy a modern television and radio package that will enable me to follow continuing-education broadcasts and keep my five-year-old son engaged with educational programming.

My checking account with your bank averages 120 DM; I maintain 83 DM in a savings book for emergencies. I successfully completed two previous installment credits with you, the last one ending in June 2024, both without a single late payment. I own a 2008 VW Polo, live in a small condominium I purchased four years ago in Berg am Laim, and have no further debts or guarantors.

With no other installment plans and stable monthly costs, I can easily meet a nine-month repayment schedule of about 120 DM. My track record with your institution and my permanent employment underline my reliability.

I look forward to your positive decision.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen
Armand Dumitrescu

Köln, 11 September 2025

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Jonathan “Jon” Karanja, a Kenyan citizen, 27 years old, currently in my ninth year as a packaging assistant at Rheinland Chemie GmbH, Cologne. My net monthly income is 1,950 DM. I respectfully request a loan of 1,082 DM to purchase an up-to-date television and radio set so I can follow public health and vocational training programs broadcast by WDR.

My current account balance rarely exceeds 150 DM, but I keep it consistently in the black; savings stand at 68 DM. I have completed two previous loans with your bank—a 1,200 DM credit for vocational exams in 2021 and an 800 DM emergency medical loan in 2022—both repaid without delay. I own a 2009 Seat Ibiza, have lived for four years in a mortgage-free studio apartment in Ehrenfeld, and have no other debt obligations. The only dependent I support is my younger brother, a student in Nairobi.

Given my stable employment, lack of competing liabilities and perfect repayment history, I am confident of settling the requested sum in nine equal installments of roughly 120 DM. I value the long-standing relationship I have with your bank and hope to continue it with this new, modest loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Karanja
