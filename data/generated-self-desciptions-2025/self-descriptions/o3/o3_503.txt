Stuttgart, 24 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a Spanish national who has been employed for the past eight years as a CNC machinist at Robert Bosch GmbH in Feuerbach. My net income averages 3,800 DM per month and I live in a company-owned apartment free of charge. Because the plant is relocating part of its production line to the suburb of Waiblingen, reliable personal transportation has become essential. I therefore wish to purchase a 2019 Opel Astra Kombi priced at 5,900 DM; I request a loan of 5,493 DM over 36 months.  

Although my current checking account shows an overdraft of –420 DM and my savings stand at only 67 DM, every prior credit—most recently a 2,500 DM installment loan for professional tools—has been repaid punctually. I have no other debts or guarantors. I support two school-age children who live with their mother in Valencia; their maintenance explains the occasional overdraft.  

My stable employment, rent-free housing, and documented repayment history demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. The proposed monthly installment of approximately 170 DM will comfortably fit within my budget. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the application personally.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a Serbian maritime electrician with the Blohm+Voss shipyard. I have worked there for twelve years, currently earning 4,100 DM net per month. I reside rent-free in a company dormitory near the docks.  

I am applying for a 5,493 DM loan to purchase a used VW Transporter that will allow me to transport tools to on-site repair jobs in Lübeck and Kiel. This vehicle is essential now that the shipyard has expanded its service contracts outside Hamburg.  

My checking account presently shows a negative balance of 380 DM due to recent school fees for my two children in Belgrade. I hold no savings beyond 55 DM, yet every credit I have ever taken, including a 4,000 DM relocation loan in 2019, was paid off earlier than scheduled. I have no outstanding obligations and no guarantors.  

With free housing, my monthly expenses are modest. The projected repayment of around 170 DM constitutes less than 5 % of my regular income, assuring comfortable coverage. My long tenure, steady salary, and spotless credit record underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available at your convenience for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrovic

Esteemed Lending Officer,  

I am Anil Kapoor, an Indian mechanical engineering technician employed by Siemens Mobility in Allach since March 2016. My net monthly salary is 3,600 DM, and I occupy a subsidized, rent-free apartment on the factory grounds.  

To maintain my shift-work schedule, I must replace my aging scooter with a dependable used vehicle. I have identified a 2018 Škoda Fabia costing 5,800 DM and request a loan of 5,493 DM payable over 36 months.  

My current account shows an overdraft of 295 DM, and my savings amount to 41 DM. The deficit stems from recent tuition payments for my two dependents, aged 10 and 12, who live with my parents in Pune. Importantly, a prior 3,000 DM education loan was repaid in full last year, and my record with your bank remains flawless. I hold no other installment plans or credit cards.  

Given my secure employment, minimal living costs, and established repayment history, I am confident of meeting the monthly installment of roughly 170 DM without difficulty.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Anil Kapoor

Frankfurt am Main, 24 September 2025  

Dear Loan Department,  

My name is Tomasz Zielinski, a Polish national working as a senior laboratory assistant at Merck KGaA in Darmstadt for the past nine years. I earn 3,900 DM net each month and reside at my sister’s flat in Frankfurt without paying rent.  

Because I have recently been assigned late-night shifts, public transport is no longer a viable option. I intend to buy a reliable 2017 Ford Focus for commuting and therefore apply for a 5,493 DM loan over 36 months.  

At present my checking account is overdrawn by 310 DM, and my savings balance is 73 DM. The overdraft arose after covering dental expenses for my two children who live with their mother in Gdańsk. Nevertheless, my previous 5,000 DM consumer loan with your bank was repaid ahead of schedule, demonstrating my commitment to financial obligations. I hold no other debts and require no guarantor.  

With no housing costs, the proposed installment fits comfortably into my monthly budget. My steady employment history and impeccable repayment record make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to supply any additional information.  

Yours faithfully,  
Tomasz Zielinski

To whom it may concern,  

I am José Manuel Rodríguez, a Portuguese citizen and master toolmaker at MAN Truck & Bus SE, where I have been employed for eleven years. My take-home pay averages 4,050 DM per month. I live rent-free in a company guesthouse adjacent to the plant.  

I request a 5,493 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a used 2016 Audi A3. The vehicle will allow me to transport my children, aged 8 and 11, during their weekend visits from Lisbon and to reach the factory when I am on emergency call.  

My current account is overdrawn by 460 DM, and my savings total 88 DM. The overdraft reflects airfare for my children’s summer stay. I have previously settled a 3,500 DM credit for professional certification without a single late payment, and I maintain no other liabilities.  

Given my stable, long-term employment, absence of housing costs, and spotless repayment history, I am confident I can meet the monthly installment of about 170 DM. I respectfully ask for your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
José Manuel Rodríguez
