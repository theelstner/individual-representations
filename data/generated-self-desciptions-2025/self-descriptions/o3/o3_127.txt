Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Mihai Popescu, a 30-year-old Romanian mechanical technician employed by Siemens Turbomachinery GmbH since March 2022. I request a loan of 2 121 DM to complete the purchase of a new Volkswagen Polo, essential for my daily 45 km commute to the plant.  

Income & liabilities: my net salary is 3 600 DM per month. I have two active credits with your bank—furniture (52 DM/month, ends Feb 2025) and a language-course loan (38 DM/month, ends Oct 2024)—both serviced without delay. My current account shows a temporary overdraft of –420 DM after recent moving costs. Savings stand at 64 DM; additionally I hold an LBS building-society agreement (balance 780 DM) and a life-insurance policy valued at 25 000 DM.  

The requested loan will be repaid in 12 monthly instalments of roughly 180 DM, keeping my total debt service under 270 DM, or 15 % of take-home pay. I own my condominium in Altona (residing there two years) and have never missed a housing or utility payment. If required, I am willing to register the vehicle as collateral and arrange payroll deduction.  

My steady employment, spotless internal repayment record, and willingness to provide security make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Mihai Popescu

To the Credit Department,  

I am Carlos Alvarez, a 30-year-old Spanish research assistant in molecular biology at Goethe University, employed under a permanent contract since June 2021. I wish to obtain a 2 121 DM loan to pay the final instalment on a new Opel Corsa that will replace my 20-year-old scooter and allow safe transport of my six-year-old son to school.  

Financial picture: net income averages 3 250 DM monthly. Two small loans with your bank—a 2019 laptop credit (48 DM/month, ends Jan 2025) and a 2020 relocation credit (42 DM/month, ends Sep 2024)—have been serviced flawlessly. My checking account is currently –310 DM after recent conference fees; savings equal 58 DM. I contribute 120 DM monthly to a BHW building-society plan and hold a 30 000 DM life-insurance policy. I have lived in my own cooperative flat for two years.  

The new loan, repayable over 12 months at about 180 DM, leaves my total monthly debt burden below 9 % of income. I consent to automatic withdrawal and am open to listing the vehicle as collateral. My consistent payment history and secure academic post attest to my reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Andriy Shevchuk, Ukrainian software test engineer at Bosch Engineering GmbH since January 2023, request a consumer loan of 2 121 DM to cover the dealer down-payment on a new Škoda Fabia. The vehicle is required for project visits to the Reutlingen plant, now part of my role.  

I earn a net 3 800 DM per month. Two existing credits held with you—a 2020 furniture loan (50 DM/month) and a 2021 evening-course loan (40 DM/month)—are in perfect standing and will be fully settled within nine months. Present account balance is –390 DM, reflecting recent dental expenses. Liquid savings are 72 DM, while a Wüstenrot building-society contract (balance 960 DM) and a 20 000 DM life-insurance policy constitute additional assets.  

With a proposed 12-month schedule of 180 DM, my total instalments will not exceed 270 DM monthly, comfortably below 8 % of income. I have owned and lived in my condominium for two years. Payroll deduction and comprehensive insurance on the car will secure repayment.  

I value the trust your bank has already placed in me and look forward to strengthening our relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Andriy Shevchuk

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is Daniel Kovács, a 30-year-old Hungarian customs officer stationed at Mannheim Hafen since May 2022. I apply for a 2 121 DM auto loan to finance a new Ford Fiesta, replacing a failing 1999 model that no longer meets emission rules. Reliable transport is vital for rotating night shifts.  

Monthly net income is 3 100 DM. I maintain two minor credits with your institution: a 2019 washing-machine loan (45 DM/month) and a 2020 German-language course loan (35 DM/month), both current and ending within the year. Checking balance is –350 DM after annual insurance premiums; cash reserves equal 61 DM. I also contribute to a Schwäbisch Hall Bausparvertrag (balance 840 DM) and hold life insurance for 22 000 DM.  

The new loan, amortised over 12 months at roughly 180 DM, keeps my combined instalments at 260 DM, or 8 % of net pay. I reside in my own apartment (two years) and have never missed a utility or association fee. I consent to automatic debit and to the bank holding the Fahrzeugbrief until repayment.  

My steady civil-service position and impeccable payment record underscore my creditworthiness. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Kovács

Dear Lending Manager,  

I am Oleg Petrov, a 30-year-old Russian CNC machinist employed at Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH since April 2021. I seek a 2 121 DM loan to complete purchase of a new Seat Ibiza necessary for commuting to Zwickau after late shifts.  

Financial details: net salary 3 450 DM. Two ongoing credits with your bank—2019 appliance loan (44 DM/month) and 2021 evening-college loan (39 DM/month)—are serviced on time; both mature within ten months. Account currently stands at –370 DM due to property-tax payment. Savings are 69 DM. I hold a LBS building-society contract with 900 DM balance and a 28 000 DM life-insurance policy.  

The requested loan, repaid in 12 equal instalments of about 180 DM, will raise total monthly debt service to 263 DM (under 8 % of income). I have lived in my own townhouse since 2023 and have never been late on homeowners’ dues. I authorize salary deduction and agree to comprehensive coverage listing the bank as first loss payee.  

My stable employment, ownership of residence, and spotless repayment history affirm my reliability. I appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Best regards,  
Oleg Petrov
