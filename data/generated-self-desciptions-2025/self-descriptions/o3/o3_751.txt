Letter 1 – Carlos Alvarez

Berlin, 17 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Carlos Alvarez, a 33-year-old Spanish industrial mechanic employed with Siemens Turbinenbau GmbH in Berlin since February 2020 (5 years, permanent contract). I would like to request a loan of €3 029 for the purchase of a reliable used Volkswagen Golf Variant that will replace my twelve-year-old Opel Astra, which has become increasingly expensive to repair. The car is essential for commuting to the Siemens plant in Spandau and for childcare transport for my six-year-old son, Diego.

My net salary averages €2 750 per month and I own a 40 m² condominium in Lichtenberg, fully paid off. I currently have one consumer loan with your bank taken out in 2022 for household appliances; every installment was settled punctually and the balance was cleared ahead of schedule last month. I have no other debts, overdrafts, or credit cards. Because I have always handled my obligations responsibly and kept my budget within limits, the requested 15-month plan at roughly €205 per month (including interest) comfortably fits my finances.

Although I do not yet maintain a current account, I am prepared to open one with your institution so that the installment can be debited automatically. I will also provide my employment contract and the latest twelve salary slips.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing a transparent and reliable relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,
Carlos Alvarez

Letter 2 – Ahmed Khan

Bonn, 17 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed Khan, a 33-year-old Pakistani network support specialist working for Deutsche Telekom IT GmbH in Bonn since June 2021 (4 years). I respectfully request a €3 029 loan to acquire a 2016 Toyota Yaris Hybrid. The vehicle will lower my commuting costs and allow me to visit my eight-year-old daughter, Aisha, who lives with her mother in Cologne each weekend.

My monthly net income is €2 640. I own a small townhouse in Bonn-Endenich, inherited from my uncle in 2023; it is mortgage-free. The only credit I have ever held is a €1 500 electronics loan from your bank, which I repaid without a single delay. I keep less than €100 in a savings booklet and hold no credit cards, overdrafts, or leases.

The requested term of 15 months results in an affordable monthly burden of about €210, well below 10 % of my take-home pay. Even though I presently operate only a savings booklet, I am committed to opening a checking account with you for automatic installment collection.

My record demonstrates punctuality and stability, and I would be grateful for your positive decision.

Kind regards,
Ahmed Khan

Letter 3 – Luka Petrovic

Hamburg, 17 September 2025

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Luka Petrovic. Since March 2019 (6 years) I have been employed as a certified TIG/MAG welder at Blohm + Voss Shipyards in Hamburg. I seek a loan of €3 029 to purchase a 2015 Skoda Octavia Combi. Reliable transport is vital because my current Peugeot broke down twice last quarter, causing me to miss overtime shifts that are important for household income and for driving my seven-year-old son, Marko, to daycare.

Financially, I earn €2 850 net per month, plus regular overtime averaging €300. I own a 36 m² apartment in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg, fully paid. My sole previous loan—€2 200 for dental work—was taken with your bank in 2021 and repaid three months ahead of schedule. I neither use credit cards nor have other installment obligations.

The planned 15-month repayment (≈€205/month) is well within my budget; even in months without overtime I retain more than 60 % of my income for living costs after paying the installment.

I will gladly open a checking account at your branch for direct debit and provide all required documents. I trust my employment stability and impeccable repayment history will merit your approval.

Respectfully,
Luka Petrovic
Veringstr. 155
21107 Hamburg


Letter 4 – João Pereira

Leverkusen, 17 September 2025

Dear Ms. Müller,

I am João Pereira, a Portuguese laboratory technician at Bayer AG, Leverkusen, employed since April 2021 (4 ½ years). I am applying for a €3 029 loan to buy a well-maintained 2014 Ford Focus Wagon. The car will enable punctual shift attendance and transport of my seven-year-old son, Miguel, to school—public transport does not reach our neighborhood in time for early shifts.

My net pay is €2 580 per month plus a fixed annual bonus. I own a small freehold flat in Opladen, insured and without liens. In 2022 I borrowed €2 500 from your bank for moving expenses and repaid it completely in May 2024. No other liabilities exist, and I maintain a small savings book with €75.

The proposed 15-month repayment results in around €210 monthly, comfortably below my available disposable income. Though I currently handle payments in cash, I intend to open a current account with you to simplify the process.

My continuous employment, clean credit record, and home ownership affirm my reliability. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
João Pereira
Uhlandstr. 19

Letter 5 – Daniel Osei

Frankfurt a.M., 17 September 2025

Dear Credit Department,

I am Daniel Osei, a 33-year-old Ghanaian administrative assistant employed by the Federal Customs Administration at Frankfurt Airport since January 2021 (4 years, public-sector contract). I wish to obtain a €3 029 loan to purchase a 2013 Opel Insignia Sports Tourer. The vehicle will replace my aging Ford Fiesta and is necessary for alternating early and late shifts as well as for transporting my five-year-old son, Kwame.

My net monthly income is €2 720, secure under Tarifvertrag öffentlicher Dienst. I own a 42 m² condominium in Frankfurt-Höchst that I fully paid off last year. My credit history includes one prior loan with your bank for €1 800 (acquired 2022 for furniture), repaid exactly on schedule. I have no other debts, credit cards, or open invoices, and my savings amount to €80.

Based on the offered 15-month term, the installment will be roughly €205, leaving ample room in my budget. To streamline servicing, I will open a checking account with your branch and authorize automatic deductions.

My stable public-sector employment, home ownership, and spotless repayment record underline my creditworthiness. I appreciate your favorable evaluation.

Sincerely,
Daniel Osei
