Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marco Hernandez, 54, married with one son, and I have lived in my own house at 11 Maple Lane for the past four years. I am applying for a €717 loan, payable over 24 months, to complete the purchase of a 2018 Renault Zoe that will replace my 2001 pickup and cut commuting costs.

I have worked as a municipal building inspector for nine years, earning €3 200 net per month. The requested loan equals less than 1 % of my annual income, and I can comfortably service a €30 monthly instalment.

Three years ago I fell behind on two credit-card payments when my wife required surgery, but all accounts were brought current and my two existing renovation loans with your bank have been paid on time ever since. I own my home and current vehicle outright.

Although I do not yet have a checking account, my salary is paid onto a payroll card and I will open a current account with your bank if the loan is approved. My stable employment, property ownership and clean recent payment record make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,  
Marco Hernandez

Dear Credit Committee,

I, John Schmidt, 54 and widowed, request a €717 loan over 24 months to purchase a safer car for my daily 40-km commute as a signal technician for Deutsche Rail. My 2005 hatchback is unreliable, and a replacement will protect both my job and overtime opportunities.

I have held a permanent contract with Deutsche Rail for 15 years, earning €2 850 net monthly. My only other debts are two small appliance loans with your bank; both are paid on schedule.

In 2020 a delay was recorded after my wife’s passing caused temporary income disruption. Every obligation has been honoured promptly since, and automatic payments are now in place.

I own my apartment mortgage-free and a 2013 scooter valued at about €1 200. I will open a checking account to channel repayments if the loan is granted.

I trust my steady employment and modest debt load will meet your criteria. Thank you for your favourable review.
Respectfully,  
John Schmidt

To the Loans Department,

My name is Ahmed Farouk, 54, married with one son. I have been a senior laboratory technician at Bayer AG for ten years, earning €3 400 net per month. I seek €717 over 24 months to buy a 2017 Opel Astra so I can reach my plant during night shifts when public transport is unavailable.

I now hold two contracts with your bank—home insulation and a dishwasher—both serviced without a single missed payment in the last 30 months. A delay in 2019 arose during a temporary plant shutdown but was rectified within the same quarter.

I own my residence outright and a 2012 motorbike valued at €2 000. The planned €30 monthly repayment fits easily within my budget. I will open a current account with your branch to automate instalments.

Thank you for considering my application; my long-term employment and consistent repayment pattern show my reliability.
Kind regards,  
Ahmed Farouk

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Carlos Mendes, a 54-year-old widower residing at 3 Rua das Oliveiras, Porto. I request a €717 loan, repayable over 24 months, to buy a nearly-new Kia Picanto for my work as a regional sales officer.

For twelve years I have been employed by Lusitano Tools S.A., earning €2 950 net monthly plus commissions. My credit file shows a payment delay in 2018 during my late wife’s illness; all commitments have been punctual since. Two existing loans with your bank will be settled within six months.

I own my house and a 2010 delivery van worth about €3 500. The proposed €30 instalment represents barely 1 % of my income. I will open a checking account and set up automatic debits on approval.

I look forward to your positive response and remain available for any further information.
Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

Dear Loan Panel,

My name is Peter Novak, married, 54, living in my own home in Brno for four years with my wife and adult son. I request a €717 loan over 24 months to buy a 2016 Škoda Fabia Combi that will replace the ageing pool car I use for weekend shifts.

I have been a senior machine operator at Zbrojovka Brno a.s. for eight years, taking home about €2 800 net monthly. I currently have two active credits with your branch, both paid ahead of schedule.

A short delay appeared in 2020 when our roof needed emergency repairs, but arrears were cleared within the same month. I own a 2008 motorboat and hold my house title, giving me assets well above liabilities. The €30 monthly instalment is easily manageable.

I do not hold a current account yet, but I am ready to establish one and set up direct debit payments immediately.

Thank you for your time. I value our long-standing relationship and am confident I will meet every instalment.
With respect,  
Peter Novak
