Leipzig, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Petrovic, a 29-year-old divorced citizen of Serbia living in Leipzig with my six-year-old son. I respectfully request a loan of 2 171 € to purchase a smart television and DAB+ radio set that I will use for my evening remote-learning program in medical-device software testing and for my child’s German-language tutoring apps.  

Although I have held my current position as a quality-control technician at MedTechSoft GmbH for only ten months, my net salary is 2 350 € per month. I own the condominium in which we live (mortgage with your bank, instalment class 2) and my 2017 Opel Corsa. Last year I took a 1 500 € furniture loan with you and repaid it three months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, and my Schufa record is spotless.  

Because my salary comfortably covers the projected monthly instalment of 97 €, I am confident of meeting every payment on time. The requested loan will improve both my professional qualifications and my son’s integration, thus strengthening our household’s long-term stability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace number 0341 – 85 77 219 for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Maria Petrovic

Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ana Rodríguez, a married Spanish national working since February at the Munich Department of Public Works as a civil-service administrative officer. I wish to obtain a 2 171 € loan to buy semi-professional podcasting radio equipment and a 55-inch energy-efficient television. The devices will let me launch a bilingual city-services information podcast in partnership with my employer’s communications team.  

My gross income is 3 100 € per month, and my housing costs are limited because I own a small row house purchased in 2022 (mortgage serviced punctually through this bank). I currently have no revolving credit and only one past loan—a 1 200 € tuition advance from you that I repaid in full last July. My savings are minimal, but my payment history demonstrates reliability.  

The new project is endorsed by my department head and will generate an additional 250 € monthly honorarium, more than covering the 97 € instalment. I therefore view this loan as low-risk for both parties.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration. I can be reached weekdays after 17:00 at 0151 – 44 98 72 30.  

Sincerely,  
Ana Rodríguez

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Elena Popescu, a 29-year-old Romanian chemical-lab assistant employed eight months at RheinChem AG. Following my recent separation, I moved with my four-year-old daughter into a condominium I purchased in 2023; the mortgage is serviced with you and is current. I am applying for a 2 171 € loan to replace our obsolete CRT television and broken kitchen radio.  

My net salary is 2 100 € and child allowance adds 219 € monthly. I have no checking account yet, but my salary is transferred to my savings passbook and I pay bills by standing order. In 2024 I took a 900 € appliance loan from your bank and repaid it exactly on schedule over nine months. Apart from that, I have no debts.  

The requested loan will carry a manageable instalment under 100 €, which I will pay through automatic transfer on my pay-day, minimizing any risk of delay. My steady income, spotless record, and existing customer relationship make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Elena Popescu

Frankfurt a.M., 12 September 2025  

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Viktoria Novak. I am a Croatian customs officer assigned to Frankfurt Airport since November 2024. I respectfully ask for a loan of 2 171 € to purchase a low-consumption OLED television for my German-language immersion course and a digital car radio compliant with new federal safety standards.  

I earn a net monthly salary of 2 800 € plus overtime averaging 300 €. I own a 2019 Škoda Fabia and a 38 m² studio apartment that I bought in 2022 with financing from your bank; payments have never been late. My only previous credit, a 1 600 € relocation loan, was settled in June. I do not have additional debts or credit cards.  

The proposed loan’s instalment of about 97 € represents less than 3 % of my regular income. I will authorise automatic deduction from my salary account to guarantee punctual repayment. My consistent track record with you underlines my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for questions at my office line 069 – 70 33 441.  

Best regards,  
Viktoria Novak

Hamburg, 11 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,  

I am Sofia Dimitrova, a Bulgarian registered nurse employed since October 2024 in the intensive-care unit of St. Mary’s Hospital, Hamburg. I intend to purchase a smart television and internet-enabled radio for my 69-year-old mother, who recently moved in with me, so she can follow Bulgarian news channels and my hospital’s distance wellbeing programs. The cost is 2 171 €, for which I am requesting financing.  

My take-home pay is 2 400 € per month. I live in a townhouse I bought in 2023 (mortgage handled by your bank, category 2 instalment), and I drive a 2018 Ford Fiesta. My only previous credit—a 1 000 € language-school loan—was paid off four months early this March. Other than that, I carry no consumer debt and have maintained an unblemished repayment record.  

The new loan will add a modest 97 € monthly obligation, comfortably within my budget. To eliminate any possibility of delay, I will set up a fixed standing order timed one day after my salary is credited each month. My dependable income, property ownership, and proven discipline affirm that I am a trustworthy applicant.  

Thank you for taking the time to evaluate my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Sofia Dimitrova
