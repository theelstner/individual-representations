Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Adrian Kovacs. For the past three years I have worked in Augsburg as a certified tool-and-die technician at Maschinenbau Kehl GmbH, earning a steady net income of 2 900 DM per month. I would like to finance the purchase of a combined radio–television receiver that will allow my 10-year-old son, who lives with me, to attend an E-learning language programme broadcast on regional television. The required amount is 1 360 DM, which I propose to repay over 15 months in equal instalments of approximately 95 DM.

Although I do not hold a current account with your bank, I am already servicing two small consumer loans with you (contract numbers 17/0632 and 18/0447) and have never missed or delayed a payment. My life-insurance policy with Allianz (face value 15 000 DM) and a building-society savings contract worth 8 400 DM attest to my long-term financial discipline, even though the balance on my passbook savings account is currently below 100 DM.

I am a Hungarian citizen with permanent residence status and have lived in my own apartment in Augsburg for two years. My stable employment, spotless repayment record and existing collateral make me a reliable applicant. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.

Sincerely,
Adrian Kovacs



Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Carlo Moretti, a 31-year-old Italian national working as a network administrator for Bayerische Verkehrsbetriebe AG in Munich since February 2021. My monthly net salary is 3 150 DM. I am applying for a 1 360 DM loan to buy a new colour television and digital radio tuner so I can complete a distance-learning certification in Linux server management that is broadcast on BR-Alpha.

I presently hold two micro-loans with your bank (total outstanding 910 DM). All instalments have been paid punctually, and the final payment on the first loan is due next month. While I do not keep a current account with you, I maintain a life-insurance policy (insured sum 20 000 DM) that could be assigned as security. My savings balance is modest—77 DM—because I have concentrated on paying down debt quickly.

I have lived in my owner-occupied condominium in Schwabing for two years and support my younger brother, who is studying at the TU München. My proven payment history, stable employment and additional insurance collateral demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any further information.

Kind regards,
Carlo Moretti



Respected Credit Officer,

I am David Chen, a Singaporean research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits in Erlangen. I have held this position for three years and earn a net monthly income of roughly 2 800 DM. I seek a loan of 1 360 DM to purchase a high-resolution television and DAB radio set required for a remote usability-testing project the institute is conducting.

I currently have two active consumer credits with your branch. My repayment record is immaculate: every instalment has been transferred before the due date via standing order from my savings account at Sparkasse Erlangen. Aside from an 87 DM balance in that account, my largest asset is a building-society savings contract (current value 9 200 DM) that I am willing to pledge.

I own a small townhouse where I have resided for two years. Although I do not hold a checking account or telephone line, my supervisor can confirm both my employment status and reliability. I am single but financially responsible for my mother, who moved to Germany last year.

Given my steady income, existing collateral and flawless repayment history, I am confident of settling the proposed 15-month plan without difficulty.

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.

Sincerely,
David Chen



Dear Credit Department,

My name is Femi Ajayi. I have been employed for three years as a customs compliance officer at Stuttgart Airport, earning 2 750 DM net each month. I wish to borrow 1 360 DM to buy a combined radio/television set so my 8-year-old daughter and I can access educational programming on Südwestrundfunk.

I already manage two instalment loans with your institution (contracts 19/1128 and 19/1453) and am proud to have maintained an unblemished payment record. Beyond a small savings balance of 63 DM, I hold a life-insurance policy valued at 18 000 DM and a building-society savings agreement reaching maturity in 2029, which I am prepared to list as additional security.

I have owned and occupied my apartment in Filderstadt for the past two years. As a Nigerian citizen with permanent German residence, I have found stable footing both professionally and socially. I have no other debts, guarantors or instalment plans, and I am comfortable with the proposed repayment schedule of about 95 DM per month over 15 months.

Your continued confidence in my reliability is greatly appreciated, and I look forward to strengthening our banking relationship.

Yours faithfully,
Femi Ajayi



Dear Lending Manager,

I am Hans Petersen, a Danish avionics technician employed with Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg since March 2021, earning a constant 3 020 DM net per month. I request a loan of 1 360 DM to purchase a new smart television and digital radio unit that will enable me to follow live remote-training modules required for my EASA B2 recertification.

I have two existing credits at your bank, both serviced flawlessly through automated monthly deposits. My passbook savings stands at 52 DM, but I maintain a building-society savings plan worth 10 500 DM and a life-insurance policy with a 25 000 DM insured sum. Although I do not hold a current account with you, I value our lending relationship and intend to consolidate future banking services under your roof.

I have lived for two years in the condominium I own in Altona and support one dependent—my nephew, who is studying engineering at HAW Hamburg. Aside from regular living expenses, I carry no other debt obligations. The requested loan would be repaid comfortably over 15 months at roughly 95 DM per month, representing less than 4 % of my net income.

With stable employment, verifiable collateral and a spotless payment history, I trust I meet your criteria for creditworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Hans Petersen
