Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Rossi, Italian citizen and resident in Stuttgart since 1991.  For the past nine years I have worked full-time as a housekeeping aide at St. Joseph’s Hospital, earning a steady net income of 2,350 DM per month that is paid into my checking account with your branch.  I have held this account for more than five years and always maintain a balance above 300 DM.  

In 1998 I financed a washing machine with a 900 DM loan from your bank and repaid every installment on schedule.  I now ask for a 1,240 DM loan over ten months to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my twenty-year-old car, whose repairs have become uneconomical.  Reliable transportation is essential for the 20-km commute to the hospital and for caring for my two school-age children.  

I live rent-free in my sister’s house, have no other debts, and keep 340 DM in a savings account for emergencies.  My proposed monthly installment of roughly 125 DM represents just 5 % of my net income, leaving ample room for all regular expenses.  My earlier credit record with you demonstrates that I honor my obligations fully and on time.  

Thank you for considering my application.  I am available at the hospital during work hours should you need further information.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Rossi

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Anna Kowalska, a Polish national living in Dortmund since 1993.  For eight years I have been employed as a cafeteria attendant at the Municipal Vocational School, receiving a net salary of 2,100 DM that is transferred monthly to my checking account at your bank.  The balance has never fallen below 250 DM.  

Five years ago I took a 1,500 DM furniture loan from another institution and repaid it ahead of time; I currently have no outstanding liabilities.  I request a loan of 1,240 DM for ten months to buy a new Volkswagen Lupo.  My present vehicle failed inspection, and dependable transport is necessary to bring my wheelchair-bound husband to therapy and my two children to kindergarten.  

We live in my parents-in-law’s home without rent, which keeps household expenses low.  I hold 410 DM in savings and have an overdraft facility I have never used.  The projected 125 DM monthly installment fits comfortably within my budget and leaves ample cushion.  

My long and stable employment, spotless repayment history, and consistent account conduct make me a trustworthy borrower.  I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Yours faithfully,  
Anna Kowalska

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Elif Yılmaz.  I have resided in Hamburg for twelve years and have been a cleaning operative with Deutsche Bahn AG for a decade, earning 2,250 DM net per month.  All wages are paid into my checking account at your bank, which I opened four years ago and keep above 400 DM.  

In 1997 I obtained a 1,000 DM small-appliance loan from you and repaid it flawlessly.  I now seek a 1,240 DM loan, repayable over ten months, to purchase a new Ford Ka.  Public trains do not run at the hours of my night shifts, and my old Renault recently broke down beyond repair.  

I live rent-free in a company-owned residence, support two teenage children, and have no other installment plans.  I hold 380 DM in a savings book for unforeseen costs.  The planned payment of roughly 125 DM amounts to less than 6 % of my income, ensuring timely servicing.  

Given my stable job, clean credit record, and prudent budgeting, I respectfully ask you to approve my request.  

Kind regards,  
Elif Yılmaz

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Sofia Petrova, Bulgarian citizen, divorced, age 48, residing in Leverkusen since 1994.  For seven years I have worked as a packaging helper at the Bayer chemical plant, drawing a steady net wage of 2,180 DM that is credited to my account with your bank.  The account has been active for over three years, with a standing balance above 300 DM.  

Three years ago I repaid a 1,200 DM loan from your bank for vocational courses without a single delay.  I now request 1,240 DM for the purchase of a new Skoda Fabia.  Reliable transport will secure my shift punctuality and allow me to bring my two children to weekend language classes.  

Housing is free in a company dormitory, and I have no other debts or guarantees outstanding.  I keep 290 DM in a savings bond and regularly add to it.  The expected 125 DM monthly installment is well within my disposable income.  

My consistent employment, spotless payment history, and modest lifestyle testify to my reliability.  I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Katarina Novak, Croatian national, married, and the primary earner for my household in Bremen.  I have served as a resident carer at St. Martin’s Elderly Home for the past eleven years, earning a net salary of 2,300 DM which is deposited directly into my current account with you.  That account, open since 1996, has never dipped below 350 DM.  

Four years ago I took a 2,000 DM education loan from another bank and repaid it early.  I seek a 1,240 DM loan for ten months to buy a new Fiat Punto.  The car is essential for my night-shift travel and for taking my two children to their grandparents on weekends.  

We occupy a rent-free flat provided by the care home, have no other installment obligations, and maintain 420 DM in savings.  The planned monthly installment of about 125 DM is easily covered by my budget surplus of roughly 600 DM.  

My stable employment record, sound financial conduct, and proven repayment discipline make me a dependable borrower.  I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide any additional documents.  

Respectfully,  
Katarina Novak
