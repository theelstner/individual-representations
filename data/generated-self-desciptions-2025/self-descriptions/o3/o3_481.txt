Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Markus Keller, 44, employed for the past nine years as a scientific research assistant in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Hamburg. I respectfully request a loan of 1 478 DM over 15 months to purchase essential furniture and a new laptop needed both for my office at home and for my two school-age sons.

Although my current checking account shows a debit balance of –312 DM, this is temporary after paying last semester’s conference fees. My monthly net salary is 4 250 DM, of which 104 DM can comfortably be allocated to the proposed instalment plan. I own my condominium in Barmbek (paid off) and a 2016 VW Golf, and I have maintained two small credits with your bank since 2018, both serviced without a single late payment. Other external obligations amount to 260 DM per month and end next April.

With stable public-sector employment, four years at my present address, and a documented record of punctual repayments, I am confident of meeting every instalment on time. The requested sum will improve both my productivity and my children’s study environment, strengthening our household finances in the long run.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at any time on 040-72 66 55.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Keller

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

I am Peter Schneider, single, 44, and have served as a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since 2013. I am applying for a 1 478 DM loan to replace living-room furniture and a damaged refrigerator following a recent water leak.

My current account is overdrawn by 547 DM, but my net monthly income of 3 900 DM easily supports the planned 15-month repayment of roughly 100 DM. I maintain modest savings of 67 DM and drive a 2014 Opel Astra that is fully owned. Though I have one outstanding auto loan with an external lender (178 DM per month, never late), both credits I hold with your bank—for a washing machine and minor roof repair—have been serviced flawlessly for three and two years respectively.

I have lived at my present home in Neu-Isenburg for four years and carry no guarantor or co-debtor. The civil-service status of my position offers job security; my payroll slip and service record are enclosed as proof. I trust this demonstrates my reliability and capacity to honour the requested credit.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I welcome any further questions by telephone at 069-33 18 44.

Kind regards,  
Peter Schneider

Dear Credit Department,

I am Andreas Hoffmann, an IT systems analyst at Siemens AG, employed continuously for eight years. I request a loan of 1 478 DM payable over 15 months to furnish a small home office and purchase an ergonomic workstation; my doctor has advised this to prevent ongoing back problems.

At the moment my current account stands at –289 DM, owing to school fees for my twin daughters. My net salary is 4 600 DM. The envisaged 104 DM monthly instalment fits well within my budget even alongside a 250 DM external education loan that ends in February. My savings account holds 54 DM; however, I own my terraced house in Trudering and a 2015 Skoda Octavia outright. Both of my existing credits with your bank have been repaid punctually—one was closed last month.

I have resided at my current address for four years, maintain a listed landline, and possess an unblemished employment record. These factors, combined with consistent repayment history, underline my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I am reachable on 089-71 62 30 for any clarification.

Respectfully,  
Andreas Hoffmann

To the Loans Office,

My name is Thomas Meier, 44, journeyman electrician with Berliner Stadtwerke for twelve years. I seek a 1 478 DM loan for new children’s bedroom furniture and replacement of several worn-out power tools I use for side jobs.

Following tuition costs for my two dependents, my checking account is presently –418 DM. Net take-home pay averages 3 750 DM, and I can allocate 100–105 DM monthly toward repayment over 15 months. Savings total 82 DM. I own a 2013 Ford Focus and a small row house in Pankow, held free of mortgage. My history with your bank includes two successfully serviced credits; my only outside obligation is a 190 DM cooperative loan that concludes this December.

Four years at the same residence, a permanent contract, and steady overtime income attest to my stability. I have never missed an instalment, and all payments are automated to ensure punctuality.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply. You may reach me at 030-55 39 67.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Meier

Dear Banking Team,

I am Jan Weber, 44 years old, single father of two, employed as an insurance claims examiner at Allianz Versicherungs-AG since 2018. I wish to borrow 1 478 DM over 15 months to purchase a new energy-efficient furnace and living-room furnishings.

My current account shows –365 DM after paying last quarter’s school materials. Monthly net income is 4 100 DM. The proposed 104 DM instalment represents less than 3 % of my earnings. Savings stand at 39 DM, but I own my detached home in Gerresheim and a 2014 Toyota Corolla. I hold no active credit at this bank; two previous loans here were cleared on schedule. An external credit card balance of 310 DM is managed well within limit.

Residency of four years, stable employment, and clean payment records underscore my reliability. Automated salary transfer into my account further assures regular instalment coverage.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at 0211-44 22 11 for any questions.

With respect,  
Jan Weber
