Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 22-year-old Portuguese national living in Stuttgart with my wife Anna and our one-year-old son Leo. For the past 2 years and 2 months I have been employed as a certified CNC operator at Siemens Turbomachinery GmbH, earning 3 000 DM net per month. Last year I repaid a 600-DM education loan from your bank without a single delay.  

I am applying for a 1 007-DM, 12-month loan to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo so I can reach my 5 a.m. shift reliably. My checking account currently shows 138 DM; my savings book holds 1 420 DM. I own the condominium at Schwabstraße 71 outright and carry no other debts or installment plans.  

With stable income, real-estate ownership, and a spotless repayment record, I am confident of meeting the monthly installment of roughly 90 DM. I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any additional documents by mail.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I am Marek Novák, age 22, a married Czech citizen residing in Dresden. Since February 2023 (1 year, 7 months) I have worked as a laboratory assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Photonics, earning a steady 2 700 DM net. My checking balance is 74 DM, while my savings account holds 1 310 DM.  

In 2024 I concluded a 900-DM consumer loan with your bank, making each payment on schedule. I now request 1 007 DM over 12 months to buy a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to transport sensitive equipment to partner sites instead of relying on public transport.  

I own a small terraced house on Blasewitzer Straße, mortgage-free, and have no other credit obligations. The proposed installment represents less than 4 % of my monthly income, a level I can comfortably meet. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Respectfully,  
Marek Novák

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Juan Alberto Reyes, 22, a widower from Argentina raising my two-year-old daughter Elena in Munich. For 3 years I have served as a junior civil-engineering drafter with Hochtief Süd, earning 2 850 DM net. My current account shows 159 DM; my savings bond is valued at 1 650 DM.  

Two years ago I took a 1 100-DM household loan with your branch and repaid it three months ahead of schedule. I now apply for a 1 007-DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to purchase a new Ford Fiesta needed for site inspections across Bavaria.  

I own a 35 m² studio apartment in Sendling and have no other debts or guarantors. The projected monthly payment of approximately 90 DM is well within my budget. I trust my proven reliability will merit your approval.  

Kind regards,  
Juan Alberto Reyes

Honoured Loan Officer,  

My name is Nikolai Dimitrov, a 22-year-old Bulgarian engineer’s mate employed for 1 year and 11 months at Blohm + Voss Shipyards, netting 2 600 DM monthly. I am married and support our infant son. My giro account holds 92 DM; my Sparbuch balance is 1 205 DM.  

In 2023 I cleared an 800-DM apprenticeship loan with your bank, never missing a deadline. I now seek 1 007 DM for 12 months to buy a new Renault Clio, essential for commuting to the night shift when public transport is unavailable.  

I live in and own a small townhouse in Wilhelmsburg, free of encumbrances, and I carry no additional installment plans. My steady income, property ownership, and flawless credit record underscore my reliability. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Nikolai Dimitrov  



Letter 5  
Frankfurt am Main, 9 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Farouk, a 22-year-old Egyptian national, married, with one dependent daughter. For the past 3 years and 1 month I have worked as a certified IT support specialist at Deutsche Bank’s internal services division, earning 3 200 DM net.  

I respectfully request a 1 007-DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to purchase a new Toyota Yaris that will replace my unreliable second-hand motorbike and allow me to respond to after-hours on-site support calls. My checking account shows 187 DM, while my savings certificate totals 1 580 DM.  

I concluded a 950-DM furniture loan with your institution six months ago, repaid punctually. I own an apartment in the Rödelheim district and have no other liabilities. The projected monthly installment of about 90 DM is easily covered by my salary.  

Thank you for considering my application. I remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Farouk
