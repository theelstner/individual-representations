Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Frank Adler, a 47-year-old former hotel manager who was laid off last winter when the Kronprinz Hotel closed. After twenty-three years in hospitality, I am now setting up an independent revenue-management consultancy. To visit potential clients around Baden-Württemberg I need a reliable vehicle; therefore I am applying for a 1 209 DM loan, to be repaid over six months.

Financially, my checking balance is currently 178 DM and my savings account holds 61 DM. Although modest, I also own my condominium (resided in for four years) outright and maintain a 35 000 DM building-society savings contract as well as a life-insurance policy that can be assigned to the bank as collateral. I have one existing micro-credit with your bank; aside from a brief delay in 2022 that has since been cleared, every installment has been paid punctually. I have no other debts.

My new consultancy already has signed letters of intent from two hotels worth an estimated 4 800 DM in fees over the next quarter, so I am confident about repaying the requested amount. My telephone is registered and I can be reached at any time.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.

Sincerely,  
Frank Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Michael Brandt, 47, single father to an eleven-year-old daughter. After serving nineteen years as a logistics officer in the Bundeswehr, I left the service last year to launch “Brandt Kurierdienst”, a same-day parcel franchise that will open next month. For this purpose I require a compact delivery car and seek a loan of 1 209 DM, repayable within six months.

My present current-account balance is 42 DM; my savings amount to 74 DM. I have lived in my own townhouse for four years and hold a paid-up life-insurance policy worth 28 000 DM, which I am willing to pledge. I maintain only one other credit with your bank, standing at 540 DM, on which I missed one installment in 2021 but have since paid ahead of schedule. There are no guarantors or external obligations.

Military pensions starting in February will guarantee 1 650 DM net monthly, supplemented by projected courier revenues of at least 2 000 DM. With these stable inflows, the six-month repayment plan is fully covered.

I trust my long service record and property assets demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for your time and attention.

Respectfully,  
Michael Brandt

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Dr. Jonas Lehmann. Until July I was senior R&D manager at Aurora Biopharma, where a restructuring rendered my position redundant. I have signed a new contract as Head of Quality at NordMeds AG beginning 1 October with a net salary of 5 400 DM. In order to commute daily from my home in Harburg to the Lübeck production site, I need a dependable car. I therefore request a six-month loan of 1 209 DM.

Current account: 163 DM; savings: 89 DM. I own my flat (market value about 140 000 DM) and have a 50 000 DM building-society savings agreement plus life insurance. I have one small consumer loan with your bank (outstanding 292 DM) that suffered a late payment in 2022 but has otherwise been serviced flawlessly. No other debts, guarantors, or installment plans exist.

Given my imminent employment and extensive professional history, I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule. I remain available by phone at all hours for any further information.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Jonas Lehmann

Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Peter Vogt, a self-employed architect with eighteen years’ experience. Following a prolonged construction freeze earlier this year I was temporarily without income and am currently registered as unemployed. However, three new contracts (total fees 38 000 DM) start in November, requiring frequent site visits. My old estate-car is beyond repair, so I request a 1 209 DM loan for a replacement, repayable in six monthly installments.

My checking account holds 97 DM and my savings 56 DM. I have lived in and fully own my duplex in Pasing for four years. Collateral is available through a 31 000 DM life-insurance policy. Apart from one existing loan with your bank—on which I was late once in 2020 but am now current—I carry no other liabilities.

Projected monthly cash flow from the upcoming projects exceeds 6 000 DM, ensuring comfortable repayment. I can provide signed contracts upon request and will gladly authorize direct debit.

Thank you for considering this application.

Sincerely,  
Peter Vogt

Esteemed Credit Department,

My name is Sebastian Krause, 47 years old, single, responsible for my fourteen-year-old nephew who lives with me. After thirteen years as regional sales director at Helios Pharma, I took a redundancy package last quarter. I have now accepted a position as field trainer with Medita GmbH starting 15 October (net salary 4 200 DM). A reliable vehicle is essential for this role; hence I seek a 1 209 DM loan for a new car, to be repaid over six months.

My current account balance is 115 DM, and my savings account contains 38 DM. I have resided in my own townhouse for four years and possess a building-society savings agreement and life-insurance policy totaling 29 500 DM, which I will assign as security. I hold one existing credit with your bank. Apart from a delayed payment in March 2023, all installments have been honored punctually. I have no additional debts or guarantors.

With signed employment in hand and no competing obligations, I am confident of meeting the repayment schedule. I am reachable by telephone at any time to supply further documentation.

Thank you for your trust and support.

Faithfully yours,  
Sebastian Krause
