Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a personal loan of 1 388 € in order to buy a sofa-bed and a compact washing machine for the apartment that my six-year-old daughter and I have rented in Munich since November 2021.  

For the past two years I have been employed as a laboratory technician (pay scale E6 TV-L) at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, earning a steady net salary of 2 150 € per month. Nine months ago I took out a small education loan with your bank; every instalment has been credited before the due date. Apart from that obligation I am debt-free, hold a savings balance of 72 €, and have no guarantor commitments.  

Although I do not yet maintain a current account, my salary is paid onto a prepaid card and all payments are automated. If this application is approved I will open a Girokonto with you and route my wages there.  

I am 26, divorced, and responsible for one child. While I rent my flat, I own a 400 m² plot of registered land near Valencia that I inherited in 2018. This asset, together with my stable employment and flawless repayment record, provides additional security. The requested amount will be repaid in four equal instalments of about 355 €, comfortably below 20 % of my disposable income.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to deepening my relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Ana García

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Agnieszka Nowak, a 26-year-old Polish national working as a grade A6 administrative officer at the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg District Office since November 2021. My net monthly income is 2 280 €.  

I am requesting a loan of 1 388 € to furnish the children’s room and to purchase a modest computer desk for the apartment my son and I began renting last autumn. My savings account holds just 87 €, so spreading the cost over four months is prudent.  

Nine months ago I obtained a relocation loan from your bank and have met every payment punctually. I have no other debts, no guarantor obligations and no overdraft facility.  

Although day-to-day expenses are still handled through my Polish account, I will move my salary and open a Girokonto with you once this loan is granted.  

I am divorced, have resided at my current address for just over two years, and own a 12 % share of my parents’ farmhouse near Kraków, registered in the land registry. The planned instalment of roughly 360 € represents only 16 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living costs.  

My consistent civil-service employment, clean repayment history and real-estate share make me a reliable borrower. I appreciate your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Agnieszka Nowak

Dear Credit Department,  

I wish to apply for a loan of 1 388 € to purchase a compact steriliser and replace worn patient chairs at the dental practice where I am employed.  

I am 26, married, and the mother of one child. Since February 2022 I have worked full time as a certified dental hygienist at SmileCraft GmbH in Stuttgart, earning an average net income of 2 050 € per month.  

In March this year I took an education loan with your bank; nine consecutive instalments have been paid on or ahead of schedule. Beyond that, I carry no debts and my savings account holds 63 €.  

While my salary currently loads onto a prepaid card, I intend to open a checking account with you to consolidate my finances once this application is approved.  

Although I rent my flat, I own a registered building lot on the island of Thassos that I inherited from my grandparents. This property, together with continued employment and an unblemished credit record, underlines my credit-worthiness. Four monthly repayments of about 350 € will absorb less than one-fifth of my disposable income.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Eleni Papadopoulos

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Lucia Rossi, an Italian national employed for 30 months as an IT support specialist at Autoworks AG in Wolfsburg. My net salary is 2 380 € per month.  

I seek a loan of 1 388 € to buy a high-performance laptop, ergonomic desk and shelving for the home-office corner of my rented flat. These items will improve productivity and allow me to continue working two days per week from home.  

Nine months ago I borrowed 900 € from your bank for relocation expenses; every instalment has been repaid on or before the first of each month. I have no other loan commitments and my savings stand at 54 €.  

Though I presently manage daily expenses via a prepaid card, I intend to open a Girokonto with you and have my employer redirect my wages there once this loan is approved.  

I am 26, divorced, and the mother of one child. While renting in Germany, I own a small vineyard parcel near Asti valued at roughly 9 000 €, providing an additional layer of collateral. The proposed repayment of around 360 € in four equal instalments represents less than 17 % of my monthly net income, leaving a generous buffer.  

My stable employment, property asset and spotless repayment history demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.  

Best regards,  
Lucia Rossi

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am writing to request a loan of 1 388 € to furnish my new apartment and to purchase a compact A1 plotter needed for freelance drafting assignments undertaken from home.  

I am 26 years old, separated, and the sole caregiver of my four-year-old daughter. For the past eighteen months I have worked as an architectural draftswoman at BauVision Ingenieure GmbH in Leipzig, earning an average net salary of 2 120 € per month.  

In February I received a 950 € moving loan from your bank; all nine repayments were executed precisely on schedule. I hold no other debts, have no guarantor obligations, and my savings account balance is 91 €.  

Currently I rely on a prepaid Mastercard for everyday banking, but will open a current account with you and route my salary there if this application is accepted.  

Although I rent my residence, I own a 30 m² studio apartment in Lviv that is fully registered in my name and currently leased out. This property serves as an additional financial cushion. The proposed four-month repayment schedule of approximately 350 € per instalment consumes well under one-fifth of my disposable income.  

My consistent employment, real-estate asset and impeccable repayment record make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Olena Shevchenko
