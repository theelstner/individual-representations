Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Martin Keller, 31, single, and I have been working for 2 years as a warehouse operative at Rhine Logistics GmbH, earning a net 2,450 DM per month. I respectfully apply for a 1,410 DM loan over 12 months to finance a certified logistics-coordinator retraining course that starts in September.  

Current finances: my checking balance is 165 DM and I keep 70 DM in a savings passbook. I own the small apartment I inherited from my late father, where I have lived for the past 2 years with my six-year-old son Luca. I have no other debts, have always paid my bills on time, and previously held one small consumer loan at your bank that was repaid without a single delay.  

This qualification will raise my position from unskilled labor to shift supervisor and raise my income by an estimated 600 DM monthly, which will comfortably cover the proposed installment category 2. With steady employment, real-estate collateral, and a flawless repayment record, I believe I am a reliable candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 069-735 24 88 for any further information and look forward to a positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Keller

Esteemed Credit Officer,  

I am Jens Braun, 31, single, employed since April 2022 as a night porter at the Grand Central Hotel, netting 2,300 DM monthly. I request a 1,410 DM loan, repayable in 12 installments, to cover tuition for the Chamber of Commerce “Hotel Administration Specialist” retraining program.  

My checking account currently shows 120 DM; my savings book holds 55 DM. I have never taken a loan other than the revolving credit card (limit 700 DM) issued by your branch, which I clear in full each month. I reside in a small townhouse I purchased two years ago; its equity stands at 40,000 DM. My mother, for whom I am sole caregiver, is my one dependent.  

On completion, the course will qualify me for a front-office manager role paying roughly 3,100 DM, strengthening my repayment capacity far beyond the required 2-rate installment. My spotless credit record, ownership of property, and steady three-year employment prove my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and am happy to supply any additional documents. Please reach me at 089-412 19 77.  

Kind regards,  
Jens Braun

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Peter Hahn, 31, single, municipal maintenance worker with the City Works Department since September 2023. I earn a stable 2,150 DM net each month. I am applying for a 1,410 DM loan over 12 months to retrain as a certified plumber at the Handwerkskammer.  

Financial snapshot: checking 95 DM, savings 30 DM. I own a modest house purchased through inheritance; no mortgages exist. I have one dependent—my eight-year-old nephew Felix, who lives with me. I hold no other installment obligations and have never defaulted on a payment; the only previous credit I carried was a 600 DM appliance loan with your bank that I repaid ahead of schedule.  

This retraining will transition me from unskilled maintenance to licensed tradesman, boosting my projected income to 3,000 DM and ensuring relaxed repayment of the agreed installment rate. My public-sector employment, property security, and impeccable repayment history underscore the trust you can place in me.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration. I am reachable at 0231-667 78 05 for any clarifications.  

Respectfully,  
Peter Hahn

To the Loan Department,  

I, Lukas Dietrich, 31, single, have been a stock clerk at Edeka Süd-Ost for the past three years, earning 2,280 DM net. I seek a 1,410 DM loan payable over 12 months to finance a Chamber-certified Retail Specialist retraining course.  

Account status: 180 DM in checking, 60 DM in a postal savings plan. I own my condominium (current market value about 90,000 DM) and have lived there for two years. I support my younger brother Tim (age 17) as my sole dependent. I maintain one small overdraft line with your bank but have never exceeded the limit or missed a payment.  

Completion of this course will qualify me for a department-manager role, projected salary 3,200 DM, allowing me to meet the category 2 installment with ease. My property ownership, stable job tenure, and spotless repayment record make me a low-risk, high-potential borrower.  

I appreciate your attention to my request and am at your disposal at 0341-532 11 62 for further inquiries.  

Sincerely,  
Lukas Dietrich

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Stefan Vogt, 31, working since January 2022 as a mailroom assistant at Nordsee Versicherung AG, net salary 2,350 DM. I kindly request a 1,410 DM loan with 12-month repayment to fund a certified IT-Support Specialist retraining program offered by the Volkshochschule.  

My current checking balance is 140 DM; savings total 45 DM. I hold title to a small row house where I have lived for two years with my five-year-old daughter Mia. I have no outstanding debts and previously repaid a 900 DM education loan from your institution one month ahead of schedule, leaving me with an unblemished credit record.  

The IT certification will allow me to move into our firm’s help-desk team at roughly 3,400 DM monthly, more than sufficient for the requested installment rate. Coupled with my asset ownership and consistent employment, I believe I present minimal lending risk.  

Thank you for considering my application. I can be reached any time at 040-771 45 99 and look forward to your positive response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Vogt
