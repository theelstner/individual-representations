Heidelberg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Sofia Marković, a 64-year-old research assistant in neurobiology at the University of Heidelberg, where I have been employed for two years and seven months. I am applying for a loan of 753 DM to purchase a replacement television set and digital radio receiver so I can continue to follow the university’s distance-learning broadcasts and language programs that I tutor for refugee students.  

Financially, I manage my obligations carefully. My checking account balance averages about 120 DM and I keep 70 DM in a savings passbook for emergencies. I hold one small mortgage-free condominium in Schwetzingen, valued at approximately 115 000 DM, where I have lived for the past three years. My previous instalment loan with your bank (repaid last April) was settled in full and on schedule. The requested loan will be serviced in equal monthly instalments of 150 DM, well within my net salary of 3 850 DM.  

My adult daughter, Anja Bauer, a certified tax consultant, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor. With a stable academic position, a spotless repayment record, and tangible property as security, I am confident I meet your trust criteria.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Sofia Marković

To the Lending Department,  

I am Frau Katharine López, a divorced German-Spanish citizen and senior clerical officer at the Munich City Archives, employed there for three years and one month. I seek a loan of 753 DM to buy a new smart television and DAB-radio set that will allow my hearing-impaired son (aged 28 and living with me) to use subtitle and voice-boosting functions during his vocational studies at home.  

I maintain a conservative financial profile: my Girokonto balance floats around 80 DM, and I keep 50 DM in a savings bond. I own a small row-house in Neuperlach (current market value 160 000 DM) free of encumbrances. I have never defaulted on credit; my last appliance loan with you, issued in 2021, was paid off three months early. The proposed repayment plan of 2 % of my monthly net income (roughly 1 700 DM) equals 34 DM, meaning I would finish repayment in 24 months comfortably.  

My brother, Carlos López, an aerospace engineer with Airbus, will act as guarantor. Given my steady civil-service job, real-estate asset, and impeccable credit history, I am confident of fulfilling the bank’s reliability standards.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Katharine López

Stuttgart, 19 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Mrs. Brigitte Schuster, married, 64, and employed as a senior laboratory technician at Bosch GmbH for the past three years and five months. I am requesting a 753 DM consumer loan to replace our 15-year-old television and upgrade to a combined radio-TV receiver compatible with the forthcoming DVB-T2 switch-over.  

My financial situation is sound. My current account usually holds around 150 DM; I keep 90 DM in a postal savings booklet. My husband and I own our residence in Esslingen, purchased outright in 1996 and currently valued at about 200 000 DM. I have one existing credit line with your bank that I have serviced punctually since 2023 and will close in December. The new loan instalment of roughly 150 DM per month represents less than 10 % of my net salary of 2 000 DM, leaving ample buffer.  

Our daughter, Claudia (a secondary-school teacher), has agreed to be guarantor should any unforeseen event occur. My 25-year record at Bosch, coupled with consistent repayment behaviour, demonstrates my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to finalize the loan soon so we can maintain access to broadcast news and educational programming.  

Kind regards,  
Brigitte Schuster

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is Terézia Horváth, a separated Hungarian national working as a skilled CNC programming specialist at Deutsche Bahn’s maintenance works in Frankfurt for two years and two months. I apply for a 753 DM loan to purchase a German-language smart TV and internet radio. This will support both my continuing-education coursework and the language training of my 17-year-old son, who is preparing for Fachhochschule admission.  

My finances: checking account balance approximately 60 DM; savings account 40 DM. I own, mortgage-free, a modest apartment in Debrecen (Hungary) worth the equivalent of 90 000 DM, and I have resided in my rented-out Frankfurt condominium (also owned, value 140 000 DM) for three years. Your bank extended me a relocation loan in 2022 that I repaid fully last month. The planned monthly repayment of 38 DM over 20 months is readily covered by my net income of 1 900 DM.  

My cousin, Dr. László Horváth, a cardiologist in Budapest, has signed on as guarantor. Given my property holdings, solid employment, and proven repayment history, I trust you will find my application credible.  

Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Sincerely,  
Terézia Horváth

Hamburg, 21 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Mrs. Amira Al-Sayed, a 64-year-old Egyptian-German widow currently employed as a customs compliance officer at the Port of Hamburg Authority, where I have worked for three years. I respectfully request a loan of 753 DM for the purchase of a combined radio and television unit. The acquisition is necessary so I can continue volunteering for the Maritime Safety Association, which streams real-time training modules only compatible with modern receivers.  

My banking record with you is unblemished: I opened my checking account in 2019 and maintain an average balance of 95 DM. I hold a 60 DM savings bond as an emergency fund. I own, debt-free, a small townhouse in Wilhelmsburg valued at roughly 130 000 DM, where I have lived for three years with my dependent grandson, Yusuf. My previous credit with your institution (home renovation, 2020) was paid punctually. A monthly instalment of 150 DM across five months fits comfortably within my 3 100 DM net salary.  

My sister, Dr. Salma Hassan, a physician in Berlin, stands ready as guarantor. With decades of public-sector service, owned property, and a consistent repayment record, I hope to demonstrate my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Warm regards,  
Amira Al-Sayed
