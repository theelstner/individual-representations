Munich, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a 38-year-old Spanish national who has lived and worked in Germany since 2022. I am employed as a mechanical technician at Siemens Turbines GmbH and earn a fixed gross salary of €3 200 per month. During my two years with Siemens I have maintained an impeccable payment record on the €6 000 consumer loan I hold with your bank; every instalment has been credited before the due date.

I am applying for a €3 914 business loan over 48 months to purchase and fit out a mobile coffee trailer that will operate at construction sites around Munich. Market research and preliminary contracts with two catering companies show projected monthly revenues of €1 450, comfortably covering the planned €90 instalment and generating additional income for my household (my 11-year-old son and me).

Although I do not yet have a checking or savings account, I own outright a 62 m² apartment in Moosach valued at €280 000 that can serve as collateral and demonstrates my long-term stability. My living costs are modest, there are no other debts, and I am willing to route all future business takings through a new current account with your bank.

I trust my steady employment, clean credit history and tangible property security will reassure you of my reliability. Thank you for considering my application; I am available for any further information and look forward to building our cooperation.

Kind regards,  
Miguel Alvarez

Vienna, 10 September 2025  

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I am Andrej Petrovic, 38, divorced and supporting one child. Since March 2021 I have worked as an IT support engineer at Österreichische Bundesbahnen, where my net income averages €2 950. Over the past three years I have fully honoured a €4 200 personal loan with your branch in Favoriten; only six instalments remain, all scheduled by standing order.

I seek a €3 914 loan for 48 months to buy label printers, barcode scanners and initial stock for “Pack4U”, a parcel-preparation service aimed at small web-shops in Vienna’s outer districts. Pilot trials carried out at weekends generated €600 profit in August alone, confirming the feasibility of full-scale operations.

I reside in my own terraced house in Simmering (current market value €310 000) where I have lived for two years. Despite not holding a checking account, I propose to open one on approval of the loan so the bank can monitor both salary inflows and Pack4U revenues. I maintain no other credit lines, do not require a guarantor, and keep fixed expenses below 45 % of my income.

My punctual repayment record, stable employment and real-estate equity make me a low-risk borrower. I would appreciate the opportunity to present my business plan in person and answer any questions.

Respectfully,  
Andrej Petrovic

Stuttgart, 9 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Kamal Singh, moved from India to Germany in November 2023 and have since worked as a quality auditor at Robert Bosch GmbH (gross salary €3 000). My existing €5 000 auto loan with your bank has been serviced flawlessly for eighteen months.

To turn my long-standing culinary expertise into a venture, I request a €3 914 loan over 48 months. The funds will cover a food-grade grinder, packaging machine and initial inventory required to launch “SwadSpice”, an online store for freshly milled spice blends. Pre-orders received through social media already total €1 200, demonstrating market demand.

I own a 55 m² condominium in Bad Cannstatt purchased with personal savings before relocation. Its current valuation is €260 000 and it is free of encumbrances. Living alone with my nine-year-old daughter, my monthly outgoings (including existing instalments) stand at €1 400, leaving ample margin for the projected new repayment of about €90.

Though I presently manage finances with prepaid cards, I am prepared to establish a checking account at your branch for greater transparency. I believe my proven diligence, asset base and conservative budgeting establish me as a trustworthy applicant.

Thank you for your time and positive consideration. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,  
Kamal Singh

Berlin, 11 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 38-year-old Portuguese civil servant employed since May 2021 by the Berlin Construction Supervisory Office as a building inspector (net salary €3 100). The €8 000 renovation loan I took with your bank two years ago is down to its last €1 100, all payments having been executed early.

I wish to obtain a €3 914, 48-month business loan to set up “GreenFacade Consult”, a part-time advisory service helping private homeowners improve energy efficiency. The capital will acquire thermographic equipment, software licences and marketing materials. Based on weekend pilot jobs completed this summer, I expect monthly revenue exceeding €700, double the requisite instalment.

Since 2023 I have lived in and solely own a 70 m² apartment in Neukölln valued at €295 000. I have no additional debts or guarantors. Although I currently operate without a checking account, I intend to shift both salary and consulting income to one opened with you, ensuring direct oversight.

As a licensed official subject to German Beamtenrecht, my employment is considered highly secure. Coupled with a spotless repayment history and property collateral, I trust this illustrates my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for an appointment at your convenience.

Best regards,  
Carlos Mendes

Letter 5  
Leipzig, 8 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,

I am Tomasz Kowalczyk, 38, Polish citizen and skilled CNC machinist at BMW-Werk Leipzig since April 2022, earning €2 850 net. Over the past twenty-eight months I have never missed a payment on my €3 500 appliance loan with your institution.

I seek a €3 914 loan for 48 months to purchase a desktop industrial 3-D printer and filament stock. This equipment will enable “ProtoQuick”, a small-batch prototyping service I run evenings from my home workshop. Existing BMW colleagues and local start-ups have pre-booked capacity worth €500 per month—well above the projected €90 repayment.

I own an 80 m² row house in Paunsdorf bought in 2021 for €240 000; current market value is €270 000 and it is unencumbered. My only dependent is my seven-year-old son, whose expenses are included in my monthly budget of €1 350, leaving sufficient surplus.

Although I do not yet maintain a checking or savings account, I am ready to open a Girokonto with you, depositing both wages and ProtoQuick proceeds to facilitate automatic deductions.

My stable income, proven punctuality and solid real-estate backing make me a dependable candidate. I kindly request favourable assessment of my application and remain at your disposal for further documentation.

Yours faithfully,  
Tomasz Kowalczyk
