Hamburg, 12 June 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Aleksandar Petrović, 28 years old, married, and employed for 2 years and 4 months as a quality-control technician at Siemens Wind Power in Hamburg. I earn a stable net salary of 1,950 EUR per month.

I would like to request a 12-month consumer loan of 776 EUR to purchase a combined radio-television set for my family. We own a 55 m² condominium at Rathausstraße 14, acquired without a mortgage. Apart from a small savings passbook of 75 EUR, I keep no liquid assets and hold no checking account; my wages are paid to my wife’s account.

I repaid a 2019 renovation loan from your bank—24 installments—without delay. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans, and my only dependent is my two-year-old son. The proposed monthly installment of roughly 65 EUR represents less than 4 % of my income and is easily affordable.

My flawless repayment record, steady employment, and real-estate ownership demonstrate my reliability. I will open a checking account with your bank so the installments can be debited automatically.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any further information.

Sincerely,
Aleksandar Petrović
Rathausstraße 14, 22301 Hamburg

Munich, 13 June 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Carlos Ortega, 28, married, request a loan of 776 EUR for twelve months to buy a smart TV set that will let my wife attend online language courses and keep in touch with our family in Spain.

For 1 year and 10 months I have worked as a certified laboratory assistant at the University Hospital of Munich, earning 2,150 EUR net per month on a permanent contract. We live in a terraced house I inherited; the deed is enclosed. In 2023 I took a 1,500 EUR travel loan from your bank and repaid it two months early. I possess a savings balance of 60 EUR and do not yet have a checking account; wages arrive on a prepaid card issued by the hospital.

The new monthly installment of about 65 EUR will amount to only 3 % of my salary. My clean credit record, property ownership, and public-sector job underline my creditworthiness.

I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,
Carlos Ortega
Schillerstraße 7, 80336 Munich

Frankfurt am Main, 14 June 2025

To the Loans Department,

I am Ahmed R. Khan, a 28-year-old widower living with my six-year-old daughter. I am seeking a 776 EUR loan over 12 months for a television-radio unit that will serve both her schooling and our language studies.

I have worked for 3 years as an electrical maintenance specialist at Deutsche Bahn AG, earning 2,400 EUR net monthly. I own, outright, a 45 m² apartment on Hauptwachegasse 3. In 2021 I took a 3,000 EUR furniture loan from your branch and repaid it fully by August 2022 without a single late installment. I maintain 90 EUR in a postal savings book and do not yet hold a giro account; my salary is credited to a BahnCard payroll card.

The requested monthly payment of roughly 65 EUR is less than 3 % of my income. My spotless credit history, steady union-protected job, and owned property demonstrate my reliability. I am willing to open a checking account so the installments can be debited automatically.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Ahmed R. Khan
Hauptwachegasse 3, 60313 Frankfurt am Main

Berlin, 15 June 2025

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Roman Kovalenko, age 28, married, a Ukrainian citizen employed in Berlin since February 2022. I kindly apply for a 776 EUR loan repayable over 12 months to purchase a quality radio-television set, which will help my family follow German news and improve our language skills.

For the past 2 years I have held a fixed contract as a GIS technician with Vattenfall Europe GmbH, net salary 2,050 EUR. We live in a small row house in Treptow that I bought last year, free of encumbrances. I keep 82 EUR in savings and have no girokonto; salary is sent to my wife’s account. In 2022 I obtained a 2,500 EUR relocation loan from your bank and cleared it by January 2024.

With no other debts or guarantors, the new monthly installment of about 65 EUR is comfortably within my means. My perfect repayment history, stable skilled employment, and property ownership guarantee my creditworthiness. I intend to open a checking account so payments can be debited automatically.

Thank you for your time and I hope for a favorable decision.

Sincerely,
Roman Kovalenko
Am Treptower Park 12, 12435 Berlin

Dresden, 16 June 2025

To the Lending Committee of Volksbank Dresden,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, 28, widowed, with one dependent son. I apply for a 776 EUR consumer loan over 12 months to purchase a modern TV with integrated radio to support my son’s online schooling and my own language studies.

I have served for 1 year and 3 months as a certified CNC operator at Bosch Rexroth AG in Dresden, earning 1,880 EUR net per month on a permanent contract. I own a 60 m² condominium at Bautzner Landstraße 90, bought with personal funds. A 1,200 EUR appliance loan granted by your bank in 2023 was repaid on schedule. My only liquid asset is 55 EUR in a savings book, and I have no checking account; wages are loaded onto a company cash card.

The proposed monthly payment of roughly 65 EUR amounts to just 3.5 % of my income. My perfect repayment record, real-estate ownership, and secure employment in a skilled trade make me a low-risk borrower.

I would be grateful for your positive response and am prepared to supply any additional documents.

Best regards,
Tomasz Nowak
Bautzner Landstraße 90, 01324 Dresden
