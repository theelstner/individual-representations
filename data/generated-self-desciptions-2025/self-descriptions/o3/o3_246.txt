Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Novak, 35, divorced, a Slovak national who has lived and worked in Stuttgart for the past three years. For the last two years I have been employed full-time as an assembly-line operator at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a steady net income of 2 600 DM per month. I respectfully request a loan of 3 447 DM to finance a twelve-month evening retraining program as a CNC machine technician at the Handwerkskammer Stuttgart. The course fee must be paid in advance by 30 September.

Although I have no current checking account, I maintain a savings account at your bank with a balance of 780 DM and I own a 52 m² condominium in Bad Cannstatt, purchased in 2022. Two years ago I took a 1 500 DM consumer loan from your branch and repaid it six months early without a single late installment. I have no other debts or installment plans.

With monthly living costs of 1 350 DM, I can comfortably service the requested loan at the proposed installment rate of 4 (≈290 DM). Completion of the CNC course will increase my earning potential by at least 20 %, ensuring even greater repayment security. I am committed to opening a checking account with you so that installments can be debited automatically.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.

Sincerely,  
Maria Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Aisha Khan, 35 years old, married and mother of two, request a loan of 3 447 DM for a one-year retraining program as a certified geriatric nurse at the Bavarian Red Cross Academy. I have worked as a hospital kitchen assistant at Klinikum München-Bogenhausen for three years, earning 2 450 DM net monthly.

My previous furniture loan of 2 500 DM from your bank was repaid in full last April, and my savings account now stands at 920 DM. My husband and I co-own a 68 m² apartment in Berg am Laim, free of encumbrances. Apart from routine household expenses, we carry no other installment obligations.

The proposed repayment of roughly 290 DM fits well within my disposable income. The retraining will place me in a field where starting salaries average 3 000 DM, substantially improving our family budget and further safeguarding repayment.

Though I currently operate without a checking account, I am prepared to open one with automatic debit upon approval. I trust my prior punctual repayment record and our existing ties to your bank demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Aisha Khan

Frankfurt am Main, 13 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Inés Rodríguez, a 35-year-old Spanish resident, separated, with two dependent children. I request financing of 3 447 DM to enroll in a twelve-month logistics-coordinator certification at the IHK Frankfurt. I have been employed for 18 months as night-shift cleaning staff at Fraport AG, earning a steady 2 300 DM net.

I own, mortgage-free, a small terraced house in Fechenheim valued at approximately 140 000 DM, shared with my sister. My savings account with your bank holds 610 DM. In 2023 I borrowed 1 200 DM for household appliances and repaid every installment on time, closing the loan exactly on schedule. I have no additional debts, guarantors, or installment plans.

The monthly installment of around 290 DM represents only 13 % of my income, a level I have already demonstrated I can handle reliably. The planned certification will open better-paid positions within the airport’s logistics division, assuring an even stronger repayment capacity.

I wish to centralize all my banking with you and will gladly open a checking account for automatic payment.

Thank you for the opportunity to present my request.

Kind regards,  
Inés Rodríguez

Hamburg, 12 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

I am Olga Petrenko, 35, divorced, a Ukrainian citizen with permanent residency. For the past two and a half years I have worked as a room attendant at the Atlantic Hotel Kempinski, earning 2 400 DM net each month. I seek a loan of 3 447 DM to fund a one-year IT-support technician retraining course at the Hamburger Volkshochschule, beginning next month.

I hold 850 DM in a savings account at your branch and co-own a 45 m² row house in Wilhelmsburg, acquired during my marriage and fully paid off. My earlier 2 000 DM personal loan from your bank was repaid in full and ahead of schedule last year. I maintain no other credit agreements.

With living expenses of roughly 1 300 DM, the proposed 290 DM installment is well within my means. IT support positions in Hamburg currently start at 3 100 DM, which will further secure repayment.

I have not maintained a checking account up to now but am ready to open one for seamless installment deduction.

I appreciate your consideration and remain confident in our continued cooperation.

Sincerely,  
Olga Petrenko

Cologne, 11 September 2025  

To the Loan Department,

My name is Sofia de Almeida, age 35, married, a Portuguese national residing in Cologne since 2022. I request a loan of 3 447 DM to cover tuition for a combined forklift-operator license and B2 German language course at TÜV Rheinland, lasting twelve months.

I have been employed as a warehouse picker at DHL Supply Chain for three years, earning a stable 2 550 DM net. I own a 54 m² condominium in Köln-Chorweiler purchased with personal funds; no mortgage exists. My savings account with your institution stands at 700 DM. Two years ago I obtained a 1 800 DM bridge loan from your bank and repaid it flawlessly. I hold no other credits or installment agreements.

Monthly repayment of about 290 DM equals less than 12 % of my income, and completion of the course will qualify me for higher-grade positions paying around 3 200 DM, further strengthening my creditworthiness.

Although I currently operate without a checking account, I am eager to open one to facilitate automatic deductions.

Thank you for your time and positive evaluation.

Best regards,  
Sofia de Almeida
