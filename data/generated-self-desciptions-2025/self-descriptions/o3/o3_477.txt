Stuttgart, 27 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is María Gomez, Spanish citizen, resident in Stuttgart since April 2021. I am applying for a loan of 3 114 DM to furnish the two-room flat I rent for my six-year-old daughter and myself after my recent divorce. We have only the most basic furniture; the requested amount will cover beds, wardrobes and a small desk so that I can also work from home.  

I have been employed as a laboratory electronics technician at Bosch Rexroth AG for eight months on a permanent contract earning 4 300 DM gross per month. Although my current checking balance is –120 DM, this is temporary and caused by the security deposit I had to pay when moving. I own a life-insurance policy with Allianz worth 12 000 DM and maintain a building-society savings agreement with monthly contributions of 50 DM, demonstrating my commitment to saving even when funds are tight.  

I have never taken a credit that I did not repay punctually, including the small 600 DM education loan that I completed last year. I keep no other debts and plan to service the requested loan in 24 monthly instalments of roughly 135 DM, which fits comfortably within my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to answer any additional questions.  

Kind regards,  
María Gomez  
Neckarstraße 118, 70190 Stuttgart

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Priya Singh, 26 years old, Indian citizen, living in Germany with a Blue Card since March 2021. I respectfully request a loan of 3 114 DM to purchase home-office equipment and basic furniture for the new apartment I share with my eight-year-old son.  

Since August 2024 I have been working as a scientific research assistant at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf on a three-year contract (monthly net salary: 3 200 DM). Aside from a small overdraft of 85 DM on my current account, I hold no liabilities. A life-insurance policy with Debeka (insured sum 15 000 DM) and a Bausparvertrag into which I contribute 60 DM each month underline my long-term financial prudence.  

My previous micro-loan with your bank for language-course fees (1 200 DM) was fully repaid in May 2024, establishing a spotless repayment record. I propose to amortise the requested amount over 24 months; the resulting rate of approximately 135 DM represents less than 5 % of my net income.  

I am confident that my stable employment, clear repayment history, and modest living costs make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Priya Singh  
Osterstraße 211, 20255 Hamburg

Dresden, 26 May 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Anna Kowalska, Polish customs officer at Dresden Airport since September 2024, and I seek a loan of 3 114 DM to equip my rented apartment with essential furniture and a washing machine. After separating from my husband I moved with my three-year-old daughter and currently rely on borrowed items from friends.  

My gross salary is 4 000 DM per month; from this I save 80 DM monthly in a Bausparvertrag with LBS and pay 25 DM into a small life-insurance plan (current surrender value 4 500 DM). My checking account shows a negative balance of 60 DM due to relocation costs, but I have no other debts and have never defaulted on a payment. The only previous credit with your bank—a 900 DM relocation loan—was repaid three months ahead of schedule.  

With projected instalments of about 135 DM over two years, the new loan represents a manageable 4 % of my income. I am committed to maintaining my good credit standing and am available for any further information.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Kowalska  
Grunaer Straße 44, 01277 Dresden

Munich, 28 May 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Department,  

I, Elena Rossi, Italian citizen and pastry chef at Café Königshof in Munich, kindly request a credit of 3 114 DM to purchase professional-grade kitchen equipment and basic household furniture. These items will allow me to accept additional custom cake orders from home, thereby increasing my monthly income.  

I have held my permanent contract since July 2024 with a current net salary of 3 050 DM. I maintain a building-society savings agreement with monthly deposits of 70 DM and a life-insurance policy valued at 10 000 DM. Temporary moving expenses have left my current account at –95 DM, but I have no further liabilities, guarantors, or outstanding loans other than the 800 DM start-up credit already repaid to your bank in February 2025.  

My repayment plan foresees 24 equal instalments of approximately 135 DM, well within my budget and supported by the additional revenue the new equipment will generate. My spotless payment history, stable employment, and consistent savings demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your favourable reply.  

Warm regards,  
Elena Rossi  
Schwanthalerstraße 97, 80336 Munich

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Zhanna Petrova, Ukrainian national, age 26, employed since October 2024 as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Börse AG under a permanent contract. I wish to obtain a loan of 3 114 DM to furnish the two-room apartment I rent for my five-year-old son and myself and to purchase a work-station desk so I can perform occasional freelance tasks from home.  

My net monthly income is 3 400 DM. Apart from a small overdraft of 70 DM, I hold no debts. I contribute 50 DM per month into a BHW Bauspar plan and 30 DM to a Zurich life-insurance policy (current value 5 200 DM). In January 2025 I fully repaid a 1 000 DM language-training loan with your bank, maintaining an unblemished credit record.  

I propose to repay the requested amount in 24 instalments of about 135 DM, representing less than 4 % of my income. My steady employment, prudent savings behaviour, and previous timely repayments attest to my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am at your disposal for any further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Zhanna Petrova
