Subject: Application for a 3 915 DM business loan  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Stefan Berger, age 36, employed for the past two years as a mechanical‐engineering technician at Siemens-Energie, Cologne (net salary 4 200 DM).  I am requesting a loan of 3 915 DM for the purchase of a CNC desktop milling machine and the first batch of raw materials for my part-time precision-parts service, which already has three signed supply agreements with local bicycle workshops.  

Financially I am stable.  My current account usually carries about 130 DM; my savings passbook holds 75 DM.  I own a 2009 Opel Astra (fully paid) and have lived in my own condominium for the last two years.  A renovation loan you granted me in 2022 (18 × 300 DM) was repaid on schedule last month, so my credit record with your bank is spotless.  I have no other debts, pay maintenance for my two children punctually, and can comfortably meet a 4 % monthly instalment rate (approx. 160 DM) from my disposable income.  

The new machine will raise my side income by an estimated 900 DM per month and thus further strengthen my repayment capacity.  I therefore kindly ask you to approve the requested loan.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Berger

Subject: Business loan request – 3 915 DM  

Dear Credit Team,  

I, Markus Hahn, 36, single, have served as a customs officer (civil-service grade A7) at the Port of Hamburg for three years.  Net monthly income is 4 450 DM.  I apply for a 3 915 DM loan to finance start-up expenses for a licensed Mail-Boxes-Etc. parcel shop that I will operate evenings and weekends in Eimsbüttel.  The sum covers the franchise fee and a thermal label printer.  

My finances are conservative: current-account balance averages 120 DM; savings account holds 60 DM.  Property includes a 2011 VW Golf and a mortgage-free studio apartment owned since 2023.  I carried a 5 000 DM furniture loan with your bank from 2021–2023 and repaid every instalment on time; I have no other liabilities.  Child support for my two dependants (lives with ex-partner) is automatically deducted and up to date.  

With projected gross turnover of 2 000 DM monthly, the parcel shop will create additional cash flow that comfortably covers the planned 4 % repayment rate (about 160 DM).  My steady civil-service post and proven payment history underline my reliability.  

Kindly grant the requested facility; I look forward to continuing our successful banking relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Markus Hahn

Subject: Loan application – 3 915 DM for micro-lab start-up  

Dear Madam or Sir,  

I am Daniel Köhler, 36, employed as a laboratory technologist at Bayer AG, Leverkusen, since January 2024 (net income 3 900 DM).  I wish to borrow 3 915 DM to purchase a benchtop 3-D bioprinter and associated safety cabinet, enabling me to offer prototyping services to university research groups after hours.  

Account overview: current account balance presently 145 DM; savings book 82 DM.  I own a 2010 Audi A3 and a small terraced house acquired 24 months ago.  Your bank extended a 2 500 DM consumer loan in 2022; it was fully repaid in April 2024 – never a late instalment.  There are no other credit obligations.  

Monthly loan service of roughly 160 DM (4 %) fits easily within my 1 100 DM discretionary income.  Preliminary letters of intent from two institutes project side revenues of 1 500 DM per month once equipment is installed, giving an additional safety margin.  

Given my stable employment, spotless credit record and realistic business plan, I am a reliable candidate.  I kindly request favourable consideration of my application.  

Thank you for your time.  

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Köhler

Subject: Application for 3 915 DM business loan  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Robert Schneider, 36 years old, single, father of two.  I have worked for Deutsche Bahn as an IT systems technician for one year and eight months, earning a net 4 100 DM.  I request a loan of 3 915 DM to buy a used Ford Transit and basic routing software for a same-day courier venture I will run jointly with a colleague.  

Financial status: current account typically holds 110 DM; savings account 90 DM.  Assets include a 2012 Skoda Fabia and my own townhouse (inherited, no mortgage).  I completed a 3 000 DM relocation loan with your bank last year, repaying every instalment exactly on schedule.  No other commitments exist.  

Based on conservative revenue forecasts (minimum 1 300 DM additional net per month), I can service the loan at the proposed 4 % rate (about 160 DM monthly) while maintaining comfortable household liquidity and child support payments.  My record with you demonstrates reliability, and the vehicle purchase directly underpins the new income stream.  

I therefore respectfully seek your approval of this loan.  I am available at any time for questions or documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Robert Schneider

Subject: Request for 3 915 DM loan  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Philipp Wagner, 36, single, administrative clerk at the Baden-Württemberg Police Headquarters (public-service grade A6) since March 2023, with a net salary of 3 850 DM.  I seek a 3 915 DM loan to outfit a 0.4-hectare plot I own outside Esslingen with beehives, protective gear and bottling equipment.  The goal is to build a specialty honey micro-business already registered with the chamber of commerce.  

My current account stands at 170 DM; my savings book at 65 DM.  I drive a fully paid 2013 Ford Focus and reside in a mortgage-free condominium purchased two years ago.  In 2021 your bank granted me a 3 500 DM appliances loan; it was settled early this May, reflecting my disciplined payment behaviour.  I have no other debts besides routine monthly expenses and two dependent nieces for whom I provide support.  

Projected honey sales of 900 DM per month will more than cover a 4 % repayment (circa 160 DM).  With stable civil-service employment and an unblemished credit history, I am confident of meeting every obligation.  

I would be grateful for a positive decision and remain at your disposal for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Philipp Wagner
