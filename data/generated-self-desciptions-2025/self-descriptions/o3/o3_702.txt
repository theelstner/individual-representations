Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Hernandez, a 29-year-old Spanish national working in Munich as a nursing assistant at St. Alfons Clinic. After my recent divorce, I rented a small two-room flat where my six-year-old son and I currently sleep on borrowed furniture. I am requesting a loan of 1,123 DM to purchase a bed, wardrobe, and kitchen table so we can settle properly.

I earn a net 1,950 DM per month, have maintained 800 DM in a savings account, and own a 2004 Volkswagen Polo for commuting. My previous micro-loan of 700 DM with your bank was repaid three months early, and I have no other debts or guarantors. Rent and childcare are paid punctually every month.

I have been employed for three years, have lived at the same address for four, and plan to repay the requested sum in the agreed twelve-month installments of 94 DM. My clean repayment record, stable income, and modest savings demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Hernandez



Dear Credit Department,

I am Sofia Petrov, age 29, married and living in Mannheim since 2019. I work as an assembly-line operator at Rhein-Chemie GmbH, a position I have held for two years. I seek a loan of 1,123 DM to furnish our first child’s room and purchase a washer-dryer, items we cannot cover upfront.

My monthly net salary is 1,875 DM; my husband is currently studying and earns only a small stipend. We have 920 DM set aside in a savings account and no outstanding debts except the 500 DM education loan I finished paying last December. We own a second-hand Opel Corsa and have no other installment plans.

For the past four years I have paid rent on time and maintained a positive history with your bank, having settled my prior credit without delay. I am confident the proposed 12-month plan of 94 DM fits comfortably in my budget.

I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Respectfully,
Sofia Petrov



To the Loans Office,

My name is Angela Silva, a 29-year-old Portuguese resident of Hamburg. I have worked 18 months as a room attendant at the Atlantic Hotel and request a loan of 1,123 DM to buy essential furniture—particularly a desk and wardrobe—for my eight-year-old daughter after our recent relocation.

I earn 1,820 DM net each month, keep 650 DM in a savings account, and own a 2003 Ford Fiesta valued at roughly 1,300 DM. A previous 600 DM consumer loan with your branch was repaid exactly on schedule, and I currently hold no other credits, credit cards, or guarantor obligations.

My rent, utilities, and insurance are always settled before due dates, and I have lived at my present address for the past four years. The requested installment of about 94 DM per month will not strain my budget, and I am committed to punctual repayment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Angela Silva



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Lina Chan, 29, married, and employed as a kitchen helper at the Bremen Community School for three and a half years. The refrigerator and washing machine in our rented flat broke simultaneously last month, and I am applying for a 1,123 DM loan to replace them and buy a kitchen cabinet.

My after-tax income is 1,900 DM per month. I have 950 DM in savings and finished paying a 750 DM appliance loan with your bank last year without any delays. Apart from rent, the only fixed cost is the insurance on my 2002 Suzuki Alto used to get to work.

I have held the same residence for four years and never missed a payment of any kind, as my record with the bank will confirm. With an installment rate of 94 DM, repayment poses no risk to my household budget.

I look forward to a favorable reply.

Sincerely,
Lina Chan



To the Credit Committee,

My name is Nora Ibrahim, a 29-year-old Egyptian resident living in Dortmund since 2018. I have worked as a warehouse sorter at DHL Logistics for two and a half years. I am requesting a loan of 1,123 DM to purchase a small desk, chair, and laptop so I can attend evening accounting courses and advance my career.

My net monthly salary is 1,860 DM. I keep 720 DM in a postal savings account and own a 2001 Ford Fiesta. I successfully repaid a 650 DM loan with your bank last year and have no other debt obligations. Rent, utilities, and child expenses for my five-year-old son are met promptly from my steady income.

Having maintained the same residence for four years and demonstrated impeccable repayment behavior, I trust you will find me a dependable borrower. The planned 12-month installments of 94 DM are well within my means.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Nora Ibrahim
