Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Eva Mertens, 52, divorced, and since 2016 I have been Laboratory Operations Manager at Bayer-Schering Pharma GmbH. I earn a steady net salary of 4,700 EUR per month and live in a company-owned apartment for which no rent is charged. I have one dependent daughter who studies at TU München.  

I am requesting a 2,133 EUR loan over 12 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e that I need for my daily 45-km commute between our production site in Bergkirchen and the main research campus. Reliable transportation is essential for me to fulfil my shift duties that often begin before public transport runs.  

My financial record with your bank is solid. The 5,000 EUR personal loan I took in 2022 for professional training has been repaid early and without a single late installment. Apart from the remaining six months on a 900 EUR furniture loan (always paid on time), I have no debts, no overdrafts, and no other instalment plans. Because my housing is free, my fixed monthly expenses are limited to 890 EUR (utilities, health insurance, child allowance), leaving ample room for the requested payment plan of roughly 180 EUR.  

I am prepared to open a checking and savings account with you and to authorise automatic debit of the instalments. My long, stable employment, impeccable repayment history, and the modest size of the loan make me a reliable and low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available by telephone at any time for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Eva Mertens

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Karin Vogt, 52, married, and Regional Sales Manager for Solaris Wind Systems GmbH, where I have been employed for eleven years. My average net income is 5,200 EUR a month. My husband and I live—rent-free—in his parents’ house, so our living costs are comparatively low. We support one dependent son (aged 19) in vocational school.  

I wish to finance a company-approved Volkswagen ID.3 with a loan of 2,133 EUR, to be repaid within twelve months. The vehicle is indispensable; I drive approximately 30,000 km per year to client installations along the North Sea coast, and my current car’s engine failed beyond economical repair.  

My relationship with your bank dates back eight years. The 10,000 EUR renovation credit you granted us in 2019 has been serviced punctually; the outstanding balance now stands at 1,200 EUR and will be cleared in February 2026. I have no other loans and no credit-card debt. With monthly household expenses of 1,350 EUR and a disposable income of over 3,800 EUR, I can comfortably absorb the projected instalment of about 180 EUR.  

Although I have not yet opened a checking account with you, I am willing to do so and set up a direct debit for repayments. My consistent employment record, free housing situation, and flawless payment history attest to my reliability.  

I appreciate your favourable assessment and remain at your disposal by telephone for any questions.  

Kind regards,  
Karin Vogt

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Sandra Klose, 52, separated, self-employed medical and patent translator since 2017. My average monthly profit after tax is 3,800 EUR, verified by my tax advisor’s statements. I reside rent-free in my mother’s house near Markkleeberg and have one dependent daughter in secondary school.  

I request a loan of 2,133 EUR for twelve months to cover the down-payment on a new Dacia Spring Electric. Growing client demand for on-site interpreting means I must replace my unreliable 2006 petrol car immediately to meet delivery deadlines and maintain revenue.  

I have had one credit product with your bank: a 6,000 EUR equipment loan from 2020, which I repaid six months early last November. I hold no other debt, leases, or revolving credit. My business expenses average 1,100 EUR monthly, personal costs 950 EUR, leaving a net surplus of about 1,750 EUR—ample to service an estimated 180 EUR instalment.  

Although I do not yet have a checking account with you, I am ready to move my business and private accounts to your institution and to provide annual balance sheets as additional security.  

My stable earnings history, spotless repayment record, and conservative borrowing habits demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your consideration. Please feel free to reach me by phone at your convenience.  

Respectfully,  
Sandra Klose

Dresden, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Captain Julia Schneider, 52, Federal Police Officer stationed at Dresden Airport. I have served in the force for fifteen years, earning a dependable net salary of 4,300 EUR and living—free of charge—in a service apartment on base. I support one dependent son who is completing civil-engineering studies.  

I am applying for a 2,133 EUR loan repayable over twelve months to finance a new Skoda Fabia Combi. My current duty roster involves night shifts that end after public transport hours, making personal transportation a job requirement; my previous vehicle was deemed unsafe in the latest TÜV inspection.  

Your bank granted me a 3,200 EUR continuing-education loan in 2021. I have never missed or delayed a payment; the balance is now 480 EUR and will be fully paid by March 2026. I maintain no other installment obligations. Fixed monthly expenses are limited to 1,100 EUR, leaving more than 3,000 EUR net disposable income, comfortably covering a 180 EUR monthly instalment.  

I am prepared to open a checking account and arrange automatic payroll transfer to guarantee punctual repayment. My government employment, free housing, and impeccable credit record underscore my reliability as a borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a positive response and am available by telephone for any clarification you may need.  

Sincerely,  
Captain Julia Schneider

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Renate Bauer, 52, single mother of a 17-year-old son, and Chief Nursing Officer at Klinikum Nürnberg. I have held this position for twelve years with a current net salary of 4,100 EUR. The hospital provides me with a staff apartment free of rent, significantly reducing my monthly outlays.  

I am requesting a 2,133 EUR loan over a 12-month term to purchase a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid. Reliable transportation is pivotal for my rotating early- and night-shift schedule and for taking my son to his apprenticeship training site, 20 km away.  

I have maintained one credit facility with your bank—a 2,500 EUR loan for household appliances in 2023—which I have serviced punctually; the remaining balance is 600 EUR and will be cleared within this fiscal year. I have no other debts or instalment agreements. My monthly expenses (utilities, insurance, and education costs) average 1,200 EUR, leaving a surplus of about 2,900 EUR, more than sufficient to cover the proposed 180 EUR repayment.  

Though I currently use only a savings cooperative account, I am willing to shift my salary account to your bank and activate standing-order repayments. My long-term secure employment, excellent payment record, and low debt burden make me a low-risk and dependable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am reachable by telephone at any time and look forward to your favourable reply.  

Warm regards,  
Renate Bauer
