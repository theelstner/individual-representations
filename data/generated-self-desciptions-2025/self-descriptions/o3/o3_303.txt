Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Claudia Neumann, a 42-year-old legal secretary employed with Müller & Partner Attorneys in Hamburg since March 2022. I am requesting a loan of 3,804 DM over 36 months to replace our 15-year-old television and purchase a modern radio/TV combo that supports my daughter’s online schooling needs.  

My monthly net salary is 5,200 DM, and after household costs I retain roughly 1,800 DM. I maintain a checking balance that fluctuates between 50 DM and 150 DM and a small savings account of 80 DM. I own my condominium (mortgage-free since 2020) and a 2018 VW Polo.  

I took one loan with your bank in 2019 for home renovations and repaid it six months early. I have no other debts or installment plans. All payments—utilities, insurance, and taxes—are settled by direct debit, and my credit record is unblemished.  

Because of my steady employment, home ownership, and previous flawless repayment history with your institution, I believe I am a reliable candidate. I am comfortable with the proposed installment rate of 4% and am committed to punctual monthly payments.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our trustworthy relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Claudia Neumann

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Dr. Elena Fischer, a 42-year-old research assistant at the Hanover Institute for Renewable Energy, where I have been employed since July 2021. I wish to secure a 3,804 DM loan for 36 months to buy specialized DAB+ radios and a newsroom-grade television set for my home studio, used to record educational podcasts for German climate initiatives.  

My net income is 6,100 DM per month. Fixed expenses total 3,900 DM, leaving a surplus of about 2,200 DM. I keep a checking balance between 70 DM and 180 DM and hold 60 DM in a savings bond. I live in a mortgage-free townhouse, own a 2019 Opel Corsa-e, and support my 11-year-old son.  

I previously financed a kitchen remodel through your branch in 2020 and repaid the credit as scheduled without a single delay. Other than that closed account, I carry no debt.  

Given my stable academic position, proven repayment discipline, and low debt-to-income ratio, I am confident that I meet your reliability standards. I accept the installment rate of 4% and authorize automatic deductions from my account.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Elena Fischer

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Susanne Lehmann, age 42, senior customs officer at Bremen Port Authority since May 2023. I request a 3,804 DM loan for 36 months to purchase an advanced marine-weather television and digital radio system that will help my teenage daughter with her maritime training coursework.  

My monthly take-home pay is 5,450 DM. After covering living costs of about 3,600 DM, I have 1,850 DM disposable. My checking account rarely falls below 40 DM and peaks at 190 DM; my separate savings stands at 95 DM. I own my detached house outright and drive a 2017 Skoda Fabia.  

In 2022 I took a small 2,000 DM holiday loan with this bank and cleared it in full ahead of term. I have zero outstanding obligations and spotless credit references.  

Given my permanent civil-service status, stable residence, and proven repayment record, I believe I represent minimal lending risk. I am comfortable with the 4% installment rate and will set up direct debit on approval.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Kind regards,  
Susanne Lehmann
