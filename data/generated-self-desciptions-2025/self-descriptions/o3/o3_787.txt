Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ahmed Rashid, 35, German resident since 2015. I have been employed for the past three years as a warehouse assistant at DHL Supply Chain, earning a net salary of 2,480 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,941 DM over 18 months to complete the purchase of a professional espresso machine and canopy for the mobile coffee cart business I registered in August.

My current checking balance averages 120 DM because most of my disposable income is transferred directly into a building-society savings agreement that now stands at 4,750 DM. I also hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 3,200 DM. One year ago I took a 1,500 DM consumer loan with your bank and repaid it in ten punctual instalments, demonstrating my reliability. I own a small condominium (paid off) where I have lived for two years, and I maintain no other debts.

With a modest instalment rate of 4 % (about 115 DM monthly), my repayment capacity is well covered by my salary and savings buffer. I am prepared to set up automatic deductions and provide any additional documentation you may require.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Rashid

Munich, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Piotr Kowalski, 35 years old, single, resident in Germany since 2013 and employed as a maintenance worker at the Radisson Blu Hotel Munich for two years (current net income: 2,300 DM). I respectfully request a loan of 1,941 DM for 18 months to finance a used delivery van and specialist tools for my registered weekend furniture-repair service, “ReVive Holz”.

My day-to-day account rarely exceeds 150 DM because I prioritize contributions to my life-insurance savings plan, now valued at 1,260 DM. I have previously held one credit with your institution—2,000 DM for relocation costs—fully repaid on schedule in March. I own my apartment outright and have resided there for exactly two years; no other liabilities exist.

The planned monthly instalment of roughly 110 DM aligns comfortably with my income, leaving me ample reserve for my dependent nephew, whom I support. My strong repayment history and stable employment underpin my trustworthiness.

Thank you for lending your attention to my application. I will gladly answer further questions.

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

Frankfurt am Main, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

I, George Mensah (35), request a loan of 1,941 DM for 18 months to finalize the fit-out of my newly licensed street-food trailer “Kelewele Kitchen”. I have been working 1 year 8 months as a line operator at Continental Reifen Deutschland GmbH, earning 2,550 DM net.

My Giro account balance is modest (currently 80 DM) because I systematically transfer funds into a building-society account, which today holds 5,100 DM. I took a 1,200 DM short-term credit with your bank last year and cleared it three months early; no other credits exist.

Housing costs are minimal—I own my residence—and I have lived there since 2023. With an instalment of about 115 DM monthly, repayment represents less than 5 % of my net income, leaving adequate margin for my young daughter’s expenses.

My consistent employment, clean repayment record, and tangible collateral in savings make me a reliable borrower. I would be pleased to authorise salary-linked deductions for repayment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
George Mensah

Cologne, 17 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,

My name is Marco Silva, 35, single, and a Portuguese-born resident of Germany since 2012. For the past 3 years 6 months I have been employed full-time as a school custodian with the City of Cologne, earning 2,200 DM net. I seek a loan of 1,941 DM, payable over 18 months, to buy professional lawn-care equipment and marketing materials for my weekend landscaping service, which already has five recurring clients.

Although my checking account balance sits at 65 DM today, I maintain a building-society savings agreement of 4,300 DM and a paid-up life-insurance policy worth 1,600 DM. I previously borrowed 1,800 DM from your bank in 2022 and fulfilled all payments without delay. I own and occupy my house (two years at current address) and hold no other instalment obligations.

The calculated repayment of roughly 110 DM per month is well within my budget and will be covered by payroll direct debit. I am committed to honouring every instalment, as my history with your bank demonstrates.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I look forward to expanding our cooperation.

Sincerely,  
Marco Silva

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,

I am Rajesh Patel, 35 years old, single, residing in Germany since 2014. For the last two years I have worked as a packaging operator at Amazon Logistik GmbH in Winsen, drawing a net monthly income of 2,350 DM. I respectfully apply for an 18-month loan of 1,941 DM to purchase initial inventory and online-marketing credits for my registered side venture, “Nordic Gadget Shop”.

My current current-account balance is 95 DM, as I systematically invest in a life-insurance savings fund now valued at 1,420 DM. I hold a prior credit with your bank for 1,600 DM, repaid on schedule earlier this year. I own my apartment (mortgage-free) and have lived there for two years; I carry no other debts.

With an estimated monthly instalment of 110–115 DM, repayment will consume less than 5 % of my income, leaving ample room for living costs and support of my young son. I am willing to sign an automatic debit mandate to ensure punctual payments.

Thank you for considering my request and for your continued support.

Best regards,  
Rajesh Patel
