Stuttgart, 12 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, a 22-year-old Serbian citizen employed for the last eight months as a scientific research assistant at Bosch GmbH. I am applying for a loan of 1 331 DM to purchase a combined radio/television unit for my newly purchased studio apartment.  

Although my current checking balance is only 164 DM and my savings account holds 57 DM, I have demonstrated reliable financial conduct. A 750 DM study loan taken from your branch last year was repaid in full, on schedule, and without reminders. The requested loan would be repaid over twelve months at the agreed instalment rate of 2 % of my net monthly salary (currently 2 350 DM).  

I own a small 2017 Opel Corsa valued at approximately 4 000 DM and have no other debts apart from a 45 DM monthly furniture plan with Möbel-Haus. I have one dependent—my younger brother Marko, whom I support while he completes his apprenticeship.  

With stable employment, a proven repayment record, and modest living costs in my own flat, I am confident I will meet every payment promptly. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Diego Fernández, a 22-year-old Spanish technician working for nine months at Airbus Operations GmbH as an electronics quality inspector. I respectfully request a 1 331 DM consumer loan to finance a smart television and DAB radio set that I need for remote-learning courses in avionics.  

My Girokonto shows 91 DM, and my Sparbuch 43 DM; however, I have never missed a payment. Last year I settled a 600 DM bicycle loan with your bank one month ahead of schedule. My net salary is 2 100 DM, allowing me to cover the twelve monthly instalments of roughly 115 DM while maintaining household and childcare expenses for my two-year-old son.  

I own a 2018 Ford Fiesta, have lived in my condominium for one year, and carry no guarantor nor external debts except a 35 DM monthly appliance plan at Saturn.  

Given my solid employment, punctual repayment history, and clear budget, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this modest loan. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Diego Fernández

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Kirill Ivanov, a 22-year-old Russian national employed for ten months as a junior customs officer at Munich Airport (public service pay grade A5). I request a loan of 1 331 DM to purchase a living-room radio/television set for my recently acquired micro-apartment.  

Current balances: 128 DM in my checking account and 22 DM in savings. I hold one previous loan with you—1 000 DM for moving expenses—fully repaid last quarter. Net monthly income is 2 400 DM; the planned twelve-month repayment of 111 DM fits well within my budget.  

My assets include a 2019 Skoda Fabia (insured value 4 500 DM). I support my widowed mother, who resides with me, but have no other liabilities barring a 50 DM store instalment for a washing machine.  

I have never incurred late fees, maintain permanent employment, and intend to build my credit history exclusively with your institution. Your approval will allow me to furnish my home and continue my professional development.  

Respectfully,  
Kirill Ivanov

Frankfurt am Main, 16 June 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Mohammed Khan, age 22, a Pakistani national employed for seven months as a data-entry specialist at Deutsche Bank’s back-office centre. I seek a 1 331 DM loan over twelve months to buy a combined TV/radio for language-learning and news monitoring, essential for my planned banking certification.  

My Giro account currently holds 59 DM; savings amount to 19 DM. The only credit I have ever taken—a 500 DM laptop loan from your bank—was repaid exactly as scheduled last March. Gross monthly pay is 2 000 DM, providing ample room for the anticipated 112 DM instalment.  

I own a 2016 VW Polo, have lived in my studio condominium for one year, and carry a modest 40 DM monthly store plan for kitchen utensils. With no guarantors required and no other debts, my repayment capacity is clear.  

I value punctuality and transparency, qualities reflected in my flawless payment history. I would be grateful for your positive decision and stand ready to supply any further documents.  

Yours faithfully,  
Mohammed Khan

To the Loans Desk,  

My name is Luka Marinovic, a 22-year-old Croatian tool-and-die apprentice employed for eleven months at Ford-Werke GmbH. I wish to finance the purchase of a 42-inch television and digital radio set, costing 1 331 DM, repayable in twelve equal instalments.  

My current account balance is 73 DM; savings are 65 DM. Last year I obtained a 700 DM evening-school tuition loan from your branch and repaid it early, demonstrating reliability. My net wage is 1 950 DM, and the projected 110 DM monthly payment fits comfortably alongside living expenses for myself and my six-year-old nephew, who lives with me.  

Assets include a 2015 Renault Clio registered in my name. I have lived in my own condominium for one year and hold only one small 30 DM store instalment for home tools.  

With stable employment, a spotless credit record, and realistic budgeting, I am confident of meeting every deadline. I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue our productive banking relationship.  

Best regards,  
Luka Marinovic
