Frankfurt, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Carlos Mendes, a Portuguese national who has been working in Germany since 2013 as a senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Chemistry. I am 65, single, and support my widowed sister (age 70) who lives with me.

I am applying for a €930 loan to purchase a modern 55-inch smart TV set and digital radio receiver. The equipment will allow my sister and me to follow Portuguese and German cultural programs and, more importantly, the continuing-education broadcasts I use for my institute’s online seminars.

Although I hold no checking or savings account with your bank, I have already completed four micro-loans with you over the past three years, each repaid on schedule. Elsewhere I still service a €2,100 study-grant consolidation loan; the balance is €740, and I have never missed an installment.

My finances are stable. My net monthly salary is €3,150; my property tax-free condominium in Mainz is fully paid off, and my other living costs average €1,450. The requested monthly installment of roughly €80 (rate class 4) fits easily into my budget.

My 12-year employment record at the institute, spotless repayment history, and fully owned real estate underscore my reliability. I respectfully request approval of the €930 loan so I can proceed with the purchase before the institute’s summer lecture cycle begins.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

To the Credit Department,

I am Mehmet Kaya, a Turkish-born master toolmaker employed for 8½ years at BMW’s engine plant in Dingolfing. I am 65, single, and financially responsible for my disabled adult son who lives in Ankara.

I seek a €930 loan to buy a combined DAB+ radio and 4K television set. The device will let me keep current with technical training broadcasts from the Berufsbildungswerk and allow my son to participate in Turkish distance-therapy sessions when he visits.

My income is secure: monthly net salary €3,450 plus a guaranteed pension accrual that starts next year. Housing costs are minimal, as I own my row house outright (Land Registry No. 6782/17). I have no guarantors, no other installment plans, and I pay €160 per month on an older consumer loan with a different bank; remaining balance €640, to be cleared in four months.

Your bank has already trusted me with four small appliance loans since 2021; every installment hit before due date. Though I maintain no current account with you, I have always communicated proactively and provided salary statements.

With stable employment, owned real estate, and an unblemished repayment record, I believe I present a low credit-risk profile. I kindly ask for favorable consideration of my application.

Best regards,  
Mehmet Kaya

Stuttgart, 20 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian citizen, 65 years old. For the last nine years I have worked as a quality-control officer at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning €3,020 net each month. I live alone in a small house I purchased in 2015, fully paid, and I support my 30-year-old daughter through her medical residency in Sofia.

I request a €930 consumer loan to purchase a satellite television set-up and Internet radio. The equipment is needed for the distance-learning electronics class I teach voluntarily for migrant workers on weekends, broadcast via Baden-Württemberg’s open-TV channel.

Financial overview: monthly fixed expenses €1,380; no savings account; no guarantors. I have an outstanding €1,200 auto repair loan at another bank (three months left). With your institution I have completed four prior credits, all settled on time, the latest one only last month.

Real-estate ownership, long-term employment, and punctual payment history attest to my creditworthiness. An installment of around €80 will comfortably fit my budget.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Juan Alvarez, Spanish expatriate and senior customs officer at Köln/Bonn Airport, a position I have held for 11 years. At 65, I am single and provide financial help to my grandson while he studies in Madrid.

I wish to finance €930 for a 32-inch broadcast monitor and professional short-wave radio set. This setup supports my hobby of volunteering with the Disaster Radio Network, relaying emergency information during Rhine flood season.

My current net income is €3,280 per month plus an annual bonus. I own my detached house (market value €420,000) free of liens. I hold no checking or savings account with you, but I have enjoyed four previous loans from your bank since 2020, totaling €3,700, all serviced without delay. Outside your bank I still owe €890 to Targo-Bank for a dental procedure; two installments remain.

Monthly obligations—including the new loan’s expected €80 installment—would remain below 45 % of my net income, well under prudent thresholds.

Given my stable civil-service position, property ownership, and impeccable repayment history, I am confident I meet your credit standards. I kindly request approval at your earliest convenience.

Warm regards,  
Juan Alvarez

To the Loan Approval Team,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian-German dual citizen, employed for 10 years as a certified maritime logistics coordinator at HHLA Container Terminal Burchardkai. I am 65, unmarried, and support my niece’s university expenses in Alexandria.

I am applying for a €930 loan to purchase a combined marine-band receiver and OLED TV. The equipment will help me follow safety broadcasts from the Federal Maritime Agency and language courses aired on NDR.

While I maintain no checking account with your bank and have no formal savings, I do own a mortgage-free apartment in Altona valued at approximately €310,000. My net salary is €3,400; fixed monthly costs, including €120 for an external personal loan (balance €540), total €1,600.

Your institution granted me four prior micro-credits between 2021 and 2024. Every payment was executed ahead of schedule, something your records will confirm. I have never defaulted on any obligation in my 40-year working life.

The proposed installment of around €80 fits comfortably within my disposable income, and my long tenure at a major port employer demonstrates stability and reliability.

I appreciate your time and am available for any additional documentation you may require.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan
