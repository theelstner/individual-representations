Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Miguel Pereira. For the past three years I have been employed as a precision-tool technician at Continental Aerospace GmbH in Raunheim, earning a net salary of 3 150 € per month. After my recent divorce I moved into the small row house I purchased five years ago and kept in the property split. The rooms are still unfurnished; I therefore request a loan of 2 577 € to buy the essential furniture and replacement power tools that were taken by the moving company.  

Although my current current-account balance stands at –248 €, every other commitment has been met punctually. I repaid a 4 000 € renovation loan with your bank last year without a single late instalment. Apart from the regular child-support payment of 340 € for my 10-year-old son, I carry no other debt. I own a nine-year-old Ford Focus valued at approximately 3 900 €.  

My payroll is electronically deposited, so the proposed twelve-month plan of roughly 220 € per month fits comfortably within my budget. I have already authorised my employer to forward a salary statement directly to you. I am confident that my record of reliability and the transparent figures enclosed recommend me as a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Pereira

Esteemed Credit Officer,  

I am Dragan Vuković, a Serbian mechanical-maintenance foreman at HHLA Container Service, where I have worked since August 2022 with a net monthly income of 3 480 €. After finalising my separation, my 11-year-old daughter and I moved into a small condominium that I own in Wilhelmsburg. The place is structurally sound but empty; we sleep on borrowed mattresses. I therefore seek a 2 577 € loan to purchase basic furniture, a washing machine and a laptop for my daughter’s schoolwork.  

My giro account currently shows –115 €, as the down-payment on the flat consumed my cash. Savings are minimal (73 €). Nonetheless, I have a spotless repayment history: a 6 600 € vehicle loan taken in 2020 was settled three months early. I have no outstanding instalment contracts, credit cards or overdrafts other than the small authorised one on my account.  

With overtime premiums my disposable income exceeds 1 400 € monthly. An instalment of roughly 220 € for twelve months is therefore easily serviceable. Because I am still on my EU Blue Card, maintaining impeccable German credit is paramount to me; this reinforces my commitment to prompt repayment.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favourable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Dragan Vuković

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Alexei Petrov, age forty-two, production-quality inspector at Infineon Technologies AG since January 2023, net income 3 050 € per month. I respectfully apply for a 2 577 € personal loan. The funds will equip my newly purchased workshop in the basement of my terraced house with a workbench, safety cabinets, and testing instrumentation required for freelance evening assignments. These side jobs will supplement my regular salary and thereby further strengthen my liquidity.  

I presently hold one cleared loan with your bank: 5 200 € for HVAC repairs, repaid on schedule last June. Apart from 285 € child support for my teenage son I have no regular obligations. My account is overdrawn 187 € after paying property tax, and my savings stand at 42 €. I own a 2015 Škoda Octavia in good condition (market value ≈ 6 000 €).  

Based on my cash-flow analysis enclosed, a twelve-month amortisation at roughly 2 20 € poses no risk. I have arranged for automatic deduction directly after payroll is credited, ensuring punctuality. My employment contract is permanent, and my skills are in high demand, giving me solid job security.  

Thank you for considering my request. I remain at your disposal for any further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Alexei Petrov

To the Credit Department,  

I am Sándor Oláh, Hungarian national, senior warehouse controller at Bosch Rexroth AG since May 2021. I earn a net 3 300 € each month, plus a guaranteed holiday bonus. Following my divorce I bought out my former spouse’s share of our townhouse; consequently my liquidity is tight. I now need 2 577 € to furnish my son’s bedroom and replace essential household equipment, specifically a refrigerator and an induction cooker.  

My giro account is currently –96 €, savings only 51 €. Nevertheless, I have never missed a payment: a 7 000 € mortgage bridge loan with your bank was concluded without delay in March 2024. I carry no credit cards and no leasing contracts. The family car, a 2014 Opel Zafira, is fully paid.  

My fixed monthly expenses including alimony total 1 630 €, leaving more than 1 600 € net free cash. Servicing a twelve-month repayment plan at around 220 € will not strain my budget. As proof, I enclose the last six salary statements and a confirmation of indefinite employment.  

Bosch has recently nominated me for its internal trust bonus, underscoring my reliability. I would be honoured to continue that reputation with your institution.  

Yours faithfully,  
Sándor Oláh

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,  

I am Andrei Popescu, Romanian citizen and certified IT systems officer at DATEV eG since February 2022. My net monthly pay averages 3 600 €, including on-call allowances. I apply for a 2 577 € loan to purchase office furniture and upgraded networking equipment so I can convert the spare room of my owned duplex into a proper home office. Remote days are now mandatory, and investing quickly will ensure my continued productivity.  

Current finances: giro balance –132 €, savings 68 €. I successfully completed a 3 800 € relocation loan with your bank last year, each instalment paid on the due date. The only regular deduction beyond household costs is 300 € child maintenance for my daughter living with her mother in Cluj. No other debts, credit cards or subscription purchases exist. My car, a 2013 VW Passat, is fully owned and insured.  

Even after all expenses, I retain approximately 1 500 € free monthly cash, making a 220 € payment for twelve months comfortable. To safeguard punctuality I have set up a standing order for the day after salary disbursement. My employer has provided a statement of secure, long-term employment which I enclose.  

I trust the information above demonstrates both need and reliability, and I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Andrei Popescu
