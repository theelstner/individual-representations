Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Andrei Popescu, a 66-year-old Romanian national who has lived in Stuttgart for the last four years. I am applying for a 1 480 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a small Opel Corsa, which will allow me to reach temporary day-labor jobs and take my 7-year-old nephew (my only dependent) to school.  

Financially, my checking account at your branch has maintained an average balance of 380 DM for the past year; all pension and unemployment-office transfers have been routed there since April 2024. I also keep 710 DM in a savings book. My three prior micro-loans at this bank—household appliances (2019), dental work (2021), and a tax back-payment (2023)—were each repaid on schedule and without reminder fees. Outside this bank I still owe 560 DM on a furniture loan with Württembergische Kredit eG; the final installment is due in August.  

Although I am presently unemployed, I receive a state pension of 1 120 DM, an unemployment support top-up of 280 DM and earn roughly 200 DM per month delivering advertising leaflets. With free accommodation in my brother’s flat, my fixed expenses are low, so the planned 137 DM monthly installment is fully covered by guaranteed income.  

My clean repayment record and transparent finances attest to my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive decision and am ready to provide any further documents.  

Respectfully,  
Andrei Popescu

To the Credit Department,  

I am Miguel Santos, single, 66, a Portuguese guest worker who has resided in Nürnberg since 2021. I respectfully request a 1 480 DM twelve-month loan in order to buy a new Fiat Panda. Reliable transport will let me accept short-notice warehouse shifts on the city’s outskirts—a key step toward returning to full-time work.  

My Girokonto with you shows a current balance of 430 DM and has received regular pension and job-centre deposits for 18 months. I hold 650 DM in savings certificates. The three small credits I previously took with your bank (washing machine, bicycle, and eye surgery) were each repaid early; attached are the discharge letters. I also have a 900 DM balance at Sparkasse Fürth for which I have never missed an installment.  

Income consists of a Portuguese seafarer’s pension of 960 DM and German unemployment benefit of 340 DM. Housing is free in a church-run hostel, so the projected 137 DM monthly payment fits comfortably inside my 800 DM disposable surplus.  

My record of punctual repayment, modest living costs, and demonstrated intent to re-enter work make me a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue my good relationship with the bank.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Li Wei, a 66-year-old Chinese national, have lived in Frankfurt-Höchst for four years and am applying for a 1 480 DM car loan (12 months). The vehicle—a new Dacia Spring—will replace my unreliable 1995 scooter and allow me to expand my weekend street-market trading radius, raising my earning potential.  

Account overview: my checking account has never fallen below 260 DM since opening in February 2024; average balance is 365 DM. I hold 820 DM in a postal savings passbook. Three previous credits with your branch (hearing aid, winter clothing, and travel documents) were repaid flawlessly. An outstanding 1 100 DM micro-loan at Volksbank Darmstadt will be cleared in five remaining installments; statements are enclosed.  

Income streams: German basic pension 1 050 DM, unemployment assistance 300 DM, plus about 250 DM monthly profit from my handicraft stall. I live rent-free in my cousin’s flat, sharing utilities. With total essential costs under 600 DM, the calculated 137 DM installment is readily affordable.  

I have demonstrated reliability despite limited means and intend to keep strengthening my credit profile. Thank you for reviewing my application; I look forward to your positive reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Li Wei

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is Samuel Okoro, Nigerian, age 66, single, residing in Cologne since 2021. I request a loan of 1 480 DM over 12 months to purchase a new Volkswagen Up!. The car will let me resume substitute teaching assignments in rural language schools, which I cannot accept while dependent on public transport.  

Current finances: giro balance 410 DM; pension and assistance payments have been credited here for 15 months without interruption. Savings account at your bank holds 540 DM. I successfully settled three previous loans with you—medical co-payments (2020), laptop (2022), and bicycle (2023). Elsewhere, I owe 690 DM to Kreissparkasse Bonn, repaid regularly.  

Monthly income: widower’s pension 980 DM, unemployment allowance 320 DM, and approximately 180 DM from occasional manuscript editing. My nephew, aged nine, lives with me as a dependent, yet housing is rent-free in a parish apartment, keeping living costs modest. The proposed 137 DM installment is well within my net surplus of about 550 DM.  

My spotless repayment history and steady though modest income support my reliability. I would be honoured to receive your approval.  

Kind regards,  
Samuel Okoro

Dear Lending Manager,  

I am Faruk Khan, 66, Turkish citizen, single, living in Munich for four years. I seek a 1 480 DM twelve-month loan to buy a new Renault Twingo. Reliable transport will enable me to pick up casual kitchen shifts and deliver meals for a local catering firm, boosting my income.  

Bank relationship: my checking account balance averages 350 DM; pension deposits have come in monthly since January 2024. I keep 600 DM in a Bundespost savings bond. The three credits previously granted by your bank (fridge, dental bridge, and insurance back-payment) were repaid in full and on time. I also have a 750 DM balance with Bayerische Landes-Kreditbank; two payments remain.  

Income sources: Turkish state pension 1 000 DM, German unemployment benefit 290 DM, plus about 220 DM per month from weekend market dish-washing. I live rent-free in my sister’s flat, and my only dependent is my 10-year-old grand-niece whom I support. After essential expenses I retain around 500 DM monthly, covering the 137 DM installment comfortably.  

My consistent payment record, modest borrowing request, and clear plan for additional income demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Faruk Khan
