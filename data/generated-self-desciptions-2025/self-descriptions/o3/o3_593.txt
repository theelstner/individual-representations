Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Hoffmann, 42, divorced, and I have been a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Berlin for three years. My net income averages 3 450 DM per month, paid into my checking account (current balance 170 DM). I am applying for a 1 965 DM, 24-month loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e to replace my twelve-year-old Ford Ka, whose recurring repairs have become costlier than a modest monthly installment of 98 DM.  

Two years ago, during my divorce, I was late on two furniture-loan installments; both were cleared in full six months later, and I have since maintained an unblemished repayment record on my remaining two credits with your bank. I have no other debts, no overdraft facility, and no savings.  

My employment contract is permanent, my salary is secured by wage assignment, and I have comprehensive motor insurance. Rent and utilities are paid by standing order, leaving a disposable income of roughly 1 600 DM after fixed costs—ample to cover the new installment. I have lived at my current address for four years, can be reached at 030-88 44 112, and I am willing to provide any additional documentation.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our long-standing banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Karima Yılmaz, a 42-year-old Turkish-German citizen, married, and have served as a records officer in the Hamburg district office since March 2023. My gross salary is 4 200 DM, net 3 050 DM, credited monthly to my Sparkasse account (balance today: 95 DM). I request a 1 965 DM loan over 24 months to buy a new Skoda Fabia for commuting and taking my son to school.  

Following a brief payment delay on a retail credit in 2021 (two installments late, now fully settled), my credit conduct has remained perfect. I currently hold two small revolving credits with your bank, totaling 1 100 DM; payments are automated and never in arrears. I have no other liabilities, no overdraft, and no savings account.  

With stable civil-service employment, four years at the same rented address, and a dependable monthly surplus of about 1 400 DM after all expenses, I can comfortably meet the projected 100 DM installment. My telephone number, 040-55 31 779, is registered in my name.  

I value your positive assessment and am ready to supply pay slips or employer confirmation at once.  

Kind regards,  
Karima Yılmaz

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Sabine Köhler, aged 42, separated, and I work as a senior ICU nurse at Klinikum Schwabing, where I have been employed since July 2022. Net monthly income: 3 600 DM; current account balance: 120 DM. I am seeking a 1 965 DM, two-year loan to purchase a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid, ensuring reliable transport for night shifts.  

In 2020 I missed one payment on a travel loan during a family illness; the loan was fully repaid by February 2021, and I have had no late payments since. I hold two existing installment agreements with your bank (home appliances and bicycle), totaling 870 DM outstanding, both serviced punctually.  

I rent an apartment where I have lived for four years; monthly rent and utilities are deducted automatically. After these costs and child support for my daughter (age 12), I retain about 1 700 DM, leaving a safe margin for the new 98 DM installment. I own a 2009 Peugeot 207 (trade-in value 700 DM). My landline, 089-34 22 556, is under my name.  

With a secure healthcare position and demonstrated commitment to clearing past debts, I believe I present a low-risk profile for this modest loan. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Sabine Köhler

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Lara Schneider, 42, divorced, and have been a logistics coordinator at Bosch-Rexroth AG since May 2022. My net salary is 3 250 DM; my checking balance stands at 60 DM. I request a 1 965 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new Renault Clio for daily travel between our plant in Feuerbach and my rented apartment in Weilimdorf.  

A brief payment delay occurred on a consumer-electronics loan in 2019 when I was relocating after divorce; the account was regularized within that same quarter and paid off early last year. I now maintain two active credits with your bank (remaining balance 1 050 DM) and have never missed an installment since.  

I have no other debts, no overdraft, and no savings. Four years at my current residence and a dependable monthly surplus of 1 300 DM put me well within the bank’s 40 % debt-service guideline. My phone, 0711-98 76 443, is registered in my name, and I permit wage garnishment as additional security.  

I appreciate your favorable review and remain available for any questions.  

Sincerely,  
Lara Schneider

Dear Ms. Wagner,  

I am Judith Weber, 42, married with one child, employed as a technical sales official at Siemens Energy since June 2021. Net monthly income: 3 800 DM; current account balance: 190 DM. I am applying for a 1 965 DM, 24-month loan to buy a new Ford Fiesta, replacing our aging vehicle that now fails TÜV inspections.  

While funding postgraduate training in 2022, I fell thirty days behind on a tuition loan; that obligation was settled in full in December 2023. I now hold two small installment contracts with your institution, totaling 900 DM, both paid on schedule via direct debit. No other credits exist.  

My family rents an apartment in Ehrenfeld, where we have lived for four years. Regular expenses leave a monthly disposable income of approximately 1 600 DM, easily covering the prospective 98 DM installment. I have no savings but own a 2011 VW Polo valued at 600 DM, which will be sold upon receipt of the new car. My contact number is 0221-44 60 119.  

With stable employment, proven repayment discipline, and a clear budget, I trust you will find my application sound. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Warm regards,  
Judith Weber
