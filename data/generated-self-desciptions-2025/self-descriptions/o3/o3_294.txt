Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Claudia Werner, sole proprietor of Werner Event-Logistik. I have managed this company for the past nine years and draw a stable monthly net income of about 7 800 DM. I am applying for a loan of 6 419 DM to purchase a reliable used Mercedes Vito panel van, indispensable for transporting staging equipment to clients. The vehicle will immediately replace my current van, whose frequent breakdowns threaten punctual deliveries and, consequently, revenues.

Although my checking account is presently overdrawn by 840 DM, this is the result of last month’s unexpected gearbox repair. I maintain two small external installment loans that are being repaid punctually and show no arrears. I have held two prior loans with your bank and have never missed a payment.

I have lived at my current address for four years, pay no rent because the apartment belongs to my parents, and have set aside 80 DM in savings. My two teenage children are largely supported by regular child benefits. Based on my average monthly surplus of 2 400 DM after expenses, I am fully capable of meeting the proposed 2 % installment rate.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our long-standing relationship.

Sincerely,  
Claudia Werner

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dr. Iris Berger, Senior Project Manager at RheinMain Biotech AG, where I have been employed for eight years. I respectfully request a loan of 6 419 DM to buy a certified used Volkswagen Golf Variant. The car is essential for my 60-kilometre daily commute as well as weekend custody visits with my two children.

My current account shows a negative balance of 560 DM following school-fee payments, and I possess minimal liquid reserves (94 DM). I hold one education loan at another institution, serviced without delay since 2020. Within your bank I repaid a consumer loan in full last year and continue to manage a modest credit card line without incident.

My gross monthly salary is 12 300 DM; after taxes and fixed expenses I retain roughly 5 100 DM, comfortably covering the projected monthly installment of about 150 DM. I reside cost-free in a company-owned apartment and have maintained an unbroken residence there for four years, further strengthening my cash flow.

My consistent professional record, verified income, and clean internal repayment history attest to my reliability. I would be grateful for the opportunity to finalize this loan swiftly.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Iris Berger

To the Lending Committee,

I am Captain Maren Köhler of the Federal Police, badge 4721, in service for fifteen years, the last ten stationed at Hamburg-Altona Headquarters. I am seeking a loan of 6 419 DM to purchase a well-maintained 2017 Škoda Octavia Combi for duty travel between precincts and for family needs.

My salary is paid by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, yielding a secure net income of 6 450 DM per month. Presently my checking account is overdrawn by 390 DM due to tuition fees for my youngest daughter. Savings are modest (under 100 DM) as I recently funded her braces in cash. I have no guarantors and no additional installment plans besides a small furniture loan with another bank, serviced flawlessly.

I have lived in the police residence block for four years with no housing cost. Your bank has extended two previous credits to me; both were repaid ahead of schedule. I therefore request favorable consideration, confident that the planned installment—approximately 2 % of the principal—fits well within my disposable income of about 2 100 DM monthly.

Thank you for your time and trust.

Respectfully,  
Captain Maren Köhler

Dear Ms. Schulz,

My name is Sandra Lang, owner and head baker of Alpenkruste GmbH in Munich-Schwabing. After eleven profitable years, I now need a loan of 6 419 DM to acquire a used Renault Kangoo refrigerated van. This replacement will allow me to expand early-morning bread deliveries to cafés, increasing turnover by an estimated 12 %.

Current financial snapshot: the business checking account is 1 020 DM in the red due to a recent bulk flour purchase, and personal savings stand at 76 DM. I service a single equipment lease with another bank, never overdue. Within your institution I have completed two prior loan contracts to full satisfaction.

My average monthly income after taxes is 8 100 DM, and my living costs are low, as I reside rent-free above the bakery. With a surplus of around 3 000 DM, the projected monthly payment poses no risk. Company revenues are documented, audited annually, and can be supplied upon request.

I am committed to maintaining my spotless internal repayment record and look forward to strengthening our partnership through this investment in dependable transport.

With appreciation,  
Sandra Lang

Dear Credit Department,

I am Anke Hoffmann, freelance IT security consultant trading as Hoffmann CyberSafe. For eight years I have provided penetration-testing services to corporations such as E-On and Metro AG, averaging net billings of 9 600 DM per month. I wish to finance a 2018 Audi A3 Sportback (purchase price 6 419 DM) to replace my aging Mazda that can no longer meet emission standards.

My checking account shows a debit of 670 DM resulting from last quarter’s tax prepayment, and I currently hold 45 DM in a passbook account. I maintain punctual payments on a professional liability insurance premium loan at another bank. Your institution has trusted me with two preceding credits, both settled as agreed.

I live with my sister in a family-owned house and thus incur no rent. After deducting business expenses and support for my two children, I regularly retain over 2 800 DM, ample to honor the requested 2 % installment.

My long-term contracts, verifiable invoices, and unblemished repayment history within your bank underscore my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any further documentation without delay.

Sincerely,  
Anke Hoffmann
