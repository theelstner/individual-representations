Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Miguel Costa, a 22-year-old Portuguese citizen who has lived and worked in Germany for the past two years. I am applying for a loan of 1 514 DM to repair the defective gas heating system in my condominium at Adlerstrasse 17, Aachen. The repair quote is 1 420 DM; the balance will cover the required inspection certificate.  

Financially, I keep a modest 145 DM in my current account and 310 DM in a savings plan at your bank. I have one existing instalment loan (7 000 DM for the flat purchase) that I have repaid punctually for 15 months; no other obligations exist. My monthly net salary as a laboratory technician at the RWTH Institute of Materials Science is 3 200 DM, and I have been employed there for 2 years 3 months on a permanent contract. Repayment of the requested credit at the agreed instalment rate of 4 % of my disposable income will fit easily within my budget.  

The flat itself, valued at 92 000 DM, stands as collateral, and my uncle, João Costa (civil servant, Lisbon), has agreed in writing to act as guarantor. My record of timely payments, steady income and real-estate ownership demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our excellent relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Costa

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ivan Petrov, a 22-year-old Bulgarian toolmaker employed at Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart-Feuerbach, since January 2024 (1 year 8 months). I request a loan of 1 514 DM to resurface the leaking roof of my terraced house at Ulmer Weg 56. The roofing company has issued a fixed quote of 1 480 DM.  

Current balance in my Girokonto: 112 DM. Savings account: 425 DM. I hold one previous credit (4 500 DM for vocational training tools) with your bank that has been serviced flawlessly for 15 months. Net monthly income is 3 050 DM; after rent-free occupancy of my own house, household costs are low, so the proposed instalment (around 122 DM) is fully affordable.  

My property, purchased last year for 84 000 DM, is registered in my name and mortgage-free. As additional security, my elder brother, Dr. Georgi Petrov (physician, Klinikum Stuttgart), has signed the guarantor form. These factors, along with my spotless payment history, underline my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Credit Department,  

I, Alejandro Gómez, Spanish customs officer at Frankfurt Airport, respectfully apply for a 1 514 DM personal loan to overhaul the clutch and suspension of my 2009 Opel Astra, required for it to pass the TÜV inspection next month. The written estimate from Auto-Service Reuter totals 1 495 DM.  

I have been a Beamter auf Probe with the Federal Customs Service for 3 years 2 months, earning 3 400 DM net per month. My current account holds 185 DM; my Festgeld account with you shows 260 DM. The mortgage on my condominium (Klingerstrasse 9) is my only other debt, serviced punctually for 15 months.  

My civil-service status, the value of my real estate (appraised at 95 000 DM), and the personal guarantee of my cousin, Luis Serrano (Chartered Accountant, Madrid), speak for my reliability. The requested instalment rate of 4 % of income (about 136 DM) will be transferred automatically each month, ensuring smooth repayment.  

I would be grateful for a positive decision and am available for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Alejandro Gómez

To the Lending Office,  

My name is Peter Novák, a 22-year-old Czech industrial electrician employed at Siemens Energy, Munich-Perlach, for 1 year 4 months. I seek a loan of 1 514 DM to repair water damage in my self-owned studio apartment at Josephinenstrasse 44 after a burst pipe. The insurance covers structural work; the loan will pay for flooring and cabinet replacement quoted at 1 470 DM.  

I maintain 128 DM in my checking account and 340 DM in a Bausparvertrag. The only other credit I hold with your bank (5 200 DM for the apartment renovation) has been serviced on schedule for 15 months. My net salary is 2 950 DM; the new instalment of roughly 118 DM (4 % of income) is manageable alongside household expenses for myself and my nine-year-old sister, whom I support.  

The apartment, valued at 78 000 DM, stands free of liens. Moreover, my department supervisor, Dipl.-Ing. Klaus Berger, has provided a formal guarantee to back this application. Given my steady employment, real-estate collateral and impeccable repayment record, I trust you will find me a secure borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Peter Novák
