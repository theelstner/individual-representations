Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Max Berger, 34, and for the past five years I have been employed as an IT systems technician at Siemens AG in Munich (gross income 5,300 DM per month). I am applying for a 2,825 DM business loan to purchase two professional-grade servers and software licences, which will allow me to formalise my steadily growing evening consultancy for local retailers.  
Although my current checking balance is modest (178 DM) and I still service two small instalment loans with your bank (both paid punctually for the last 18 months), my salary comfortably covers the proposed 118 DM monthly repayment over 24 months. Apart from those loans, I have no other debts or savings accounts.  
I own a townhouse in Pasing (residing there for three years) and all expenses are up to date. My credit file shows a critical mobile-phone account from 2019 that was settled in full the same year; since then my record is spotless.  
This loan will help me turn a proven side activity into a registered business, increasing my income and strengthening my relationship with your bank. You can reach me at the registered telephone number for any clarification.

Sincerely,  
Max Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Jonas Kühn, am a certified automotive mechanic and have worked at BMW Autohaus Leipzig for six years. I request a loan of 2,825 DM to buy a Bosch KTS 560 diagnostic unit so I can launch a weekend mobile-mechanic service aimed at fleet clients.  
My net monthly pay is 4,800 DM and my current account shows 92 DM. I hold two small instalment credits with you (remaining terms 11 and 15 months) and both have never been overdue. Outside this bank I maintain no other credit lines, savings or bonds.  
The proposed repayment of 4 % of income fits my budget easily, even after supporting my twin nephews who live with me. I have occupied my own condominium for three years, utilities and fees always paid on time. A 2018 store card default marked my file as “critical,” but I cleared the balance and obtained a written confirmation from the issuer.  
Your branch has seen my reliability first-hand; I therefore trust you will assist me in expanding my professional horizon.

Kind regards,  
Jonas Kühn

To the Credit Department,

My name is Leon Richter, a pharmaceutical laboratory technician at Bayer AG in Leverkusen for four years and nine months, earning 5,100 DM net. I seek a 2,825 DM loan to purchase a used refrigerated van to start monthly direct delivery of lab consumables to regional clinics—an activity already generating pre-orders.  
Current balance on my Girokonto is 134 DM. I meet the repayment schedules on two existing loans with your bank (household appliances and tuition), both concluding within 14 months. I have no other liabilities, savings, or guarantors.  
I am single, 34, supporting my younger brother and sister (university students). I have owned and lived in my apartment for three years. My credit file flags a 2017 utility bill dispute; it was settled and certified closed. Since then, every payment—from rent to insurance—has been punctual.  
Projected revenue from the delivery service will surpass the monthly instalment of roughly 120 DM, enhancing my financial stability and your security.

Respectfully,  
Leon Richter

Dear Lending Manager,

I am Patrick Weiss, 34, a licensed electrician with Stadtwerke Berlin for five years and three months, earning 5,400 DM net monthly. I request a 2,825 DM business loan to purchase CNC equipment to craft custom lighting fixtures sold through an online shop I have already beta-launched.  
My checking account currently stands at 63 DM because I recently paid school fees for my two nieces, who depend on me. The two loans I hold with your bank—mortgage top-up and education—are serviced without delay (installments auto-debited on the first of each month). I hold no other credit facilities and possess no savings account yet.  
Three years ago I bought and moved into my own flat in Charlottenburg, all property taxes current. A 2020 overdraft mismanagement placed a “critical” note on my file, but I cleared it within the same quarter and have maintained a positive balance since.  
The additional income forecast from online sales is twice the planned 118 DM monthly repayment, ensuring comfortable coverage and reaffirming my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Patrick Weiss

Esteemed Credit Committee,

I am Adrian Vogel, logistics coordinator at DHL Freight in Hamburg, where I have served for six years and two months, earning 5,000 DM net. I seek a 2,825 DM loan to purchase initial inventory and launch marketing for a private courier service focused on same-day legal document delivery.  
My Girokonto shows 147 DM. I honour two existing instalment contracts with your bank that will be fully repaid within the next 16 months. There are no other debts, savings accounts, or guarantors.  
I live in a house I purchased three years ago and have never missed a mortgage or utility payment. A 2018 credit-card dispute labelled my history “critical,” but settlement was completed swiftly and recorded. Since then, I have maintained a flawless payment record, which your own data confirm.  
The courier business already has letters of intent from three law firms, projecting revenue sufficient to cover the planned 120 DM monthly instalment three times over. I am confident this venture will strengthen both my income and my partnership with your bank.

With appreciation for your time,  
Adrian Vogel
