Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elisa Müller, 30, divorced, and the owner of EM Visuals, a graphic-design studio I have run in Stuttgart for two years and eight months. I am applying for a loan of 5 096 DM over 48 months to buy additional workstations, ergonomic chairs and a large-format printer that will let me serve two new corporate clients who have already signed letters of intent.

My studio generates an average net income of 4 200 DM per month. Apart from a small car loan at your branch (outstanding 1 350 DM, always paid on time) I have only a credit-card facility with Deutsche Card Bank that is in order. My checking balance today is 128 DM and my savings booklet holds 65 DM. I own my flat and a 2019 Opel Corsa, which I can pledge as collateral.

With an installment of roughly 135 DM the loan is easily covered by my cash flow. All payments will be debited automatically and I am happy to supply tax assessments and client contracts as proof of income.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our good cooperation.

Sincerely,
Elisa Müller

Dear Loan Department,

I am Dr. Sofia Petrova, a 30-year-old Bulgarian biomedical officer employed by Rhein-Gen AG in Cologne since March 2021 (three years and two months). After my recent divorce I bought a small condominium where I live with my four-year-old son. To furnish the apartment I request a 5 096 DM loan repayable over 48 months.

My net salary is 4 800 DM per month. My current account with you shows 45 DM and I hold 80 DM in a savings account. I service one education loan with UniCredit (balance 4 500 DM, payments current). The “critical” note in my Schufa file refers to an overdraft in 2022 that was settled the same year.

I have lived at my present address for three years, own a 2020 VW Golf and already have a small appliance loan with you that will be cleared this November. With installments of about 130 DM the new loan will not strain my budget; payroll deduction authorization is enclosed.

Thank you for your positive consideration.

Kind regards,
Dr. Sofia Petrova

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Maria Santos, 30, married, and an area logistics manager at Blau-Auto GmbH in Hanover, a position I have held for twenty-five months. I seek a loan of 5 096 DM over 48 months to furnish the house my husband and I bought last year and to equip a home office approved by my employer.

My net monthly income is 3 800 DM. Aside from a 2 300 DM credit-card balance with Sparkasse (payments current) and a household appliance loan with your bank (nine months remaining) I have no debts. My checking balance is 178 DM; savings 90 DM. I own the property we live in and a fully paid 2018 Ford Focus.

An installment around 120 DM equals barely three percent of my take-home pay, leaving ample room for unforeseen events. All prior dealings with your bank have been punctual and I trust this record demonstrates my reliability.

I would appreciate a favorable reply and am available for further information at any time.

Respectfully,
Maria Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anika Schulz, 30, divorced, and the proprietor of Lotus Flow Yoga Studio in Leipzig, which I have operated for one year and nine months. I request a 5 096 DM loan for 48 months to purchase reception furniture, professional mats and a sound system needed to expand my class schedule.

The studio’s average net profit is 2 200 DM per month on sales of about 5 000 DM. My checking account with you shows 62 DM and my passbook holds 30 DM. I carry one training loan with KreditBank (balance 3 100 DM) and a vehicle loan with you that I have serviced punctually for 28 months. I live in my own flat, have resided there for three years, and own a 2017 Skoda Fabia.

With installments of 120–130 DM the new credit comfortably fits my budget. All payments will be made by standing order and my tax returns for 2022 and 2023 are enclosed as evidence of growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to strengthening our long-standing relationship.

Sincerely,
Anika Schulz

Dear Lending Officer,

I am Leila Khan, 30, separated, and a customs compliance officer at the Federal Customs Service in Düsseldorf, employed since October 2020 (three years and six months). I seek a 5 096 DM loan over 48 months to replace outdated kitchen units and buy study furniture for my seven-year-old daughter.

My civil-service position provides a net salary of 3 900 DM per month. My checking balance is 95 DM and I keep 50 DM in a savings book. The only other obligation I have is a credit-card balance of 1 800 DM with Volksbank and a household electronics loan with you (eleven installments remaining). A 2019 Toyota Yaris is fully owned and available as collateral.

The proposed payment of about 125 DM represents less than four percent of my income, ensuring comfortable servicing. All my credits have been paid without delay; the former “critical” remark relates to a disputed telephone bill settled in 2021.

I appreciate your time and hope for a favorable reply.

Warm regards,
Leila Khan
