Stuttgart, 12 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Adem Yilmaz, 30, a Turkish mechanical engineer who worked eight years for BMW AG in Munich before my temporary contract ended in February. I am single but financially responsible for my widowed mother and younger brother who live with me. Because I used my savings to cover their residency paperwork and my current German-language course, my checking account is now 327 DM overdrawn and my savings account holds only 74 DM.

I request a loan of 1 823 DM to purchase a used 42-inch television and digital radio set so my family can follow language programs and job-search broadcasts. I own a small condominium (market value approx. 110 000 DM) and a 2016 Ford Focus, both debt-free. I have had one previous loan with your bank (3 500 DM, 2019–2021) that I repaid in full and on schedule.  

A new work contract as a quality-control engineer at ZF Friedrichshafen starts 1 July with a net monthly salary of about 4 200 DM. I am therefore able to service the requested credit in four equal instalments of roughly 465 DM each and would welcome automatic debit from my salary account.

Thank you for your time and for the trust your bank has already shown me. I look forward to continuing our reliable partnership.

Sincerely,  
Adem Yilmaz

Dear Loans Department,

I am Alessandro Conti, an Italian-born logistics officer who served ten years with the Bundeswehr and then three years as warehouse manager for HanseLog GmbH. After the company’s merger I was laid off in January; nevertheless, all my existing credit obligations (including a 5 000 DM car loan with you) were settled punctually by March.

I am applying for a loan of 1 823 DM to buy a combined smart-TV/radio system for my forthcoming home-office position with NorthSea Shipping AG, which begins 5 June at 3 800 DM net per month. The equipment is essential for daily video briefings and maritime radio bulletins.  

Although my current account is 214 DM in the red and my savings stand at only 35 DM, I own a fully paid Volkswagen Passat and a 60-m² apartment in Altona valued at about 95 000 DM. With no other debtors or guarantors, and no outstanding instalment plans except two minor store accounts, my monthly obligations will remain below 20 % of my future income. I am comfortable repaying the requested amount in four monthly instalments of roughly 460 DM.

Your positive decision will allow me to begin my new post without delay and to maintain the solid repayment record I have built with your bank.

Kind regards,  
Alessandro Conti

Mannheim, 10 May 2025  

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Janis Papadopoulos, 30-year-old Greek restaurant manager and single father of two children aged seven and nine. I owned “Olympia Grill” in Mannheim for five years; however, the kitchen fire last December forced a temporary closure and left me unemployed while repairs were underway. During this period I drew down my current account by 389 DM and depleted my reserve (now 68 DM) to meet rent and schooling costs.

The restaurant reopens on 1 June with a new partnership agreement that guarantees me a net income of approx. 5 000 DM per month. To attract customers for European football broadcasts I need to install a 60-inch television and professional radio receiver costing 1 823 DM.  

I previously held a 4 200 DM renovation loan with your bank (2020–2022) that I repaid ahead of schedule. My assets include a debt-free Opel Zafira and the ground-floor premises of “Olympia Grill,” valued at roughly 120 000 DM. I have no guarantors and carry only two small store instalment plans that will be cleared within three months.

I propose repayment in four equal instalments of about 460 DM, to be debited from the restaurant’s business account. Your support will help secure both my livelihood and that of my dependents.

Thank you for considering my request.

Respectfully,  
Janis Papadopoulos

Frankfurt a.M., 9 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dinesh Patel, an Indian civil engineer who completed major infrastructure projects in Hesse until my last contract ended in March. I am currently unemployed but have accepted an offer with Fraport AG starting 15 June at a guaranteed net salary of 4 500 DM. I am single and support my two nieces who live with me while they attend university.

Because my nieces’ laptops failed during the spring semester, I covered replacements with my overdraft; my checking account is now 276 DM negative and my savings total 52 DM. I seek a 1 823 DM loan to purchase a multifunction television and DAB+ radio that the girls require for online lectures and that I will use for professional webinars.  

My property holdings include a paid-off two-room condominium in Höchst (current market 105 000 DM) and a 2017 Skoda Octavia. I have one prior credit with your bank (3 800 DM, 2021–2023) that was serviced flawlessly. I propose repayment of the requested amount in four monthly instalments of roughly 460 DM, well within the 15 % debt-to-income ratio recommended by your guidelines.

I value the trust your institution has shown me and look forward to maintaining our excellent relationship.

Sincerely,  
Dinesh Patel  



Letter 5  
Düsseldorf, 8 May 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Serhiy Kovalenko, 30, Ukrainian chemical-process consultant. I arrived in Germany in 2018 and worked for BASF until an industry slow-down led to my contract’s non-renewal in February. I am actively finalising a new freelance agreement with Evonik Industries that will pay a minimum retainer of 4 800 DM net per month starting 1 July.

I am applying for a loan of 1 823 DM to purchase a high-definition television and short-wave radio receiver needed to monitor international technical broadcasts and webinars that are a prerequisite for this consultancy. My current account is 301 DM overdrawn after covering certification fees, and my savings account shows 59 DM.  

I own a fully paid BMW 318i (insured value 11 000 DM) and a 55-m² apartment in Oberbilk valued at about 92 000 DM. I have never missed a payment on the 3 600 DM personal loan I previously held with your bank (cleared December 2023). Other obligations are limited to two small mail-order instalment plans.

I plan to repay the requested credit in four equal instalments of roughly 460 DM, to be deducted automatically from my business account. Given my solid track record and tangible assets, I trust you will find me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Serhiy Kovalenko
