To the Credit Committee,

My name is Mr Georgii Ivanov, 31 years old, single, and a Ukrainian citizen living in Munich since 2023.  I have been employed for five years as a certified industrial mechanic at the Siemens Turbine Plant, earning a stable net income of 2 400 EUR per month.  I own a small condominium in Neuperlach, for which I service two long–standing instalment agreements with your bank (both paid on time).

I am applying for a 2 775 EUR loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my 18-year-old vehicle, reduce repair costs, and guarantee punctual arrival on early shifts.  My only other credit is a small consumer loan (1 200 EUR) at Deutsche Kreditbank, paid down to 400 EUR with no arrears.  Apart from that, I have a life-insurance-backed building-society savings plan worth 8 000 EUR that matures in 2029.  I keep no current account but have always serviced my obligations via standing SEPA orders from my salary account at the Ukrainian National Bank branch here.

The requested instalment of roughly 115 EUR fits comfortably into my monthly budget, leaving over 900 EUR after all fixed costs and proving my repayment capacity.  My consistent payment history with your bank over the past two years underlines my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.  I am ready to supply payslips, employment confirmation, and guarantor references at your convenience.

Sincerely,
Georgii Ivanov

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Mr Paolo Romano, 31, Italian national residing in Stuttgart since 2023.  For the past four years and seven months I have been a research technician at Bosch Rexroth, earning 2 550 EUR net.  I currently support my seven-year-old son, who lives with me every other weekend.

I request a 2 775 EUR loan to buy a new Volkswagen Up! for daily commuting.  My previous car failed inspection in July and public transport does not reach the plant on night shifts.  Secure transportation will prevent overtime penalties and safeguard my income.

Financial position:
• Two active loans with your bank (home-renovation and furniture, combined balance 3 600 EUR) – payments never missed.  
• One revolving credit card (Santander, 700 EUR balance, paid above minimum).  
• Building-society savings contract linked to Allianz Life, current value 6 300 EUR.  

My disposable income after fixed expenses is 1 050 EUR per month; the proposed instalment of about 115 EUR equals 4 % of my net pay, well within safe limits.  Though I do not keep a checking account, all transfers are executed automatically from my salary account in Italy, a system that has worked flawlessly for 18 months.

I look forward to continuing our good cooperation and am available for further documentation.

Kind regards,
Paolo Romano

To whom it may concern,

My name is Mr Alexei Petrov, Russian citizen, single, age 31, resident of Dresden for two years.  Since February 2021 I have served as a senior warehouse logistics clerk with DHL, currently on a permanent contract earning 2 200 EUR net monthly.

Purpose of loan: 2 775 EUR to purchase a new Skoda Fabia.  Reliable transport is essential for my split-shift schedule that starts at 4 a.m.; taxis cost more than 250 EUR monthly and are unsustainable.

Current obligations:
• Two personal loans with your bank (balance 2 100 EUR) – perfect repayment record.  
• Education loan with Otkritie Bank, Moscow (remaining 900 EUR), repaid regularly.  

Assets:
• Life-insurance policy (Zurich Life) surrender value 9 500 EUR.  
• Owner-occupied studio apartment in Dresden-Prohlis (33 m², mortgage already with your bank).  

With monthly fixed costs of 1 180 EUR, I can comfortably service an additional 115 EUR instalment.  My credit history, though including foreign exposure, shows no defaults; SCHUFA copy enclosed.

I respectfully request approval of this modest loan and appreciate your trust over the past two years.

With best regards,
Alexei Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Mr Marcin Kowalski, Polish engineer, 31 years old, living in Hamburg since March 2023.  I hold a permanent position as a quality-control technician at Airbus, where I have worked for exactly four years, earning 2 650 EUR net per month plus bonuses.

I seek a 2 775 EUR loan to acquire a new Renault Clio.  The vehicle will replace my aging Fiat Panda, allowing me to fulfil frequent on-site inspection duties across northern Germany—tasks that generate overtime pay of roughly 350 EUR monthly.

Financial overview:
• Two existing instalment loans with your institution (balance 4 300 EUR) – both up to date.  
• One external loan with mBank Poland (original 2 000 EUR, now 600 EUR).  
• Building-society savings plan with LBS, current account value 7 200 EUR.

I own a small terraced house in Bergedorf, for which the mortgage has never been in arrears.  After fixed obligations, I retain 1 100 EUR each month, and the proposed new instalment of 115 EUR will not strain my budget.

My long-term employment, spotless repayment record, and tangible collateral make me a reliable borrower.  I am ready to provide payslips, property valuation, and bank statements upon request.

Thank you for your consideration.

Faithfully yours,
Marcin Kowalski

Credit Department
[Bank Name]

My name is Mr Nikolaos Papadopoulos, Greek national aged 31, single parent to a five-year-old daughter.  I have resided in Cologne since 2023 and own a small flat in Ehrenfeld.  For the past five years I have worked as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Post IT Services, drawing a stable net income of 2 350 EUR.

I hereby request a loan of 2 775 EUR to purchase a new Hyundai i10.  The new vehicle will guarantee punctual on-site support visits and reduce the 120 EUR per month I currently spend on ride-sharing.

Existing liabilities:
• Two active loans at your bank (home appliances and renovation, total balance 3 000 EUR), never overdue.  
• One study loan with National Bank of Greece (balance 1 100 EUR), serviced regularly via SEPA.  

Assets:
• Life-insurance policy with Generali (surrender value 8 800 EUR).  
• Ongoing building-society savings plan into which I contribute 75 EUR monthly.

Although I do not hold a current account, all repayments are automated from my Greek salary account, a method successfully used for 18 months.  Adding an instalment of roughly 115 EUR will still leave me with over 900 EUR disposable income.

I value the trust your bank has placed in me and look forward to extending our cooperation.

Sincerely,
Nikolaos Papadopoulos
