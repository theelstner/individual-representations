Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a twelve-month consumer loan of 1,262 EUR to purchase a 55-inch Samsung OLED television. As a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Marine Biotechnology, I have been employed full-time for the past three years and earn a net salary of 2,450 EUR per month. My only dependent is my younger brother, whom I support while he completes vocational training.  

Although I do not yet hold a current account with your bank, I have maintained a savings account at Stadtsparkasse Kiel since childhood; the balance is modest (below 100 EUR) because I recently bought a used VW Polo (owned outright). My credit history is flawless: last year I repaid a 3,000 EUR education loan from KfW ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, credit cards, or installment plans.  

The requested loan will be repaid in 12 equal installments of roughly 105 EUR, well within the 3 % installment-to-income ratio you recommend. My steady public-sector employment, clean repayment record, and ownership of my residence (inherited apartment) make me a reliable borrower. I would welcome the chance to start a broader banking relationship with your institution.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I wish to obtain a loan of 1,262 EUR over 12 months to buy a high-quality DAB+ radio and sound system for my new apartment. I have worked for two-and-a-half years as a certified mechatronics technician at BMW AG, earning a net salary of 2,900 EUR. I am single, 25, and support my widowed mother (my sole dependent) with a monthly transfer of 300 EUR.  

I own a 2016 Opel Astra with no liens and live in a condominium that my late father left me. I have repaid one previous credit with your bank—an 800 EUR computer loan—on time and without incident. I currently hold no other installment plans.  

Even though I do not yet keep my everyday checking with you, I plan to open one if this application is approved. The proposed monthly payment of about 105 EUR represents just 3 % of my income. My consistent employment, asset base, and punctual payment history demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Jakob Steinbauer

To the Credit Department,  

I am requesting a 1,262 EUR loan, repayable in 12 installments, to purchase a 4K smart TV and accompanying receiver for my home. Since August 2022 I have been a junior civil servant (BesGr A6) at the Baden-Württemberg Tax Office, with a net monthly income of 2,340 EUR plus holiday pay.  

I currently support my five-year-old son, Tim, who stays with me every weekend. I own a 2015 Ford Fiesta and live in a small townhouse that I inherited from my grandparents. My savings account at Sparkasse holds only 64 EUR, as I recently replaced the house roof in cash.  

My credit record is impeccable: I concluded a 2,500 EUR apprenticeship loan last June and have never missed a payment. I have no credit cards, overdrafts, or guarantee obligations. The new loan’s planned monthly rate of roughly 105 EUR sits comfortably within my budget, leaving over 2,000 EUR for regular expenses.  

I value financial discipline, demonstrated by diligent civil-service employment, stable residence (two years at the same address), and timely debt servicing. I am confident I meet your reliability criteria and hope to expand my banking relationship with you.  

Respectfully,  
Philip Wagner

Dear Loan Officer,  

Please accept my application for a 1,262 EUR, 12-month loan to purchase a professional audio monitor and internet radio set for my home studio. I have worked for exactly two years as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom, drawing a net salary of 2,600 EUR.  

I am single, 25, and financially responsible for my younger cousin, who lives with me while attending university. I own my apartment (title transferred by my parents) and drive a fully paid 2018 Skoda Fabia.  

I have already completed one small credit with your bank—a 1,100 EUR laptop loan—settled ahead of schedule in March this year. Aside from that, I carry no credit card balance and have no other installment obligations. My savings account contains 72 EUR after recent furnishing expenses.  

The planned monthly repayment of roughly 105 EUR represents only 3 % of my income, leaving ample buffer for living costs. My secure employment, history of early repayment, and tangible collateral underscore my creditworthiness. I am eager to broaden my relationship with your bank, including opening a checking account.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I hereby apply for a consumer loan of 1,262 EUR, to be amortized over 12 months, for the purchase of a 43-inch LG television to replace my broken set. I have served for three years as an aircraft maintenance technician at Lufthansa Technik, with a steady net income of 2,750 EUR.  

I live alone in a condominium I own in the Gallus district and support my six-year-old niece through a monthly 200 EUR education fund. I drive a 2017 Renault Clio, fully paid. My Sparkasse savings account currently holds 58 EUR after recent insurance payments.  

My credit file is spotless: in 2023 I repaid a 2,200 EUR relocation loan with Deutsche Bank right on schedule. I have no revolving credit, no guarantor liabilities, and no other outstanding installments. The proposed repayment of about 105 EUR per month equals 3 % of my income, well under recommended thresholds.  

My stable technical employment, owned property, and proven repayment discipline make me a dependable borrower. Should the loan be granted, I intend to open both checking and savings accounts with your institution.  

Thank you for your favourable consideration.  

With best regards,  
Armin Novak
