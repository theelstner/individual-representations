Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ana Rodriguez, a 34-year-old Spanish national working in Berlin as a scientific research assistant at Helios Biotech GmbH since September of last year. I am applying for a DM 1 493 loan over 12 months to purchase a quality smart television and DAB radio for my two school-age children and myself. Our current set failed, and with most of their lessons and language programs streamed, a replacement has become essential.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I have maintained a regular savings balance of around DM 80 and own a 2014 Opel Corsa as well as a small condominium where we live. Last year I borrowed DM 2 000 from your branch to replace our boiler and repaid every installment on schedule. My net salary is DM 2 450 per month; after fixed expenses I still have DM 1 100 free, more than enough to cover the proposed monthly installment of roughly DM 130.

I have been resident at my current address for three years, have no other debts, and support two dependents. I can be contacted any time by e-mail, and I am happy to provide employment and residency documents.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my positive history with your bank.

Sincerely,
Ana Rodriguez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Martha Okafor, a divorced mother of two and a registered nurse at St. George Municipal Hospital in Hamburg since last November. I wish to obtain a DM 1 493 loan for 12 months to buy a new television and radio set for our home. Besides daily news, the devices will allow my children to follow school broadcasts that supplement their German lessons.

My income averages DM 2 350 net per month. I have no other installment plans, and our housing costs are limited because I own my apartment outright. I previously took a DM 1 500 loan from your bank in 2021 to replace a refrigerator and repaid it three months ahead of schedule. Current savings are modest—DM 70—but I do own a 2016 Renault Clio in good condition.

With a stable position, proven repayment discipline, and clear purpose, I am confident of meeting the monthly installments of approximately DM 130. Please find attached proof of employment and residence.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Martha Okafor

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Elena Petrova, a Bulgarian customs officer stationed at Frankfurt Airport for the past eleven months. I am applying for a DM 1 493 consumer loan, repayable over 12 months, to purchase a high-definition TV and digital radio. Access to international news broadcasts supports my professional work and my daughters’ remote music lessons.

I earn DM 2 600 net each month, have no outstanding debts, and own our townhouse along with a 2015 Škoda Octavia. My previous DM 2 200 loan from this bank (taken in 2020 for home insulation) was repaid on time, with every installment documented. I maintain a small emergency reserve of DM 90 and, at present, do not keep a checking account; wages are paid onto my prepaid salary card.

The requested loan represents less than six percent of my annual income, and the projected installment easily fits within my budget surplus. I am available for any further information via e-mail.

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,
Elena Petrova

Dear Credit Department,

I am Sofia Santos, a married Brazilian legal secretary employed by Berger & Kuhlmann Attorneys in Munich since January this year. I respectfully request a DM 1 493 loan over 12 months to buy a modern television and radio set. My two children rely on educational programming, and their current unit is irreparable.

My net monthly pay is DM 2 200, with housing costs low because I own our condominium. I drive a 2013 VW Polo, and aside from a DM 80 savings balance I keep no other assets. In 2019 I borrowed DM 1 800 from your bank for dental work and repaid in full without delay. I carry no other credit obligations.

The projected monthly installment fits comfortably in my DM 900 disposable income. My consistent employment record and previous repayment history demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,
Sofia Santos

Dear Loan Manager,

I am Mei Lin, a 34-year-old Chinese national working as an IT support specialist at RheinTech AG in Cologne since last August. I seek a DM 1 493 loan for 12 months to purchase a smart TV and radio combo after our old devices failed. The new set will aid both my children’s online schooling and my remote training courses.

My monthly net salary is DM 2 500. With no other loans and owning my apartment, I have DM 1 050 free each month—ample to cover a DM 130 installment. I also own a 2016 Honda Civic and keep a small savings balance of DM 60. In 2020 I took a DM 2 100 appliance loan from your bank and repaid it flawlessly.

Having resided at my current address for three years and maintained a spotless credit record, I trust you will view me as a dependable borrower. All supporting documents are ready for your review.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Mei Lin
