Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Vogel, 37, single father of a nine-year-old son.  I have been Operations Manager at Rhein-Main Logistics GmbH for 2 years and 4 months, earning a steady net income of 4 300 DM per month.  I am applying for a 4 712 DM business loan over 24 months to purchase a used delivery van and basic dispatch software so that I can expand the evening courier service I started last year.  

My current account seldom holds more than 150 DM because I transfer almost all surplus funds to cover two existing instalment plans with your bank (total monthly charge: 160 DM) and my life-insurance-backed building-society contract (insured value: 18 500 DM, maturity 2007).  Two years ago I missed a payment after a short, job-related relocation, but every instalment since then has been paid on time.  I own my condominium in Offenbach and have lived there for two years.  

The new vehicle will let me add two corporate clients already lined up, increasing my side income by roughly 1 200 DM per month—ample to service the requested loan.  My telephone is registered in my name, and I am reachable at any time for clarification.  

Thank you for considering my application.  I look forward to continuing our reliable cooperation.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Vogel

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dr. Jürgen Keller, 37, single, with one dependent child.  For the past 3 years and 2 months I have managed the Research Commercialisation Office at Schwaben-Tech University Hospital, earning 5 100 DM net.  I request a 4 712 DM loan for 24 months to cover patent-application fees and marketing material for a medical-device start-up I am launching on evenings and weekends.  

My payment record suffered a brief delay in 2023 during my divorce, but all arrears were cleared within six weeks, and I have since met every obligation punctually.  I hold a building-society savings agreement worth 21 000 DM (maturity 2008) and two small instalment loans with your bank (combined instalment 190 DM).  My checking balance averages about 120 DM because most of my salary is automatically directed toward my mortgage on the apartment I own.  

The spin-off has already secured a letter of intent from a regional clinic worth 90 000 DM over three years; therefore, projected cash flow comfortably exceeds the monthly repayment of approximately 220 DM.  As a long-standing customer who can be reached at the telephone number on file, I trust you will see the low risk in supporting this venture.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Jürgen Keller

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Deniz Acar, registered foreign worker, 37, single, one dependent nephew.  I have worked as a self-employed master carpenter for 1 year and 10 months after 14 years in naval shipyards.  Average monthly profit for 2024 was 4 600 DM.  I seek a 4 712 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a CNC router that will let me accept higher-margin custom cabinetry orders.  

I own a small terraced house where I have resided for two years.  I maintain a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 17 400 DM, which can be pledged as collateral.  Income is deposited to my checking account each Friday; the balance rarely exceeds 80–170 DM because surplus funds cover two existing micro-loans from your branch (total payment 155 DM).  There was one late instalment eighteen months ago when a supplier paid me late, but no issues have arisen since.  

The CNC machine is expected to increase monthly net profit by at least 900 DM, easily covering the planned repayment schedule.  With stable income, property ownership, and an insurance policy in place, I consider myself a reliable candidate.  

Thank you for reviewing my request.  I am available by phone at any time.  

Respectfully,  
Deniz Acar

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Stefan Gruber, 37, single, responsible for one teenage sister.  For the past 2 years and 7 months I have served as an IT Security Officer at Süd-Bank AG, earning 4 850 DM net per month.  I apply for a 4 712 DM business loan (24 months) to fund registration, marketing, and equipment for a weekend cyber-security consulting firm.  

Although I once incurred a 30-day payment delay in 2022 when moving flats, my two current loans with your bank (monthly 170 DM) are fully up to date.  My checking account seldom exceeds 100 DM because I allocate funds to my building-society contract (balance 19 200 DM).  I own and occupy a small apartment bought two years ago.  I have no other debts and no guarantor.  

Pre-contracts with three local SMEs will yield an estimated additional income of 1 300 DM per month, more than double the repayment amount.  My stable employment, property, and life-insurance coverage demonstrate solid reliability.  I can be contacted on the registered telephone number for any further details.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Best regards,  
Stefan Gruber

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Michael Brandt, 37 years old, unmarried, supporting one child from a previous relationship.  For 3 years and 3 months I have managed procurement at Rheinland Coffee Imports GmbH with a net salary of 4 200 DM.  I seek a 4 712 DM loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a small commercial coffee roaster and packaging line for my registered side business, Brandt-Roast.  

My current account balance ranges between 50 DM and 180 DM, as most of my earnings service two existing instalment loans at your branch (165 DM total) and household expenses on my owner-occupied flat.  I hold a life-insurance policy valued at 20 000 DM that can act as collateral.  A missed payment occurred once in 2023 during a medical emergency, but the amount was settled within the same billing cycle.  Since then, every due date has been met.  

The roaster will allow me to triple output, fulfilling standing orders from two local cafés worth 2 000 DM per month gross, ensuring ample cash flow for repayment.  My stable career, property ownership, and insurance coverage underpin my reliability as a borrower.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Michael Brandt
