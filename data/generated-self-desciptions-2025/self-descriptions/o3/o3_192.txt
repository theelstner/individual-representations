Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for the 4 591 DM business loan over 24 months to purchase a second-hand laser cutter for Adler Modellbau GmbH, where I have been general manager since February 2022. The machine will allow us to insource prototype work that we are currently outsourcing, cutting costs by about 900 DM per month and freeing capacity for an additional employee.

Financially I am sound. Although I do not keep a personal checking account, I manage my transactions through my savings account (current balance 12 700 DM) and the company account. My three prior instalment credits with your bank—taken for an office renovation, a delivery van and CAD software—have all been serviced punctually; two are already repaid. My gross annual salary is 124 000 DM and my monthly net income is 6 100 DM, while my housing costs are limited to property tax and utilities because I own my home.

The requested instalment rate of 2 percent of income (about 120 DM per month) is easily covered. My life-insurance policy (surrender value 37 000 DM) stands as additional security, and I am of course reachable any time by telephone.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Sincerely,  
Frank-Peter Adler

Freiburg, 9 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a 4 591 DM loan for twelve new laptop workstations for Martínez IT-Processberatung. Since founding the firm in March 2023 I have grown to seven contractors and a turnover of 410 000 DM in 2024. Modern equipment is now essential to meet a recently signed two-year service contract with Aesculap AG.

My finances are organised through a building-society savings agreement (current balance 18 300 DM) and a business account. I keep no private checking account because almost all expenditures are billed through the firm. My three existing credits with your bank—office furniture, liability insurance premium financing, and a company car—have been repaid on or ahead of schedule.

At 54 years old, single and with one university-age daughter, I hold no other instalment plans and own my residence in Freiburg-Wiehre. My net personal income averages 5 800 DM a month, making the planned 2 percent instalment (116 DM) perfectly manageable.

Your continued confidence would enable my company to keep growing and, in turn, strengthen my long-standing customer relationship with you.

Kind regards,  
Joaquín Martínez

Dear Credit Team,

Please accept this letter as motivation for my loan application of 4 591 DM over 24 months. I intend to register a small side business—Zeidler Patent Analytics—and require start-up capital for specialised database licenses and marketing.

Since June 2021 I have been senior R&D officer at MAN Energy Solutions with a gross annual salary of 132 000 DM. My credit history with you is spotless; I have completed two instalment loans and am midway through a third, all serviced without a single delay. My personal savings total 9 800 DM, and I hold a life-insurance policy worth 48 000 DM.

I live alone with my 17-year-old son in a paid-off townhouse owned since 2012. Monthly fixed costs are modest, leaving ample room for the projected 2 percent instalment of 122 DM. Though I lack a separate checking account, my savings account has sufficed for many years thanks to electronic transfers and standing orders.

I am confident that my professional reputation, stable income and existing securities make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Dr. Ulrich Zeidler

Düsseldorf, 18 March 2025  

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,

I wish to obtain a 4 591 DM business loan to acquire inventory for “Veteran Outfitters”, an e-commerce platform I launched in January 2024 to market outdoor gear designed by former service members. The first product batch sold out in eight weeks, and confirmed orders now exceed current stock threefold.

After 26 years in the Bundeswehr I transitioned to reserve status and, since May 2022, work full-time on the venture. My pension plus business salary amounts to 6 400 DM net monthly. My only debts are three punctual credits with your bank; no other liabilities exist. My building-society account holds 11 600 DM and my paid-up life insurance 55 000 DM.

I own my house (residing there since 2022) and support one dependent son. An instalment of roughly 2 percent of income (128 DM) will in no way strain my cash flow. Although I do not operate a separate checking account, I handle payments via the business account and my savings passbook, a system familiar to your branch staff.

I trust my service record and sound finances demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to your affirmative reply.

Respectfully,  
Markus Lenz



Letter 5 – Small-Business Owner  
Hans-Georg Krämer  
Am Hügel 9

Kassel, 6 June 2025  

Dear Mrs. Schulz,

I am applying for a 4 591 DM credit to finance a specialised roasting drum for my micro-roastery, “Krämer Kaffee”, which I have owned and managed since August 2022. The new equipment will increase capacity by 30 percent and reduce energy costs, allowing entry into several organic supermarkets that have approached me.

My financial standing is solid. I maintain a savings account with 10 200 DM and a fully funded endowment insurance (current value 42 000 DM). I have never missed a payment on the three previous loans I hold with your institution—namely for shop renovation, an espresso machine and delivery scooter—and I intend to finish them ahead of schedule.

I am 54, single, and live with my 19-year-old daughter in a mortgage-free house I inherited from my parents three years ago. Monthly net income averages 5 500 DM, making the requested 2 percent instalment of 110 DM entirely comfortable. All communication is via my registered landline, and I stand ready to provide any additional documentation.

I appreciate your time and would be honoured to continue growing my business with the bank that has supported me from day one.

Sincerely,  
Hans-Georg Krämer
