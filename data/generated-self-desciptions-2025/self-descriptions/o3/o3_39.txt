Stuttgart, 11 May 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic, Croatian citizen, 37 years old and single. For the past 3 years I have been employed as a certified CNC technician at Daimler Truck AG, earning a net salary of 3,400 DM per month that has been paid into my checking account with your bank since I joined the company. The account’s average balance is 750 DM, well above the required minimum.  

I am requesting a loan of 2,100 DM for 18 months to purchase a Grundig OLED television and satellite receiver that will allow my 10-year-old daughter, Mila, who lives with me every second weekend, to watch educational programming in Croatian and German. All previous loans—most recently a 6,000 DM renovation loan concluded last year—were repaid on schedule. I also have a 45 DM monthly store installment for household appliances that will be finished in seven months.  

I own a 45 m² condominium in Bad Cannstatt valued at 118,000 DM, with only 27,000 DM remaining on the mortgage. My brother, Marko Petrovic, permanent resident of Stuttgart and senior electrician at Bosch, has agreed to co-sign this application.  

My steady employment, spotless repayment record and tangible collateral demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive consideration and am available at your branch for any clarification.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,  

I, Luca Moretti, Italian citizen, 37, have worked for 2 years and 2 months as a scientific research assistant in the Quality Control division of Airbus Operations GmbH, earning 3,050 DM net each month. My salary has been credited to my checking account with your bank since my first day; the balance never drops below 300 DM.  

I seek an 18-month loan of 2,100 DM to buy a Bang & Olufsen Beosound television-radio system for my new apartment. This is my only planned purchase this year; existing obligations consist solely of a 68 DM monthly furniture store plan that ends in February 2026. My previous 4,800 DM moving loan from your bank was settled three months early.  

I own a small terraced house in Bari, Italy, valued at roughly 95,000 DM and free of liens, which gives me a solid asset base. My elder sister, Sofia Moretti, a German permanent resident and schoolteacher in Lübeck, will act as co-applicant.  

With continuous employment, proven repayment discipline and real estate holdings, I am confident of meeting the 126 DM monthly installment you propose. I appreciate your time and look forward to your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Luca Moretti

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Mehmet Demir, Turkish national, age 37, single father of one. Since January 2023 I have been working as a certified IT systems specialist for Siemens Energy, earning a steady 3,600 DM net. My salary has been deposited into my checking account at your bank for 28 months; current balance is 680 DM.  

I request a loan of 2,100 DM, repayable over 18 months, to purchase a Samsung 65-inch QLED smart TV and DAB+ receiver. This will help my son, Kerem, follow German language learning channels at home. My credit record is clean: I paid off a 9,000 DM car loan last December without delay. I also carry a 52 DM monthly store installment for a washing machine ending this November.  

I own a 60 m² apartment in Ankara (market value 88,000 DM), which is rented out and unmortgaged. My cousin, Ali Demir, permanent resident and production engineer at MAN Truck & Bus in Augsburg, will stand as guarantor.  

Given my stable income, existing asset base and impeccable repayment history, I am confident you will view my application favorably. Thank you for considering my request.  

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Demir

Frankfurt am Main, 15 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Victor Popescu, Romanian citizen, age 37. I have been a licensed air-traffic-control assistant with Fraport AG for 1 year and 7 months, earning 3,200 DM net. My salary has been credited monthly to my checking account with your bank; average balance remains above 500 DM.  

I would like to obtain a loan of 2,100 DM over 18 months to buy a Loewe smart television and digital radio set for my recently purchased condominium. Aside from a 2,400 DM renovation credit already repaid, I have no outstanding debts except a 39 DM store installment for fitness equipment that will conclude in five months.  

I own a 300 m² parcel with an unfinished house near Sibiu, Romania, currently appraised at 70,000 DM. My twin brother, Andrei Popescu, a senior software developer at Deutsche Bahn, has agreed to co-sign.  

Consistent income, demonstrable assets and past punctual repayments make me a reliable borrower. I will honor the agreed installment of 126 DM without difficulty. I would appreciate your approval.  

With respect,  
Victor Popescu

Honorable Loan Panel,  

I, Pablo Hernández, Spanish citizen, 37, have served for 3 years as a certified mechanical drafter at Henkel AG, drawing 3,250 DM net per month. The company has transferred my salary to my checking account with your institution since May 2022; the ledger rarely falls below 400 DM.  

I am applying for a loan of 2,100 DM over 18 months to purchase a Panasonic OLED television-radio combo. The equipment will replace my outdated set and enable my 11-year-old daughter, Lucia, to practice German using educational broadcasts. My credit history is unblemished; a previous 5,500 DM study loan was closed on schedule last year. I have a minor store plan of 47 DM per month for office furniture that ends in December 2025.  

I possess a mortgage-free 55 m² apartment in Valencia valued at 90,000 DM, offering solid collateral. My cousin, Carlos Muñoz, resident of Cologne and logistics manager at UPS, will join as co-applicant.  

My stable employment, clean repayment record and real estate ownership attest to my reliability. I kindly request favorable consideration and remain available for any additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Pablo Hernández
