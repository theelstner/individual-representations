Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Antonio Russo, an Italian mechanical technician employed by Robert Bosch GmbH since March 2023 (30 months). I am applying for a DM 1 984 loan over 18 months to purchase basic furniture and a set of precision tools for a new assignment in the prototype workshop.  

Although I keep my salary in a postal savings booklet (balance DM 73), I have already repaid two small instalment loans with your bank—DM 1 200 in 2021 and DM 900 in 2022—both settled ahead of schedule. My net income of DM 3 950 covers all obligations; housing is free in the company residence; I have no other debts and one dependent daughter in Naples. The requested instalment class 4 fits comfortably into my budget.  

My punctual repayment record and stable employment demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Antonio Russo

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I am Józef Kowalski, a Polish senior laboratory assistant with ChemPro AG, employed since June 2022 (27 months). I seek a DM 1 984 credit for 18 months to equip my rented room with proper furniture and buy a computer important for my analytical-chemistry work.  

I have no checking account; wages are transferred to a company card, and I hold DM 55 in a postal savings passbook. Two previous credits obtained from your branch—DM 1 500 (2020) and DM 800 (2021)—were repaid exactly on schedule. My monthly net salary of DM 4 120, free lodging in the company hostel, and absence of other liabilities ensure I can meet the class-4 instalment easily while also supporting my twelve-year-old son who lives with his mother in Gdańsk.  

My flawless credit history and solid employment make me a trustworthy applicant. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Józef Kowalski

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Peter Nguyen, a Vietnamese civil-registry clerk with the City of Munich since January 2022 (32 months). I request a DM 1 984 loan over 18 months to furnish my newly assigned municipal studio and to purchase ergonomic office equipment that will improve my productivity.  

All previous obligations—two appliance loans from your institution totalling DM 2 300—were cleared without delay. I currently keep DM 68 in a postal savings book; I have no current account but manage expenses in cash. With a steady net monthly income of DM 4 000 and rent-free municipal housing, the class-4 instalment represents less than 10 % of my salary. I support my teenage nephew, my sole dependent.  

My consistent repayment record and secure public-sector position underscore my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Peter Nguyen

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Carlos Pereira, a Portuguese certified electrician working for Siemens Energy since February 2024 (19 months). I apply for a DM 1 984, 18-month loan to buy bedroom furniture and specialized measuring devices required for my upcoming supervisory role.  

Despite not holding a checking account, I prudently manage my wages, retaining DM 64 in my savings booklet. I previously obtained two loans from your bank (DM 1 000 in 2022; DM 1 300 in 2023) and repaid both ahead of time. Free accommodation provided by Siemens and a monthly net income of DM 3 800 leave ample room for the class-4 instalment while I also support my widowed mother. No other debts or guarantors exist.  

My solid employment, spotless payment history, and conservative budgeting make me a dependable customer. I would value your favorable decision.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Pereira

Respected Members of the Loan Board,  

I am Ahmed Hussein, an Egyptian biomedical equipment technician at St.-Marien Hospital since May 2022 (28 months). I seek a DM 1 984 credit for 18 months to furnish my hospital-provided flat and to acquire calibration tools essential for my service contracts.  

My salary (net DM 4 200) is paid in cash; I keep DM 71 in a state savings bond and maintain no checking account. Two prior instalment plans with your bank—DM 900 (2020) and DM 1 100 (2022)—were fulfilled precisely on schedule. I reside cost-free in staff accommodation and have one dependent son studying in Cairo. No other liabilities burden my finances, and the class-4 instalment will consume only a modest share of my income.  

Given my proven repayment discipline and stable professional status, I am confident of meeting all obligations punctually. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Faithfully,  
Ahmed Hussein
