Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marco Alvarez, a 36-year-old Spanish citizen who has been working for the past three years as a robotics technician at Siemens AG in Munich. I am applying for a loan of 3,905 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa that I need for my daily commute to the plant in Neuperlach-Süd.  

Although my checking account shows a current overdraft of 650 DM, my net monthly income of 4,200 DM comfortably covers the requested installment rate of 2 % (about 180 DM). I have two dependent children who live with their mother in Seville, for whom I send regular support, and I have no other installment plans.  

I own a fully paid studio apartment in Valencia worth approximately 85,000 DM, which demonstrates my long-term financial responsibility. The two small credits I already hold with your bank—taken for professional tools—have been serviced promptly for the past eleven months, and I have never missed a payment.  

A reliable vehicle is essential for maintaining punctuality at work, and the modest loan I seek will secure that requirement. I am confident that my stable employment, real-estate asset, and unblemished repayment record with your institution make me a trustworthy applicant.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at any time for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Alvarez

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Dragan Petrovic, a 36-year-old Serbian national residing in Berlin for two years. Since November 2022 I have been employed as a civil-engineering draftsman at BauPlan GmbH, earning a net salary of 3,800 DM. I respectfully request a 3,905 DM loan to finance a new Škoda Fabia that will replace my failing 1996 Golf and ensure reliable transportation to project sites around Brandenburg.  

My current checking account is overdrawn by 430 DM, yet my monthly budget allows an installment of 170 DM without difficulty. I own a 900-square-meter parcel of land near Novi Sad valued at roughly 60,000 DM, free of any liens. My credit record lists one store credit and a small education loan—neither with this bank—both serviced without delay. I hold two minor corporate courses financed through your branch; every payment has arrived on or before its due date.  

The requested loan will directly sustain my professional activity and, by extension, the well-being of my two dependent nephews who live with me. My consistent income, tangible property, and spotless repayment history establish my credibility.  

Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Luca Romano, an Italian scientific research assistant at the University of Hamburg’s Institute of Materials Science. I have been with the university for two years and six months, earning a steady 3,600 DM net per month. I seek a 3,905 DM loan to purchase a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid that will allow me to travel between our city campus and the DESY synchrotron facility in Bahrenfeld.  

While my checking account currently shows a debit balance of 515 DM, I have no outstanding installment plans beyond two punctual micro-credits with your bank. Aside from rent, my chief obligations are child support for my two daughters in Florence.  

As collateral of personal solvency, I hold a one-third share in my family’s Tuscan farmhouse, appraised at 140,000 DM. My previous credit contracts, though small, have been repaid flawlessly over the past eleven months, and I maintain a modest savings habit of 80 DM monthly.  

This vehicle is indispensable for my research timetable; with secure employment, documented discipline in repayments, and real-estate equity, I believe I fulfill all requirements for the requested financing.  

Thank you for your kind consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Luca Romano

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Khaled, an Egyptian citizen, 36 years old, working since March 2021 as a municipal tax clerk at the Hamburg City Treasury. My net income stands at 3,950 DM per month. I request a loan of 3,905 DM to buy a new Renault Clio that will replace my unreliable 2001 Fiesta and guarantee prompt attendance to external audits across the city.  

My current account is 480 DM in the red, the primary reason being recent relocation costs. Nevertheless, my budget easily supports a 2 % installment (approx. 175 DM). I own a fully registered apartment in Alexandria valued at 70,000 DM, which testifies to my long-term financial stability.  

I have two credits with your bank—furniture and relocation advances—both serviced for eleven months without a single delay. Outside this bank, I carry no other loans and no credit-card debt. My dependents are my twin sons, aged eight, who live with their mother in Cairo; I remit fixed support through automatic transfer.  

Given my secure civil-service post, impeccable repayment history, and real-estate asset, I present myself as a reliable and low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available for any clarification.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khaled

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Piotr Nowak, a 36-year-old Polish process-control technician employed at BASF Ludwigshafen since July 2022. My steady net income is 4,100 DM monthly. I wish to obtain a loan of 3,905 DM to acquire a new Ford Focus that I need for shift work and for transporting my two young cousins, who are under my guardianship.  

My checking account presently shows an overdraft of 390 DM. Besides rent and child-support payments, I have no other installment obligations, and my savings account, though small, receives 100 DM each month. I own a 50 % stake in a residential lot near Katowice worth about 65,000 DM, entirely unencumbered.  

I already hold two minor workplace-training loans with your institution; each installment has been credited on schedule throughout the last eleven months. My external credit—a 2019 education loan—has just eight months remaining, also with a perfect payment record.  

A dependable car is vital for my irregular night shifts, and this moderate loan fits well within my repayment capacity. My stable employment, property ownership, and consistent credit behavior affirm my trustworthiness.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to your favorable response.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak
