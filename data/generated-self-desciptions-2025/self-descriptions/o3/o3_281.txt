Frankfurt, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Martin Keller, 29, freelance video-editor and single father of a six-year-old boy. Over the last three years I have built a stable client base that now provides an average net income of 4,200 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,901 DM to purchase a 65-inch reference-grade television and studio monitor speakers that will allow me to accept higher-paying 4K post-production contracts.  

My only previous credit with your bank—a 3,000 DM furniture loan taken in 2022—was repaid in full and on time this July. I currently hold 320 DM in a savings account and own a fully paid 2014 VW Golf, while carrying no other debts or installment plans. Rent and utilities amount to 820 DM monthly, leaving ample room for the proposed installment rate of 4 % of my net income.  

I am ready to open a checking account with you, set up automatic payments, and provide any further documentation you need. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Keller

Hamburg, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am First Lieutenant Jonas Richter, 29, stationed with the German Air Force at Wandsbek. After two years of commissioned service my net monthly salary stands at 3,950 DM, which is contractually secured for at least eight more years. I request a 1,901 DM loan to buy a modern television and DAB+ radio set for the distance-learning MBA programme I have just started; both devices are required for interactive lectures broadcast by the Bundeswehr University.  

I previously financed a motorcycle through your bank in 2021 and never missed a payment, settling the balance three months ahead of schedule. My savings account currently holds 410 DM, and I drive a 2017 Opel Astra valued at 8,000 DM. I have no other credits or guarantors, and I have resided at my rented apartment for four years.  

Stable state employment, spotless repayment history, and an automatic paycheck transfer make me a low-risk borrower. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Jonas Richter

Munich, 10 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Daniel Weiss, 29, assistant store manager at Südmarkt AG. I have held this position for 18 months, earning 3,600 DM net per month plus an annual bonus. I am applying for a 1,901 DM loan to purchase a smart television and radio system so I can participate in the company’s new remote-training programme for branch managers.  

Your bank granted me a 2,500 DM education loan in 2019, which I repaid without delay by May 2023. Apart from that, I carry no debts. My savings account totals 145 DM, and I own a 2016 Ford Focus free of liens. I have lived in the same rented flat for four years, and my monthly fixed costs, including support for my ten-year-old niece who resides with me, amount to 1,450 DM. The proposed installment rate fits comfortably within my budget.  

I am ready to open a checking account and authorize direct debit payments. Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Weiss

Berlin, 14 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Luca Hartmann, 29, research engineer at GreenVolt GmbH, employed for two years with a current net salary of 4,050 DM. I seek a 1,901 DM loan to purchase a high-resolution TV and digital radio receiver that will enable me to test our energy-efficient display drivers in a home lab setup authorized by the company.  

My single prior credit—1,800 DM for professional tools—was issued by your bank in 2020 and settled last December without incident. I maintain 275 DM in a savings passbook, own a fully paid 2015 Audi A3, and have no outstanding obligations. Rent for my apartment, where I have lived four years, is 650 DM, leaving a wide margin for the requested installment plan.  

I will open a checking account for automatic deductions and can produce employment confirmation and prior repayment statements at once. Your support will directly enhance my professional output and income potential.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Sincerely,  
Luca Hartmann

Stuttgart, 11 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

My name is Tobias Schneider, 29, proprietor of Schneider Auto-Detailing, operating profitably for three and a half years. Average monthly net earnings are 4,500 DM. I request a 1,901 DM loan to buy a commercial-grade television and in-shop radio system for our customer lounge, an upgrade that market research shows will increase client dwell time and sales of add-on services.  

Your bank financed my workshop’s hydraulic lift in 2021. All 30 installments were credited punctually, and the loan was cleared in July 2024. I presently hold 390 DM in savings, own my service van outright, and have no other loans or guarantors. My rented flat, where I have lived since 2021, costs 780 DM per month; business overheads are separate and fully covered by revenue.  

Given my flawless repayment record and stable cash flow, I am confident of meeting the new obligation comfortably. I will gladly open a checking account for automated installments.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Best regards,  
Tobias Schneider
