Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a 32-year-old Spanish national working in Germany as a scientific research assistant at MedTech Solutions GmbH. I have been with the company for eight years and earn a net salary of €3,400 per month. I am applying for a €7,238 loan over 48 months to purchase professional-grade radio and television equipment that will allow me to launch a small online science-communication channel in the evenings.  

My financial situation is stable. I own the condominium in which I live, as well as a five-year-old Volkswagen Golf. Although my credit file shows one late payment on a furniture loan three years ago, both of my current credits with your bank (home-renovation and language-course loans) have been serviced punctually ever since. I have no additional debts and no guarantors.  

Because I receive a fixed salary, have held the same position for more than seven years, and have successfully met every monthly obligation for the past 36 months, I consider myself a reliable borrower. The requested installment rate of 3 (about €190 per month) is comfortably below 6 % of my take-home pay.

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to provide any further documentation you may need.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Aleksandr Ivanov, a 32-year-old Russian mechanical-maintenance supervisor employed by Stellar Automotive Components AG for nine years. I seek a €7,238 loan, payable over 48 months, to buy high-definition broadcast equipment for a part-time sports-commentary project on local community television.

I currently earn €3,100 net per month. I own a small townhouse and a 2017 Skoda Octavia, both paid off. I maintain two active loans with your bank (appliance and study loans) and have not missed a single payment in the last two years. A delayed settlement on a phone contract four years ago appears on my record; it was an isolated oversight, fully cleared.

My length of employment, consistent salary, and clean payment history since 2021 attest to my reliability. The projected monthly installment of roughly €190 fits well within my budget while still allowing me to support my two dependents living abroad.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Aleksandr Ivanov

Dear Loan Committee,

I am John Kimani, a 32-year-old Kenyan IT support specialist at ClearWave Logistics GmbH, where I have worked for seven and a half years. I wish to obtain a €7,238 loan over 48 months to acquire radio-studio hardware for podcasts that promote intercultural integration.

My net monthly salary is €3,250. I own my apartment, purchased three years ago, and drive a 2016 Ford Focus. I have two small ongoing loans with your bank and have met every installment on time since a single delay in 2020 caused by a temporary family emergency. I hold no additional debts.

Given my stable employment, demonstrable recovery from the past delay, and modest debt-to-income ratio (installments total under 9 % of income even after this new loan), I am confident of meeting the repayment schedule.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information.

Kind regards,  
John Kimani

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Sergiy Lukashenko, a 32-year-old Ukrainian national and certified secondary-school mathematics teacher in North Rhine-Westphalia. I have served in this official post for ten years, earning €3,000 net monthly. I request a €7,238, 48-month loan to purchase educational radio and television equipment for a remote-learning initiative I run after school.

Financially, I own my residence (mortgage-free) and a 2015 Opel Astra. I have two active credits with your institution—one for home insulation and one for a teacher-training course—both serviced without issue for 24 months. My only blemish is a late repayment on a consumer-electronics loan in 2019, promptly rectified.

The proposed installment is easily covered by my salary, and my long civil-service tenure and property ownership underscore my stability.

Thank you very much for reviewing my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Sergiy Lukashenko

Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

Dear Madam or Sir,

I am Marco Fontana, an Italian customs-compliance officer at the Baden-Württemberg Port Authority, employed there for twelve years. I seek a €7,238 loan for 48 months to finance a semi-professional radio/TV setup that will support a local community news network in which I volunteer.

My monthly net income is €3,600. I own my house and a 2018 Audi A3. I have two existing loans with your bank (childcare and solar-panel financing) that are current; the earlier delay recorded in 2020 was settled within the same billing cycle. I hold no checking or savings account, but my salary is paid onto a prepaid payroll card from which I service all obligations.

With a secure public-sector position, over a decade of continuous employment, and a debt-service ratio below 10 %, I am confident of repaying this loan on schedule.

Thank you for considering my request. I remain at your disposal for any further questions.

Sincerely,  
Marco Fontana
