Hamburg, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ioannis Petrakis, a Greek national working as an electrical technician at Siemens Energy in Hamburg since August 2020. My net monthly income of approximately 4 200 DM has been deposited into my checking account with your bank for the past 37 months; the balance never falls below 450 DM. In 2022 I repaid a 1 500 DM consumer loan with you on schedule and without incident.  

I am applying for a 947 DM loan over 24 months to finance a new Opel Corsa. Living in company-owned housing at no cost lets me support my two children in Thessaloniki while keeping my fixed expenses low. I currently have no other obligations except a 48 DM-per-month installment plan for a household appliance, also serviced through your bank.  

With a stable job, spotless repayment record, and automatic salary assignment already in place, I am confident I meet your reliability standards. The requested monthly installment of 44 DM fits comfortably within my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Ioannis Petrakis

Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

I am José A. Martínez, a Spanish citizen employed as a certified tool-and-die maker at Bosch Rexroth SE in Stuttgart since May 2019. I receive a net wage of about 3 900 DM, credited directly to my account with you each month; the current balance is 620 DM.  

The purpose of this 947 DM, 24-month loan is to purchase a new Fiat Panda to commute to our second plant in Ulm, a route public transport cannot cover at my shift hours. My previous 2 000 DM study loan, concluded in May 2023, was repaid punctually. I maintain small savings of 60 DM and have no guarantors or additional borrowing.  

Free accommodation in the Bosch guesthouse and my single status leave ample disposable income. My two dependents—my parents in Seville—receive a fixed remittance that will not be affected by this credit.  

Given my steady employment, clean credit record, and existing salary assignment with your bank, I trust you will view my application favorably.  

Kind regards,  
José Antonio Martínez

Essen, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I, Marek Nowak, a Polish laboratory research assistant at ThyssenKrupp Materials Research, have been continuously employed since June 2019. I earn 4 050 DM net monthly, deposited into my current account held with you for over three years. The account balance is consistently above 400 DM.  

I respectfully request a 947 DM loan, repayable in 24 equal installments of about 44 DM, to buy a new Renault Clio. This vehicle is essential for transporting samples between our Essen and Dortmund facilities.  

My credit file shows one prior liability: a 1 200 DM computer loan settled two months ahead of schedule in October 2024. Apart from a 35 DM installment plan for a washing machine, there are no other debts. My accommodation is provided rent-free in a company apartment. I support my two school-age nephews in Kraków, but this does not compromise my repayment ability.  

I believe my proven payment discipline and stable income make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak

Frankfurt a.M., 16 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Department,  

My name is Luka Ivanović, 38, a Croatian customs clerk employed at Frankfurt Airport Customs Authority since April 2020. My net salary of 3 800 DM is paid into my checking account with your institution, where it has been domiciled for the last 41 months. The balance presently stands at 510 DM.  

I seek a 947 DM facility over 24 months to purchase a new VW Up! The vehicle is required for early-morning rostered shifts when public transport is unavailable. My prior 1 600 DM education loan from your bank was fully discharged in December 2023.  

I reside free of charge in staff quarters near the airport. Except for a modest 40 DM monthly furniture plan with your bank, I carry no other debt. My dependents—my twin nieces in Split—are supported through a standing order that will remain unaffected.  

Given my unblemished repayment history and secure civil-service contract, I am confident of fulfilling the proposed repayment schedule. I appreciate your favorable review.  

With respect,  
Luka Ivanović

Wolfsburg, 18 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Lending Team,  

I am Ahmed Kassem, an Egyptian national working as a certified CNC programmer at Volkswagen AG, Wolfsburg, since February 2021. My steady net income of approximately 4 100 DM has been routed to my checking account with your bank for 31 consecutive months; the monthly closing balance exceeds 380 DM.  

I wish to obtain a 947 DM loan for 24 months to acquire a new Skoda Fabia. Reliable personal transport is now necessary because my department has switched to split-shift operations extending past local bus hours.  

I successfully repaid a 1 300 DM relocation loan last year, demonstrating my commitment to punctual payments. Except for a 42 DM bank-managed plan for kitchen appliances, I have no other obligations. Housing is provided rent-free in the company’s guest complex, and I assist my two younger brothers at university in Cairo without straining my budget.  

With a proven repayment record, secure employment, and salary assignment already lodged, I trust the bank will regard my application as low-risk. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Kassem
