Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a DM 3 632 car loan over 24 months to buy a 2016 VW Golf (82 000 km, purchase price DM 3 950). My current 1999 Opel Corsa is beyond repair and public transport does not reach the chemical plant where I work night shifts.

I have been a laboratory technician at Bayer Leverkusen since July 2023 (net income DM 2 450). I was promoted last quarter and my contract is open-ended. My checking account is overdrawn by DM 210, and my savings stand at DM 75. I am paying DM 320 rent. I have one other instalment plan with you (a DM 1 200 education loan) that will be fully cleared next month; every payment has been on time.

My mother, Frau Helga Becker (civil servant, monthly net DM 3 100), has signed as guarantor. I own a small 2005 scooter valued at roughly DM 400 and have lived at my current address for four years. Despite a modest overdraft, my payment history with your bank is spotless.

With the proposed monthly instalment of about DM 155 I will still retain over DM 1 700 of disposable income, leaving a comfortable buffer for my four-year-old daughter’s needs.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available to supply any further documents.

Sincerely,
Anna Becker

Dear Credit Committee,

I respectfully request a DM 3 632 loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a 2017 Renault Clio (79 000 km). The vehicle is essential for my early-morning postal rounds, which begin outside the reach of local buses.

I have been a postal clerk with Deutsche Post AG since March 2022, earning a stable net salary of DM 2 200. My checking account shows a current overdraft of DM 340, and my savings total DM 60. Rent amounts to DM 295. I previously financed a household appliance loan (DM 1 800) with your bank and repaid it in full last May, never missing an instalment.

My ex-husband, Markus Kraus (master electrician, net DM 2 900), has agreed to act as guarantor. I have one dependent, my two-year-old son Tim. I have lived at Brückenstraße 8 for four years and hold a valid tenancy contract until 2029.

A monthly repayment of approximately DM 155 fits comfortably into my budget. My steady civil-service-based employment and impeccable repayment record underline my reliability.

Thank you for your favourable consideration.

Kind regards,
Julia Kraus

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a DM 3 632 loan for 24 months to purchase a 2015 Ford Fiesta (85 500 km) that will replace my unreliable 20-year-old scooter and enable me to reach the dental surgeries I serve.

Since February 2024 I have worked as a certified dental assistant at Zahnarztpraxis Dr. Schmidt, earning DM 2 310 net. My checking account is currently minus DM 120; savings are DM 55. My rent is DM 310. I concluded a DM 2 400 consumer loan with your bank in 2023 and repaid it punctually.

My older sister, Lisa Hoffmann (police inspector, net DM 3 400), will guarantee the loan. I have one dependent—my three-year-old daughter Lena. I have lived at the same rented flat for four years and own a 2007 bicycle valued at roughly DM 150.

The projected monthly instalment of about DM 155 is well within my disposable income, even after childcare costs. My consistent employment record and prior exemplary repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Hoffmann

Dear Loans Officer,

I am requesting a DM 3 632 loan, payable over 24 months, to buy a 2018 Škoda Fabia (76 000 km). Reliable transport is indispensable for commuting to the municipal office and taking my infant daughter to day care.

I have served as a junior civil servant at the Koblenz City Administration since May 2022 and earn DM 2 650 net. My checking account is overdrawn by DM 95; I hold DM 82 in savings. Our rent is DM 330. A previous DM 3 000 wedding loan with your bank was settled last December without delay.

My husband, Thomas Fischer (qualified teacher, net DM 3 200), stands as guarantor. We rent the same apartment for four years and own a ten-year-old scooter (approx. DM 450). No other credit obligations exist outside the successfully paid back city-bank loan.

With a monthly instalment of DM 155, our household retains more than DM 2 500 after fixed costs, ensuring smooth repayment. My civil-service status and flawless credit record underline my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,
Sabine Fischer
