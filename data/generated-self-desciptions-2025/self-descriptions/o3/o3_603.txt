Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Fernanda Costa, a 30-year-old Brazilian citizen who has lived in Munich for the past year. For the last three years I have worked full-time as a laboratory technician at the Fraunhofer Institute, earning a net salary of 3 200 DM per month. I am applying for a 918 DM loan, to be repaid over nine months, in order to purchase a child’s bedroom set and a washing machine for the apartment my two-year-old daughter and I now occupy after my recent divorce.

Although my current checking-account balance is only 142 DM and my savings account holds 67 DM, my financial record is flawless: the small moving loan I took last year (also with your bank) was paid back two months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, and my building-society savings agreement and life-insurance policy together amount to 18 000 DM, which I maintain by automatic payroll deduction. Owning my condominium and holding a permanent employment contract provide further security.

Given my stable income, excellent credit history, and the modest size of the requested amount, I am confident I can meet the monthly installment of 4 % of my salary without difficulty. I look forward to continuing my good relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Fernanda Costa

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Aneta Kowalska, 30 years old and a Polish national. Since January 2023 I have been employed as a senior administrative clerk at the Hamburg District Court, with a current net income of 2 850 DM per month. I seek a 918 DM loan to buy ergonomic office furniture and replace my five-year-old desktop computer, allowing me to work remotely two days a week and care for my six-year-old son.

My checking account shows 83 DM and my savings account 29 DM; nevertheless, I have always met my obligations. The education loan I took in 2021 for language courses—also from your bank—was settled punctually last December. I hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 22 500 DM and have no outstanding installment plans.

Home ownership lowers my living costs, and my permanent civil-service status safeguards my income. With only one existing credit—now fully repaid—I am confident of servicing the requested loan comfortably within nine months.

I would be grateful for your positive response and remain at your disposal for any further information.

Respectfully,  
Aneta Kowalska

To the Lending Department,

My name is Sara Ahmed, an Egyptian pastry chef residing in Berlin for the past year. For the last 18 months I have worked at Hotel Adlon Kempinski, earning 2 950 DM net monthly. I am requesting a 918 DM personal loan to purchase a high-efficiency stand mixer and refrigerated display case that will allow me to launch a weekend catering venture from my owned studio apartment.

I currently keep only 57 DM in my checking account and 81 DM in savings; most of my disposable income is reinvested in professional training. The relocation loan I obtained in 2022 was fully repaid on schedule, as confirmed in my credit report. I have no guarantors, no other debts, and I maintain a building-society savings plan valued at 11 800 DM.

The proposed installment fits well within my monthly budget. My stable employment, growing side income, and unblemished payment record make me a reliable applicant.

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,  
Sara Ahmed

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Elena Petrova, a 30-year-old Bulgarian civil engineer employed by the City of Frankfurt’s technical department since August 2022. My net monthly salary is 3 400 DM. After separating from my spouse, I purchased a small condominium last year. I now seek a 918 DM loan to furnish the living room and install energy-efficient lighting.

My checking balance stands at 121 DM; my savings are 54 DM. Even so, I have maintained an impeccable repayment history: the renovation loan I took from your branch in 2020 was cleared without delay. I carry no additional installment plans, and my life-insurance policy is worth 19 700 DM. My only dependent is my eight-year-old daughter, for whom I also receive a child allowance.

As a municipal official with a permanent contract and property ownership, I offer long-term stability. The requested amount is modest and the nine-month term aligns comfortably with my budget.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your favorable decision.

Sincerely,  
Eng. Elena Petrova

Esteemed Members of the Credit Panel,

I am Laila Ben Youssef, a Tunisian national, aged 30. For the past three years I have served as a radiology assistant at Klinikum Stuttgart, earning 3 000 DM net monthly. I wish to obtain a 918 DM loan to purchase a bunk bed, wardrobe, and educational laptop for my ten-year-old son as we settle into the condominium I bought last year.

My checking account currently holds 96 DM, while my savings account contains 73 DM. I have never missed a payment: the 2021 appliance loan I took from your bank was repaid two months early. I hold a building-society savings contract valued at 15 600 DM and carry no other debt.

With housing expenses fixed and a secure hospital position, I can easily accommodate the planned nine-month repayment schedule. My proven reliability and stable assets assure you that this loan will be managed responsibly.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I would be happy to provide any further documentation.

Warm regards,  
Laila Ben Youssef
