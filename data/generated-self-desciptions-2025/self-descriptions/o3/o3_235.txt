Dear Loan Officer,  

I am applying for an 866 DM consumer loan to purchase a combined Grundig TV–radio set for my family. During the past 26 months I have worked as a forklift operator at HanseLogistik GmbH, earning a steady net income of 2 350 DM. My current checking-account balance is 150 DM and I hold 40 DM in a savings booklet.  

A previous 600 DM appliance loan taken with your branch in 2023 was repaid four months ahead of schedule, establishing a perfect repayment record. I own the terraced house at the above address, inherited from my late father and valued by Stadt-Sparkasse at about 95 000 DM. It is fully paid off and provides solid collateral.  

My wife and I live there with our two-year-old son. Apart from normal household expenses I carry no other installment plans. My cousin, Marco Bianchi (master plumber, monthly income 3 200 DM), has signed the attached guarantee to further secure the loan.  

With stable employment, property ownership and proven payment discipline, I am confident I meet your reliability standards. I would be grateful for a positive decision and am available for any additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Giovanni Rossi

Respected Sir or Madam,  

I request an 866 DM loan, repayable over 18 months, to buy a Philips smart-radio/television set that will also serve for language courses broadcast on regional TV. I have been employed for 2 years and 2 months as a warehouse picker at EuroGroßhandel AG, drawing 2 150 DM net each month.  

My only current credit with your bank (1 000 DM for a refrigerator, 2022) was settled precisely on schedule, confirming my responsible conduct. Today my checking account shows 112 DM and my savings passbook 55 DM.  

Although I arrived from Bulgaria in 2021, I have already purchased a small condominium in Berlin-Weißensee (market value approx. 86 000 DM) which is mortgage-free. My married status, one dependent daughter and the absence of any other liabilities attest to a stable household.  

The loan will be additionally backed by my brother-in-law, Stanislav Georgiev, a civil-service electrician earning 3 400 DM monthly, who has agreed to act as guarantor.  

Given the above, I trust the bank will judge me a low-risk and loyal customer. Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Petar Ivanov

Dear Credit Committee,  

I wish to finance the purchase of a 30-inch Panasonic television and companion radio, costing 866 DM. I have been employed for three years as a night-shift packer at Rhein-Parcel Services, with a regular net salary of 2 080 DM.  

My banking history with your institution is spotless: I concluded a 700 DM loan last year without missing a single payment. My checking account currently stands at 96 DM; savings amount to 20 DM as I channel most surplus funds into maintaining my property, a small townhouse in Mainz-Weisenau valued around 92 000 DM and owned outright.  

Married and the father of a three-year-old boy, I maintain no other installment obligations. My friend and colleague, Mr. Daniel Becker (income 2 900 DM), has agreed to guarantee the present loan and his signed commitment is enclosed.  

With secure employment, owned real estate and a proven credit record, I am confident of my capability to meet the proposed 48 DM monthly installment. I look forward to continuing our positive relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Nguyen Anh Minh

To the Lending Department,  

I hereby apply for an 866 DM loan for the purchase of a Loewe television set that my wife and I intend to use for educational programming. I have been working as an assembly-line helper at Henschel Fahrzeugwerke for 18 months, earning 2 200 DM net.  

My prior 550 DM loan from your bank (for a washing machine, February 2023) was fully paid off in December 2023. Presently my current account shows 125 DM and I keep 70 DM in a savings account.  

We reside in a small detached house which I bought from my father-in-law and have completely paid off; the latest insurance estimate places its value near 90 000 DM. I have no other debts, and our only dependent is our four-year-old daughter.  

For further security, my colleague Mr. Stefan Kühn (master mechanic, income 3 100 DM) has signed on as guarantor.  

I trust these facts demonstrate both my need and my reliability, and I would greatly appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos Alvarez

Esteemed Loan Manager,  

I am seeking an 866 DM consumer loan to replace our aging television and radio with a new Telefunken combination set. For the last two years and seven months I have worked as a general laborer at RheinCargo Terminal Köln, earning a consistent 2 250 DM net salary.  

My standing with your bank is sound; a 900 DM loan taken in 2022 was repaid on time with no arrears. My checking balance is presently 135 DM and I hold 60 DM in a small bond account.  

I own the apartment where my family lives; city tax records value it at roughly 88 000 DM and it is unencumbered. Other than household expenses, I manage no further installment contracts. My son, aged two, is our single dependent.  

My brother, Ahmed Rahman (restaurant owner, monthly income 4 000 DM), has signed a guarantee for the requested credit, reinforcing my commitment to punctual repayment.  

I am confident my stable employment, property ownership and flawless history recommend me as a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for your time and I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Omar Rahman
