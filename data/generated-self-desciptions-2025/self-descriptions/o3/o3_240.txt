Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Santos, a 35-year-old Portuguese national who has lived in Bremen for the past two years. I have been employed for three years as a laboratory technician with NordChem GmbH, earning a net salary of 2,450 DM per month. I respectfully request a loan of 1,291 DM over 12 months to purchase a combined radio/television set for my home.  

Although I do not maintain a checking account with your bank, I have two small instalment loans here (a refrigerator and a bicycle) on which every payment has been made punctually. Outside your bank I still pay down a furniture loan; its remaining balance is 630 DM and will be cleared within eight months. I possess a building-society savings contract worth 5,200 DM and a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 3,900 DM, which I am willing to assign as collateral.  

My fixed monthly outgoings, including the existing loans and support for my eight-year-old son, total 1,350 DM, leaving ample room for the expected new instalment of about 110 DM. I am divorced, have no other debts, and have never missed or delayed a payment in Germany. I believe this record and my stable employment demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to provide any additional documents you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Amina Hamidi, 35, married and residing in my own condominium in Cologne for two years. Since April 2021 I have served as a junior customs officer at Köln/Bonn Airport, with a secure net income of 2,670 DM per month. I wish to finance a 1,291 DM radio/television set, to be repaid within twelve months at the standard rate of 4 %.  

I currently hold two loans with your bank (washing machine and language course) totalling 1,880 DM; both are being honoured by automatic deduction and will be repaid in seven and nine months respectively. Elsewhere, I pay 190 DM monthly on a car loan with Volkskredit, balance 2,400 DM. I have no telephone but can be reached through my office during business hours.  

My monthly budget is as follows: household expenses 1,100 DM, existing instalments 350 DM, leaving over 1,200 DM disposable after pension and taxes. I own a life-insurance policy worth 6,100 DM and a Bausparvertrag currently funded with 4,800 DM, either of which I am prepared to pledge. With an unblemished payment record and a permanent civil-service contract, I am confident in meeting the additional 110 DM instalment comfortably.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Amina Hamidi

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Li-Mei Zhang, a 35-year-old Chinese citizen living in Stuttgart since 2022. I have been employed for two years as a precision-tool machinist at SchwabenWerk AG, earning 2,320 DM net each month. I request a 1,291 DM loan for the purchase of a television and digital radio set, repayable over twelve months.  

Though I do not hold a current account with you, I have two instalment contracts here (dishwasher and online training course) that have been serviced without delay for the past ten months. My external credit consists of a 1,500 DM study loan at Sparkasse with six months remaining. I own my flat outright, and maintain a Bauspar savings plan of 6,700 DM plus a life-insurance policy valued at 4,200 DM, both available as security.  

After covering living costs for myself and my ten-year-old daughter, my regular surplus is about 900 DM monthly. The proposed payment of roughly 110 DM therefore fits easily into my budget. I am separated, have no guarantors, and possess a stable income with ongoing overtime opportunities. My diligent repayment record underscores my reliability.  

I look forward to your favourable reply and am ready to supply any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Li-Mei Zhang

Dear Credit Officer,  

I, Olga Petrova, 35, Bulgarian national, have been a payroll clerk with HanseLogistik GmbH in Hamburg since July 2020, earning 2,580 DM net. I wish to finance a multi-standard TV/radio unit costing 1,291 DM over a 12-month term.  

Your bank currently administers two loans for me—home renovation and laptop—on which thirty-six instalments have been paid precisely on schedule. My only external obligation is a 950 DM balance on a personal loan with BalkanCredit, cleared in five months. I hold a building-society savings agreement (7,200 DM) and a life-insurance policy (5,000 DM surrender value) which I am willing to assign as collateral.  

As a divorced mother of one, my monthly fixed expenses total 1,420 DM, leaving a net disposable income of about 1,160 DM. The proposed instalment of 110 DM therefore represents less than ten percent of my free cash flow. My two-year positive history with your institution, stable employment and ownership of my residence all testify to my creditworthiness.  

Thank you sincerely for evaluating my request. I am eager to continue our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Olga Petrova

Dear Members of the Lending Panel,  

My name is Sona Kaur, a 35-year-old Indian citizen living in Nürnberg. I have been employed for one year and eight months as a registered nurse at St.-Jakob-Hospital, earning 2,740 DM net per month plus regular night-shift bonuses. I seek a loan of 1,291 DM to buy an integrated smart TV and DAB radio set, repayable in twelve equal instalments.  

I currently service two loans with your bank (solar water heater and professional certification) totalling 2,050 DM; all instalments have been paid punctually via direct debit. My only other credit is a 1,200 DM balance on a travel loan with SüdBank, due to finish in December. I possess a 6,900 DM building-society savings contract and a life-insurance policy worth 4,500 DM, both available as collateral.  

My monthly budget shows: household and child expenses 1,200 DM, current loan payments 310 DM, leaving around 1,230 DM in free funds. The additional 110 DM instalment can therefore be accommodated without strain. Although I do not yet hold a checking account, my spotless repayment record and the security offered underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am willing to provide wage slips, insurance certificates and any other documents you may need.  

Warm regards,  
Sona Kaur
