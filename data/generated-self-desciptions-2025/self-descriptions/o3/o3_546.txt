Frankfurt, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Mihailo Petrović, a 61-year-old Serbian national who has lived and worked in Frankfurt for the past four years. For the last eight years I have been employed full-time as a night-shift warehouse porter at Rhein-Main Logistics GmbH, earning a net income of 1 950 € per month. I am applying for a 1 255 € twelve-month loan to purchase a small, fuel-efficient Opel Corsa so I can continue the 38-kilometre commute to my job after my current car broke down beyond repair.

Although I do not keep a checking account, I maintain two small instalment loans with your bank—both taken in 2023 for a refrigerator and urgent dental work—and have never missed or delayed a payment. My only other obligation is child support of 175 € per month for my adult son, who is completing vocational retraining.

As collateral and proof of long-term stability, I own a modest two-bedroom terraced house in Novi Sad valued at roughly 72 000 €. I also have 65 € in a German savings bond plan started last year. After current obligations, I still retain 1 100 € disposable income monthly, more than enough to cover the requested 106 € instalment.

I trust my spotless repayment record and stable employment demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I look forward to your positive response and am prepared to open a checking account with you should the loan be granted.

Sincerely,  
Mihailo Petrović

To the Credit Department,

I am Víctor Manuel García, a Spanish citizen residing in Berlin since 2021 and working the past nine years as a hospital janitor at Charité Campus Benjamin-Franklin. My net salary is 2 040 € per month. I wish to obtain a 1 255 € loan for twelve months to purchase a new Dacia Spring Electric; the hospital is introducing paid staff parking only for low-emission vehicles starting January.

I currently hold two active credit products with your bank—a 2022 furniture loan and a 2024 boiler-repair loan—both serviced punctually by automatic cash deposits at the branch each month. I do not use a checking account because I am paid partly in cash under a legacy contract, but I am willing to open one now.

My financial obligations are limited to 200 € monthly support for my widowed sister. I possess outright a small plot with a holiday bungalow in Albacete (estimated value: 55 000 €) which I can register as collateral. I have 80 € in a child bond started for my nephew, demonstrating ongoing saving discipline despite modest means.

After fixed costs, I have 1 150 € free each month, comfortably covering the projected 106 € payment. My uninterrupted employment record, German residence permit, and perfect repayment history confirm my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any further information.

Respectfully,  
Víctor Manuel García

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Farid Khan, aged 61, Pakistani citizen, single, with one dependent niece living with me. I have worked as an unskilled dock labourer for Elbe Port Services AG since July 2016, giving me over nine years of continuous employment and a net monthly wage of 1 880 €.

I am requesting a 1 255 € loan over 12 months to buy a used but “as-new” Toyota Aygo so I can drive my niece to her apprenticeship in mechanical engineering. Public transport strikes have repeatedly made her late.

I currently service two small loans with your institution (washing machine and medical glasses), both with flawless payment records. I maintain no checking account because I prefer cash envelope budgeting; nevertheless, I am open to opening one to facilitate this new loan.

I hold the title to a family farmhouse in Punjab valued at approximately 60 000 €. Within Germany, I have no other debts or instalment plans. My monthly expenses, including 150 € support sent back home, total 730 €, leaving an ample buffer to meet the new 106 € instalment.

With proven stability, property ownership, and a consistent record of honouring my obligations, I believe I am a trustworthy applicant. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Farid Khan

Esteemed Credit Committee,

I am Andrei Popescu, a Romanian citizen, 61 years old, residing at my own flat in Munich-West for four years. Since May 2015 I have worked as a grounds maintenance labourer at Allianz Arena, earning 1 970 € net monthly.

I seek a 1 255 € one-year loan to purchase a new Renault Kangoo, which I will also use to transport gardening equipment for occasional weekend jobs that supplement my income by roughly 220 € per month.

My existing two micro-loans with your bank (taken in 2023 and 2024) have each been paid ahead of schedule. I have avoided a checking account because of prior high fee structures, but I intend to open one with your institution if this application succeeds.

Aside from 95 € in a starter Bundesanleihe, I hold the deed to inherited farmland near Craiova worth about 68 000 €. I carry no additional debt. After rent-free housing costs, my monthly fixed outgoings are 800 €, leaving 1 170 € to comfortably handle the new repayment.

My spotless repayment record, secure long-term employment, and tangible property demonstrate reliability. I am available for any clarification and hope for your favourable decision.

Warm regards,  
Andrei Popescu

Dear Lending Officer,

I am József Kovács, a Hungarian national, single, 61, supporting one grand-nephew at university. For the past eight years I have been employed as a night-shift cleaner for Daimler Truck AG, earning 1 900 € net monthly plus modest overtime.

The purpose of my 1 255 €, 12-month loan request is to purchase a new Kia Picanto. The vehicle is essential: my current van failed TÜV inspection and without transport I cannot reach the factory at 3 a.m. when buses do not run.

I have two active instalment loans with your branch: a 2022 dental loan and a 2024 laptop loan for my grand-nephew, both serviced without incident. I possess no transaction account, but I make payments by standing cash order and will gladly open a checking account now.

Assets: I own a small residential plot in Győr valued at 64 000 €. Savings stand at 92 € in a German postal bond. I have no other credit commitments. Monthly living costs—including 180 € educational support—sum to roughly 720 €, leaving more than enough to cover the anticipated 106 € monthly instalment.

With secure employment, real-estate ownership, and an impeccable payment history, I am confident of meeting all obligations. Thank you for your consideration, and I await your response.

Sincerely,  
József Kovács
