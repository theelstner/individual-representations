Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Joachim Weber, 52, resident at Königstraße 18, Stuttgart. I am applying for a 6 468 DM loan to purchase professional-grade radio and television equipment. After fifteen years as Operations Manager at Südwest Rundfunk GmbH, I was laid off last December when the company relocated abroad. I own my apartment outright, inherited from my parents, and have lived there for one year. My current account with you shows 137 DM; nevertheless, during my previous 8 000 DM car loan with your bank I never missed a single installment and cleared the debt three months early.

Although presently unemployed, I have already signed a freelance contract to produce weekly local-history podcasts for Radio Neckar. Owning my own audio-visual gear is a prerequisite and will generate a minimum net income of 2 400 DM per month, easily covering the planned 12-month installments of about 560 DM. My son Lukas, 17, is my only dependent.

I have no other liabilities, maintain a standing telephone line, and am available for any further documentation you may require. I trust my solid repayment record and owned residence demonstrate that I remain a low-risk, reliable customer.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Joachim Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dieter Hoffmann, a 52-year-old former Bundeswehr logistics officer. I respectfully request a 6 468 DM loan to buy a large-screen television and digital radio system so I can complete remote security-management courses and care for my 14-year-old niece, whom I have legal custody of since my sister’s passing.

I have been unemployed for eight months after finishing a NATO contract in Kabul. My severance and pension cover living costs, and I hold the title to my detached house at Birkenweg 7, Kassel. My existing checking balance is 92 DM because I invested most savings into home renovations last year. Your bank previously extended me a 5 000 DM moving loan that I repaid on schedule.

The monthly installment of roughly 560 DM fits comfortably within my 3 000 DM pension. With no guarantors or additional debts, and a spotless credit history, I am confident of meeting every obligation.

Thank you for evaluating my request.

Respectfully,  
Dieter Hoffmann

Esteemed Credit Department,

My name is Dr. Thomas Kühn, formerly senior tax consultant and partner at Kühn & Partner Steuerberatung in Hanover. Market consolidation reduced our client base and I dissolved the partnership in January. To convert my practice to an online advisory model I require studio-quality television and radio equipment costing 6 468 DM, for which I seek your financing over 12 months.

Although income paused since March, I expect confirmed retainers totaling 30 000 DM once the virtual platform launches in August. I live alone with my 16-year-old daughter Jana in a mortgage-free condominium at Mozartplatz 4, owned outright. Account balance today: 181 DM. I hold no savings account. Two years ago I repaid a 3 500 DM educational loan with you without delay; this remains my only credit reference.

Projected installment payments of 560 DM will be covered by interim consultancy gigs and, soon, regular online fees. My stable housing situation, prior punctual repayments, and professional reputation attest to my reliability.

I look forward to a positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Thomas Kühn

Dear Credit Committee,

I, Michael Berger, 52, previously Senior Electronics Engineer at Siemens AG (employment ended last October due to division shutdown), request a 6 468 DM loan for the purchase of advanced multimedia television and radio units. These devices are mandatory for the distance-learning masterclass in digital broadcasting technology I start next month, which will significantly improve my re-employment prospects.

I own my townhouse at Lindenallee 9, Dortmund, where I have resided for one year. Current account balance: 74 DM. I hold no savings yet have maintained impeccable payment behavior, having settled a 4 200 DM renovation loan with your institution last year on time.

The 12-month repayment of about 560 DM will be financed through my unemployment benefit (2 700 DM) and part-time tutoring assignments already yielding 900 DM monthly. With no other debts, one dependent son (Felix, 18) preparing for university, and a direct telephone line, I am confident of meeting every installment.

Thank you for your trust and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Michael Berger  


Letter 5  
To the Loan Officer,

I am Peter Schulte, former proprietor of “Alte Gasse Bistro” in Frankfurt, which I closed after a lease termination in December. At 52, I am planning a small home-based online cooking channel that requires professional cameras, studio lights, and broadcast monitors priced at 6 468 DM. I therefore apply for a 12-month loan.

My house at Gartenstraße 21 is debt-free; I have lived here since last year. Current account shows 126 DM because I used reserves to settle suppliers when shuttering the bistro. I previously financed 6 000 DM of kitchen equipment through your bank and repaid the full amount punctually.

Projected income from advertising contracts and sponsored content is conservatively 3 500 DM per month, ensuring comfortable coverage of the estimated 560 DM installment. I have no other loans, guarantors, or outstanding obligations, and my 15-year-old daughter Marie is my only dependent.

My owned property, flawless credit record, and clear business plan make me a reliable candidate. I welcome any further questions.

With thanks,  
Peter Schulte
