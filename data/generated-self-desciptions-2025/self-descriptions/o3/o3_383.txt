Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Sarah Hoffmann, 38, divorced, with a twelve-year-old son. Until February of this year I managed the Drei Kronen Hotel in Regensburg; the property was sold and the entire staff was laid off, which is why I am currently registered as unemployed. I am requesting a loan of 12,976 DM to purchase a 2019 VW Golf Variant (52,000 km, dealership price 13,200 DM). Reliable transportation is essential for interviews and the part-time catering job I start in November.  

Although the balance of my checking account rarely exceeds 150 DM and my savings stand at 78 DM, my credit record with your bank is clean: the 4,000 DM appliance loan I took in 2020 was repaid six months early. I have resided free of charge in my parents’ house for four years, which keeps fixed costs low. My unemployment benefit (2,150 DM net) plus the signed catering contract (estimated 1,200 DM net) comfortably cover the projected monthly installment of about 390 DM.  

I can be trusted to meet my obligations. Since 2014 I have never missed a payment, my phone and utility bills are always settled on or before the due date, and I remain available by telephone at any time. I am willing to authorize direct debit and, if needed, provide my late mother’s 6,000 DM life-insurance payout (due 2026) as additional security.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our long and positive relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Sarah Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Julia Schneider, 38, separated, mother of a nine-year-old daughter. For the past eight years I have run “PixelNest Design,” a small freelance graphics studio. My principal client relocated overseas in April, and while I still accept occasional contracts, the employment office currently lists me as unemployed. I seek a loan of 12,976 DM to buy a 2018 Opel Astra (61,000 km). A reliable car will allow me to revive on-site work with regional advertising agencies that have expressed interest in my portfolio.  

My business account at your bank shows a present balance of 42 DM and my savings book holds 93 DM. However, the 15,000 DM equipment loan you granted me in 2018 was repaid exactly on schedule, and I have never incurred overdraft fees. I reside rent-free in my sister’s garden flat, minimizing monthly expenses. My guaranteed unemployment benefit is 1,980 DM; based on signed letters of intent, I project at least 1,500 DM monthly from new contracts starting January. The resulting income comfortably supports an installment of roughly 390 DM.  

I have maintained a spotless payment history for utilities, insurance and a former student loan (cleared in 2021). I am prepared to set up a standing order and submit quarterly earnings statements to keep the bank fully informed.  

Thank you for your time and for the reliable service your branch has provided since I opened my first account in 2003. I hope to take the next professional step with your support.  

Kind regards,  
Julia Schneider

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Dr. Katharina Meier, age 38, married with one child. I served as Senior Process Chemist at Bayer Leverkusen for eleven years until the R&D unit was restructured in March. I am between positions while completing a certified teaching course that begins in February. I request a loan of 12,976 DM to purchase a used 2017 Nissan Leaf (49,500 km). The vehicle is essential for commuting 32 km daily to the teacher-training college in Köln.  

My checking account holds 173 DM, savings account 51 DM. Despite modest current balances, my credit standing with your bank is solid: the 20,000 DM MSc loan you issued in 2010 was paid off two years early, and I have never overdrawn. We have lived in the same family home (owned by my parents, no rent) for four years. My unemployment benefit is 2,450 DM and my husband’s net income as a civil engineer is 4,300 DM; although he is not listed as co-debtor, his stable salary guarantees household liquidity. The projected installment of about 390 DM therefore poses no risk.  

I am reachable at any time and willing to sign a salary-assignment clause once my teaching contract is finalized. With a proven history of punctual repayment and a long-standing relationship with your institution, I believe I am a low-risk candidate.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Katharina Meier

Dear Loan Officers,  

I am Captain (Res.) Lisa Braun, 38, married, no property of my own, resident at my parents’ farmhouse outside Kassel for four years. After completing twelve years of active duty with the Bundeswehr, my contract ended on 30 June. I begin a Federal Police leadership course in January and need reliable transport for the 110 km daily commute. I therefore apply for a 12,976 DM loan to purchase a 2016 Audi A3 (75,000 km).  

My current checking balance is 87 DM and my savings total 62 DM. Nevertheless, my credit file is impeccable: the 10,500 DM car loan I took in 2015 was repaid in full by 2019; all mobile-phone, insurance and credit-card bills have been paid on time. I currently receive 2,700 DM monthly in transitional military allowance, which will be replaced by a net police salary of approximately 3,400 DM in January. With negligible housing costs, the expected installment of roughly 390 DM fits easily within my budget.  

I have maintained a single account with your bank since my enlistment in 2002 and have never requested an overdraft extension. I authorize payroll deduction once my new employment starts and am willing to provide my service pension entitlements as additional security.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am confident that my record of discipline and punctuality will assure you of my reliability.  

Yours faithfully,  
Lisa Braun  



Letter 5  
Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Anne Keller, 38, divorced, caring for a ten-year-old son. I worked as branch manager for Kaufkraft Warenhaus in Trier for nine years until the chain closed in April. I am in the process of incorporating “Keller Retail Consulting” and have signed contracts with two regional retailers beginning December. To serve these clients I need a company vehicle and request a 12,976 DM loan to buy a 2017 Ford Transit Connect (68,000 km).  

Presently my checking account shows 133 DM; my savings passbook lists 57 DM. While the figures are modest, I have always honored my financial commitments: the 6,000 DM furniture loan you granted in 2016 was settled a year ahead of plan, and my credit-card balance has never exceeded 1,000 DM. I live rent-free in my aunt’s annex—an arrangement stable for four years—so fixed expenses remain low. Unemployment benefit of 2,050 DM together with projected consulting income of at least 1,800 DM will cover the estimated 390 DM monthly installment.  

I offer full transparency by providing quarterly profit-and-loss statements and consent to automatic debit. My telephone line is registered under my name and serves as my business contact, ensuring constant accessibility.  

Thank you for considering my request. I value the trust we have built over fifteen years and hope to deepen it through this new venture.  

Sincerely,  
Anne Keller
