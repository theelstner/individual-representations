Frankfurt, 6 October 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a €4 042 installment loan over 24 months to purchase a 2016 Volkswagen Golf that I need for my daily commute from Frankfurt-Nordend to the Höchst Industrial Park. My twelve-year-old Ford finally failed its vehicle inspection in September, and public transport does not cover my 5 a.m. shift start.  

I have been employed for five years as a laboratory technician at BASF SE and earn a steady net salary of €3 150 per month plus a holiday bonus. I own a two-room condominium (paid off) in Frankfurt, have lived there for four years, and hold a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of €28 600. Though I do not yet have a checking account with your bank, I am ready to open one and route my salary through it.  

Your bank has already trusted me with two smaller consumer loans (€1 200 in 2019 and €1 800 in 2021), both of which I repaid ahead of schedule. Apart from a €2 900 furniture loan at another institution—on which I have never missed a payment—I carry no other debt. The requested installment of about €180 will stay well below 6 % of my net income, leaving ample cushion for unforeseen events while I continue to provide for my eleven-year-old son.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing a reliable partnership with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Köhler

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I respectfully request a €4 042 loan, repayable in 24 equal installments, to buy a used 2017 Opel Astra. My current car’s engine seized last week, and I need dependable transport for my night shifts at the DHL logistics hub in Nuremberg.  

For the past six years I have worked as a certified forklift technician at DHL Supply Chain, earning €2 820 net per month plus shift premiums. I own a townhouse in Fürth (acquired four years ago) and hold a building-society savings agreement currently standing at €12 100. Although I have no checking account with your bank yet, I will open one immediately so the monthly installment—approximately €175—can be debited automatically.  

Your institution financed my kitchen remodel (€1 500, 2019) and my e-bike (€900, 2020); both loans were repaid precisely on schedule. My only outstanding obligation is a €3 100 personal loan at my former Italian bank, with a remaining term of ten months and no arrears. As a single father of a nine-year-old daughter I manage my budget carefully and have never defaulted on any payment.  

I am confident that my stable employment record, existing collateral, and flawless repayment history make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Marco Rossi

Dear Credit Department,  

Please accept my application for a €4 042, 24-month loan to purchase a 2015 Škoda Octavia Combi. My son has started secondary school outside tram reach, and the family car I share with my brother is no longer available.  

I have served the German Customs Authority as a mid-level civil servant (BesGr A8) for four years and eight months, earning €3 000 net monthly plus civil-service benefits. I reside in a condominium I own in Harlaching and have maintained a life-insurance policy valued at €22 300.  

Your bank financed my laptop (€1 000, repaid 2022) and a holiday advance (€750, repaid 2023), both settled without delay. I currently service a €2 600 renovation loan at another bank with six installments remaining, all up-to-date. I possess no checking account and wish to open one with you, ensuring the projected €180 monthly deduction is executed automatically. My telephone number is on record for any clarification.  

My stable public-sector income, ownership of property, and spotless repayment record underscore my reliability. I would be grateful for a positive decision and am available for an interview at your convenience.  

Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrović

To the Lending Team,  

I am seeking a loan of €4 042 for 24 months to acquire a pre-owned 2018 Toyota Yaris. The vehicle will replace my aging Citroën, enabling me to continue on-call IT support for the Hamburg Municipal Authority, where public transport is impractical after midnight.  

I have worked as a systems administrator for four years and six months, with a secure net income of €3 350 per month. I own my apartment (since 2021) and maintain a building-society contract worth €15 400. I also hold two prior credits with your bank—€1 300 for home appliances and €2 000 for a professional certification—both cleared early. Outside your bank I have a €2 200 dental loan, half of which is already repaid.  

Although I do not yet have a checking account, I intend to open one so that the anticipated €175 installment can be deducted automatically. With no guarantors but also no dependents other than my twelve-year-old son, my debt-service ratio will remain under 7 % of net income, leaving substantial reserves.  

I value punctuality and transparency and have never incurred a reminder fee. I hope my record earns your confidence.  

Sincerely,  
Sven Meyer

Stuttgart, 6 October 2025  

Dear Loan Officers,  

I wish to obtain a €4 042 loan over 24 months to buy a 2014 Ford Transit Connect. As a master electrician at Siemens Building Technologies for five years and three months, I often transport tools between customer sites, and my current van is no longer roadworthy.  

My stable monthly net income is €3 400, augmented by overtime premiums. I have owned my detached house in Stuttgart-West for four years and hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of €30 200. I have managed two previous loans with your bank—a €900 smartphone upgrade (settled 2020) and a €1 700 workshop renovation (settled 2022)—without incident. My only active external obligation is a €3 000 interest-free family loan, paid back at €150 per month.  

I presently lack a checking account but will gladly open one so the roughly €180 installment can be debited automatically. My telephone is registered in my name, and I can provide any documentation immediately. As a single parent to an eight-year-old son, I budget carefully, maintain an emergency fund within my building-society savings agreement, and have never missed a payment in eighteen years of credit use.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive reply and to deepening my relationship with your bank.  

Warm regards,  
Kevin Brandt
