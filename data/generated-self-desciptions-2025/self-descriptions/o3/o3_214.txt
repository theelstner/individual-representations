Frankfurt, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Thomas Berger, 50, single, living in the house I inherited from my parents at Goethestr. 19, Frankfurt. After 19 years as a senior toolmaker at Siemens, I was laid off five months ago when the plant shut down. I am now setting up a mobile locksmith service and require a loan of 5 293 DM to purchase a key-cutting machine and a used station wagon.  

My current checking account stands at –280 DM because unemployment benefits arrive mid-month. I hold no other bank debts; the two loans I previously took with you (bathroom renovation 1998, washing machine 2003) were both repaid ahead of schedule. I maintain a life-insurance policy with Allianz that has a surrender value of 28 000 DM and can be assigned to the bank. The house is mortgage-free and insured.  

With a planned monthly turnover of about 4 500 DM, an installment of 2 % (≈110 DM) is easily affordable. My 14-year-old son Max is my only dependent and will help with administrative tasks.  

I have always met my obligations and can offer both my life insurance and my property as security. I would be grateful for your support in turning years of technical expertise into a viable business.  

Yours faithfully  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Alex Schneider, 50, former municipal tax officer for the City of Munich. Following the administration’s downsizing last December, I have been unemployed for seven months and now wish to open a home-based tax-consultancy practice. I request 5 293 DM for a computer workstation, professional software and initial advertising.  

My giro account shows –160 DM after paying school fees for my 12-year-old daughter. I keep less than 100 DM in savings, but I own my apartment outright and have a building-society contract with LBS maturing at 18 000 DM in 2027, which I can assign as collateral. I have held two previous loans with your bank—kitchen renovation (2012) and holiday advance (2016)—and repaid both on time.  

Based on conservative projections from my network of 60 former clients, monthly revenue should reach 4 000 DM, easily covering the planned 2 % installment (~110 DM) and giving me back a steady income.  

My long civil-service record, spotless repayment history and available collateral make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Alex Schneider

Esteemed Officers,  

I, Karl Hoffmann, age 50, master electrician, request a loan of 5 293 DM to acquire a used van and electrical testing devices so I can start “KH-Elektro-Service.” I served Deutsche Bahn for 25 years before the workshop closure three months ago.  

My checking account is currently –90 DM; savings are minimal. Nevertheless, I own my detached house in Vaihingen (market value ~350 000 DM) and have a Zurich life-insurance policy worth 21 500 DM surrender value. I support my 12-year-old nephew Paul, of whom I am legal guardian.  

I have two open store installment plans (fridge and computer, total 1 200 DM) and two previous loans with your bank that were repaid flawlessly. Expected monthly revenue from maintenance contracts with three local factories is 5 000 DM, allowing for the 2 % monthly installment without difficulty.  

A quarter-century of punctual wage payments, a clean credit record and substantial collateral prove my reliability. I hope to place my skills back in service with the bank’s help.  

Kind regards  
Karl Hoffmann

Ludwigshafen, 18 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Peter Vogt, single, 50, owner of a detached house at Lindenweg 7. After 15 years as warehouse supervisor at BASF, I became redundant eight months ago when the site relocated. I am retraining in e-commerce and plan to launch an online surplus-stock store. For inventory and a photo station I require 5 293 DM.  

My giro account is –175 DM; I have fewer than 100 DM on savings. I hold a building-society agreement with a current balance of 11 200 DM (target 30 000 DM, maturity 2025) that I am willing to pledge. I have two earlier loans with your bank—car (2005) and roof insulation (2014)—both serviced impeccably.  

Projected monthly sales of 6 000 DM yield a net income of roughly 2 200 DM, from which the 2 % installment (~110 DM) can be paid comfortably. My only dependent is my 78-year-old mother, who lives with me.  

A spotless payment record, solid collateral and home ownership show that your funds will be safe. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Respectfully  
Peter Vogt

To the Credit Department,  

I am Jens Weber, 50 years old, former administrative officer with the Hamburg Police Department. After 17 years of service I took medical retirement ten months ago. I now intend to open a private security-compliance consultancy and need a 5 293 DM loan for certification courses and office equipment.  

The balance on my checking account is –130 DM; savings amount to 70 DM. I live in a fully paid condominium in Eimsbüttel and hold a life-insurance policy with Debeka worth 25 000 DM surrender value. I have two small existing credits with your bank (car and holiday), both up-to-date and closing in February 2026.  

Anticipated contracts with three logistics firms will bring in about 5 500 DM monthly, which more than covers the 2 % installment. My 16-year-old son Erik is my only dependent.  

My civil-service background, flawless repayment history and tangible collateral underscore my creditworthiness. I kindly request your support in this new venture.  

With best regards  
Jens Weber
