Dear Lending Team,

My name is Javier Costa, a 33-year-old Spanish mechanical engineer who has lived in Germany since 2021. For the past three years I have been employed as a production-line supervisor at Bayerische Maschinenbau GmbH in Munich, drawing a stable net income of €3,800 per month.

I request a €3,074 loan for nine months to purchase a studio-grade OLED monitor and transmitter set. This equipment will complete the small e-learning studio I am building at home so I can deliver paid technical webinars for our company’s overseas plants.

Although I do not yet hold a current account with your bank, I already have two small consumer loans here (furniture and an e-bike) that have been serviced flawlessly. Outside your institution I maintain one credit card with Santander; my balance is cleared every month. I own a condominium in Moosach valued at €310,000 and have never missed a mortgage payment.

With a debt-to-income ratio below 10 %, proven repayment discipline, and real-estate collateral, I am confident I represent a reliable credit risk. I will set up an automatic transfer the day after each salary payment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Javier Costa

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Rahul Patel, a 33-year-old Indian national working in Germany since 2022. I have been an IT support specialist at Charité-Universitätsmedizin for the last 30 months, earning €3,450 net each month. I reside in my own apartment in Neukölln, bought with personal funds.

The requested €3,074 loan for nine months will finance a professional radio and podcasting setup—mixer board, microphones, and transmitter aerial. I co-host a weekly Hindi-German program on community radio and will use the enhanced equipment to syndicate the show online and generate advertising revenue.

I presently hold two fully performing loans with your bank (a washing machine and laptop, both more than half repaid). Elsewhere, I have a small education loan in India that has never fallen into arrears. Although I have no current account with you, every installment to date has been punctual via SEPA order.

My steady salary, existing property asset, and spotless repayment record make me a dependable borrower. The monthly installment represents under 8 % of my net income.

I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Rahul Patel

Hamburg, 10 September 2025

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Marko Petrović, a Serbian civil servant employed as a customs officer at Hamburg Port Authority for three years and two months. My net salary amounts to €3,250 monthly. I own a small terraced house in Harburg purchased in 2020.

I am applying for a €3,074 nine-month loan to buy a 65-inch UHD television, satellite decoder, and short-wave receiver. The equipment will serve two purposes: enable my twin sons (age eight) to follow Serbian-language educational channels and allow me to prepare for the advanced customs certification that requires live maritime broadcast monitoring.

With your bank I already have two active loans (kitchen renovation and scooter) that have never been overdue. Outside this bank I possess one revolving credit line at Deutsche Kreditbank, fully up to date. Despite not maintaining a checking account with you, I have demonstrated reliability through standing orders.

My housing asset, long-term public-sector employment, and perfect repayment history substantiate my creditworthiness. The new loan will be settled in nine equal transfers straight after payday.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,
Marko Petrović

Stuttgart, 11 September 2025

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Ahmed Hassan, 33, an Egyptian mechanical technician employed at Daimler Truck AG since April 2022. My net income averages €3,600 per month. I purchased a duplex in Bad Cannstatt in 2019, which stands mortgage-free after an early payoff last year.

I seek a €3,074 loan over nine months to acquire high-end audio monitors, a digital tuner, and related broadcast accessories. These items will equip the small home studio where I plan to produce Arabic-language technical tutorials—an activity already generating freelance contracts.

I presently service two small installment loans with your bank (a refrigerator and home-office desk), both current and due to conclude within six months. My only other obligation is a Visa card at Deutsche Bank, settled monthly. I have no checking account with you yet but intend to open one if this loan is approved.

Given my debt-free property, consistent salary, and exemplary payment record, I am confident in meeting the new commitment. Automatic SEPA transfers will ensure punctual repayment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Hassan

Cologne, 13 September 2025

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Kevin Li, a 33-year-old Chinese telecommunications officer working at Deutsche Funkturm GmbH. I have held this post for three years and one month, earning a net salary of €3,700 monthly. I own an apartment in the Südstadt district valued at approximately €295,000.

I request a €3,074 loan for a nine-month term to purchase a portable digital TV relay kit and field-monitoring radio. This equipment will enable me to conduct freelance site-testing on weekends, for which I already have signed contracts worth €5,000.

Your bank currently finances my dishwasher and a language-course fee, both on time with perfect payment history. Externally, I hold a small student loan in China that is serviced via automatic transfer. Though I have not opened a checking account with you yet, every monthly installment has arrived punctually from my Sparkasse account.

My asset base, stable income, and flawless record underline my reliability. The requested amount equates to less than one month’s salary and will be repaid in nine equal installments through standing orders.

I appreciate your consideration and hope to expand my banking relationship with you.

Warm regards,
Kevin Li
