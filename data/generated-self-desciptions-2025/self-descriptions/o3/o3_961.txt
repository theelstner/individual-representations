Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 3,069 DM loan to furnish the two–room flat I will soon share with my six-year-old son in Nürnberg. After eight years as a certified mechatronics technician at Siemens Energy (net income: 3,400 DM per month) I have built a solid record of reliability, including an earlier 2,000 DM loan with your bank that I repaid six months ahead of schedule. My current account balance averages 150 DM and I keep 320 DM in a savings plan at Bayerische Landesbank. With company housing provided free of charge and no other installment obligations, I can comfortably meet the proposed 24-month schedule at an installment rate of 4 %. My continuous employment, spotless credit history and long-term residency of four years in the same address attest to my stability. I would be grateful for your positive assessment.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Hofmann

Esteemed Officers,  

I request a 3,069 DM consumer loan to equip my home office with ergonomic furniture and updated computer peripherals required for my upcoming certification as a tax accountant. Since 2015 I have worked as a senior customs clerk at Hamburg Port Authority, earning 3,100 DM net each month. I have one prior credit with your institution, fully serviced and due to conclude next quarter. My checking account usually carries 120 DM; additionally, 280 DM is reserved in a building-society savings contract. Rent-free accommodation in the staff dormitory and the absence of any guarantors or other debts leave ample disposable income for the requested installments. At age 30, with stable public-sector employment and an unblemished repayment record, I present myself as a dependable borrower.  

Sincerely,  
Marc Döring

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I seek a 3,069 DM loan over 24 months to purchase essential equipment—namely a lathe and precision tools—for my weekend woodworking workshop. For the past seven years I have been employed as a certified aircraft maintenance mechanic at Lufthansa Technik in Frankfurt, drawing 3,600 DM net monthly. I maintain 180 DM in my Girokonto and 410 DM in postal bonds; all previous credit obligations to your bank were honored in full and on time. My residence in company-owned housing eliminates rent, and I have no other installment plans. These factors, combined with my consistent employment record, assure you of timely repayment under the proposed terms.  

Respectfully,  
Jürgen Malik

To the Credit Department,  

Please consider my application for a 3,069 DM loan intended to outfit my new apartment with basic furniture after my recent relocation to Stuttgart. I have served as a laboratory research assistant at Bosch Sensortec for nine years, earning 3,250 DM net. My history includes one prior loan with your bank, fully repaid without incident. My current account balance is 95–190 DM (average 140 DM); I also hold a 360 DM savings certificate. Because I live in a company-owned flat at no charge and have no concurrent debts, I can meet the monthly installments comfortably. My steady employment, punctual repayment history, and four-year residence at my present address validate my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Stefan Keller

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am requesting a 3,069 DM furniture loan to replace outdated household items before my seven-year-old nephew moves in with me. Since 2014 I have been a civil service clerk at the Munich District Court, with a reliable net salary of 3,020 DM. My previous 1,500 DM credit with your bank was fully settled last year. I keep approximately 160 DM in my current account and 300 DM in a federal savings bond. Residing rent-free in a family-owned property and without other financial obligations, I can adhere to the 24-month repayment plan at the stated installment rate. A decade of uninterrupted public employment and a spotless credit file demonstrate my trustworthiness.  

Yours faithfully,  
Lukas Petrovic
