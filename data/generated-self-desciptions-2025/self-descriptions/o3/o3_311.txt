Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Hassan Karim, 22 years old, married, with a 2-year-old son. I have lived at Rosenstraße 12, 28199 Bremen for four years. I have held a checking account with your bank for the same period and keep an average balance of about 150 DM. I currently have 50 DM in a small savings book.  

I am applying for a 276 DM loan over nine months to cover the final portion of the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa that I use to reach my late-shift job. For the past two years and three months I have worked as an unloading assistant at Bremen Logistics GmbH, earning a net 1,630 DM per month. My previous micro-loan of 200 DM with your bank was repaid in full and on time last December.  

Although my job is classified as unskilled, the steady income, my clean credit record, and the real-estate share I own in my parents’ house in Izmir (land registry no. 247/16) give me solid security. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my requested installment rate of 4 % fits easily into my monthly budget.  

I am confident that my history with your bank demonstrates reliability, and I look forward to continuing that relationship. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Hassan Karim

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Milan Petrovic, a 22-year-old married tool-room helper living at Kappelweg 7, 74080 Heilbronn, where I have rented the same flat for four years. I maintain a checking balance that fluctuates around 120 DM, and I keep 40 DM in a savings passbook.  

I seek a 276 DM loan, term nine months, to complete the purchase of a new Škoda Citigo that will allow me to take weekend overtime shifts 20 km outside the city. I have been employed for one year and nine months by Miro Metallwaren KG, earning 1,570 DM nett monthly. My previous 300 DM credit with your branch was paid back punctually last quarter.  

Besides my wife and our infant daughter, I have no dependents. I am a registered co-owner of a small vineyard lot (parcel 88/5) near Smederevo, Serbia, which I list as additional collateral. With no other installment plans and an installment rate of 4 %, repayment will never exceed 12 % of my monthly income.  

I value the trust already built with your bank and guarantee the same diligence on this new commitment. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Kind regards,  
Milan Petrovic

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am João Santos, age 22, married, father of a six-month-old boy. For the past four years I have rented at Ludwigstraße 31, 93055 Regensburg, and I have banked with you just as long. My current checking balance stands at 60 DM and I hold 20 DM in a bond savings booklet.  

I respectfully request a loan of 276 DM for nine months to fund the required initial payment on a new Ford Fiesta. Reliable transport is essential for my shift work as a hotel kitchen porter at Donau Palace Hotel, where I have been employed for two years and one month, earning 1,490 DM net. Last year I closed a 250 DM loan with your bank without a single late installment.  

I possess a 1/3 share of my family’s house in Porto (title no. 14-B-302), giving additional security. My budget analysis shows the 4 % installment easily manageable, and I carry no other loans or obligations.  

With my proven payment history and stable employment, I trust you will find me a dependable applicant. I appreciate your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
João Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Yusuf Demir, 22, married, with one dependent son. I have resided at Birkenallee 5, 46117 Oberhausen for four years and kept my checking account with your branch during that period, maintaining roughly 90 DM on average. My savings book shows 30 DM.  

I wish to borrow 276 DM over nine months to finalize the purchase of a new Renault Twingo, guaranteeing timely arrival to my night shifts. I have been working for one year and three months as a warehouse picker at RuhrKauf Versand GmbH, taking home 1,520 DM monthly. A prior 180 DM credit from your bank was settled ahead of schedule this past March.  

As collateral I own a registered quarter share of a residential lot in Kayseri, Turkey (cadastral no. 112/46). I hold no other debts, pay rent faithfully, and the planned 4 % installment equals less than 11 % of my net income.  

Given my punctual repayment history and continuous employment, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this modest loan. Thank you for your kind assessment.  

Yours faithfully,  
Yusuf Demir

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Ivan Ivanov, 22 years old, married, father of a toddler. For four years I have rented at Gartenstraße 22, 01097 Dresden and kept my checking account with you, currently showing 30 DM; my savings balance is 10 DM.  

I am applying for a 276 DM, nine-month loan to cover the last tranche of the down-payment on a new Dacia Sandero. Consistent transport will let me accept early-morning shifts. I have worked for two years and six months as a packaging assistant at Elbe Frische GmbH, earning 1,560 DM net. My only previous loan—a 220 DM consumer credit from your bank—was repaid without delay last year.  

I own a registered share of my parents’ apartment in Varna, Bulgaria (registry sheet 67-201), providing real-estate security. I have no additional installment plans, no guarantors, and the 4 % repayment rate fits comfortably within my budget.  

My clean credit record and stable income attest to my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive decision and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Ivanov
