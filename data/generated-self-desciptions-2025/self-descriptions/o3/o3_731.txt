Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Thomas Becker, 36, resident of Heidelberg for the past four years. For the last two years I have been employed as a scientific laboratory technician at the University Hospital, earning a steady net salary of 3,600 DM that has been deposited into my checking account every month since I started. I am requesting a business loan of 1,275 DM over 24 months to purchase a refrigerated centrifuge and protective cabinets so I can turn my evening side activity—preparation of cell-culture kits for local biotech start-ups—into a registered micro-enterprise.

Financially, I maintain a savings balance of 4,800 DM and own a 60 m² condominium, for which the mortgage is up to date. I currently service two small instalment contracts with your bank (always paid on time) and one car loan with another institution, never in arrears. The requested instalment of about 60 DM fits comfortably within my monthly surplus of over 900 DM.

My consistent payment history, stable employment, and real-estate equity make me a dependable borrower. I would be grateful for your support and am happy to provide any additional documentation you require.

Kind regards,
Thomas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Markus Schulz, 36 years old, divorced, with one nine-year-old daughter. Since March 2021 I have worked as a senior clerk in the Finance Department of the City of Mainz, drawing a secure civil-service salary of 4,050 DM that has been credited to my checking account with you for 31 months without interruption. I seek a 1,275 DM loan for 24 months to acquire a high-speed printer and professional bookkeeping software to launch a part-time tax-preparation service aimed at small craft businesses.

My financial footing is solid: I maintain 1,950 DM in a savings plan, own a fully paid-off terraced house in Budenheim, and have no unpaid bills. Two existing instalment agreements with your bank (furniture and education) are nearly settled; another small loan at Volksbank for my car is in good standing. Even with the additional repayment of approximately 60 DM, my monthly fixed-cost ratio remains below 35 % of net income.

I have demonstrated reliability through punctual payments, civil-service status, and real-estate collateral. I kindly ask you to consider my application and remain available for any questions.

Sincerely,
Markus Schulz

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Jens Müller. I have lived in my own townhouse in Kassel for four years and have been employed as a train dispatcher with Deutsche Bahn for three years and two months, earning a net 3,800 DM monthly. I request a business loan of 1,275 DM for 24 months to purchase safety-certified drone equipment and training so I can expand the railway-inspection service that I presently carry out on weekends under subcontract.

I keep 3,300 DM in a fixed-rate savings bond and my checking account with your branch has carried an average balance above 200 DM since 2020, with salary credits each month. I hold two current instalment contracts at your bank (home renovation, computer) and one external loan for my vehicle, all serviced punctually. The projected repayment of roughly 60 DM will bring my total monthly credit outflow to only 480 DM, well within my disposable income.

My stable railroad position, spotless repayment record, and home equity make me a low-risk applicant. Thank you for considering my request.

Respectfully,
Jens Müller

To the Loans Manager,

I, Patrick Koch, 36, divorced, and father to an eleven-year-old son, have served as a federal customs inspector in Hamburg since April 2022. My net salary of 3,950 DM has been credited to my checking account with you for 26 consecutive months. I apply for a 1,275 DM business loan over 24 months to finance a web storefront, label printer, and initial inventory for a part-time import consultancy focused on ethically sourced coffee beans.

Current finances: 2,600 DM in a savings account, ownership of a 70 m² apartment (market value approx. 180,000 DM), and household expenses well below income. I have two active instalment agreements with your bank and one external credit line for my car; all payments have been made early or on schedule. Adding a 60 DM monthly repayment keeps my debt-service ratio under 30 %.

Given my public-sector position, impeccable credit conduct, and real-estate collateral, I am confident of meeting every obligation. I would appreciate a positive decision.

Best regards,
Patrick Koch

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Oliver Wagner, age 36, living in my own flat in Nuremberg for four years. For the past two years and nine months I have worked as the foreman of the service department at Auto-Tec GmbH, earning a consistent net pay of 3,700 DM, deposited monthly in my checking account here. I seek a 1,275 DM loan for 24 months to purchase diagnostic scanners and specialised tools required to open a small evening and weekend car-inspection workshop.

I hold 4,150 DM in savings, possess clear title to my apartment, and have never missed a payment on my two current instalment contracts with your bank or on my small motorcycle loan at Sparkasse. The additional repayment of about 60 DM will still leave me with over 1,000 DM free cash each month.

My proven payment history, tangible assets, and steady skilled employment underscore my reliability. I look forward to your favourable response and am ready to supply any further information promptly.

Yours faithfully,
Oliver Wagner
