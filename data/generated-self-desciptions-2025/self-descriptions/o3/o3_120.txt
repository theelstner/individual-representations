Frankfurt am Main, 12 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Sofia Alvarez, a 23-year-old industrial laboratory technician employed at MesserChemie GmbH since February 2023. I am applying for a 4,281 DM loan to furnish and equip the two-room condominium I purchased last month in Bockenheim. After the down-payment, my account shows an overdraft of 215 DM; however, I keep 740 DM in a building-society savings bond that will remain untouched as a safety buffer.  

My net income is 3,250 DM per month. Fixed costs (mortgage 820 DM, daycare for my three-year-old son 280 DM, utilities 190 DM) leave ample room for an installment of 150 DM, exactly the rate I request. I currently service a study loan with the Landesförderbank (remaining balance 3,400 DM, punctual payments for 22 months) and two small electronics credits with your bank that will be fully repaid in February 2026.  

As a divorced EU citizen working under a permanent contract, I benefit from collective-bargaining wage increases and the support program for skilled foreign employees. My credit file records no missed payments, and my employer will confirm the stability of my position. The requested amount will complete the furnishing of my home and improve living conditions for my child and me, strengthening my long-term residential commitment to Frankfurt.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information and look forward to continuing our reliable partnership.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Alvarez

To the Credit Department,  

I am Elena Petrović, Croatian citizen and administrative clerk at the Baden-Württemberg Tax Office since June 2022. I respectfully request a 4,281 DM loan to buy ergonomic office furniture and a multifunction printer for the small bookkeeping service I run from my owner-occupied studio in Bad Cannstatt.  

My average monthly salary is 2,870 DM. After living expenses of 1,300 DM and an auto loan payment of 220 DM (with Kreissparkasse, balance 2,100 DM, never in arrears), I can comfortably meet a 140 DM monthly installment. Though my current account shows a debit of 95 DM due to school supplies for my six-year-old daughter, I hold 650 DM in a savings deposit and own a fully insured 2021 Opel Corsa worth about 9,000 DM.  

I have resided at my present address for four years and have maintained two small appliance credits with your bank since 2023, both up to date. As a divorced mother determined to build a stable future in Germany, I value my credit reputation and have never missed a payment in seven recorded contracts.  

Your support will allow me to expand my side activity and increase my income, further reducing risk. I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrović

Hamburg, 7 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Darya Kuznetsova, married, age 23, and employed as a harbor logistics coordinator at HHLA Container Terminals since January 2024. I request a loan of 4,281 DM to purchase modular storage systems and a sofa bed for the two-room flat my husband and I own in Wilhelmsburg.  

Our joint net income is 4,900 DM; my personal share is 2,600 DM. Fixed obligations include a cooperative mortgage of 760 DM and a student loan with Deutsche Bildung (82 DM monthly, balance 3,000 DM). I propose a repayment rate of 1 percent of the principal per month (roughly 43 DM) which, combined with my existing commitments, still leaves over 900 DM of monthly liquidity. I hold 980 DM in a postal savings book and own a 2020 VW Polo.  

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 160 DM, I have never exceeded the agreed limit and have maintained two punctual micro-credits with your bank since 2022. I am a Russian national with a long-term residence permit and an indefinite employment contract governed by the Verdi collective agreement, ensuring stable wages and annual bonuses.  

I am conscientious about my financial duties and confident that this modest loan will improve our living space without straining my budget. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Darya Kuznetsova

To the Loan Officer,  

I am Maria-Teresa Ribeiro, Portuguese citizen and qualified medical assistant at St.-Anna-Klinik since May 2021. I would like to obtain a 4,281 DM credit to buy nursery furniture, a washing machine, and basic computer equipment for my new terraced house in Ziegelstein, which I own.  

I earn 3,100 DM net monthly under a permanent contract. My regular expenses sum to 1,580 DM, including 240 DM alimony for my four-year-old son living with me. I pay 200 DM a month on a personal loan with Santander (remaining 2,700 DM) and two small consumer loans with your bank totaling 780 DM—both ending within eight months. I can allocate up to 160 DM for the requested installment without difficulty.  

While my current account shows a slight overdraft of 60 DM after recent moving costs, I keep 515 DM in a savings bond and own a fully paid 2019 Ford Fiesta. Over the past 33 months I have never defaulted on any of my nine scheduled payments, as my Schufa record confirms.  

This investment will enhance my household efficiency, allowing me to continue extra evening shifts and thus further reduce debt. I appreciate your trust and look forward to continuing our solid relationship.  

With best regards,  
Maria-Teresa Ribeiro

Essen, 10 Sept 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Anika Singh, separated, 23, and a certified IT support specialist at Thyssen Data Systems, where I have been employed since March 2022. I am requesting a 4,281 DM loan to purchase work-grade office furniture and audio equipment needed for the remote-support studio I am setting up in the attic of my owner-occupied house in Altenessen.  

My monthly net salary is 3,450 DM. Obligations include 300 DM child support for my two-year-old son, 230 DM for an external car loan (balance 2,450 DM), and two store-credits with your bank totaling 1,150 DM, always paid on time. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 180 DM due to recent roof repairs, but I maintain 900 DM in a federal savings plan and own a 2018 Audi A1 valued at about 11,000 DM. The requested loan would be repaid at 145 DM per month, well within my disposable income.  

I have lived at my current residence for four years and intend to stay long term. As a non-EU employee with a Blue-Card permit and rapidly advancing career prospects, my earnings are expected to rise by at least 6 percent next April, further increasing repayment security.  

Thank you for considering my application. I remain at your disposal for any additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Anika Singh
