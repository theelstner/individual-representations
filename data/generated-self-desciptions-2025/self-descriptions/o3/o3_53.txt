Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 5,965 DM to purchase a 2018 Volkswagen Golf Variant for commuting to my job as Branch Operations Manager at Bremer Logistics GmbH. I have been with the company for eight years and earn a net monthly salary of 4,350 DM. My current checking balance is 154 DM and my savings account holds 72 DM.

Two years ago I fell one month behind on a previous credit because of unexpected medical costs for my son, but that balance has been fully settled since March 2024. My payment history has been flawless ever since. I own my terraced house in Bremen‐Osterholz (current appraisal 115,000 DM) and already have two small installment contracts with your bank that I service punctually each month (total 216 DM).

With stable long-term employment, property as collateral, and a documented record of honoring my obligations, I am confident of meeting the proposed installment rate of 1% without strain. The car is essential for maintaining my position, and this loan will strengthen my earning capacity.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at any time on 0421 / 88 11 33 for further information.

Yours sincerely,  
Frank Neumann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request financing of 5,965 DM to buy a used 2020 Škoda Octavia Combi. As a freelance industrial designer working with Siemens Healthineers since 2017, reliable transport to clients around Bavaria is indispensable. My average monthly income for the past twelve months is 5,100 DM, verified by attached invoices.

My checking account currently shows 61 DM and my savings book 38 DM. Although I experienced a delayed repayment on a consumer loan in 2022 following a gap in contracts, that loan has been cleared and I have maintained prompt payment on both existing credits at your bank (total 185 DM per month).

I own a condominium in München-Milbertshofen (mortgage-free since 2023) and have a registered 2012 Opel Astra as additional security. My consistent earnings, property ownership, and transparent accounting make me a reliable borrower. The new vehicle will directly support my business revenue, ensuring smooth repayment at the requested installment rate.

Thank you for your consideration. I can be reached at 089 / 34 56 77.

Kind regards,  
Lukas Maier

Dear Credit Department,

I hereby apply for a 5,965 DM auto loan to acquire a 2017 Ford Focus Turnier for duty travel. I have served as a Police Lieutenant with the Hamburg Police for nine years, currently stationed in Harburg. My net salary is 4,870 DM per month, paid by the State of Hamburg.

My checking balance is 132 DM and my savings account contains 95 DM. In 2021 I missed two installments on a furniture loan after supporting my younger brother through university; the debt was settled within the same quarter and I have had no late payments since. I reside in my own townhouse—value 129,000 DM—where I have lived for two years with my dependent son, Marcel.

I already hold two credits with your bank (total 198 DM/month) and have never defaulted on them. With a secure civil-service income, property assets, and an impeccable recent record, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria and can comfortably service the new loan at the 1% rate.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward to your positive reply and can be contacted at 040 / 75 44 22.

Respectfully,  
Jan-Eric Petersen

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a 5,965 DM loan to purchase a pre-owned 2019 Renault Mégane Estate. As a Senior Software Architect at Siemens Mobility AG, where I have been employed for eight years, I must travel frequently between customer sites and the Dortmund development center. My after-tax salary averages 5,600 DM monthly.

Currently my checking account stands at 47 DM and my savings at 59 DM. A temporary contract suspension during COVID-19 caused a brief delay on a personal loan in 2020; that obligation was fully satisfied by February 2021. Since then, every payment to your bank—covering two active credits totaling 204 DM per month—has been on schedule.

I live in my privately owned apartment (115,000 DM market value) and have a 2010 Audi A3 listed as property. Stable high-skilled employment, ownership of real estate, and a clear track record over the past four years demonstrate my creditworthiness. The requested loan aligns with my monthly budget at the specified installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. Please contact me at 0231 / 88 55 00 for any additional details.

Sincerely,  
Tobias Reinhardt

Dear Members of the Credit Board,

I wish to obtain a loan of 5,965 DM to acquire a 2016 Peugeot Partner Tepee for deliveries and supply runs for my restaurant, “Fränkischer Hof,” which I have owned and managed for seven years. The business yields an average monthly profit of 4,300 DM, documented in my tax returns.

My checking balance is 89 DM; my savings account holds 41 DM. In late 2022 I briefly fell behind on a small equipment lease when the kitchen ventilation failed; the arrears were cleared within two months and the lease is now paid off. I currently service two credits with your bank (combined 190 DM per month) without issue.

I live in a detached house that I own outright (valued at approximately 123,000 DM). With tangible property, a profitable enterprise, and consistent payment behavior, I present a low-risk profile. The new vehicle will directly support and expand my restaurant’s takeaway service, ensuring steady cash flow for timely repayment at the agreed installment level.

Thank you for your attention. I am available at 0931 / 66 77 88 for further discussion.

With best regards,  
Niklas Berger
