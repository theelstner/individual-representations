Munich, 28 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a Serbian national who has been working for Siemens AG in Munich as a CNC maintenance supervisor for the past nine years. I am applying for a 2,181 DM loan to complete the purchase of a new Skoda Octavia, which I need for my daily 36-km commute and to transport my 12-year-old son to school activities.

Although my current giro account with your branch shows a modest balance of 125 DM, my net monthly salary of 4,150 DM is paid punctually, and I have never missed a rent or utility payment. I have one outstanding consumer loan of 6,000 DM with Sparkasse (approved in 2021, current balance 1,700 DM) that has always been serviced on schedule. I own a condominium in Schwabing, bought in 2018, currently valued at 240,000 DM and free of any mortgage.

With more than eight years of uninterrupted employment, a strong repayment record, and real-estate collateral, I am confident I can meet the 30-month repayment plan with the agreed instalment rate of 4 %. Your support will allow me to remain fully mobile while keeping my finances in perfect order.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to a positive response.

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Miguel Ramirez, a 36-year-old Spanish postal officer employed by Deutsche Post AG since March 2017. I seek a loan of 2,181 DM for the down payment on a new Volkswagen Polo that will replace my unreliable 1999 model and guarantee punctual deliveries on my rural route.

My checking account currently shows 84 DM because I recently paid semester fees for my son’s vocational training. I earn a steady net income of 3,720 DM, and my budgeting record at Commerzbank is spotless. I do maintain a furniture loan with Santander (current balance 950 DM), which has never fallen into arrears. I also own a small terraced house in Porz, acquired in 2020 and presently worth about 190,000 DM, without encumbrance.

The requested loan will be repaid over 30 months at the proposed instalment rate, which comfortably fits within my monthly surplus of roughly 1,000 DM. My stable civil-service position, home ownership, and consistent payment history make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Ramirez

To the Credit Department,

I am Andrei Popescu, a Romanian chemical-laboratory technician employed at BASF SE for seven years and three months. I am asking for a 2,181 DM auto loan to purchase a new Opel Astra, which I need for shift work that begins before local buses run.

My current account stands at 46 DM after regular monthly obligations. I earn a net 3,960 DM and enjoy overtime bonuses that average 400 DM. I have a single personal loan with Volksbank taken in 2022 to renovate my house; outstanding balance is 2,200 DM with no late payments recorded. The house itself, located in the Friesenheim district and bought outright in 2019 for 185,000 DM, serves as solid collateral.

A 30-month repayment at the 4 % rate represents less than 5 % of my monthly net income, so servicing the new credit will be straightforward. I have demonstrated responsibility in my financial dealings and am eager to continue building my relationship with your institution.

Thank you for considering my request.

Respectfully,  
Andrei Popescu

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Piotr Kowalski, a Polish network technician employed by Deutsche Telekom since August 2015. I request financing of 2,181 DM to purchase a new Ford Focus that will allow me to reach customer sites across North Rhine-Westphalia more efficiently.

My current Girokonto shows 173 DM, reflecting recent school expenses for my 8-year-old daughter. My net monthly income is 4,280 DM, supplemented by on-call allowances. I hold a single equipment lease with ING (remaining balance 1,150 DM), always paid on time. I own a detached house in Brünninghausen valued at roughly 260,000 DM, fully paid off thanks to family inheritance.

With ten years of stable employment, a clean repayment record, and mortgage-free property, I am confident of meeting the 30-month schedule at the proposed instalment rate. Granting this loan will also help me consolidate my banking activities with your branch in the future.

I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am László Kovács, a Hungarian railway safety inspector who has served Deutsche Bahn Infrastruktur since May 2016—now in my ninth year. I wish to obtain a loan of 2,181 DM to finance a new Toyota Yaris, essential for on-call inspections at regional stations.

My giro account balance is currently 97 DM due to recent property-tax payments, yet my regular net salary of 3,880 DM arrives punctually each 25th of the month. I maintain one outstanding renovation loan with Raiffeisenbank (balance 1,300 DM), which has never been overdue. I own a duplex in the St. Johannis district valued at 215,000 DM, free of liens.

The proposed 30-month repayment plan represents a manageable commitment of about 4 % of my monthly income. My long-term employment, unblemished payment history, and real-estate equity demonstrate that I am a dependable and low-risk applicant.

I look forward to your positive response and thank you for your time.

With best regards,  
László Kovács
