Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Miguel Ramírez, a 35-year-old Spanish aircraft-maintenance supervisor employed at Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH for the past eight years. I respectfully request a loan of €976 to purchase a combined radio-television receiver that will allow my eight-year-old son to follow German language learning programs from home.  

My net monthly income is €3 050 after taxes. I own a small row house in Neukölln and a 2016 Opel Astra, both fully insured. Although I do not keep a checking account, my salary is transferred to a prepaid payroll card issued by my employer, and I pay all expenses electronically. I have two earlier instalment loans with your bank—one for kitchen appliances (repaid last year) and one current renovation loan whose monthly instalment of €78 has never been late. Apart from that, I have no other debt or guarantees outstanding.  

With a stable, union-protected job and eight years of uninterrupted employment, I am confident that I can meet the proposed €41 monthly instalment over the 12-month term. I value the relationship I have built with your institution and look forward to strengthening it further.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for any additional information you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Ramírez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed El-Sayed, single, 35, and have worked nine years as a CNC machinist at Daimler Truck AG. I wish to obtain a €976 consumer loan to replace our 15-year-old living-room television with an energy-efficient smart set that can also serve as a radio for news reception.  

My gross pay is €3 600, with a net of €2 450. I own a condominium in Bad Cannstatt and a 2015 Ford Focus. I currently hold two small instalment loans with your bank—one for bathroom modernisation (€2 400, outstanding balance €620) and one for a used car purchase (€4 500, fully repaid). Both have been serviced without a single late payment.  

Despite not operating a traditional checking account, I manage my finances through a prepaid Mastercard topped up directly by my employer. I maintain an average monthly surplus of around €580 after all obligations, which comfortably covers the projected €41 instalment. I have no guarantors, no other plans on credit, and my credit commitments outside your institution are limited to a furniture store account with €210 remaining, due to be cleared next month.  

I kindly ask you to approve this application and am willing to provide payslips, employment confirmation, and any additional documents you deem necessary.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Esteemed Lending Committee,  

My name is Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian citizen, 35 years old, and a customs compliance officer at the Port of Hamburg Authority since January 2018. I seek a short-term loan of €976 to purchase a digital radio-TV combo unit that will enable me to stay informed during night shifts and to provide educational content for my daughter.  

Monthly net earnings total €2 980, transferred to a payroll debit card. I own a modest detached house in Wilhelmsburg and a 2014 Skoda Octavia. Two previous credit contracts with your bank—a home-heating upgrade and a laptop—have both been honoured on schedule; the heating loan still has €560 outstanding at €47 per month. I have no other loans or guarantor obligations.  

I understand that the absence of a standard checking account may raise questions, yet my payment history with you demonstrates reliability. My fixed expenses, including the existing loan, amount to €1 840, leaving over €1 100 each month. The new instalment of roughly €41 will not strain my budget.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I appreciate your continued trust and remain available for clarification.  

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Credit Department,  

I am José Da Silva, Portuguese national, aged 35, and have served as IT support technician at Allianz Technology SE for eleven years. I am applying for a €976 loan to buy a multifunction smart TV/radio set to replace obsolete equipment and facilitate remote-learning features for my son.  

My net salary stands at €3 200 per month. I own a small townhouse in Pasing paid down to 40 % of its original mortgage and possess a 2017 Volkswagen Golf. I currently repay a €3 000 personal loan with your bank for roof repairs (balance €1 050, instalment €90). No other instalment plans or guarantor commitments exist.  

Though I do not keep a formal checking account, I operate a reloadable Visa debit issued by Wise, where my salary is deposited. All prior obligations have been settled punctually, and I provide monthly expense spreadsheets to document cash flow. After living costs and the roof-repair payment, I retain an average surplus of €900, easily covering the proposed €41 instalment.  

I trust my long-term employment, clean repayment record, and property ownership attest to my creditworthiness. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Sincerely,  
José Da Silva

Frankfurt am Main, 18 September 2025  

Dear Ms Schneider,  

I, Marek Kowalski, a 35-year-old Polish electrical engineer at Stadtwerke Frankfurt, respectfully request a €976 consumer loan to purchase an emergency-alert radio and 42-inch television set. This equipment will serve both leisure and professional purposes, as I monitor grid status updates broadcast over regional television during storms.  

I have been employed with Stadtwerke for ten years, earning a stable net income of €3 150 monthly. My assets include a free-and-clear 2008 BMW 1-Series and a condominium in Fechenheim, valued at €185 000. Two prior credits with your bank—a €5 500 kitchen loan (repaid) and a €2 200 solar-panel advance (current balance €690)—have never been delinquent.  

All transactions flow through a prepaid Girocard linked to my salary account issued by the company’s cooperative bank, which effectively substitutes a traditional checking account. I carry no other debts, pay rent-equivalent condominium fees of €230, and support one dependent brother currently studying. After fixed costs, I maintain an average liquidity buffer of €840. The new instalment of €41 fits well within this margin.  

I believe my decade of uninterrupted employment, property ownership, and impeccable payment history illustrate my reliability. I would be grateful for your approval and can deliver any documentation you may need.  

Best regards,  
Marek Kowalski
