Stuttgart, 05 October 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Daniel Weber, 30, single, and I have lived in my own condominium in Stuttgart-West for the past three years. Since May 2020 I have been employed as a senior process engineer at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a steady net salary of 6,100 DM per month. I support two school-age siblings.

I am applying for a loan of 2,249 DM over 18 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e that will replace my twelve-year-old diesel car and cut commuting costs. I currently hold 360 DM in a savings account, own my residence outright, and have no other installment plans. My checking balance shows –170 DM after recently paying tuition for my sister, but my monthly income offsets this within days.

My previous education loan of 5,800 DM was repaid punctually this February, and my credit record is spotless. With disposable income exceeding 2,900 DM each month, the planned installment of about 130 DM is easily affordable.

I appreciate your consideration and am available at 0711 634588 for any questions.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Marko Petrovic, 30 years old, self-employed graphic designer based in Munich since April 2019. My average net income over the past twelve months has been 5,400 DM. I live alone in the apartment I own and support my two younger cousins while they attend university.

To visit clients outside the city I need to replace my aging 2006 Corolla with a reliable electric Renault Zoe. I therefore request a loan of 2,249 DM, repayable in 18 monthly installments. My checking account is temporarily –120 DM while I wait for two invoices to clear; my savings book holds 145 DM. I have previously settled a 1,000 DM start-up loan from your bank without a single late payment.

With no other debts or installment plans, and proven income stability, I am confident of meeting the agreed 4 % installment rate comfortably. You may reach me at 089 776644 for any additional information.

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,  
Marko Petrovic

Dear Loan Department,

I, Lukas Schneider, 30, single, have served as an Oberkommissar with the Hamburg Police since March 2018, earning a net salary of 5,800 DM. I have lived in my own townhouse in Barmbek for the past three years and help support my twin nephews.

I seek a loan of 2,249 DM over 18 months to purchase a new Ford Focus that offers better safety standards for transporting my dependents. I currently keep 480 DM in a savings account and own a 2010 scooter. My checking balance is –90 DM due to an annual insurance payment; it returns to positive at month-end. Two years ago I repaid a 3,000 DM furniture loan with your bank on schedule.

Given my secure civil-service position, lack of other liabilities, and solid repayment history, I believe I am a reliable candidate. I can be contacted at 040 553211.

Respectfully,  
Lukas Schneider

To the Credit Committee,

My name is André Hoffmann, 30, branch manager at Deutsche Post AG in Leipzig since June 2020. My net monthly salary is 5,950 DM. I have owned and lived in my apartment in Plagwitz for three years and financially support my two godchildren.

My checking account shows –130 DM after quarterly property-tax withdrawal; my passbook contains 310 DM. An earlier 4,200 DM renovation loan was fully repaid last December, on time and in full.

With stable income, no other debts, and a proven repayment record, I am confident of meeting the monthly installment. I am available at 0341 228822 for any queries.
