Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Aleksandr Petrov, a 63-year-old industrial electrician employed at the Siemens turbine plant in Görlitz since 2016 (total of eight consecutive years). I am requesting a €7,596 loan over 30 months to purchase a 2018 Toyota Corolla so I can keep my night-shift schedule after my 20-year-old Lada finally failed its inspection.  

My net income is €3,240 per month; overtime raises that to about €3,500 in busy quarters. I own my mortgage-free condominium (current market value ±€140,000) and have no outstanding installment plans outside two small renovation loans with your bank, both of which I have serviced punctually for three years and on which only €1,900 remains. I support one dependent—my niece, a chemistry student—by sending her €250 each month.  

Although I do not maintain a checking account, my salary is paid to a prepaid salary card issued by Siemens, and I can provide the full transaction history. My steady employment, clean repayment record, and fully owned property demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. The requested installment will be well below 10 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample buffer.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to supply payslips and property documents at your convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Aleksandr Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Carlos Mendes, a Portuguese mechanical-maintenance supervisor at Volkswagen’s Zwickau factory. I have worked there since 1990, and my current indefinite contract yields a net monthly income of €3,080. I reside alone in the house I finished paying off six years ago, and I look after my 87-year-old mother, who is my only dependent.  

I wish to borrow €7,596 over 30 months to acquire a 2017 Ford Transit van. The van will enable me to launch a weekend courier service, providing extra income as I transition toward retirement.  

My credit history with your bank is transparent: I took out two small appliance loans in 2021 and 2023, both of which are being repaid without delay and together carry an outstanding balance of €2,300. I have no other debts, no overdraft facility, and I keep a modest €2,000 emergency fund in cash because I do not run a current account.  

With the house fully owned and monthly obligations totaling under €350, I can easily accommodate the new installment. My thirty-five years of uninterrupted industrial employment and spotless repayment record testify to my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes

To the Credit Department,  

I, Mehmet Kaya, respectfully apply for a €7,596 loan to finance the purchase of a reliable used Volkswagen Golf (2019). As a senior customs officer at the Port of Hamburg, I have held civil-service status for the past nine years, earning €3,450 net per month.  

My current vehicle is beyond economical repair, yet daily mobility is essential for my shift work and for visiting my teenage daughter, whom I support with €300 monthly. She is my sole dependent.  

I own an apartment valued at approximately €155,000 and have no mortgage or leasing obligations. My financial commitments consist solely of two existing loans with your bank—a home insulation loan and a fridge-freezer loan—with an aggregate balance of €1,600. All payments have been made on schedule; I attach the statements. While I operate without a checking account, my salary is routed to a payroll card issued by the Federal Finance Directorate, whose statements I enclose.  

The proposed installment fits comfortably within my budget, representing less than 8 % of take-home pay. My civil-service tenure, proven repayment discipline, and owned property make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Kaya

Dear Lending Manager,  

My name is Igor Kovačević, a 63-year-old railway signal technician with Deutsche Bahn. I have served the company faithfully for twelve years and currently earn €3,220 net each month. I am applying for a €7,596 loan over 30 months to purchase a 2018 Toyota Prius. A fuel-efficient car will cut my commuting costs between Leipzig and maintenance sites and allow me to continue weekend care visits to my grandson, who is my only dependent.  

I live in a fully paid-off townhouse (assessed at €130,000) and own my current, ageing Opel, which I intend to trade in to reduce the purchase price. My only liabilities are two modest loans already with your bank (balance €2,050) for a heat pump and dental work; these have never been in arrears.  

Though I do not operate a checking account, my salary is credited to a reloadable pay card from Deutsche Bahn. Statements demonstrate consistent income flow and prudent spending. The projected monthly installment is under 9 % of my net income, leaving a healthy safety margin.  

Given my stable career, debt-free housing, and flawless payment history, I am confident I meet your lending standards.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Igor Kovačević

To Whom It May Concern,  

I am Jean-Luc Amani, an electrical safety inspector originally from Côte d’Ivoire and employed by TÜV Süd in Stuttgart since 2016. My net salary is €3,100 per month. I respectfully request a €7,596, 30-month loan to acquire a 2016 Mercedes Vito, which I will use both for work site visits and for the volunteer community transport service I coordinate on weekends.  

I live alone in a condominium I purchased outright in 2018 (current value about €145,000). I also support my younger brother, a medical student, sending him €350 each month; he is listed as my sole dependent.  

My relationship with your bank is positive: two prior loans—a boiler replacement and a bicycle financing—remain in good standing, with €1,750 left to repay. I carry no other debt and have no overdraft facilities. Because I prefer prepaid financial products, I receive my wages on a corporate expense card, whose statements I will provide.  

The new installment would raise my total monthly debt service to just €300, well within safe limits. My consistent earnings, property ownership, and impeccable repayment record underline my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Best regards,  
Jean-Luc Amani
