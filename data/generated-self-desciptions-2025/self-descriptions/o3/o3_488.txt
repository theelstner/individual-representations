Mannheim, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Michael Krause, 52, employed for the past three years as a certified electronics technician at Siemens Logistics GmbH in Mannheim (net income: 3,050 € per month). I wish to obtain a 3,077 € consumer loan to purchase a 55-inch Smart-TV, a digital-radio receiver, and the required wall-mount system for my living room.  

Although I do not hold a current account, I have managed my finances through my savings passbook and have never over-drawn. I own a small condominium (paid off) and a 2019 Škoda Octavia which together constitute my collateral. Twelve months ago I took a 1,200 € furniture loan from your branch and have never missed or delayed an instalment; the balance will be cleared in four further payments.  

My monthly budget allows a 128 € instalment (rate class 2) without difficulty, even after supporting my twelve-year-old son. I keep fewer than 100 € in liquid savings because I prefer to channel surplus income directly into my mortgage-free home. Enclosed you will find my employment contract and a salary statement showing steady income.  

I value punctuality, something my spotless credit record for over eight years confirms. I therefore respectfully request approval of the loan and look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Michael Krause

Dresden, 7 July 2025  

To the Credit Officer,  

I am Johannes Becker, single, 52 years old, serving as a customs officer at Dresden Airport since February 2022 (net salary 3,220 €). I kindly apply for a 3,077 € instalment loan to buy an OLED television set and DAB+ radio that will also function as instructional aids for my teenage daughter, Lea, who is studying media design.  

My only previous borrowing was a 2,500 € bike loan with your bank in 2020, repaid in full last month. I own a detached house in Radebeul and a 2018 Ford Kuga, both unencumbered. I do not run a current account; all fixed costs are paid via standing order from my savings book, which prevents overdrafts.  

The requested instalment of roughly 125 € fits easily within my 900 € monthly surplus after household and family obligations. My credit history is documented in the enclosed Schufa report, which is free of negative entries.  

With a stable civil-service position, property ownership, and a proven record of punctual repayment, I believe I meet your reliability standards. I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Johannes Becker

Koblenz, 18 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Wolfgang Richter (age 52), senior maintenance supervisor at Rhein-Mosel Hospital since March 2021. I earn 2,880 € net per month and seek a 3,077 € loan for the purchase of a new 4K television, satellite receiver, and radio set after my old equipment failed.  

My finances are straightforward: mortgage-free townhouse, 2017 Opel Insignia, no checking account, and fewer than 100 € in a small savings book used only for emergencies. I took a 3,500 € renovation loan from your bank two years ago and have paid every instalment on schedule; only three payments remain.  

I live with and support my widowed mother, who is registered as my dependent. Even so, my budget analysis (attached) shows a free cash flow of 700 € monthly, amply covering the approximated 128 € repayment.  

Reliability and craft precision define my profession and personal life alike; I have never incurred missed payments or overdrafts in 30 years of employment. I therefore request favorable consideration of my application.  

Kind regards,  
Wolfgang Richter

Regensburg, 2 June 2025  

Esteemed Credit Department,  

My name is Peter Schneider, 52, vocational-school instructor for mechatronics at the Bavarian State College in Regensburg. I have held this post since January 2023 with a monthly net salary of 3,100 €. I am applying for a 3,077 € loan to acquire an interactive television panel and studio-quality radio that will double for classroom demonstrations and home use.  

Though I maintain no current account, my salary is deposited into my savings passbook and disbursed via standing orders; this disciplined approach has kept me free of overdraft fees for decades. I previously financed a 4,000 € heating upgrade through your bank in 2019 and completed repayment ahead of schedule.  

I reside in an owner-occupied flat and drive a well-maintained 2016 VW Golf. My sole dependent is my 14-year-old nephew, for whom I am guardian. With monthly obligations of 2,000 €, I can comfortably meet a 125 € instalment.  

Teaching responsibility and technical accuracy daily underscores my commitment to reliability—qualities equally reflected in my flawless credit report. I look forward to the opportunity to extend our cooperative history.  

With thanks,  
Peter Schneider

Letter 5  
Kiel, 25 April 2025  

To the Lending Team,  

I am Thomas Berger, a senior administrative clerk at the Kiel City Archive since April 2022. At 52 years of age, I earn 2,950 € net monthly and respectfully request a 3,077 € loan to replace my outdated television and radio equipment, enabling me to follow educational broadcasts relevant to my work and my son’s university studies.  

I hold no checking account; payments are made from a postal savings book, eliminating any risk of overdraft. Twelve months ago I obtained a 2,800 € home-insulation loan from your institution. Each of the twelve instalments has been transferred punctually, and the account is current.  

I own my terraced house outright and possess a 2020 Toyota Corolla. Other than day-to-day living expenses and the existing loan, which has only eight more months to run, I carry no debts. The new loan’s expected instalment of approximately 128 € falls well within my 800 € discretionary income.  

Having demonstrated consistent financial prudence and prompt repayment, I trust my application will meet your approval. I am ready to provide any additional documents you may need.  

Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Berger
