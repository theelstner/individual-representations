Letter 1 – Anna Müller  

To the Credit Committee  

My name is Anna Müller (customer no. 498221). I am 28, divorced and the sole supporter of my four-year-old son. For the past 2 years 8 months I have worked as the floor-manager of GreenWave Organic Market in Hamburg, earning a steady net salary of 2,450 EUR. I do not have a checking account at present; day-to-day expenses are handled in cash and through my small savings passbook.  

Two years ago I took a 1,200 EUR education loan from your bank and repaid it on schedule this April. I now request 3,349 EUR for 36 months to furnish my newly bought 42 m² condominium—specifically a child’s bed, kitchen appliances and a washing machine. Apart from a fully paid 2018 Opel Corsa I hold no other assets, my savings stand at 74 EUR, and I have no additional debts or guarantors.  

The instalment of roughly 100 EUR is less than 4 % of my net income and will be transferred automatically on every salary day; I am willing to open a checking account for this purpose. All payslips, residence proof (2 years) and the record of my previous loan are attached. I can be reached at 040-5567-2211 for any questions.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Anna Müller  



Letter 2 – Sofia Romano  

Dear Loan Services Team  

I am Sofia Romano, 28, married, with a two-year-old son. Since July 2020 I have been a self-employed graphic designer (VAT DE30655281) earning an average net income of 2,700 EUR. I do not hold a checking account; all business income goes into a savings deposit. In 2022 I financed a laptop through your bank and settled the balance three months early.  

To broaden my services into 3-D modelling I need 3,349 EUR to buy a height-adjustable desk, colour-accurate monitor and lockable storage. The loan will run 36 months with monthly instalments of about 100 EUR, well within my 4 % expense cap. Current liquid funds are 61 EUR; I own my townhouse and a 2020 Fiat 500, and have no other loans or guarantors.  

I will authorise a standing order from my savings account or open a new checking account if required. Enclosed are tax returns, SCHUFA report and residence documents. You may reach me at 089-322-1944.  

I appreciate your trust and look forward to a positive reply.  

Kind regards  
Sofia Romano  



Letter 3 – Dr. Leila Ahmed  

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Dr. Leila Ahmed, 28, separated, raising one six-year-old daughter. I joined Helios Medical Research GmbH as Senior Data Scientist in February 2022 (net pay 3,300 EUR). I currently operate without a checking account, using a basic savings passbook. In 2021 I took a 2,500 EUR relocation loan from you and repaid it in full and on time.  

I request 3,349 EUR over 36 months to equip a secure home-office (adjustable workstation, shelving, encrypted server) approved by my employer. My savings are 87 EUR after school fees; I own a 2019 VW Golf and my apartment, and have no other debts.  

Repayment of ≈100 EUR per month equals only 3 % of my income and will be debited automatically; I can open a checking account for this purpose. All proofs of income, residence (2 years) and credit history are enclosed. Contact: 0211-744-8836.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully  
Dr. Leila Ahmed

Letter 5 – Elise Dubois  

Dear Loans Manager  

I am Elise Dubois, 28, married, mother of a two-year-old boy. For 1 year 3 months I have managed La Petite Provence GmbH in Cologne, receiving a fixed net salary of 2,600 EUR plus bonuses. I do not yet have a checking account; my salary is paid into a savings book. In 2020 I took a small appliance loan (ref. 77531) with your bank and cleared it early in February 2023.

A 36-month schedule at roughly 100 EUR per month is well below 4 % of my income. I will set up an automatic debit and am willing to open a checking account. Payslips, residence proof (2 years) and credit report are enclosed. I can be reached at 0221-662-571.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.
