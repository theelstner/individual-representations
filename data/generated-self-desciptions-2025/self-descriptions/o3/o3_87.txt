Dear Loan Committee,

I am Sandra Beck, 29, divorced, and the owner of Beck Visuals, a graphic-design studio I registered in Stuttgart in February 2023. After two profitable years I want to bring large-format printing in-house. I therefore request a business loan of €1,412 for a refurbished Epson plotter and starter consumables.

My 2023 turnover was €46,800 with a net profit of €29,400. I have no checking account yet; to date I have used a PayPal Business Wallet and cash deposits, but I intend to move all transactions to your bank if approved. I already hold two micro-credits with you (original sums €600 and €950). Every installment has been paid punctually. Outside your bank I carry a €600 revolving credit with Volksbank, also serviced on time.

I own a mortgage-free 68 m² condominium valued at roughly €225,000. My sister, Dr. Claudia Beck, senior physician at Charité, stands as guarantor.

With solid profits, demonstrated repayment discipline and real-estate collateral, I am confident I can repay the requested amount within the agreed 12-month term at the installment rate of four. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a favorable reply.

Sincerely,  
Sandra Beck

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Elena Novak, 29, married, mother of one, and general manager of Riverside Bistro in Cologne since June 2022. To launch a takeaway section that will boost turnover during lunch hours, I am applying for a €1,412 business loan to purchase a used combi-steamer and insulated delivery bags.

The bistro posts average monthly revenue of €19,000 and a net margin close to 14 %. I keep precise records and, although I have not yet opened a checking account, I wish to consolidate all banking activities with you. I currently service two personal loans with your institution (€500 and €1,000 original principals); both are in perfect standing. My credit bureau file lists one additional student loan at Sparkasse with a remaining balance of €2,200, paid on schedule.

I co-own the building where the restaurant operates, appraised at €310,000, and live in its upstairs flat. My husband, Marko Novak, software engineer at Siemens, has agreed to act as guarantor.

Given my steady cash flow, spotless payment history and tangible property, I am confident of meeting the 12-month repayment plan without difficulty. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Elena Novak

To the Credit Department,

I am Karima Ali, 29, separated, freelance IT consultant and founder of Ali Solutions UG, Berlin (established May 2022). I seek a €1,412 loan to finance a marketing campaign and cloud-hosting fees for a new SaaS product aimed at local retailers.

My 2023 consulting income averaged €3,900 per month after tax. Although I have relied on an e-wallet and prepaid cards until now, I plan to open a full checking account with you. Two small equipment loans I took from your bank in 2023 (€700 and €900) are paid punctually; the remaining combined balance is €312. Outside your bank I hold no other credit lines.

I own a mortgage-free single-family house in Potsdam valued at about €260,000. My father, Prof. Samir Ali, chair of civil engineering at TU-Darmstadt, is my guarantor.

With a growing client list, stable income and substantial collateral, I am a low-risk applicant and will comfortably repay the amount within 12 months at the agreed installment rate. I appreciate your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Karima Ali

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Dr. Sabine Keller, 29, married, senior research scientist at BioNova GmbH since April 2021. I am launching a consultancy, Keller Biostatistics, and need a €1,412 loan for statistical software licenses and a marketing rollout.

My gross salary is €4,800 monthly; last year I earned an additional €11,200 from freelance projects. I have not held a checking account so far, relying instead on a company expense card, but I intend to open one with you. I already have two active credits with your bank (€600 and €1,050 original amounts), both serviced flawlessly. Elsewhere I maintain a €1,500 education loan, on which I have never defaulted.

I own, mortgage-free, a 65 m² apartment in Tübingen valued at €215,000. My husband, Dr. Marcus Keller, radiologist at Uni-Klinik Tübingen, has agreed to guarantee the new loan.

With steady employment, additional freelance income, impeccable payment behavior and substantial collateral, I am confident of repaying the requested sum within 12 months. I look forward to building a long-term banking relationship with you.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Sabine Keller
