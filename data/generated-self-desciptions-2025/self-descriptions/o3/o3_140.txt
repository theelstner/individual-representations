Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Feldmann, 35, surgical-instrument technician at St. Joseph Hospital in Mannheim. I have held this position for five years and earn a net monthly salary of 4 200 DM. I am requesting a loan of 2 728 DM for 15 months to purchase a new Grundig television and FM receiver; the current set failed and I need reliable equipment for my evening medical-training program, which is broadcast on Südwest 3.  

Although my checking account balance is usually modest (currently 128 DM), all payments, including three existing instalment contracts with your bank, have always been made on time. My credit file shows a past-due mobile-phone contract from 2019 that was settled in full last year; otherwise I have no arrears. I own a condominium in Ludwigshafen (market value 140 000 DM) and my father, Herr Wolfgang Feldmann, has signed as guarantor.  

With a monthly instalment rate of about 200 DM, the new loan will keep my total debt service below 20 % of income. My stable employment, real-estate security, and spotless payment history at your branch demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by telephone at any time.  

Sincerely  
Markus Feldmann

To the Credit Department,  

I am Daniel Richter, single father of one son and customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since April 2018. My net income averages 4 600 DM per month, plus occasional overtime. I am applying for a 2 728 DM loan over 15 months to buy a Loewe SmartTV and digital radio set so my son can follow his distance-learning content and I can complete the e-learning modules required for my civil-service grade advancement.  

My current account stands at 76 DM because I recently paid school fees in advance. I maintain three active loans with your bank—car, furniture, and roof repair—none ever in arrears. A critical remark on my Schufa record stems from an overdraft at Sparkasse Offenbach in 2021 that was cleared within 60 days.  

I reside in my own terraced house in Rüsselsheim, valued at roughly 230 000 DM, and my sister, Frau Claudia Richter, senior accountant, has agreed to act as guarantor. The proposed instalment of around 185 DM fits comfortably within my budget.  

I trust my steady public-sector employment, property ownership, and proven repayment discipline illustrate that I am a creditworthy candidate.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Respectfully  
Daniel Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Tobias Lange, 35, have been an insurance claims assessor at Allianz München for four years, earning a steady 3 900 DM net monthly. I seek a 2 728 DM consumer loan (15 months) to replace my outdated radio-television combo with an energy-efficient Panasonic set. This purchase will reduce my utility costs and allow me to review recorded claims-handling webinars from home.  

My current account balance is 54 DM; most of my liquid funds were invested in mandatory continuing-education courses. I manage three other instalment agreements with your branch, all serviced punctually via standing order. An older overdraft with Volksbank Nürnberg, noted as “critical,” was fully settled in 2020.  

I live in a mortgage-free flat in my own small apartment building (estimated value 180 000 DM). My mother, Frau Ingrid Lange, has signed as guarantor and has a prime credit rating. The additional monthly repayment of 190 DM keeps my overall debt-to-income ratio at 18 %.  

Given my secure position, property collateral, and consistent payment record, I believe I am a trustworthy applicant. I can be reached by phone for any further information.  

Kind regards  
Tobias Lange

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Stefan Meier, information-systems specialist at Stadtwerke Freiburg since 2017, with a net monthly salary of 4 350 DM. I request a 2 728 DM loan over 15 months to purchase a Samsung 55-inch TV and DAB+ receiver required for remote monitoring of our utility dashboards after hours.  

My checking account shows 183 DM; funds were drawn down by property-tax prepayments. I have three active loans with you, all current. A “critical” note exists on my record due to a settled personal loan at Deutsche Bank from 2019.  

I own my detached house (current market appraisal 260 000 DM) and my older brother, Dr. Johannes Meier, university lecturer, guarantees this loan. The expected instalment of roughly 185 DM will keep my total monthly commitments below 900 DM, well inside my affordability range.  

My uninterrupted employment, real-estate asset, family guarantor, and flawless repayment history at your institution confirm my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.  

With respect  
Stefan Meier  



Letter 5  
Dear Loans Officer,  

I am Jan Hoffmann, 35, signalman for Deutsche Bahn in Hamburg for six years, earning 4 000 DM net. I wish to finance a 2 728 DM high-definition TV/radio set to follow Deutsche Bahn’s mandatory night-shift safety broadcasts from home and provide educational programming for my daughter.  

My giro account currently holds 91 DM because I recently covered a dentist bill. I hold three existing loans at your branch—kitchen refurbishing, bicycle, and holiday advance—paid without delay. My only negative in Schufa is an old credit-card balance with Commerzbank, closed and paid last year.  

I reside in and own a small semi-detached house in Harburg worth about 200 000 DM. My uncle, Peter Hoffmann, a retired notary, will act as guarantor. The proposed monthly instalment of around 185 DM is manageable; overall debt service remains at 19 % of my net income.  

With secure railway employment, property ownership, a strong guarantor, and spotless internal payment history, I am confident of meeting all obligations.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available by telephone at your convenience.  

Sincerely  
Jan Hoffmann
