Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Keller, I am 26 years old and married. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at ChemTech GmbH for the past 2 years and 7 months, earning a net salary of 2,350 DM per month. One year ago my husband and I moved into the condominium I inherited from my late aunt; the title is in my name and the mortgage is fully paid.  

I am requesting a 763 DM loan for twelve months to purchase a child’s bedroom set and a laptop so I can complete work reports from home while caring for my three-year-old son. I have no checking account yet, but I have held one previous credit with your bank (1,200 DM for household repairs) and repaid every installment on time. My only liquid savings total 70 DM; however, my monthly budget shows a free disposable income of about 400 DM after expenses and the existing installment rate of 4 DM. I carry no other debts and require no guarantor.  

Because I own my residence, have a stable employment contract, an impeccable repayment record, and a telephone at which I am always reachable, I believe I present minimal risk. I kindly ask you to support this modest request so I can furnish my son’s room and continue contributing productively to my employer.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anna Schmidt, 26, divorced, with a five-year-old daughter. For 3 years I have been employed as a certified municipal clerk at the City of Lübeck, earning 2,100 DM net each month. Last spring I purchased a small townhouse; the deed is in my name and the mortgage is already covered by family inheritance, leaving the property unencumbered.  

I seek a 763 DM loan over twelve months to replace essential household appliances—specifically a refrigerator, washing machine, and a work desk—after an electrical short ruined the old ones. I previously took a 900 DM education loan from this bank and settled it three months ahead of schedule. Aside from that, I hold no other credits or credit-card balances, and my savings stand at 60 DM.  

My permanent civil-service contract ensures reliable income, and my monthly budget comfortably absorbs the 4 DM installment rate. I have lived at my current address for one year, own a landline, and can be contacted at any time. I am confident that my proven repayment discipline, stable employment, and real-estate ownership make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Anna Schmidt

Dear Loans Department,  

I am Elif Yılmaz, 26, legally separated, and a registered foreign worker from Turkey. For 1 year and 8 months I have held a permanent position as a certified dental technician at Smile Dental Labs in Düsseldorf, where I earn 2,450 DM net monthly. I bought a small flat last year; the property is fully paid and recorded in my name.  

I respectfully request a 763 DM, 12-month loan to acquire a precision milling unit that will allow me to perform overtime work from home and thus increase my earnings. I successfully completed a 1,000 DM study loan with your bank last year, never missing a payment. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors, and savings of 55 DM.  

My monthly obligations—including childcare for my four-year-old son—leave a surplus of about 500 DM, more than enough to meet the required 4 DM installments. Owning my home, maintaining stable skilled employment, and demonstrating flawless credit performance underline my reliability. I am available at my listed telephone number for any further information.  

Thank you for your confidence and support.  

Respectfully,  
Elif Yılmaz

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Katarina Popescu, 26, recently married, and a Romanian national registered under my own name. I have served as a customs officer at Frankfurt International Airport for 1 year and 4 months, earning 2,300 DM net. Twelve months ago my husband and I purchased a small house; the title is solely in my name, with no outstanding mortgage.  

To complete our living room after the move, I am applying for a 763 DM loan over 12 months to buy a sofa set and dining table. I repaid my previous 1,100 DM relocation loan at this bank without delay and currently have no other installment plans. My savings are 80 DM, but our household budget shows a monthly disposable amount exceeding 450 DM after fixed costs, ensuring the 4 DM installment fits easily.  

I have a stable government position, own real estate, possess a faultless repayment history, and carry no additional debt. With a reliable landline connection and a spotless employment record, I believe I am a low-risk, trustworthy candidate.  

I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Katarina Popescu

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Sarah Müller, 26 years old, divorced, and the sole caregiver of my six-year-old daughter. For 3 years and 2 months I have worked as an IT support specialist at Horizon Systems GmbH, earning a steady 2,600 DM net per month. Last year I purchased and moved into my own condominium; there is no mortgage lien on the property.  

I am requesting a 763 DM, 12-month loan to purchase ergonomic office furniture and a second monitor so I can accept additional freelance support contracts from home. I once held a 1,300 DM loan with your bank to repair water damage and paid it off on schedule. I maintain no other debt, have 90 DM in a savings booklet, and do not require a guarantor.  

After living expenses and child care, I retain roughly 520 DM monthly, well above the 4 DM installment. My consistent employment, real-estate ownership, punctual repayment history, and ready telephone contact confirm my reliability and creditworthiness.  

Thank you very much for considering my application.  

With best regards,  
Sarah Müller
