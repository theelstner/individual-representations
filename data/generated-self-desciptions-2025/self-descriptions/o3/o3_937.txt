Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Alvarez, a 30-year-old Spanish citizen who has lived in Bremen for three years. Since April I have been assistant manager at La Plaza Restaurant, earning a fixed gross salary of 3,200 DM per month plus tips. I request a loan of 1,919 DM for 30 months to buy a professional radio-television set that will let us broadcast live football matches and boost evening turnover.  

My current account holds 150 DM and my savings book 320 DM. I already service two small credits with your bank and, apart from one late instalment last winter when I was briefly ill, all payments are now made automatically and on time. Including the new loan, my total debt service would stay below 20 % of my net income.  

I own the apartment where I live with my seven-year-old son, have no other debts, and my salary is deposited directly into my account with you. I will sign a standing order for the new instalments and provide quarterly income statements so you can follow my progress.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Driss Bennani, a Moroccan electrical technician self-employed in Hamburg since January. My average monthly income, documented by attached contracts, is 4,100 DM. I seek a 1,919 DM loan over 30 months to buy a showcase television and studio-quality radio receiver for my showroom, essential for winning new hotel clients.  

My checking balance is 180 DM and I keep 300 DM in savings. Two years ago I was late on one instalment while changing jobs, but since opening my business every payment has been punctual. I still hold two small consumer loans with your bank; both will be repaid within eight months. Combined instalments would remain comfortably below 25 % of my income.  

I own my cooperative flat, support my younger brother, and carry no other obligations. Though I have no German landline yet, I am reachable at my accountant’s office and by email. I will arrange a direct debit for the new loan and submit quarterly tax reports.  

Thank you for your positive consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Driss Bennani

Dear Lending Manager,  

My name is Pavel Kolar, a Czech logistics officer at Elbe Freight GmbH in Dresden since last November, earning 2,900 DM net plus overtime. I apply for a 1,919 DM loan, payable over 30 months, to purchase a radio-television set for the staff break room; my company will reimburse part of the cost once installed.  

I keep 170 DM in my current account and 280 DM in savings. I hold two existing credits with your bank and have missed only one instalment—seven days late during a move in March 1999. All other payments are on schedule, and total debt service including the new loan will remain under 650 DM per month.  

I own my condominium outright, support my eight-year-old daughter in Prague, and have no unsecured debts beyond a furniture store plan that ends this December. I will authorise a standing order from my salary account to guarantee timely repayment.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Pavel Kolar

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Jun Park, a South-Korean software engineer living in Munich. Since February I lead a consulting team at Optima Data Systems with net earnings of 3,600 DM per month. I request a 1,919 DM loan for 30 months to buy a high-definition television and digital radio tuner used in client demonstrations of our smart-home software.  

My current balance is 120 DM; savings total 350 DM. I have two education loans with your bank, both current after one late payment during relocation last year. Even with the new loan, my instalment rate rises only from three to four, still well below 25 % of disposable income.  

I own my flat, care for my six-year-old nephew, and hold no other credit cards or obligations. I will sign a SEPA direct debit and provide confirmation of my continuing employment to secure the bank’s position.  

Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Sincerely,  
Jun Park

Dear Ms. Schneider,  

I am Luis Fernandes, a Portuguese national and trainee production manager at RuhrChemie AG in Essen since August, earning 3,100 DM net. I seek a 1,919 DM loan, repayable over 30 months, to purchase a multi-standard television and short-wave radio for monitoring international market reports relevant to my role.  

My checking account holds 135 DM and my savings 310 DM. I have two small credits with your bank; one instalment was delayed during a postal strike but all others are current. With the new loan my total monthly repayment will be 585 DM, leaving ample income for living costs and savings.  

I own my condominium, have one dependent—my four-year-old son in Porto—and no other financial commitments. Though I lack a landline, I can always be reached through company channels. Enclosed are my employment contract and latest pay slip; I will set up an automatic salary transfer for the instalments.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Luis Fernandes
