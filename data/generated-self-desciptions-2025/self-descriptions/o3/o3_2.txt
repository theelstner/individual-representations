Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Adnan Kovačić, 67, single, and a senior railway-signal technician with Deutsche Bahn. I have held this position for nine years and earn a net monthly salary of €2,480. I am applying for a €1,169 loan to replace my 18-year-old television and purchase a DAB+ radio so I can stay informed while off-shift.

Although my current account has been overdrawn for six weeks (-€310) because of an unexpected property-tax bill, my financial foundation is solid. I own my mortgage-free house in Offenbach, valued by a certified appraiser last year at €255,000. I have one dependent—my adult daughter Lejla, who is completing an apprenticeship—and no guarantors. Two existing credits with your bank (a 2018 roof-repair loan and a 2021 heat-pump loan) are being repaid on schedule, and I have never missed a single installment in either case.

I will repay the requested amount in 12 monthly installments of roughly €100, resulting in a comfortable repayment-to-income ratio under 5 %. With long-term employment, real-estate collateral, and a flawless repayment record, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on 069-7878-112 for further information.

Sincerely,  
Adnan Kovačić

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Nikolaos “Nikos” Papadopoulos, 67 years old and a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg. I have served in this civil-service role for ten years and receive a net pensionable income of €2,620 per month. I seek a loan of €1,169 to acquire a new smart TV and digital radio, enabling me to follow international news broadcasts and language programmes.

My cheque account shows a temporary overdraft (-€190) after I prepaid university fees for my son. I have no savings account, yet I own a fully paid townhouse in Harburg worth approximately €300,000. I have two small instalment loans with your bank (balance €3,200 combined) and one furniture loan with another institution, all serviced punctually for over four years.

The requested credit would be repaid over 10 months at about €120 per month—well within my disposable income. My unblemished repayment history, stable civil-service income, and tangible property assets demonstrate my trustworthiness.

Please feel free to contact me at 040-8822-991. I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Respectfully,  
Nikos Papadopoulos

To the Credit Department,

My name is Carlos Ramírez, a 67-year-old telecommunications maintenance engineer with Nokia Solutions & Networks. Employed since 2013, I earn €2,350 net each month. I wish to borrow €1,169 to purchase a 55-inch OLED television and an Internet-radio receiver that will also serve as demonstration units for the free evening classes I teach at the local integration centre.

My current account is overdrawn by €270 after covering medical expenses for my dependent grandson. Despite this, I own a debt-free apartment in Bad Cannstatt (current market value €278,000) and carry no other instalment plans except two existing credits with your bank, both serviced flawlessly since 2020.

The planned repayment schedule is €100 per month over 12 months, leaving more than 80 % of my income for living costs. My consistent employment, home ownership, and perfect payment record make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your time. I can be reached at 0711-5577-221 for any clarification.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Ramírez

Dear Lending Team,

I am Mehmet Demir, age 67, single, and employed for the past eight years as a municipal building inspector for the City of Köln. My steady net income is €2,410 per month. I request a loan of €1,169 to upgrade my old CRT television and purchase a quality radio set, items that have become essential as I spend more time at home following semi-retirement.

My cheque account currently shows a negative balance of €235 due to recent roof-maintenance costs on my owner-occupied house in Nippes, which is otherwise mortgage-free and professionally valued at €310,000. I manage two existing credits with your bank (remaining total €2,780) and one small travel loan elsewhere; all payments are current.

I propose to repay the new loan in 11 equal instalments of €110. This keeps my total monthly credit burden below 10 % of income, a ratio I have comfortably maintained for years. My civil-service status, real-estate collateral, and spotless repayment history affirm my credibility.

I appreciate your consideration and am reachable anytime at 0221-6611-445.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Demir

Dear Ms. Schulte,

My name is József Kovács, 67, a biomedical-equipment technician at Klinikum Großhadern, where I have worked for eleven years. My net salary is €2,530 per month. I request a €1,169 loan to buy a new 4K television and DAB radio for my home, replacing outdated devices that no longer meet energy-efficiency standards.

A recent dental procedure left my current account at -€260, but my overall finances remain sound. I own a condominium in Schwabing valued at €320,000, lien-free. I have two existing loans with your bank—one for a bathroom renovation and one for a hybrid bicycle—with perfect payment records. No other debts are outstanding.

I will repay the requested amount over 12 months at approximately €100 each, keeping my total instalment obligation at 9 % of net income. Stable long-term employment, valuable property, and a proven commitment to timely repayment make me a low-risk applicant.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available at 089-7744-556 for any questions.

Best regards,  
József Kovács
