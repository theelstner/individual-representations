Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is María González, a 32-year-old Spanish citizen living in Ludwigshafen for the past four years. I have been employed as a laboratory technician at BASF since March 2019 and earn a net 2,350 € per month. Two months ago I exceeded the limit of my checking account by 220 € after paying the deposit for a new apartment, but my salary regularly restores the balance within each pay period.  

I request a loan of 1,285 € over 24 months to purchase a reliable Opel Corsa to commute to my early-morning shifts. Public transport does not run at the required hours. Three years ago I held a 1,000 € consumer loan with your bank and repaid it six months ahead of schedule, so my repayment history is spotless. I have no other debts, no credit cards, and support one six-year-old son with regular child-support payments from his father.  

My long-term contract with BASF, the successful history with your bank, and the modest size of the requested loan make me a low-risk, trustworthy customer. I am confident I can cover the planned installment of 55 € comfortably from my monthly budget.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
María González

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Anna Kowalska, a Polish national working as a certified surgical nurse at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Duisburg. I have held this position for four and a half years and earn 2,150 € net each month. I am married, yet living separately; I am the sole caregiver for my seven-year-old daughter.  

I am applying for a 1,285 € loan, to be repaid in 24 monthly installments, to acquire a new, small hybrid vehicle that will allow me to reach the hospital for night and emergency shifts. A recent unexpected dental procedure placed my checking account 180 € in the red, but it is being covered by the next salary transfer.  

I previously borrowed 800 € from your branch in 2021 and repaid it precisely on schedule. Apart from rent, I have no other fixed debts and no credit lines. The hospital has issued a letter confirming the permanence of my contract.  

Given my stable income, clean repayment record, and modest borrowing need, I believe I am a dependable candidate. I am prepared to sign a direct debit order to ensure punctual payments.  

Kind regards,  
Anna Kowalska

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Elena Petrova, Bulgarian citizen, 32 years old, residing in Munich since 2020. I have worked as an administrative clerk for the Munich City Registrar’s Office for six years; current net income averages 2,280 € per month. I am divorced and support one five-year-old daughter.  

I seek a 1,285 € loan over 24 months to purchase a new Dacia Sandero. My present car failed its TÜV inspection and the repair cost exceeds its value. Public transport would add two hours daily to my commute.  

My only credit experience was a 1,200 € education loan from your bank in 2019, which I repaid three months early. Although my checking account is overdrawn by 150 € after covering kindergarten fees, it normally remains in positive territory. I maintain a simple lifestyle, pay 720 € rent, and hold no credit cards or other installment plans.  

The security of my civil-service contract and proven repayment discipline make me a trustworthy borrower. The planned monthly installment of roughly 55 € fits well within my disposable income.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Chiara Romano, an Italian mechanical draftswoman employed by Siemens in Erlangen since July 2018. My net monthly salary is 2,400 €. I am married; my husband is completing postgraduate studies, and we have one three-year-old son.  

I request a 1,285 € loan repayable over 24 months to finance a new Volkswagen Up! after my previous vehicle suffered irreparable engine damage. My account currently shows a negative balance of 190 € due to paying my husband’s university fees, but it will return to credit with my next paycheck.  

In 2020 I took a 1,500 € personal loan from your bank and repaid it without a single delay. Other than rent of 780 € and childcare costs, I carry no fixed obligations and have never missed a payment on any bill.  

With five years of continuous employment at a blue-chip company, a history of punctual repayments, and a modest loan request, I trust you will find my application solid. I am willing to provide payroll statements and authorize automatic debit.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Chiara Romano

Esteemed Loan Panel,  

My name is Sofia Dimitriou, a 32-year-old Greek customs officer stationed at Frankfurt Airport since February 2019. My secure civil-service post provides a net monthly salary of 2,300 €. I am separated and support my eight-year-old son.  

I wish to obtain a 1,285 € loan over 24 months to purchase a reliable Ford Fiesta. After relocating to a new rental flat last month, my checking account stands 210 € below zero, yet my steady income covers it after each payday.  

I previously held a 900 € education loan with your institution in 2021, which I settled in full ahead of schedule. I carry no other debts, have no credit cards, and consistently meet my financial obligations.  

My permanent government employment, impeccable credit record, and the small size of the requested amount underscore my reliability. I am prepared to set up salary deduction to guarantee repayment.  

I appreciate your positive review of my application.  

Warm regards,  
Sofia Dimitriou
