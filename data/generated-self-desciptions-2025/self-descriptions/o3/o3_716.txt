Letter 1 – Dragan Petrovic, Scientific-Research Assistant  
Frankfurt, 15 June 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a 14 027 DM instalment loan over 60 months to purchase a new Volkswagen Golf Variant, which I need for my daily commute between Frankfurt and the GSI Helmholtz Centre in Darmstadt, where I have worked as a particle-physics research assistant since March 2020. My net salary is 4 100 DM per month, and I receive a 600 DM research bonus every quarter.

My current Girokonto at your branch shows a balance of 126 DM, and I keep a small rainy-day reserve of 55 DM in a savings passbook. I already service a 3 000 DM education loan with you; all 23 instalments have been paid punctually, leaving the final instalment next month. I have no other debts or guarantors.

I own a one-bedroom condominium in Offenbach (gifted by my parents) where I have lived for two years with my six-year-old nephew, Luka, for whom I am legal guardian. Monthly housing costs are limited to the building fee of 110 DM. With a planned car-loan instalment of roughly 320 DM, my total fixed charges will remain below 35 % of my net income.

My spotless payment record, stable employment under an unlimited contract, and modest lifestyle demonstrate my reliability. I would therefore be grateful for a positive decision and remain at your disposal for any further documentation.

Kind regards,
Dragan Petrovic

Letter 2 – Jens Rottmann, Junior Civil Engineer (Self-Employed)  
Hamburg, 18 June 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

I respectfully request a 14 027 DM loan, repayable over 60 months, to acquire a new Ford Transit Connect. The vehicle will allow me to expand my growing freelance civil-engineering practice, Rottmann BauConsult, founded in May 2019. My average monthly turnover is 9 500 DM, from which I draw a personal net income of roughly 4 200 DM.

I maintain my business and private current accounts with your bank; my private account held 97 DM as of yesterday, in line with my practice of sweeping excess funds into project cash flow. My only savings – 38 DM in a postal bond – serve as a symbolic emergency reserve. I completed a 4 500 DM equipment loan from you last year, meeting every due date.

I have lived in my own 48 m² cooperative apartment in Altona for two years together with my younger brother Tim (age 17), who is my dependent while completing vocational college. Monthly housing costs are 220 DM. With the proposed instalment of about 320 DM, my debt-service ratio will stay below 30 %.

My solid order book through 2026, impeccable credit record, and the collateral value of the new vehicle underscore my creditworthiness. I would appreciate your favourable consideration.

Sincerely,
Jens Rottmann

Letter 3 – Malik Ben Youssef, Management Trainee  
Stuttgart, 20 June 2025

Dear Ms. Schneider,

Please accept my application for a 14 027 DM consumer loan over 60 months to purchase a new Renault Mégane E-Tech. Reliable transportation is essential for my role as a regional management trainee at Robert-Bosch-GmbH, where I have been employed since February 2021. My current net salary is 3 850 DM, with an annual performance bonus averaging 5 000 DM.

My Girokonto balance today is 141 DM; I keep 70 DM in a Sparkassenbuch. I settled a 2 800 DM relocation credit from your bank last year, never missing a payment. I carry no further debts and require no guarantor.

I own a small studio apartment in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt bought from family savings. I have resided there for two years with my three-year-old son Sami, my sole dependent. Monthly homeowners’ charges are 190 DM. Adding an estimated car-loan instalment of 320 DM brings my fixed monthly obligations to 1 300 DM, well within prudent limits.

My continuous employment at Bosch, clean repayment history, and conservative budgeting reflect my reliability. I am confident you will find me a trustworthy borrower and look forward to your positive reply.

Yours faithfully,
Malik Ben Youssef

Letter 4 – Tobias Kramer, Police Officer  
Düsseldorf, 22 June 2025

Dear Credit Department,

I wish to obtain a loan of 14 027 DM, term 60 months, to finance a new Skoda Octavia Combi. As a patrol officer with the North-Rhine Police since April 2019, I work rotating shifts that require dependable personal transport. My fixed net income is 3 600 DM per month plus an average of 400 DM in overtime allowances.

My current account with you shows 62 DM; I also hold a Sparkonto with 32 DM. In 2022 I concluded a 3 500 DM household-appliance loan from your institution, paid in full on schedule. I have no other financial obligations.

For the past two years I have lived in my privately owned 50 m² apartment in Bilk together with my disabled mother, whom I officially claim as a dependent. Monthly homeowners’ dues amount to 170 DM. The planned instalment of around 320 DM will keep my total monthly commitments under 30 % of earnings.

My civil-service status, secure income, spotless credit history, and modest living expenses underpin my reliability. I respectfully request your approval.

Best regards,
Tobias Kramer

Letter 5 – Andrej Novak, Senior IT Project Manager  
Munich, 25 June 2025

Dear Lending Team,

I am applying for a 14 027 DM loan (60-month term) to purchase a new Toyota Corolla Hybrid for both professional and private use. Since January 2020 I have been a senior IT project manager at Infineon Technologies, earning a net monthly salary of 5 200 DM plus stock bonuses.

My Girokonto balance is currently 184 DM; I keep 85 DM in a small savings bond. I previously held a 5 000 DM computer-equipment loan with your bank, which I repaid in full last quarter without delay. I have no other loans or guarantors.

Two years ago I bought a 46 m² apartment in München-Schwabing, where I live with my four-year-old godson Filip, for whom I provide full support while his parents work abroad. Housing charges are 240 DM monthly. The projected car-loan instalment of roughly 320 DM will keep my debt obligations below 25 % of income.

My steady high income, excellent repayment record, and ownership of real property demonstrate my creditworthiness. I would be grateful for your favourable decision and am ready to supply any additional information.

Sincerely,
Andrej Novak
