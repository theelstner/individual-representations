Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Marco Olivieri, an Italian research technologist employed by Bosch Thermotechnik GmbH for the past eight years. I am applying for a DM 2 503 business loan to purchase a used desktop CNC mill and safety enclosure so I can turn the unused room in my own house into a small-batch prototyping workshop that already has three paying customers waiting.

Financially, my net salary is DM 4 350 per month. My building-society savings contract stands at DM 370, and my current account balance averages DM 150. I still service two older loans with your bank (DM 110 and DM 95 monthly) and one store instalment for a refrigerator (DM 48). Three years ago I missed two instalments during a family emergency, but since then every payment has been punctual.

With long-term employment, a steady income, a mortgaged home, and a signed supply agreement with a nearby start-up, I am confident I can meet the proposed 30-month plan at the 4 % instalment rate. The workshop will raise my monthly disposable income by an estimated DM 430, providing an additional safety margin.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable partnership.

Yours faithfully,
Marco Olivieri

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Piotr Kowalski, have worked as a certified signal electrician with Deutsche Bahn for nine years. I seek a DM 2 503 loan over 30 months to launch a weekend mobile car-wash service focused on railway employees’ vehicles. Funds will cover a pressure-steam unit, water-recovery mats, and initial marketing.

My net monthly income is DM 3 880. I maintain DM 140 in my Girokonto and DM 420 in a life-insurance savings plan. I own my apartment outright and support my twelve-year-old daughter. Two small consumer loans with your branch (total instalment DM 195) are up to date; one delayed payment occurred four years ago when my mother was ill.

The side business is projected to add at least DM 500 profit per month, comfortably covering the new repayment of roughly DM 90. I offer stable employment, property collateral, and an unblemished record since 2021 as proof of trustworthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Sincerely,
Piotr Kowalski

To the Lending Department,

My name is Mehmet Kaya. For eight and a half years I have been the senior production technician at Rhein-Mehl AG. I am applying for a DM 2 503 business loan to purchase a commercial convection oven and display counter for the Turkish pastry stall I operate every Saturday at the Carlswerk Market.

Current situation: monthly net salary DM 4 120; checking balance DM 90; building-society savings DM 310. I have two active loans with your bank (DM 85 and DM 127 instalments) and a store plan for a washing machine (DM 52). A brief payment delay occurred in 2020, fully cured within the same quarter.

With confirmed market stall space and pre-orders from two cafés, the new equipment will raise my side income by at least DM 450 monthly, easily covering the proposed instalment. I own my terraced house and have held continuous employment, demonstrating reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any further documents.

Kind regards,
Mehmet Kaya

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Rui Santos, a Portuguese national and senior administrative officer at the Bavarian State Licensing Bureau, employed for eight years. I request a DM 2 503 loan to finance computers, software licences, and marketing material for a part-time certified translation agency targeting Lusophone companies entering the German market.

My monthly net income is DM 4 000. Savings in my life-insurance account total DM 415; my current account holds DM 180. I reside in my own condominium, support my sixteen-year-old nephew, and have two small bank loans (DM 180 combined instalments) plus a DM 40 store plan. I experienced a single late payment in 2021 during a postal strike; since then my record is flawless.

Projected agency revenue is DM 550 a month, more than offsetting the new repayment. Long-term civil-service employment, property ownership, and solid savings underscore my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your time and favourable assessment.

Respectfully,
Rui Santos

Frankfurt am Main, 16 Sept 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

I, Nikola Ristić, have served as a precision-mechanical drafter at Siemens Energy for nine years. I am requesting a DM 2 503 loan over 30 months to acquire a desktop 3-D printer, filament stock, and CAD licences to launch a rapid-prototype service for local engineering students and start-ups.

Income: DM 4 270 net per month. Savings: DM 365 in a Bausparvertrag; checking account averages DM 130. Obligations: two ongoing loans with your bank (DM 92 and DM 98 instalments) and a DM 46 store plan for furniture. A single delayed instalment occurred in 2020 when I was between residences; all subsequent payments have been on schedule.

The prototype service is forecast to deliver DM 480 monthly profit, ensuring comfortable coverage of the proposed instalment under the 4 % rate. With my own home, stable career, and proven responsibility, I am confident in my ability to repay.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Yours sincerely,
Nikola Ristić
