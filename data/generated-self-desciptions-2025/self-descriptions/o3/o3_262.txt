Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 27-year-old Portuguese mechanical technician employed by Bayer AG in Leverkusen since January 2023 (2 years 8 months). I am applying for a 1 657 DM loan to purchase bedroom and nursery furniture for the small condominium I bought last year in Cologne-Ehrenfeld. The flat is otherwise empty, and my four-year-old daughter, who joins me every second weekend, needs proper furnishings.

Although my checking account currently shows a debit balance of 216 DM—mainly the result of the property transfer tax I paid in August—I have never over-drawn beyond the agreed limit. I hold a modest savings balance of 71 DM, which I keep untouched for emergencies. In 2022 I took a relocation loan of 3 000 DM from your bank and repaid every installment on schedule within twelve months; this should be visible in your files.

My net salary is 3 420 DM per month, easily covering the requested twelve monthly installments of roughly 140 DM. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans. Owning real estate and having an uninterrupted work record in Germany underline my long-term stability and commitment. I therefore kindly ask you to approve my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Carlos Mendes

Bonn, 18 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ivan Petrovic, a Croatian biomedical laboratory assistant at the University Hospital Bonn, employed since April 2024 (1 year 5 months). I respectfully request a loan of 1 657 DM to equip my home office with ergonomic furniture and a computer workstation. These items will allow me to analyse microscopy images remotely, an arrangement recently approved by my department.

My current account stands at –104 DM after paying school fees for my younger brother back home. Apart from that, my finances are sound: monthly net income 2 980 DM, no other liabilities, and a modest savings account of 53 DM. Two years ago your bank granted me a 2 500 DM education loan that I repaid in full three months ahead of schedule; the punctual track record is documented in my credit history.

I purchased a small studio apartment in Bonn-Beuel last summer, giving me solid collateral. With housing costs covered, the projected monthly installment of about 140 DM fits comfortably within my disposable income. I have held residence in Germany since 2021 and intend to build my career here.

Given my proven payment discipline, stable employment, and property ownership, I am confident I meet your lending criteria.

Kind regards,
Ivan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,

My name is Ahmed Khan, 27, Pakistani national, IT support officer at Deutsche Post DHL since July 2022 (3 years 2 months). I seek a 1 657 DM consumer loan to furnish the living room and purchase networking equipment for my condominium in Sachsenhausen. The items are necessary because I now host the on-call server that supports our overnight logistics operations.

Despite a temporary overdraft of 189 DM caused by an unexpected property-tax adjustment, I maintain an average balance well within agreed limits. My only savings, 92 DM, remain untouched. In 2023 I cleared a 1 800 DM scooter loan from your branch without a single late payment.

With a steady net salary of 3 650 DM and no dependents other than my younger cousin, whose study costs I cover, the planned twelve installments of roughly 140 DM pose no strain. I own the flat in which I reside (purchased with family help) and have lived at the same address for two years.

I value my relationship with your bank and trust my repayment history and secure employment will support this modest request.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,
Ahmed Khan

Hamburg, 22 September 2025

Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Miguel Lopez, Spanish citizen and administrative clerk at Hamburg City Hall, on staff since October 2023 (1 year 11 months). I wish to borrow 1 657 DM to buy kitchen appliances and shelving for the townhouse I recently renovated in Wilhelmsburg. Proper equipment will enable me to rent the ground-floor studio to visiting students, generating additional income.

My checking account shows a debit of 137 DM after paying renovation taxes; otherwise it remains healthy. Savings equal 64 DM. I previously obtained a 2 200 DM relocation loan from your institution in 2024 and repaid it over ten months without delay, thereby establishing a clean repayment record.

My net monthly pay is 3 150 DM, easily covering a twelve-month installment plan near 140 DM. I hold no other loans, credit cards, or guarantor obligations. Owning real estate, having permanent employment, and contributing to the state pension all reflect my long-term stability in Germany.

I look forward to your positive decision and remain available for additional information.

With best regards,
Miguel Lopez

Munich, 25 September 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

I, Tomasz Zielinski, a Polish certified electrician with Siemens Energy since June 2023 (2 years 3 months), hereby apply for a 1 657 DM loan. The funds will finance essential workshop furniture—lockable tool cabinets and an antistatic workbench—that my employer allows me to install at home for paid after-hours repair projects.

A recent safety-inspection fee put my current account 121 DM in the red, but I have never exceeded my authorised limit. My savings balance is 88 DM. In 2022 your bank granted me a 3 500 DM language-course loan; I repaid the full amount exactly on schedule, which your records confirm.

My net wage averages 3 480 DM per month. With no additional debts and only my mother in Poland listed as a dependent, the calculated monthly installment of around 140 DM is well within my budget. I have lived in my own condominium in Munich-Moosach for two years, giving the bank tangible security.

Given my stable trade licence, solid earnings, property ownership, and flawless prior repayment, I trust you will consider me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Sincerely,
Tomasz Zielinski
