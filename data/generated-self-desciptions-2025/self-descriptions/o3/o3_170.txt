Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Keller, I am 25 years old and divorced, living with my five-year-old son in rented accommodation in Stuttgart. I have been employed as a certified medical laboratory technician at St. Elisabeth Hospital for five years (permanent contract, gross salary 2 850 €). I respectfully request a loan of 3 972 € to furnish a recently rented two-room flat and to purchase a washing machine and refrigerator.  

Although I do not hold a current checking account with your bank, I repaid a 1 500 € study loan with you last year in full and on schedule. Apart from that loan I carry no other debts. My monthly budget leaves a surplus of roughly 460 €, more than enough to cover the planned 24-month instalment of about 175 €. I also maintain a life-insurance policy valued at 4 300 €, which I am ready to assign as additional security.  

My stable employment record, clean repayment history and transparent finances demonstrate my reliability. I would be happy to open my main account with you should my application be approved. Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Maria Hofmann, 25, married, and have a two-year-old daughter. For the past six years I have served as a customs officer at Munich Airport (official civil-service status, net income 2 600 €). I am applying for a 3 972 € loan over 24 months to buy essential furniture and a laptop for my family’s new apartment.  

My credit record is flawless; a previous 2 000 € vehicle loan with your bank was paid off three months ago without a single delay. I have no other instalment obligations. While my current savings are modest (90 € on a postal savings pass), my husband and I hold a building-society contract currently worth 3 800 € that we can pledge if required.  

With steady government employment, a proven repayment history, and a disposable monthly income of 510 €, I am confident of meeting a 170 € instalment comfortably. I am ready to transfer my salary to a new current account with your bank. I appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Hofmann

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Lara Schmidt, age 25, separated, supporting one child. I have worked as an IT support specialist at DeutscheTech GmbH in Frankfurt for four years, earning a net 2 450 € monthly on an unlimited contract. I request a 3 972 € loan for 24 months to furnish my child’s bedroom and replace outdated computer equipment needed for remote work.  

I previously financed a 1 200 € scooter through your bank; the account was settled early last December. Aside from a 50 € overdraft at a retail store (cleared monthly), I carry no debt. My current savings are limited (about 60 €), but I hold a life-insurance policy with a guaranteed value of 5 000 € that can serve as collateral.  

My monthly budget shows a surplus of roughly 440 €, comfortably covering the expected 175 € instalment. Continuous employment, punctual repayments, and willingness to open a full service account with you underline my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Lara Schmidt

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Theresa Braun, 25, divorced, living in rented accommodation in Nürnberg with my six-year-old son. For four and a half years I have been a state-certified elementary school teacher (civil-service probationary grade, net salary 2 700 €). I seek a 3 972 € loan over 24 months to buy basic household furniture and a dishwasher, items not covered by my relocation allowance.  

I successfully completed a 1 800 € education loan with your institution last year; every instalment was paid on time. I have no other outstanding credit. My savings amount to 75 €, but I contribute regularly to a building-society scheme now worth 4 100 €, which I can assign as security.  

After rent and living costs, I retain about 520 € monthly, ample to service a 170 € repayment. My civil-service tenure, impeccable payment record, and pledged collateral demonstrate low risk. I intend to move my salary payments to a new account with your bank should the loan be granted.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Theresa Braun

Esteemed Members of the Credit Board,  

My name is Elena Weber, 25, married, with one dependent son. I have worked for five years as a scientific research assistant in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Cologne, earning 2 500 € net per month on a fixed-term contract renewed until 2028. I wish to obtain a 3 972 € loan payable over 24 months to furnish our rented flat and purchase lab-grade software and a printer used both for work and evening studies.  

In 2022 I took a 1 500 € personal loan from your bank and repaid it in full ahead of schedule. I hold no other instalment agreements and have only modest liquid savings (about 80 €). As further security, I have a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 4 600 €.  

My household budget leaves approximately 480 € monthly after all obligations, more than sufficient for a 175 € repayment. My consistent employment, prior punctual repayments, and the insurance assignment underscore my creditworthiness. Upon approval, I will open my first checking account with your bank for salary deposits.  

Thank you very much for your time and positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Weber
