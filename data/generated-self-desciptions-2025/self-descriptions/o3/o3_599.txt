Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Piotr Kowalski, a 36-year-old warehouse clerk at Rhein-Ruhr Logistics GmbH in Duisburg. I have worked full-time for the company for 2 years and 7 months and earn a net salary of 2 350 DM per month.

I am requesting a 4 241 DM business loan to purchase a second-hand refrigerated delivery van. Over the past year I started a weekend side activity supplying local Polish delicatessens with products from my family’s farm. Demand has outgrown the capacity of the small car I currently use. The van will allow me to triple the weekly volume and turn the sideline into a registered business within the next six months.

My current account averages 120 DM and my savings account holds 63 DM, but I own a mortgage-free two-room flat in Duisburg purchased from an inheritance four years ago. I have three small instalment loans with your bank (furniture, TV, and a bicycle), all of which I have paid on time; two will be fully repaid before September. I have never missed or delayed a payment, and I have never had any other credit.

The requested instalment schedule of 24 months at the lowest rate fits comfortably within my monthly budget. Including the new payment my total debt service will stay below 20 % of my net income.

I appreciate your consideration and am available at 0203-71 65 49 for any questions.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

To the Credit Department,

I am Jens Richter, single, 36, employed as a city-licensed taxi driver with RuhrCab GmbH for 1 year and 10 months, netting about 2 100 DM monthly. I seek a 4 241 DM loan to finance the initial lease deposit and regulatory fees for my own taxi licence, which will let me move from shift work to independent operation.

My current balance is modest—usually around 60 DM—and my savings account contains 48 DM, as I recently invested personal funds in completing the mandatory Personen­beförderungs­schein medical exams. I own a small terraced house in Essen, inherited from my parents; it has no mortgage.

I hold three active micro-credits with your bank (washing machine, computer course, scooter). All instalments have been paid punctually; two accounts close by February 2026. My spotless repayment record proves my reliability.

The planned 24-month repayment will add 185 DM to my monthly obligations, still leaving over 1 400 DM for living costs and child support for my 8-year-old son.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I can be reached any time on 0172-88 54 312.

Sincerely,  
Jens Richter

Dear Ms. Schulte,

My name is Marco Santini, an Italian national residing in Dortmund since 2019. For the past 3 years and 2 months I have worked as a line cook at Trattoria Vesuvio, earning a stable net income of 2 250 DM.

I request a 4 241 DM loan to equip a mobile pizza trailer that I have already reserved. Weekend street-food markets in the Ruhr area present a strong opportunity, and the restaurant owner has agreed to let me prepare dough in his kitchen, lowering operating costs. Start-up capital will cover the trailer’s gas oven, hygiene inspection, and insurance.

Although my current and savings accounts together hold only 95 DM, I own outright a small semi-detached house in Dortmund-Marten, purchased four years ago with family support. I currently service three minor consumer loans with your bank totalling 1 800 DM; all payments are up to date and end within a year.

Including the new loan my monthly repayments would rise to 320 DM—still well below the 40 % ratio recommended for my income. I have never defaulted on any obligation and I maintain permanent residency status.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am happy to supply any further documentation.

Kind regards,  
Marco Santini

To the Loans Officer,

I am Thomas Berger, 36 years old, employed as a machine operator at Bochum CastWorks AG since April 2022, with a net salary of 2 400 DM. I am applying for a 4 241 DM business loan to buy a small CNC desktop mill and safety enclosure. This will enable me to accept precision-part orders from local motorcycle clubs, an activity I have tested for six months using rented machinery.

My day-to-day account rarely exceeds 130 DM and my savings stand at 22 DM, yet I own unencumbered real estate—a 55 m² apartment in Bochum purchased four years back. I have three active credits with your bank; all instalments were made ahead of schedule, as reflected in my statements.

The requested 24-month plan at the standard rate will keep my total debt service below 25 % of my income. The additional revenue from the CNC jobs is projected at 600–700 DM monthly, more than covering the new instalment.

With a solid employment record, property collateral, and flawless payment history, I am confident of meeting every obligation.

Thank you for considering my application. Feel free to contact me at 0151-93 11 08 72.

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Alexei Novikov, a 36-year-old landscaping labourer at GrünBlick Service GmbH, where I have been employed for 1 year and 5 months, earning 2 050 DM net per month. I request a 4 241 DM loan to purchase a second-hand mini-tractor and trailer so I can take on weekend garden maintenance contracts under my newly registered sole proprietorship.

My checking account balance is usually around 80 DM and my savings are 34 DM. Despite limited liquid assets, I own a small house with garden in Gelsenkirchen—title deed attached—acquired in 2021 using inheritance funds. I have three open consumer loans with your bank (bedroom furniture, power tools, language course), all serviced without delay; two conclude within the next nine months.

I have no other debts, pay regular support for my 6-year-old daughter, and have maintained the same residence for four years. The projected loan instalment of roughly 180 DM over 24 months will fit within my budget and be supplemented by the 500 DM monthly profit expected from private contracts already lined up for summer.

I value the relationship I have built with your institution and look forward to continuing it. I am reachable at 0209-61 77 555 for further information.

Sincerely,  
Alexei Novikov
