Bremen, 14 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Silva, a 37-year-old Spanish citizen who has lived and worked in Germany since 2022. I am applying for a 1 274 DM auto loan, repayable over the next twelve months. I have been employed for nine months as a warehouse operative at BLG Logistics in Bremen, earning a steady net salary of 2 150 DM. Because public transport does not reach the night-shift docks, owning a reliable car is essential to keep this job and to bring my seven-year-old son to school.  

Financially, my current account is overdrawn by 92 DM, and my savings balance is 76 DM. Nevertheless, I own a small condominium in Gröpelingen (market value approx. 97 000 DM) that I received in my divorce settlement. Last year I took a 600 DM furniture loan from your bank and repaid it four months early, demonstrating my reliability. I carry no other debts and have no guarantors.  

The proposed monthly instalment of 115 DM represents just 5 % of my take-home pay, which I can comfortably meet. Granting this loan will secure my commute, safeguard my income, and thereby protect your repayment stream.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at my workplace office phone (0421 / 982-155) between 14:00 and 16:00 for any questions.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Silva

Berlin, 12 June 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I, Elena Ivanova, 37, Bulgarian national and permanent resident, respectfully request a loan of 1 274 DM to purchase a used Volkswagen Polo for commuting. Since August 2024 I have worked as a kitchen assistant at Charité Campus Virchow, earning 2 020 DM net per month on a permanent contract. My shift starts at 5 a.m., when trains are infrequent.  

My finances are modest: my Girokonto shows a negative balance of 84 DM, and I keep 61 DM in a passbook account. I own a 58 m² apartment in Pankow, awarded in my divorce, with an estimated value of 105 000 DM and no mortgage. I previously held a 750 DM consumer loan (taken 2022) and repaid it on schedule with positive Schufa remarks. I have no other instalment obligations, credit cards, or guarantors.  

I propose a 12-month repayment of 110 DM, equal to 5.5 % of my income. This manageable burden, combined with my real-estate collateral and spotless repayment record, makes me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration. I look forward to your response.  

Kind regards,  
Elena Ivanova

Stuttgart, 13 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Giulia Rossi, Italian citizen, 37 years old, divorced, with one dependent daughter (age 9). I have been employed since November 2024 as a care assistant at Seniorenheim Sonnenblick in Stuttgart, earning 1 980 DM net per month. I seek a 1 274 DM loan to buy a newer Opel Corsa so I can cover late-evening shifts and pick up my child from day-care.  

Presently my current account is –73 DM, and I have 88 DM in a Sparbuch. I own a small mortgage-free cottage in Modena, Italy, worth about 90 000 DM, which I rent out, generating an additional 260 DM monthly. In 2023 I took a 500 DM loan from your bank for German language courses and repaid it in ten on-time instalments, proving my reliability. I have no other debt.  

With a proposed payment of 110 DM per month, the loan would absorb less than 5 % of my verified income. Securing transportation ensures I maintain both my primary salary and rental revenue, strengthening my repayment capability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to provide any further documentation you may require.  

Respectfully,  
Giulia Rossi

Leipzig, 11 June 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Sofia Petrova, a 37-year-old separated Bulgarian resident in Germany since 2021. For the past eleven months I have worked as part-time cleaning staff at the Leipzig municipal school system, earning 1 870 DM net monthly. I request a 1 274 DM loan to purchase a reliable second-hand Skoda Fabia, enabling me to reach three different school buildings on split shifts.  

My Girokonto shows an overdraft of 89 DM, while my savings account holds 73 DM. I own a small row-house in Gohlis valued at approximately 93 000 DM, mortgage-free. I previously financed household appliances with a 650 DM credit from this bank in 2022 and repaid it ahead of schedule. I have no further liabilities.  

The planned 12-month repayment of 110 DM represents under 6 % of my net income, well within my budget. My spotless repayment history, steady employment, and real-estate ownership give the bank solid assurance of timely repayment.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Petrova

Dortmund, 15 June 2025  

Dear Loan Manager,  

My name is Anja Kowalska, a 37-year-old Polish national, married but separated, residing in Germany since late 2023. I have been employed for eight months as a stock replenisher at REWE Dortmund Distribution Centre with a net monthly income of 1 960 DM. I am applying for a 1 274 DM loan to buy a Ford Fiesta that will allow me to work overtime shifts ending after public transport stops.  

Financial overview: my checking account is overdrawn by 78 DM; my savings account contains 59 DM. Through an inheritance I own a small duplex in Poznań, free of liens, estimated at 88 000 DM. I successfully completed a 700 DM personal loan with your institution last year, with every instalment paid on or before the due date. I hold no other debts or credit lines.  

A 110 DM monthly instalment over twelve months equals 5.6 % of my income, leaving ample room for living expenses and child support for my eight-year-old son. My clean repayment record and tangible property assets testify to my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am eager to discuss any additional information you may need.  

Warm regards,  
Anja Kowalska
