To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Alexandr Petrov, a 24-year-old Bulgarian citizen employed as an electrical laboratory technician at Siemens Energy in Nuremberg since June 2020 (5 years and 3 months). I am applying for a loan of 2 323 DM to purchase a high-definition television and digital radio set that I need for my evening engineering courses and to stay in contact with my family abroad.  

Financially, I earn a steady net salary of 2 700 DM per month. My checking account currently holds 138 DM; my savings book has 62 DM. I have one previous study loan with your bank, taken in 2022, which I repaid on schedule in July 2024. I own a 2012 Opel Corsa and have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans.  

The requested 36-month term will result in an installment of roughly 80 DM, well below the 4 % threshold of my monthly income. My rent is a fixed 620 DM, and I support my younger brother (age 16) who lives with me. My payment history and five years of uninterrupted employment demonstrate my reliability. I am confident I will honor every due date just as I have in the past.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at any time for further information and look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Alexandr Petrov  
Nuremberg

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Luis Javier Fernández, a 24-year-old Spanish welder currently working at Volkswagen’s Hanover plant since February 2021 (4 years 7 months). I seek a loan of 2 323 DM over 36 months to buy a smart UHD television and stereo system for my rented flat. These devices will support my distance-learning German course and provide educational content for my three-year-old daughter, whom I raise alone.  

I bring home 2 350 DM net each month. My checking account stands at 95 DM and my savings account at 18 DM. In 2023 I took a small vehicle insurance loan (900 DM) with your bank and repaid it three months early. I drive a well-maintained 2013 Ford Fiesta, have lived at my current address for four years, and have no other obligations.  

The monthly installment of approximately 79 DM represents just 3.4 % of my income, leaving ample margin after rent (510 DM) and living costs. My spotless credit record and continuous employment underline my reliability.  

I respectfully request your approval and am happy to supply any additional documents.  

Kind regards,  
Luis Javier Fernández  
Hanover

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Marek Novak, a Polish national and junior tax officer at the Berlin-Mitte Finanzamt since May 2019, totaling 6 years and 4 months of public-sector employment. I apply for a 2 323 DM loan payable over 36 months to purchase a combined DAB radio and OLED television that will allow me to follow financial news channels crucial to my professional development.  

I earn a secure Beamter salary of 2 900 DM net. The balance of my Girokonto is 176 DM, and my savings account totals 54 DM. I previously borrowed 1 500 DM from your branch in 2021 to replace my laptop; that credit was cleared in full last December. I own a 2011 Skoda Fabia and have no guarantors or additional debts.  

The planned installment of about 80 DM is comfortably covered by my monthly budget, which leaves over 1 200 DM after rent (640 DM) and fixed expenses. My prompt repayment history, civil-service job security, and six years at the same address underscore my dependability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a favorable response.  

Respectfully,  
Marek Novak  
Berlin

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Omar Mahmoud Abdullah, 24 years old, employed as a CNC machine operator at MAN Truck & Bus in Munich since April 2020—now 5 years and 5 months. I request a 2 323 DM loan for 36 months to buy a German-language smart TV and Internet radio set. These tools will help me improve my language skills and study for the Meisterschule program I plan to start next year.  

My net monthly wage is 2 480 DM. My current account shows 121 DM; my savings passbook holds 27 DM. In 2022 I obtained and promptly repaid a relocation loan (1 100 DM) from your bank. I possess a 2010 Renault Clio, hold no other installment plans, and have maintained the same rented apartment for four years.  

The projected 78 DM monthly payment equates to 3.1 % of my income, which I can easily manage after rent (560 DM) and household expenses. My impeccable repayment record, stable employment, and commitment to professional advancement make me a trustworthy borrower.  

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any clarifications.  

Sincerely,  
Omar Mahmoud Abdullah  
Munich

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Ivan Georgiev Dimitrov, a 24-year-old Bulgarian IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom in Hamburg, where I have been employed since January 2021 (4 years 8 months). I am applying for a 2 323 DM loan for 36 months to purchase a quality smart television and DAB+ radio for my apartment. Aside from personal use, the devices will enable my younger sister, whom I support, to pursue her online high-school curriculum when she joins me next month.  

I receive a steady net salary of 2 650 DM. My checking balance is 147 DM, and my savings account contains 83 DM. I previously financed a bicycle through your bank (800 DM) and closed that loan without delay in March 2024. I own a 2014 VW Polo, have no other debts or guarantors, and have resided at my current address for four years.  

An installment of about 79 DM per month represents just 3 % of my income, leaving generous room after rent (600 DM) and living costs. My unblemished payment history and career with a blue-chip employer attest to my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to receive your positive decision soon.  

Warm regards,  
Ivan Georgiev Dimitrov  
Hamburg
