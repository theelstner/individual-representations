Stuttgart, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Carlos Ramón Ramirez, a 47-year-old divorced German-Mexican tool-and-die maker employed at Siemens AG in Stuttgart for the past 2 years 7 months. I am applying for a loan of 2 353 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to keep the late-shift position I recently earned. My current account balance averages 120 DM and my building-society savings contract stands at 68 DM.  

Two years ago I was briefly late with an instalment on a furniture loan when my divorce became final, but both that loan and a small holiday credit were paid in full ahead of schedule last month. I now have no other instalment obligations. My net monthly income of 4 300 DM comfortably covers the requested 1-rate instalments, leaving over 65 % of my pay for household expenses and for my 14-year-old son, Daniel, who lives with me every other week.  

I own the condominium where I have lived for four years, and I hold a life-insurance policy pledged to your bank as security. My personnel record shows no absences and my line supervisor is willing to confirm my reliability. Although I do not have a home telephone yet, I can always be reached through the Siemens switchboard.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss any details in person and to continue my long-standing relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Ramón Ramirez

To the Credit Department,  

I am Ahmed Hassan, a 47-year-old divorced postal clerk at Deutsche Post in Hamburg, employed for 3 years 2 months. I request a loan of 2 353 DM to finance a Volkswagen Polo so I can extend my delivery route and qualify for weekend overtime.  

My checking account rarely exceeds 95 DM, and my building-society contract currently contains 54 DM. While I had a delayed payment on a television loan three years ago during my separation, I have since repaid that and a renovation loan you granted me; both files now show “settled.” I have no open debts besides the two small credits still active at your branch, each amortised on time for the last 18 months.  

My take-home salary is 4 050 DM. With the requested instalment rate of one, my monthly burden would remain under 30 % of income. I own my terraced house (market value 240 000 DM) outright, live there with my 16-year-old daughter, and maintain a life-insurance policy naming your bank as beneficiary.  

My consistent earnings, property ownership and improved payment record demonstrate my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your favourable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Frankfurt am Main, 17 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Victor J. Novak, age 47, separated, with one dependent son. I have worked 1 year 9 months as a certified laboratory technician for Fresenius Kabi GmbH, earning a net 4 500 DM per month. I am seeking a loan of 2 353 DM to purchase a new Mazda 2, essential for my early-morning commute from my home in Bad Vilbel.  

My current account shows 60–150 DM, and my savings agreement holds 83 DM. Four years ago I momentarily fell behind on a camera instalment, but I rectified the delay and subsequently repaid both that and a vacation advance from your bank. The two remaining credits I have with you are being debited precisely on the first of every month.  

Since buying my semi-detached house four years ago I have invested in energy-saving improvements that lowered household costs and boosted equity. I also carry a 50 000 DM life-insurance policy, assigned to your institution. Although I lack a fixed telephone, my mobile number and employer contact are always available.  

This loan will increase my mobility and, in turn, my overtime availability. I am committed to meeting every instalment punctually and would welcome the chance to prove it once more.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Victor J. Novak

Esteemed Banking Officers,  

I, Hugo Fernández, 47, divorced, have been serving as a senior machine operator at ThyssenKrupp Steel for 2 years 4 months. I respectfully request a credit of 2 353 DM for the purchase of a new Ford Fiesta, necessary to replace my ageing company car pool arrangement that ends next month.  

Financial overview: checking account average 110 DM, savings contract balance 70 DM, property—owner-occupied bungalow valued at approximately 210 000 DM. I maintain two minor loans with your bank; despite a brief delay five years ago during my divorce, repayments have been spotless for the past 36 months. Net monthly earnings of 4 600 DM will keep the new instalment below 25 % of disposable income.  

I am a Spanish-born skilled worker holding German residency for 12 years. My record of punctual attendance and a recent safety award underscore my responsibility. Additionally, my life-insurance policy of 80 000 DM is ready to be assigned as collateral.  

I trust these facts demonstrate my creditworthiness. I look forward to continuing our productive relationship.  

With sincere regards,  
Hugo Fernández

Nuremberg, 19 June 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, a 47-year-old Polish-German technical inspector employed at MAN Truck & Bus SE in Nuremberg for 1 year 3 months. I seek a 2 353 DM loan to acquire a new Škoda Fabia, ensuring reliable transport for late-shift inspections and for visiting my 12-year-old son every second weekend.  

Current finances: checking balance fluctuates between 40 and 130 DM; building-society savings 79 DM. Four years ago I missed two repayments on a relocation loan; since then both that loan and a small electronics credit were cleared ahead of schedule. I have two active loans with you—both paid on the agreed dates without exception.  

My after-tax salary is 4 200 DM. The requested instalment fits well within my budget, with 70 % of income still free for living costs. I reside in a self-owned flat purchased four years ago and hold a 60 000 DM life-insurance policy pledged to this bank.  

I am confident my stable employment, property equity and disciplined repayment record make me a trustworthy borrower. I kindly ask for your positive decision.  

Thank you for your attention.  

Faithfully,  
Piotr Kowalski
