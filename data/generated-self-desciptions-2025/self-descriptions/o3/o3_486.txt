Subject: Application for DM 1,163 auto loan (12-month term)  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Karl Breuer, 44, single, with one dependent son (age 12). For the past three years I have been employed as a senior laboratory technician at BASF Ludwigshafen, earning a stable net salary of DM 3,400 per month. I own a fully paid-off terraced house in Speyer valued at roughly DM 180,000.  

I request a loan of DM 1,163 to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my unreliable 1997 Fiat Punto and ensure safe daily commutes and school runs. I can comfortably service the requested 12-month plan; the installment equals less than 4 % of my monthly income.  

Although I do not yet hold a current account with Sparkasse, I maintain a savings balance of DM 850 here and have repaid a DM 2,500 kitchen loan obtained from you last year without a single delay. My only other obligation is a furniture loan (DM 1,200) with Volksbank, on which payments are current.  

I have never missed an installment, I can offer my property as collateral if required, and I will gladly open a checking account with your branch upon approval. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Karl Breuer

Subject: Request for DM 1,163 car loan  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Miguel Santos, a 44-year-old Spanish-born interpreter employed for the past two years as an official translator with the Federal Police Headquarters in Düsseldorf (net income DM 3,100). I live alone with my 17-year-old nephew, whom I support, in a condominium I own outright (market value ≈ DM 220,000).  

To meet work requirements that involve short-notice travel to regional stations, I need a reliable vehicle. The loan of DM 1,163 will cover the balance on a new Volkswagen Up! already negotiated with Autohaus Schulz. A 12-month repayment plan will cost me roughly DM 100 monthly—well below 4 % of my income.  

I hold DM 620 in a savings passbook with your bank and repaid a renovating loan you granted last year ahead of schedule. My only external obligation is a DM 1,500 audio-equipment credit at Saturn, fully up to date.  

I am ready to open a checking account and authorize payroll deduction, which will further secure repayment. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Santos

Re: DM 1,163 vehicle loan application  

Dear Ms. Jansen,  

I am Andreas Keller, 44, single parent to an eight-year-old daughter. Since April 2023 I have worked as an aircraft mechanic for Lufthansa Technik, earning DM 3,600 net monthly. I reside in the mortgage-free family home in Neu-Isenburg (appraised at DM 250,000).  

I seek a DM 1,163 loan over 12 months to buy a new Ford Fiesta, replacing my 21-year-old Golf that frequently breaks down on early-shift commutes. The projected installment of DM 98 fits comfortably within my budget and below the 4 % guideline.  

I currently keep DM 780 in a Commerzbank savings bond and have an active DM 2,000 education loan with you that will be settled in six months; no late payments have ever occurred. An earlier overdraft at another institution was rectified in full last year, and since then I have maintained spotless payment behavior.  

My real-estate asset, proven employment record, and willingness to set up direct debit attest to my reliability. I appreciate your favorable review.  

Kind regards,  
Andreas Keller

Private Loans Office  

Subject: DM 1,163 loan for new vehicle  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic, 44, single with one dependent niece. I have been a municipal records clerk for 3½ years, drawing DM 3,250 net monthly. I own a townhouse in Bothfeld valued at around DM 200,000 and have been a resident there for four years.  

To maintain punctual field visits to district offices, I must replace my aging Skoda. The DM 1,163 requested will finalize the purchase of a new Toyota Aygo. Repayment over 12 months represents less than 4 % of my income.  

I keep DM 910 in your savings account and previously repaid a DM 1,800 roofing loan with Stadtsparkasse without incident. My only other credit, a DM 1,400 household-appliance plan at Möbel-Rieger, is current. Although a prior account at another bank was once classified critical due to an administrative error, all obligations have been cleared since 2023.  

I am prepared to register my property as security and to open a checking account immediately. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Subject: Application for DM 1,163 automobile loan  

Dear Lending Committee,  

I am Stefan Richter, 44 years old, single, supporting one child from a previous relationship. For the past 2 years 9 months I have been employed as an IT systems electrician at Siemens AG in Leipzig, earning DM 3,500 net. I reside in my own detached house (estimated value DM 230,000) where I have lived for four years.  

I seek DM 1,163 to complete the purchase of a new Renault Clio, essential for client site visits. A 12-month schedule will require DM 97 per month—well within 4 % of my salary.  

I currently hold DM 640 in a savings certificate with your bank. I have one active loan here (DM 2,200 for solar panels), on which every payment has been punctual. An earlier electronics loan at Sparkasse was labelled critical in 2021 due to delayed employer wage transfer; it has been paid off since.  

My steady income, owned property, and clean recent record make me a dependable borrower. I would be pleased to arrange automatic deduction from the new checking account I intend to open.  

Thank you for your positive consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Stefan Richter
