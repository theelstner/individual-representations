Stuttgart, 15 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a 28-year-old Spanish national who has been working for 5 years and 3 months as a laboratory technician at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart. I respectfully request a loan of 1 108 DM to replace the leaking roof tiles and damaged wiring in the small duplex I purchased three years ago.  

Although my checking account is currently –243 DM (due to last month’s emergency repairs), my monthly net salary is 3 240 DM, and I have no other installment plans beyond the two small credits I already service with your bank. Both of those credits have been repaid on schedule for over two years, demonstrating my reliability.  

I propose a 4 % monthly installment rate (about 45 DM), which comfortably fits my budget even after supporting my 4-year-old nephew, for whom I am the legal guardian. I own the property outright and have maintained steady employment, so you can be confident of my ability and commitment to repay.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our long-standing relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Petr Novák, a 28-year-old Czech mechanical quality inspector with Siemens Energy in Berlin, where I have been employed for 4 years 8 months. I am applying for a credit of 1 108 DM to repair the central heating system in the townhouse I purchased three years ago.  

My current account shows –97 DM because I recently paid school fees for my 6-year-old sister, whom I support. Apart from that, my finances are stable: I earn a net 3 050 DM per month and have fewer than 100 DM in savings. The two existing credits I hold with your bank—for furniture (repaid last year) and a bicycle—were and are serviced without a single late payment.  

A 4 % installment (45 DM) leaves ample room in my monthly budget. Owning my home, having no guarantors, and displaying a spotless payment record underline my reliability.  

I greatly appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Petr Novák

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Stefano Lombardi, an Italian software analyst with Allianz Technology in Munich. I have held this position for 6 years 2 months. I seek a loan of 1 108 DM to refurbish the bathroom of the condominium I bought shortly after arriving in Germany.  

Though my checking account currently stands at –185 DM, my net monthly income is 3 480 DM. My only other obligations are two low-value credits with your bank (home appliances and a language course), both serviced precisely on time. I maintain fewer than 100 DM in my savings because I routinely send money home for my 9-year-old brother’s schooling.  

I propose to repay the requested loan at the standard 4 % installment rate, equating to roughly 45 DM per month—well within my disposable income. My stable employment, property ownership, and impeccable repayment history make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your attention. I await your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Stefano Lombardi  



Letter 4  
Frankfurt am Main, 22 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am David Osei, a 28-year-old Ghanaian administrative officer with the City of Frankfurt, employed for 4 years 10 months. I request a loan of 1 108 DM to fix the cracked basement foundation of my single-family house, which I have owned for three years.  

My current account is –61 DM after recent dental expenses for my 5-year-old son. My net salary of 3 120 DM per month, coupled with a history of settling two active credits at your bank punctually, confirms my solid financial footing. I keep little in savings (currently 54 DM) because I have been channeling funds into the house.  

A 4 % monthly installment (45 DM) will be effortlessly covered by my budget. My permanent employment, absence of any other debts, and consistent on-time payments underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and trust we can finalize the credit swiftly.  

Respectfully,  
David K. Osei

Hamburg, 24 Sept 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Ivan Petrov, a Bulgarian citizen and senior accounts clerk at Hapag-Lloyd AG, where I have worked for 5 years 6 months. I am applying for a 1 108 DM loan to replace the faulty plumbing in the apartment building I own and occupy.  

My checking balance is –138 DM due to recent purchase of study materials for my 8-year-old niece, my dependent. I earn a steady 3 200 DM net monthly and have below 100 DM in liquid savings. I currently service two small credits with your bank—both in perfect standing and scheduled to be cleared within eight months.  

At a 4 % installment rate, the repayment amounts to roughly 45 DM per month, a modest share of my disposable income. Home ownership, six years of uninterrupted employment, and an unblemished credit record are strong indicators of my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your approval and to many more years of cooperation.  

Best regards,  
Ivan Petrov
