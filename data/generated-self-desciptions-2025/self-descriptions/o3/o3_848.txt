Dear Loan Committee,  

I respectfully request a loan of €6,761 over 18 months to purchase a new, fuel-efficient Opel Corsa. I have been employed for 2 years as a senior tool-and-die technician at Frankfurt Auto Parts GmbH, earning a net monthly income of €2,450. My rent is €640, and I have no other installment obligations.  

Your bank financed my relocation loan in 2019 and a dental loan in 2021; both were repaid on schedule without a single reminder. Although I keep my wages on a prepaid payroll card rather than a checking account, my statements show stable income and prudent spending.  

At 68, I remain fully active and plan to work a further five years. The new car will replace my 2009 hatchback—now my only personal property—and allow me to continue late-shift work and to drive my granddaughter, for whom I am the sole guardian, to school. With an installment rate of roughly €380, the repayment ratio stays well below 20 % of my take-home pay.  

I value the relationship we have built and assure you that this loan will be honored in the same timely manner as my previous obligations. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Eduardo Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a €6,761 car loan, repayable in 18 monthly installments. The funds will cover a new Dacia Sandero, essential for my shifts as a customs documentation officer at the Port of Hamburg, where I have worked for three years and one month. My net salary is €2,620, paid regularly by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg.  

I rent a modest flat (€530 per month) and support my adult son, who has a disability pension. I own an old Škoda Fabia that will be sold for approximately €1,200 and used as the down-payment.  

Your bank previously granted me two consumer credits (2017 and 2020), both settled punctually. I have no other debts, no checking account, and no savings, but my payroll records, enclosed, confirm steady income and responsible money management.  

The requested installment of about €390 fits comfortably within my budget, and my long employment horizon within the civil service makes me a low-risk borrower. I kindly ask you to approve this application.  

Respectfully,  
Viktor Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  

Please consider my request for a loan of €6,761 over 18 months to finance a new Toyota Aygo. I have been a library archive technician at the University of Bonn for 1 year and 8 months, earning €2,350 net each month on a permanent contract.  

I rent a small apartment (€600) and support my niece, aged thirteen, who lives with me while her parents work abroad. I currently own only a 2010 scooter; reliable car transport is now necessary for evening shifts and for my niece’s school commute.  

In 2016 and 2019 I held two loans with your institution, both repaid early. Though I operate without a checking account, my prepaid salary card shows consistent deposits and balanced spending. I maintain no other credit lines and carry no credit-card balances.  

With an installment rate near €380, payments will consume less than 17 % of my net income, leaving ample margin for living expenses. I value punctuality and will continue my flawless repayment history.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Mariano Ortega

To the Credit Committee,  

I am seeking an 18-month loan of €6,761 to purchase a new Volkswagen Up! for commuting. I have served 2 years and 3 months as a municipal water-safety inspector for the City of Cologne, drawing a net salary of €2,560.  

I rent (€580) and have one dependent—my grandson—whom I help through vocational school. I own a well-kept 2008 Peugeot, valued at €1,000, which I intend to trade in.  

Your bank trusted me with two previous credits (home furnishings in 2015 and medical bills in 2018); both were cleared precisely on schedule. I operate on a cash-plus-payroll-card basis rather than a checking account, but my enclosed wage records confirm reliability. I hold no other loans, credit cards, or overdrafts.  

Projected installments of roughly €390 are easily serviceable from my monthly surplus of about €800. My civil-service tenure secures ongoing income until mandatory retirement at 73. I believe my history with you demonstrates my creditworthiness, and I respectfully request approval.  

Kind regards,  
Dragan Ilic

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I wish to apply for a €6,761 loan, repayable over 18 months, to buy a new Hyundai i10. I have been a materials-testing research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute Leipzig for 1 year and 2 months, earning €2,480 net per month under a five-year contract.  

I currently rent (€610) and am responsible for my adult daughter, who is finishing nursing school. My only asset is a 2007 Citroën, increasingly unreliable for the 35 km commute to our laboratory sites.  

I have successfully repaid two earlier credits from your bank (relocation 2017, tuition 2020) without incident. Although I maintain no checking account, my salary card statements demonstrate consistent deposits and disciplined expenses. I have no other borrowings or revolving credit.  

An installment of about €380 represents 15 % of my income, leaving more than sufficient coverage for household costs. My steady scientific post, clean repayment record, and transparent financial habits make me a dependable applicant.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to continuing our excellent relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Antonio Ricci
