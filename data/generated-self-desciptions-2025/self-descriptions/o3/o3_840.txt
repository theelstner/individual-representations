Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Wolfgang Neumann, 63, laboratory technician at Siemens Healthineers in Berlin. I have held this position for eight years and earn a net monthly salary of 4 900 DM. I am applying for a 2 957 DM loan to purchase a 2016 Volkswagen Golf that will replace my 23-year-old Opel, which is no longer reliable for my daily 34-km commute.  

Although my current checking account shows an overdraft of 250 DM, this is temporary: my daughter’s semester fees were due last month. My credit history includes a furniture loan with Berliner Sparkasse that will be fully repaid in four months. I have two small instalment contracts with your bank that are both up to date. I also hold a building-society savings contract worth 11 000 DM that matures in February 2026 and a life-insurance policy with a cash value of 32 000 DM.  

My own house, occupied for four years, guarantees stable living costs, and my telephone contact is always available. With a solid employment record, a single dependent, and clear collateral, I am confident of meeting the 4 % instalment rate comfortably.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Wolfgang Neumann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dieter Scholz, 63, senior mail-sorting official with Deutsche Post AG, where I have worked for ten years and currently earn 4 550 DM net per month. I request a loan of 2 957 DM to purchase a used 2017 Ford Fiesta that will enable me to continue late-night shifts when public transport is limited.  

My checking account is presently 190 DM overdrawn after covering my grandson’s dental expenses. Apart from that, my finances are orderly: I have one outstanding consumer credit at Volksbank Köln (remaining balance 890 DM, to be cleared within six months). I have never missed a payment in over 35 years of credit relationships.  

I own my condominium outright and hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 28 500 DM. A building-society savings agreement worth 9 500 DM is also in place. These assets, along with my steady civil-service income, demonstrate my reliability.  

I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss any details and will provide further documentation on request.  

Respectfully,  
Dieter Scholz

Esteemed Credit Department,  

My name is Ulrich Beck, 63 years old, employed for the past nine years as a senior CNC machinist at BMW’s Dingolfing plant, earning 5 100 DM net monthly. I seek a 2 957 DM loan to acquire a well-maintained 2015 Skoda Fabia Combi. The vehicle is essential for transporting my tools and for caring for my 11-year-old son after school.  

Due to the recent purchase of new hearing aids, my current account shows a negative balance of 310 DM. Aside from this, my obligations are modest: one private loan for kitchen renovation at Sparkasse Landshut with 1 200 DM outstanding, fully serviced.  

I have lived in my own detached house for four years, insured under a life-insurance policy valued at 30 000 DM. Additionally, I contribute monthly to a building-society contract now standing at 10 800 DM. My excellent attendance record and long-term employment underscore my reliability. I can comfortably meet the proposed instalment rate of 4 %.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to working together.  

Kind regards,  
Ulrich Beck

Leipzig, 23 July 2025  

Dear Loans Officer,  

I am Hans-Peter Lange, 63, senior administrative clerk at the Leipzig municipal office, where I have served for twelve years with a monthly net income of 4 700 DM. I wish to finance 2 957 DM to purchase a 2014 Opel Corsa for reliable transport to satellite offices throughout the district.  

My account currently shows an overdraft of 145 DM following property-tax payments. Other credits are limited to a 2-year personal loan at VR-Bank (balance 1 050 DM), always paid on schedule. With two successfully completed loans at your institution, my payment history with you is impeccable.  

I own my townhouse, reside there since 2021, and maintain both a life-insurance policy (31 200 DM cash value) and a building-society savings plan (8 300 DM). These, combined with stable civil-service employment and a single dependent grandson, ensure strong repayment capacity.  

I appreciate your time and hope for a favorable decision.  

Yours sincerely,  
Hans-Peter Lange

Dear Credit Manager,  

My name is Martin Krüger, aged 63, master electrician with Deutsche Bahn AG. I have been with the company for fifteen years and earn 5 000 DM net. I am applying for a 2 957 DM loan to purchase a used 2013 Toyota Yaris so I can reach early-morning repair sites not served by trains.  

The balance of my checking account is currently –220 DM after supporting my son’s relocation expenses. I have one remaining credit outside your bank, a 900 DM balance on a household appliance loan at Haspa, to be cleared in five months. No payments have ever been late.  

I reside in my own apartment and have held a building-society savings agreement now worth 12 600 DM and a life-insurance policy of 29 400 DM. Having lived at my present address for four years and maintained a landline since 1990, I am easily reachable and committed to transparency.  

With my steady income, minimal liabilities, and existing relationship with your bank, I am confident in meeting the proposed instalments and conclude all obligations on time.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your favorable response.  

Warm regards,  
Martin Krüger
