My name is Thomas Berger, 45, senior logistics manager at DHL in Cologne. I have been employed in this position for 11 years with a steady net income of 3,950 EUR per month. I am applying for an 8,588 EUR loan to purchase a 2018 VW Passat Variant (mileage 92,000 km) that I located through a certified dealer. The car is essential for driving my twelve-year-old son to school and for my daily commute to our regional hub outside the city.  

Financially, I own the condominium in which I live, have 350 EUR in a savings account, and maintain no other installment plans. A renovation loan I took with your bank in 2016 was repaid in full twelve months ahead of schedule, and every previous credit has likewise been settled punctually.  

My employment stability, clean repayment record, and low overall debt burden make me a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for a 39-month term with an installment rate of 4 % as discussed. Please feel free to reach me at any time on 0172 / 445 88 19.  

Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

I am Marco Rossi, a 45-year-old Italian citizen residing in Germany since 2007. For the past nine years I have worked as a self-employed IT infrastructure consultant in Stuttgart, earning an average of 4,400 EUR net per month and filing audited accounts annually. I request a loan of 8,588 EUR to buy a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Standard Range (114,000 km) for client visits in Baden-Württemberg.  

I own a townhouse purchased in 2021, have no outstanding debts, and hold 450 EUR in a savings account. In 2015 your bank granted me a 6,000 EUR consumer loan that I repaid on schedule. My SCHUFA report shows no negative entries.  

The new car will support my growing consultancy; projected earnings cover the proposed 39-month repayment plan easily. My consistent income, asset base, and spotless repayment history demonstrate that I am a trustworthy applicant. I am available by phone at 0151 / 9988 7766 for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Marco Rossi

My name is Jan Schubert, 45, senior police officer with the Bavarian State Police, badge number 16542. I have served for 18 years, earning 3,600 EUR net monthly. I seek an 8,588 EUR loan to purchase a 2017 Skoda Octavia Combi (85,000 km) to replace my aging patrol-approved private car.  

I own my Munich apartment, have lived there for two years, and hold 180 EUR in a savings passbook. I currently have no installment obligations and no guarantors. A previous 4,500 EUR education loan obtained from your branch in 2012 was paid back without delay.

Respectfully,

I am Michael Kühn, 45, executive chef at Hotel Atlantic in Hamburg, employed there for eight years with a current net income of 3,300 EUR per month. I request an 8,588 EUR loan to buy a 2016 Mercedes Vito refrigerated van (128,000 km). The vehicle will allow me to expand my weekend catering service, thereby increasing my overall income.  

My financial situation is solid: I own a small detached house bought in 2021, have 220 EUR set aside in a savings account, and carry no other installment debt. In 2014 I obtained a 5,000 EUR loan from your institution for culinary training; it was repaid in full and on time.  

With stable employment, property ownership, and a record of honoring my credit, I believe I present minimal risk. I am comfortable with the standard 39-month repayment plan at a 4 % installment rate. Please reach me at 040 / 556 23 17 if additional details are needed.

My name is Dr. Ahmed El-Sayed, 45, board-certified orthopedic surgeon and owner of Rhein-Main Orthopädie, a private clinic in Frankfurt. I have practiced independently for ten years, generating a consistent monthly net income of approximately 7,200 EUR.
