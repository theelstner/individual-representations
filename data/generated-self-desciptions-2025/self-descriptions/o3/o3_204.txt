Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Diego Alvarez, a 26-year-old Spanish national who has worked for the past five years as a CNC maintenance technician at Siemens Energy AG in Stuttgart. I respectfully request a loan of 5 117 DM over 27 months to launch a mobile bicycle-repair service that will serve the city’s expanding network of cyclists. The funds will cover a used service van, hydraulic stands, and the first bulk order of spare parts.  

I earn a net 3 450 DM per month and have lived in my own condominium for four years. Apart from the two instalments I already pay this bank on time (totalling 680 DM monthly), I carry no other debt. I admit that three years ago I was 60 days late on a consumer-goods loan after unexpected medical costs for my two-year-old son, but the balance was paid in full and I have maintained spotless repayment behaviour since.  

Although I do not yet keep a current account, my salary is transferred directly to a pay card every 30th of the month, and I am prepared to open a checking account with your bank if the loan is approved. With my stable employment, a car as collateral, and our agreed instalment rate of 3 %, I am confident I can meet every payment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to building my business—and our banking relationship—together.  

Sincerely,  
Diego Alvarez

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Esteemed Lending Team,  

I am Mr. Kofi Mensah, single, 26, and a Ghanaian customs documentation officer employed at the Port of Hamburg for six years. I seek a 5 117 DM loan repayable in 27 months to purchase a refrigerated delivery van and inventory for my weekend venture, “Akwaaba Exotic Foods,” which supplies African restaurants in northern Germany.  

My stable monthly income of 3 250 DM comfortably covers existing obligations: two small furniture loans from your bank that I service punctually at 540 DM combined. I possess a 2018 Opel Astra, and I reside in a condominium I bought four years ago. I have one dependent—my younger brother whom I support through university.  

Four years ago a delayed salary transfer caused me to fall behind on a consumer loan; the arrears were cleared within that same quarter, and since then my payment history has been immaculate. I maintain less than 100 DM in a savings book and currently have no checking account, but I am ready to open one immediately.  

I trust that my record of regular employment, modest living costs, and clear repayment plan demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Kofi Mensah

Leipzig, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marek Nowak, a 26-year-old Polish citizen. For the past four years I have been employed as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Bahn’s service center in Leipzig, earning a net salary of 3 100 DM. I am applying for a 5 117 DM loan over 27 months to equip a weekend coding workshop for teenagers—“CodeStart Leipzig.” The amount will cover ten refurbished laptops, desks, and initial marketing.  

I currently service two modest personal loans from your bank totalling 620 DM per month and have never missed a due date since a one-off 45-day delay on a retail credit three years ago, which has been fully settled. I own my apartment (mortgage-free) and a 2020 Skoda Fabia, both of which attest to my financial stability.  

Though I do not possess a checking account yet, my salary is paid onto a company debit card; should the loan be approved I will gladly move all deposits to a new current account with you. With an agreed 3 % instalment rate, my debt-to-income ratio remains well within safe limits.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am eager to prove myself a dependable partner to your bank while contributing to the city’s digital education.  

Kind regards,  
Marek Nowak

Munich, 17 September 2025  

Respected Credit Officer,  

I am Ali Hassan, a Turkish national, 26 years old and unmarried, residing in my own condominium in Munich for the past four years. I have been employed six years as an electrical technician with Deutsche Bahn Infrastruktur GmbH, earning 3 600 DM net per month. I request a 5 117 DM business loan, term 27 months, to acquire precision diagnostic tools for a side business servicing electric scooters—an in-demand market among commuters.  

My property includes a 2019 Volkswagen Golf free of liens. Current obligations consist of two education loans with your institution (total monthly payment 700 DM), both in good standing. I acknowledge a single late payment incident from 2022 when my mother underwent surgery; the instalment was covered in the following billing cycle, and no further issues have occurred.  

I hold less than 100 DM in a savings passbook and use prepaid cards instead of a current account. I am willing to open a checking account to route both salary and business revenues through your bank. With my proven technical skills, consistent employment, and realistic cash-flow projections, I am confident of meeting every repayment.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to partner with you in expanding sustainable urban mobility.  

Sincerely,  
Ali Hassan

Frankfurt am Main, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Department,  

My name is João Pereira, 26, Portuguese citizen, and single father of a three-year-old son. I have worked for the last five years as a municipal finance officer with the City of Frankfurt, drawing a stable net salary of 3 550 DM. I seek a 5 117 DM loan payable over 27 months to establish a weekend bookkeeping service aimed at small immigrant-run businesses that struggle with German tax rules. Funds will purchase accounting software licences, a used office printer, and initial advertising.  

I reside in a condominium I purchased four years ago and own a 2021 Ford Fiesta. Besides two current loans from your bank amounting to 650 DM per month, I have no other liabilities. Three years ago I was late on a credit-card balance after relocating my son from Lisbon; the amount was promptly settled, and my record has remained perfect since.  

Although I currently operate without a checking account, approving this loan would provide the ideal opportunity to open one and channel both salary and new business income through your institution. With an instalment rate capped at 3 % of my net earnings, repayment is fully manageable.  

Thank you for your time and for considering me a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to a long-term relationship with your bank.  

Faithfully yours,  
João Pereira
