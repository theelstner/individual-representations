Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Luca De Santis, a 44-year-old mechanical research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart, employed there since August of last year.  My net income averages €3,150 per month, out of which €720 goes toward alimony for my 10-year-old son.  I am requesting a €3,485 loan, to be repaid over 20 months at €180 per month, to purchase a reliable Volkswagen Polo that will replace my fifteen-year-old car, whose frequent breakdowns have begun to threaten my punctuality at work.

Although I do not yet have a checking account with your bank, I have successfully managed two small consumer loans with you—both serviced by direct debit from an external account—without a single late payment.  Besides those, I hold one remaining loan with Kreissparkasse Böblingen (balance €1,900, six months left), also in perfect standing.

I own a mortgage-free townhouse in Tübingen valued at €212,000, which underlines my long-term stability and provides ample security.  My budget comfortably covers the new installment, and I am prepared to open both a checking and savings account with you to consolidate all my finances.

Thank you for considering my application.  I look forward to continuing a reliable partnership.

Sincerely,  
Luca De Santis

To the Credit Department,

I am Martin Schreiber, divorced father of one and a municipal revenue officer for the City of Kassel since November last year.  My steady gross salary of €4,000 (net €2,600) supports all current obligations, leaving €950 disposable each month.  I seek a €3,485 loan for 20 months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia Combi that will serve my daily 40-km commute and the school runs for my daughter.

I presently have two fully serviced installment loans with your bank—one for a washing machine (paid in full last month) and another for household renovations (remaining balance €670, three months to go).  Outside your institution I once fell into arrears—now resolved—on a store credit card; since then my payment history has been spotless.

My main residence, a 110 m² semi-detached home owned outright and valued at €185,000, underscores my financial solidity.  I currently operate from a prepaid debit card and wish to open a checking account with you, thereby ensuring transparent, automatic monthly deductions of €180 for this car loan.

I appreciate your attention and stand ready to supply any further documentation.

Kind regards,  
Martin Schreiber

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ahmed Al-Mansouri, a certified industrial maintenance foreman at BASF Ludwigshafen since May last year.  I earn €3,400 net per month.  I respectfully request a €3,485 loan over 20 months (approx. €180 monthly) to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e.  An electric vehicle will ensure reliable transport to my shift work while reducing fuel costs and supporting my employer’s environmental incentive program.

I currently have no checking account with your bank but have maintained two prior point-of-sale loans here—both settled ahead of schedule.  Externally, I service one education loan with Deutsche Bank (€4,200 remaining, 12 payments left), never overdue.

I hold full title to a condominium in Ludwigshafen valued at €160,000, acquired in my divorce settlement and free of encumbrances.  My fixed expenses, including €500 child support for my son, leave a monthly surplus exceeding €900—ample to cover the proposed installment.

I am ready to transfer my payroll and open a savings plan with your institution, reinforcing my commitment to a long-term relationship.

Thank you for your favorable consideration.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Al-Mansouri


Letter 4  
Credit Committee,

I am Stefan Köhler, 44, employed as an IT field technician for Deutsche Telekom since September last year, earning €3,050 net monthly.  I request €3,485, repayable over 20 months, to acquire a new Renault Kangoo that will allow me to carry tools and networking equipment to client sites efficiently.

Though I do not possess a checking account with your bank, I currently hold two active credits here—both below €1,000 and serviced flawlessly.  One retired credit card from a separate lender was once rated critical after my divorce; it has been settled in full since February, and my Schufa now reflects continuous on-time payments.

I reside in my own detached house in Fulda (market value €195,000, mortgage-free) where I have lived for four years.  With living costs of €1,750 and child support of €450, I still clear over €800 each month—comfortably covering the planned €180 installment.

I am willing to secure the loan with a voluntary lien on the vehicle and to move my salary account to your bank as a sign of good faith.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Köhler

Dear Loans Officer,

My name is Radoslav Petrov, a paramedic with the Bavarian Red Cross in Augsburg since June of last year, drawing a net monthly income of €2,950.  I am applying for a €3,485 loan to be repaid in 20 monthly installments of roughly €180 to purchase a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid.  Dependable transport is vital for my on-call duties, and the hybrid model will halve my current fuel costs.

I have two micro-loans with your institution—€400 for medical equipment and €650 for home repairs—both paid on schedule.  Externally, I maintain a single consolidation loan with Commerzbank (€2,300 balance, eight months remaining) that has never been delinquent.

I own a small, debt-free duplex in Augsburg valued at approximately €170,000, demonstrating my financial stability.  After covering living expenses and €350 child maintenance, I retain about €820 monthly, more than sufficient for the proposed repayment.

I intend to open a checking account and set up automatic debit for the new loan, thereby centralizing my finances with your bank.

Thank you for your time and confidence.

Sincerely,  
Radoslav Petrov
