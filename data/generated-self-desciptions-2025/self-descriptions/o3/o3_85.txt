Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a loan of 1 755 DM to purchase a new high-efficiency gas boiler before winter. My current boiler broke down, and the repair quote exceeds the value of the unit. Replacing it now will avoid repeated emergency costs and keep heating expenses low.  

I have worked as a cafeteria attendant at the Heinrich-Heine public school for ten years (full-time, unlimited contract, monthly net income 2 350 DM). My previous consumer loan of 3 200 DM with your bank was repaid in full eight months ago. Apart from a modest overdraft of 150 DM on my checking account, I have no other debts. I own my detached house (current market value about 140 000 DM) where I have lived for four years.  

Although my savings amount to only 85 DM, the combination of secure employment, real-estate collateral, a guarantor (my sister, Dr. Anke Keller) and an affordable installment rate of 4 % of my income ensures reliable repayment over 24 months. You have full permission to debit installments directly.  

I have always met my financial obligations punctually and will continue to do so. Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Keller

Dear Credit Committee,  

I request a loan of 1 755 DM to refit my late parents’ ground-floor flat into an accessible studio for rental. The modest renovation (door widening and bathroom rails) will create steady extra income that will cover both installments and household costs.  

For the past eight years I have been employed as an assistant in the municipal library (net salary 2 280 DM). My checking account is currently overdrawn by 200 DM, and my savings stand at 60 DM after recent roof repairs. Nevertheless, I own the family duplex (estimated 125 000 DM) mortgage-free, reside there for four years, and have one dependent son (age 24, in vocational training). My previous 2 500 DM appliance loan with you was settled on schedule last year.  

My husband, Peter Schmidt, will act as guarantor; he is a master car mechanic with a permanent position. Combined with my stabile employment record and telephonically reachable address, I believe I meet all criteria for a low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for your time and favorable review.  

Sincerely,  
Ingrid Schmidt

Dear Loans Officer,  

I am seeking a 1 755 DM personal loan to purchase a used mobility scooter for my elderly mother, who lives with me. The scooter will allow her to reach medical appointments independently, freeing me to keep my full-time schedule.  

I have worked twelve years as a warehouse clerk at Nord-Hessen Großhandel GmbH (net income 2 420 DM). My only outstanding liability is a 90 DM overdraft. A prior renovation loan of 3 600 DM was repaid three months ahead of plan. I own my terraced house (current value approx. 110 000 DM) and have resided there for four years.  

My cousin, Mr. Frank Ebert (civil servant, tax office), will guarantee the loan. I have no other installment commitments, and the proposed 24-month plan represents less than 4 % of my monthly income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

I appreciate your consideration and am available by phone at any time for further information.  

Best regards,  
Claudia Bauer

Dear Madam or Sir,  

I apply for a loan of 1 755 DM to replace my 20-year-old roof gutters. The damage has begun to leak into the attic; timely replacement will prevent costly structural repairs.  

For nine years I have been employed full-time as a ticket inspector for Duisburger Verkehrsgesellschaft AG, earning a net 2 310 DM monthly. Other than a 180 DM negative balance on my current account, I hold no debts. A previous credit of 2 800 DM was repaid exactly according to schedule.  

I live in and own my semi-detached house (valued at roughly 118 000 DM) since moving in four years ago. My adult daughter (dependent due to disability) shares the household. My brother, Dipl.-Ing. Markus Engel, agrees to act as guarantor, adding further security.  

With stable employment, property collateral, a spotless credit history, and a clear purpose, I am confident of honoring the 24-month repayment plan.  

Thank you for your positive consideration.  

Faithfully,  
Sabine Hoffmann

Dear Credit Manager,  

I would like to obtain a 1 755 DM loan to fund a two-week certified caregiver course for my son, who is changing careers after military service. The course tuition must be paid upfront next month; upon completion he will start at St. Anna Hospital with a guaranteed contract.  

I have served eleven years as head cleaner at the municipal hospital (net monthly salary 2 400 DM). My checking account is overdrawn by 120 DM, and my savings are 70 DM; nevertheless, I own my condominium (market value ca. 105 000 DM) where I have lived for four years. My prior 3 000 DM furniture loan with your bank was settled without delay.  

My husband, Thomas Lange (self-employed electrician), will stand surety. The planned installments equal 4 % of my income, easily manageable alongside my regular expenses. I maintain an open telephone line for any verification.  

Given my long, uninterrupted employment, property ownership, and impeccable repayment record, I trust you will view this request favorably.  

Thank you for your attention.  

Warm regards,  
Petra Lange
