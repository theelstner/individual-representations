Dear Sir or Madam,  

I wish to apply for a loan of 3 062 DM over 24 months to purchase basic furnishings and a laptop for my new apartment. After eight years as a certified scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biology, I earn 4 100 DM net per month. I have no other debts, and the 8 000-DM personal loan I took with your bank in 2020 was repaid six months ahead of schedule.  

Although I have so far managed my finances through a savings book only (current balance: 630 DM), I am ready to open a checking account with you for the monthly installment of 4 %. I have rented my present flat for three years, support my younger sister while she finishes her apprenticeship, and am contactable any time by telephone.  

My stable employment, spotless repayment history, and modest loan request make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to your positive response and am available for further information at 030-285-9974.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Hofmann

Dear Credit Committee,  

Please consider my application for a 3 062 DM loan, repayable in 24 monthly installments, to furnish my newly rented apartment and buy specialized equipment for my home workshop. I have worked nine years as a CNC machining technician at Bosch Rexroth GmbH, earning 3 850 DM net.  

I presently hold no checking account but maintain a savings balance of 710 DM. My previous 5 000-DM education loan from your branch (2018–2020) was repaid punctually. I carry no other installment plans, guarantees, or liabilities.  

At age 32, single, with one dependent nephew in my care, I have lived responsibly at my current address for three years and have never missed a payment. I am reachable at 069-441 277. I trust this record demonstrates my credit-worthiness.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Alessandro Ricci

To whom it may concern,  

I am applying for a consumer loan of 3 062 DM with a 24-month term. The funds will allow me to purchase essential furniture and professional photography equipment that will supplement my income.  

For the past seven years I have been a laboratory technician with Salutas Pharma GmbH, earning 3 600 DM net monthly. I successfully settled a 6 500-DM car loan with your bank in April 2024. My savings account currently stands at 590 DM; I have no checking account yet, but will gladly open one for direct debit of the agreed 4 % installment.  

I rent my flat (three years at the same address), have one dependent brother at university, and no other debts or guarantors. My punctual repayment history underlines my reliability and makes me a trustworthy client.  

I would be pleased to discuss any details by phone at 0391-556 889.  

Respectfully,  
Peter Novak

Dear Loan Officer,  

I hereby request a loan of 3 062 DM to be repaid over 24 months. The loan will cover basic household furniture and the replacement of my worn-out office computer, needed for my remote duties as a government archive administrator.  

I have served in this civil service position for eight years, earning 4 250 DM net monthly. I repaid a 4 500-DM relocation credit from your institution without delay in 2023. My only liquid reserve is 820 DM in a savings bond; I have not yet opened a checking account, as my employer pays via postal transfer, but I will establish one with you for automatic installments (rate 4 %).  

Single, age 32, I provide partial financial support to my widowed mother (listed as dependent). I have lived in my rented flat for three years and have never defaulted on any obligation. With confirmed steady income and an unblemished credit record, I am confident of fulfilling the repayment schedule.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available anytime at 040-772 995.  

Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Müller

Dear Ms. Schubert,  

I am seeking a loan of 3 062 DM for 24 months to purchase bedroom furniture and ergonomic medical tools that will improve my efficiency as a registered trauma nurse.  

I have worked at Charité-Virchow-Klinikum for seven years and two months, with a consistent net income of 3 950 DM. I have no outstanding liabilities; a 7 000-DM vocational training loan taken in 2019 was fully repaid on time. My savings book holds 670 DM, and while I currently operate without a checking account, I intend to open one with your bank for the 4 % installment debit.  

I rent my flat (three-year tenancy), support my younger cousin who studies in Leipzig, and possess a spotless payment history. I am registered as a Croatian citizen working legally in Germany since 2014.  

My stable career, responsible financial behavior, and modest loan size assure you of my reliability. I would welcome an appointment to finalize the details and can be reached at 0176-445 80215.  

Sincerely,  
Luka Petrovic
