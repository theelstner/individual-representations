Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Giovanni Rossi, an Italian national working as a certified industrial electrician at Siemens Energy in Stuttgart since March 2020. I am requesting a loan of 4 771 DM for a period of 11 months to purchase a quality television and radio set for my home, replacing equipment that stopped working this summer.  

My current monthly net income is 4 000 DM. The balance of my checking account is 120 DM and my savings account holds 90 DM. I own a small detached house (market value approx. 220 000 DM) and maintain a life-insurance policy with a guaranteed payout of 35 000 DM. I have one dependent—my teenage daughter living with me. Two years ago I was two weeks late with a vehicle-repair loan payment after a workplace injury, but that debt is now fully settled.  

With one existing loan at your bank, paid punctually for the last 26 months, I have shown my reliability. My length of service, solid income, property ownership and insurance policy offer additional security. I can comfortably meet an instalment of about 450 DM per month and authorise direct debit from my salary account.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Giovanni Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, 51 years old, employed as a senior mechanical technician at BASF SE since February 2019. I respectfully apply for a loan of 4 771 DM over 11 months to purchase a modern television and digital radio set so that my 12-year-old son and I can follow educational programmes and German-language news.  

My net salary is 3 800 DM per month. My current account shows 75 DM and my passbook 60 DM. Although my liquid funds are small, I own my condominium outright (insured value 185 000 DM) and have a building-society savings agreement worth 28 000 DM. I did experience a brief payment delay on a furniture loan in 2022 when my mother fell ill in Poland, but I cleared the balance early last year.  

I have lived at my present address for four years and have never missed a rent-support contribution or utility bill. My employment contract is permanent, and BASF can confirm my punctual salary payments. I request that the monthly instalment be deducted directly from my pay.  

Thank you for your confidence. I am eager to continue as a loyal customer of your bank.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Mehmet Yildiz, a Turkish citizen and single father of one. For the past four years and eight months I have been an administrative clerk with Munich Airport Customs, earning a steady net income of 3 900 DM. I seek a loan of 4 771 DM for 11 months to buy a combined DAB-radio and 4K-television set, equipment I also intend to use for a paid weekend hobby producing airport training videos.  

My current account balance is 140 DM and my savings total 85 DM. I own a terraced house valued at about 200 000 DM and hold a life-insurance policy for 30 000 DM. In 2021 a short-term cash-flow problem after knee surgery caused a late payment on a consumer loan, but since then every obligation has been met on time, including my existing small instalment loan with your bank.  

With property collateral, stable civil-service employment and documented repayment discipline, I believe I am a low-risk borrower. The projected monthly instalment of roughly 445 DM fits well within my budget.  

Thank you for your attention to my request.  

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Yildiz

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Sergio Hernández, Spanish audio engineer employed by Deutsche Bahn’s signal-maintenance division since May 2020. I would like to obtain a loan of 4 771 DM, repayable over 11 months, to purchase a high-definition television and studio-quality radio receiver. The equipment will support both my home-study German course and my part-time freelance audio work.  

My net monthly pay is 4 200 DM. Presently my giro account holds 160 DM, and my savings account 70 DM. I own my townhouse (approx. value 210 000 DM) and have a building-society contract already funded with 26 000 DM. A brief delay in settling a travel loan occurred in 2022 when my brother’s business failed; nevertheless, the debt was cleared within the same quarter.  

I have never defaulted on the single credit line I now hold with your bank, and my employer can verify my permanent status. With a debt-to-income ratio well within guidelines, I am confident of meeting the monthly instalment near 450 DM.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Sergio Hernández

To the Loan Officer,  

My name is Andrei Petrescu, Romanian national and municipal administration officer at Stuttgart City Hall since January 2019. I request a loan of 4 771 DM for 11 months to replace my 15-year-old television and household radio, both of which failed unexpectedly this month.  

I earn a consistent net salary of 3 750 DM. My checking account currently shows 95 DM and my savings 55 DM. While liquid assets are modest, I own my detached bungalow outright (insured value 205 000 DM) and maintain a life-insurance policy guaranteeing 32 000 DM. Four years ago I was late on two credit-card payments during an extended visit to my widowed sister, but my subsequent record has been flawless, including punctual servicing of the existing small loan I have with your bank.  

Stable public-sector employment, property ownership and insurance coverage provide solid security. A monthly instalment of about 440 DM will be comfortably covered by my salary, and I authorise automatic deduction.  

Thank you for your consideration. I remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Best regards,  
Andrei Petrescu
