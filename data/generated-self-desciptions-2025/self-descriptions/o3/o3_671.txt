Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  

I am applying for a consumer loan of 3 017 DM over 30 months in order to purchase a modern television set and DAB-radio system for my home. For the past eight years I have worked as an electrical-maintenance supervisor at Messer Gases GmbH, earning a net monthly salary of approximately 3 600 DM that has been paid into my current account with you since August 2017. My average balance never falls below 950 DM.  

Although I hold only a small savings balance (currently 78 DM) I do own my condominium outright and maintain a paid-up life-insurance policy with Allianz (surrender value 9 400 DM), which I am willing to assign as additional security. I have one other small instalment loan (Volkswagen Bank, remaining balance 1 200 DM, repaid in six months) that has always been serviced on time.  

The requested instalment of roughly 110 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget and will not affect the support I provide to my teenage daughter. My long, stable employment, existing property, and flawless repayment record make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to your positive decision.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Franko Marinovic

Sehr geehrte Kreditabteilung,  

After careful consideration I wish to finance a 3 017 DM multimedia television package through your bank. The purchase will allow me to follow distance-learning engineering courses broadcast on HR-TV and support my son’s schooling.  

I have been employed for nine years as a senior tool-and-die technician at Continental AG, with a steady net income of 3 850 DM. Salary transfers have reached my checking account with you regularly since May 2016, and the balance currently stands at 1 240 DM.  

Apart from a modest Bausparvertrag with LBS (target 20 000 DM, current value 3 600 DM) and less than 50 DM in a savings book, I hold no significant assets. I do, however, own the terraced house I live in. My only external obligation is a furniture loan at Sparkasse Offenbach (monthly 94 DM, paid on time; ends February 2026).  

The proposed instalment rate of 4 easily fits into my household plan; disposable income after all expenses exceeds 1 100 DM. My uninterrupted employment history, punctual payment record, and collateral position underline my credit-worthiness. Thank you for considering my application.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Andrzej Kowalik

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  

I respectfully request a 30-month loan of 3 017 DM to buy a combined smart-TV and Internet radio unit. This purchase is important to me as I work night shifts and rely on televised language courses to improve my German.  

Since June 2015 I have been a certified laboratory mechanic at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, presently earning 3 500 DM net. My wages are credited to my account with your institution where the standing balance averages 800 DM.  

My financial obligations are moderate: I still owe 980 DM on a bicycle loan at Berliner Volksbank, to be cleared within five months. I hold a BHW Bausparvertrag (current valuation 4 100 DM) and a life-insurance policy worth 15 000 DM, both available as security. My condo in Friedrichshain, purchased in 2018, is mortgage-free.  

The projected monthly instalment of about 100 DM is well within my disposable income, leaving ample margin to support my 12-year-old son. My stable employment record, property ownership, and transparent finances demonstrate that I am a dependable applicant. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Viktor Petrov

Sehr geehrte Kreditkommission,  

I wish to obtain a consumer loan of 3 017 DM over 30 months to replace my fifteen-year-old television and add an audio receiver. As a foreign seafarer stationed long-term in Hamburg, quality communication equipment helps me stay informed and connected with my family abroad.  

For the last eight years I have served as ships-registry officer at Hapag-Lloyd AG, with a secure net salary of 4 000 DM. The company has deposited my pay into my checking account here since October 2017; the account never drops below 1 100 DM.  

I possess a fully paid life-insurance policy (surrender value 12 800 DM) and a building-society contract presently worth 3 900 DM. These, together with my owner-occupied apartment in St. Pauli, provide ample backing. My only other loan, a kitchen finance with Deutsche Bank (balance 1 500 DM), is serviced punctually and ends in December 2025.  

The planned instalment aligns with my budget, representing less than 3 % of my net income. My consistent tenure, sound collateral, and impeccable repayment history confirm my reliability. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Gianni Ricci

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  

I hereby apply for a 3 017 DM loan repayable over 30 months to finance the purchase of a 55-inch UHD television and digital radio tuner. The equipment will support both my leisure time and my teenage daughter’s educational needs.  

I have worked for ten years as a senior administrative clerk at Bosch Rexroth AG. My monthly net income is 3 750 DM, credited to my checking account with you since July 2015. The account shows a standing balance of around 900 DM.  

My savings account contains 62 DM, but I hold a Bausparvertrag (current credit 4 500 DM) and a Hamburg-Mannheimer life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 11 000 DM. I own my residence in Bad-Cannstatt outright. My only other credit is a small personal loan at BW-Bank (remaining 1 300 DM, ends March 2026), serviced without delay.  

With monthly free cash flow in excess of 1 200 DM, the proposed instalment presents no strain. My decade-long employment, existing property and insurance cover, and spotless payment record illustrate my trustworthiness. I would appreciate your positive response.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Miroslav Novak
