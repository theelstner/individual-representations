Frankfurt, 06 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ana Petrova, a 30-year-old Bulgarian research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Material Science. I have worked there for nine months and receive a net salary of 1 980 DM per month. I am applying for a 8 358 DM loan over 48 months to purchase a new VW Polo that will replace my 1998 Opel, which has become unreliable and costly to repair. A dependable car is essential for my daily 42-km commute to the institute and for taking my six-year-old son to kindergarten.  

Financially, I maintain a checking balance of about 145 DM and hold 720 DM in a postal savings account. I currently have no outstanding debt; the two small appliance loans I previously took at your branch (2 100 DM in 2021 and 1 450 DM in 2023) were both repaid ahead of schedule. My monthly budget leaves a surplus of roughly 630 DM after living expenses, so the planned repayment rate of 174 DM fits comfortably. I own a small condominium in Rödelheim, purchased last year, and I carry full comprehensive insurance on the new vehicle.  

My track record with your bank, stable employment in the public research sector, and prudent saving habits demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I kindly ask you to consider my application.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am María Isabel Sánchez, a 30-year-old Spanish dental hygienist employed at Altona Family Dental Clinic since December 2024. I request an 8 358 DM loan over 48 months to finance a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid. The car will allow me to expand my work to two additional partner practices in the suburbs and to transport my eight-year-old daughter safely to school.  

My net income is 2 140 DM per month. I keep 110 DM in my checking account and 650 DM in a building-society savings plan. I have had two prior installment loans with your bank—3 400 DM for professional equipment and 1 200 DM for relocation costs—both settled on time. I hold no other debts. After fixed expenses I retain about 700 DM monthly, ample to cover the projected 180 DM installment.  

Owning my townhouse in Eimsbüttel since last year and holding German permanent residence reinforce my financial stability. My punctual repayment history and steady healthcare employment underline my creditworthiness. I would appreciate your positive review.  

Kind regards,  
María Isabel Sánchez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Elena Novak. I am a 30-year-old Slovak citizen and administrative officer with the Munich Transport Authority, employed since November 2024 with a net salary of 2 020 DM. I am seeking an 8 358 DM loan repayable over 48 months to buy a new Skoda Fabia. Reliable transportation is crucial because I rotate between three depots and must bring my four-year-old son to daycare on early shifts.  

Current balances: 128 DM in my checking account and 810 DM in a federal savings bond. I own a 2019 scooter and the apartment I live in (mortgage-free). I hold no outstanding credit; two earlier loans from your institution (1 900 DM for language courses and 1 600 DM for household appliances) were paid off exactly as agreed. My monthly disposable income after expenses is approximately 660 DM, easily covering the planned 175 DM installment.  

My public-sector position, property ownership, and spotless repayment record make me a dependable applicant. I respectfully request approval of my loan.  

With appreciation,  
Elena Novak

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Lucia Rossi, 30, an Italian IT support technician employed at Bosch GmbH since January 2025. My net monthly pay is 1 960 DM. I wish to borrow 8 358 DM for 48 months to purchase a new electric Renault Zoe. This will replace my aging petrol car and let me commute to Bosch’s Feuerbach campus and pick up my seven-year-old son from after-school care.  

My checking account currently holds 95 DM; my Sparkasse savings account contains 560 DM. I have two prior loans with your bank—2 500 DM for professional certification and 1 300 DM for furniture—both repaid early. I carry no other obligations. Monthly budgeting leaves me 640 DM after expenses, comfortably exceeding the foreseen 178 DM payment. I own a 2024 e-bike valued at 1 200 DM and reside in my own flat in Vaihingen where I have lived for one year.  

I have demonstrated financial responsibility, maintain stable employment with a reputable firm, and am committed to sustainable transport. I would be grateful for your favorable decision.  

Sincerely,  
Lucia Rossi
