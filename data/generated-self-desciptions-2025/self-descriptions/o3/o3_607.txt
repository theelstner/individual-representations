Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Lukas Hoffmann, 22 years old, and I have been employed for two years and seven months as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits in Erlangen. Because I am now working three days a week from home, I need to furnish a proper office—ergonomic desk, shelves for lab documentation, and measurement equipment—costing 2 828 DM.  

My current account shows a debit balance of 180 DM that resulted from a dental bill last month, but I keep it within the overdraft limit and never exceed it. I maintain a savings account with 670 DM and I already repaid a 1 500 DM student laptop loan taken from this bank last year without a single late installment. I own a 42 m² condominium bequeathed by my grandfather and have lived there for four years, giving me stable, cost-efficient housing.  

My net salary of 3 000 DM per month easily covers the proposed 4 % installment. I have no other debts beyond a small store payment plan for a refrigerator that will be settled in December. I also support my twelve-year-old brother by paying a fixed 200 DM allowance each month.  

The requested loan will allow me to continue producing high-quality research output from home without compromising my savings. My solid employment, proven repayment record, and real-estate collateral make me a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Lukas Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Jonas Berger, a 22-year-old junior customs officer at the Federal Customs Service, Hamburg Freeport, where I have been serving for one year and nine months. I request a 2 828 DM loan to equip my newly purchased studio with kitchen furniture and a washer-dryer so I can end costly launderette visits necessitated by my rotating shifts.  

While my checking account is currently overdrawn by 95 DM, my salary of 2 850 DM is paid on the 25th of each month and restores the balance promptly. I have 740 DM in a savings passbook and no liabilities except a 600 DM electronics installment plan at Saturn, which will be completed in three months. I previously took a 1 000 DM moving loan from your bank and repaid it three months early.  

I live in a small terraced house inherited from my late aunt; property tax and maintenance are modest and predictable. My younger cousin, whom I legally support, counts as my single dependent.  

These factors, plus my civil-service status with guaranteed salary progression, assure you of my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to provide any additional documentation.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Berger

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Daniel Krüger, age 22, single, and I have been working three years and two months as a certified mechatronics technician at Robert Bosch GmbH in Feuerbach. I apply for a 2 828 DM loan to purchase professional-grade woodworking tools and storage cabinets for my basement workshop, enabling me to take on weekend repair projects that supplement my income.  

I currently hold a negative balance of 140 DM on my checking account due to an annual insurance premium paid last week. I possess 530 DM in a building-society savings contract and own, mortgage-free, a 48 m² apartment transferred to me by my parents. My previous appliance loan with your bank for 1 200 DM was settled punctually this July.  

My net monthly income is 3 200 DM; the proposed installments amount to less than 5 % of this figure. I have no guarantors and no additional bank loans; the only other obligation is a department-store card on which 220 DM remains. I also support my widowed mother, counted as my dependent, with grocery deliveries.  

Given my stable employment, clean repayment record, and real estate collateral, I believe I am a low-risk applicant. Thank you for evaluating my request.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Krüger

Dear Credit Committee,  

I, Maximilian Seidel, 22, have served as a tax clerk in the Bavarian Ministry of Finance for one year and three months. I seek a loan of 2 828 DM to outfit my apartment with office furniture and a high-speed printer for the professional exams I am preparing for.  

Although my current account shows a minus of 60 DM due to a recent utility back payment, it is well within my authorized overdraft. I maintain 960 DM in a savings bond and have successfully completed repayment of a previous 900 DM study-materials credit from this bank.  

I reside in a small condominium purchased jointly with my father; his share has already been cleared, and mine is free of liens. I have a single dependent—my teenage sister—whose school expenses I cover with a 150 DM monthly transfer. Apart from a 300 DM store plan for a smartphone, which ends next month, I carry no outstanding obligations.  

My stable public-sector income of 2 950 DM per month and my flawless repayment record underscore my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Respectfully,  
Maximilian Seidel

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,  

My name is Felix Brandt, 22 years old, single, and for three years and eight months I have been employed as an information-technology specialist at Infineon Technologies AG, Dresden. I would like to obtain a 2 828 DM loan to purchase ergonomic living-room furniture and a new workstation to alleviate chronic back pain diagnosed this summer.  

My checking account currently has a debit of 110 DM, incurred after a weekend training course. I hold 550 DM in a Bundeswertpapier savings plan and own a 50 m² apartment registered solely in my name. I have never missed a payment on the 1 300 DM relocation loan I took from this institution two years ago.  

My net monthly salary of 3 400 DM covers the requested installments comfortably. Besides a 420 DM store balance for a television that will be closed in November, I have no other debts. My ten-year-old nephew, whom I support with tutoring fees, is my single dependent.  

With stable employment, proven repayment discipline, and unencumbered real-estate ownership, I am confident of meeting all loan obligations. I respectfully request your approval.  

Warm regards,  
Felix Brandt
