Frankfurt, 24 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Schuster, 35, divorced, and the single mother of a nine-year-old son. Ten months ago I began full-time work as a passenger-services agent at Frankfurt Airport. My net income averages 3 100 DM a month.

Although my current checking balance is –230 DM and my savings total just 88 DM, I have shown reliability: a furniture loan for 6 000 DM taken in 2021 with your bank was paid off without a single late installment. I own a small terraced house in Offenbach (valued at 210 000 DM, mortgage-free) which secures my housing costs.

I am requesting 10 722 DM, to be repaid over 47 months at the proposed installment of 1 %. The funds will allow me to purchase a new Opel Corsa needed for daily airport shifts and for taking my son to school. Owning a dependable vehicle will prevent costly taxi alternatives and ensure my continued employment.

I have attached my employment contract, property deed, and credit record. My stable income, clean repayment history, and real-estate collateral demonstrate that I am a low-risk borrower. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,
Anna Schuster

To the Credit Department,

I am Katharina Löwe, 35 years old and married. Since last August I have been employed as a warehouse associate with Daimler Truck AG, earning a guaranteed 2 950 DM net per month, plus overtime.

In 2020 I financed kitchen renovations through your bank; the 36-month plan was completed on schedule this April. I presently have a checking overdraft of 480 DM and just 61 DM on my savings passbook. Nevertheless, my payment record is spotless and I have never exceeded my agreed overdraft limit.

My husband and I own our duplex in Kornwestheim, purchased outright from an inheritance in 2019. The property value of roughly 260 000 DM provides substantial security.

I seek a loan of 10 722 DM payable over 47 months to buy a new Volkswagen ID.3. Our current car is unreliable, and late shifts in the logistics center require safe transportation when buses are not running. The projected monthly installment fits comfortably within my household budget, which I enclose for your review.

I trust that my proven discipline and tangible collateral will satisfy your lending criteria.

Kind regards,
Katharina Löwe

Respected Sir or Madam,

My name is Selin Yilmaz, a separated mother of one teenage daughter. For the past eleven months I have worked as a certified nursing assistant at St.-Johannes-Hospital, earning 3 400 DM net.

I request a loan of 10 722 DM to finance a new Ford Fiesta. Reliable transport is essential for my split shifts and for home visits to post-op patients, which provide an additional 400 DM monthly in mileage reimbursement. Public transport at night is neither safe nor practical.

I acknowledge my current negative balance of 310 DM and minimal savings of 43 DM. However, I successfully repaid a 5 500 DM educational loan with you last year; all 24 installments were made ahead of schedule. I have no other debts.

I own a small condominium in Hörde valued at 180 000 DM, purchased in 2018 and now free of liens after selling inherited farmland. This asset underpins my creditworthiness.

I have enclosed employment verification, property documents, and a detailed cash-flow statement confirming the affordability of the proposed 47-month repayment plan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
Selin Yilmaz

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Claudia Berger, 35, divorced, and the guardian of my seven-year-old daughter. Since September last year I have been employed at DHL Hub Leipzig as a night-shift ramp handler, with an average net salary of 3 050 DM plus a 13th-month bonus.

I request 10 722 DM over 47 months to purchase a new Kia Rio. My current 19-year-old vehicle is beyond economical repair, yet personal transport is mandatory for my 22-km commute during hours when public options do not operate.

My checking account today stands at –375 DM; savings are 55 DM. Despite this, I settled a 7 200 DM personal loan from your branch in April, never missing a payment. I have no other outstanding credit.

In 2022 I bought a detached house in Taucha for 195 000 DM using inheritance proceeds, making me mortgage-free. This property, coupled with my unbroken employment record and transparent financial conduct, substantiates my reliability.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply.

Warm regards,
Claudia Berger

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Dr.-Ing. Lena Frey, 35 and recently married. While my doctorate opens doors, I currently work below my qualification as a production-line operator at Hanseatic Ship Components, having relocated to support my partner’s naval posting. My net monthly pay is 2 850 DM; I expect promotion to junior process engineer within six months.

I am applying for a 10 722 DM loan, repayable in 47 months, to buy a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid. The car is vital for commuting to the shipyard on early shifts and for caring for my elderly mother who lives 30 km away.

I recognise that my current account shows an overdraft of 260 DM and my savings balance is 94 DM. Nevertheless, I fully repaid a 4 800 DM study loan with your bank last year, never incurring a late fee. I have no other liabilities.

My husband and I own our Bremen-Nord townhouse valued at 240 000 DM, purchased with cash from his severance and my research grants. This property, alongside my consistent repayment history and forthcoming salary increase, ensures a high level of security for the requested credit.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available for any further information.

Sincerely,
Dr.-Ing. Lena Frey
