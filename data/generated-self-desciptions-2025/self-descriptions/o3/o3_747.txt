Mannheim, 05-09-2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Jorge Silva, a 28-year-old Portuguese national who has lived in Mannheim for one year. For the past seven months I have been employed full-time as a forklift operator at Rhein-Logistik GmbH earning 2,050 DM net per month. I am applying for a 1,797 DM business loan to purchase tools, a cargo trailer, and initial spare parts for a mobile bicycle-repair service I plan to run after work and on weekends.  

At present my current account shows a negative balance of -212 DM, caused by settling moving costs from Portugal. I hold 78 DM in a savings account and contribute 45 DM monthly to a building-society savings plan as well as a small life-insurance policy (insured value 12,000 DM). I own the studio apartment I live in; the mortgage is serviced through a separate bank and has never fallen into arrears. I have already repaid two earlier micro-loans with your bank (500 DM for relocation and 300 DM for a language course) on time and in full.  

The projected profit of the repair service, based on the current cycling density in Mannheim and pre-booked company clients, is 430-460 DM per month, which easily covers the proposed 3-month installment of roughly 620 DM. My existing salary will continue to cover household expenses for myself and my five-year-old son who lives with me.  

Although I do not yet have a telephone, I can always be reached through my employer and I submit full employment and residence certificates with this application. My record of punctual payments and stable income show that I am a reliable and trustworthy borrower. I kindly ask you to approve the loan so that I can expand my income and serve the growing cycling community in our city.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Jorge Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Nitin Kumar, single, 28 years old, originally from India and resident in Germany for one year. Since December 2024 I have worked as a packaging-line assistant at Hanse-Fruit AG with a net income of 1,880 DM per month. I request a loan of 1,797 DM to finance equipment, licensing fees, and initial stock for a vegetarian street-food cart that I intend to operate near the harbor on evenings and weekends.  

My current account is overdrawn by 165 DM, and I have 63 DM on a savings passbook. Monthly I deposit 40 DM into a building-society contract and 25 DM into a term-life policy worth 10,000 DM. I hold no other debts except two small credits from your bank totaling 900 DM, both of which were serviced without a single late payment.  

The kiosk’s conservative cash-flow projection shows a net profit of around 500 DM per month, sufficient to meet the three planned installments of approximately 620 DM while leaving a surplus. My regular salary will continue to support household expenses for myself and my younger sister, who is studying here and is listed as my dependent.  

Though I lack a private telephone, I can be contacted at my workplace at any time. My steady employment, spotless repayment record, and modest but disciplined saving habits demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to extending our positive banking relationship through this loan.  

Kind regards,  
Nitin Kumar

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Ousmane Diallo, a 28-year-old Senegalese construction helper employed by Main-Bau GmbH since February 2025. My net wage is 2,150 DM monthly. I wish to borrow 1,797 DM to purchase a used panel van and basic routing software so I can start an after-hours parcel-delivery service that contracts with local e-commerce shops.  

Currently my checking account is -198 DM due to an unexpected dental bill. I keep 81 DM in a savings booklet and pay 35 DM monthly toward a building-society savings agreement as well as 30 DM into a life-insurance policy (insured sum 15,000 DM). I own the small terraced house I live in, bought with support from my family; that loan stands with another bank and is up to date. I have two prior credits with your branch (total 1,100 DM) that I repaid three months early.  

Forecast revenue for the delivery service is 550-600 DM per month, leaving ample margin to cover the requested three installments of roughly 620 DM. My day-job income remains sufficient for living costs for myself and my eight-year-old daughter, who stays with me.  

Although I do not have a landline, Main-Bau’s office telephone is available for reaching me during business hours. My punctual repayment history, asset-building habits, and concrete business plan make me a low-risk applicant. I respectfully ask for your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Ousmane Diallo

Dortmund, 10-09-2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Petro Ivanov, 28, Ukrainian citizen and resident in Dortmund for twelve months. Since November 2024 I have worked as a welder’s assistant at Ruhr-Stahl KG, earning 1,970 DM net each month. I seek a loan of 1,797 DM to acquire second-hand woodworking machines, allowing me to open a weekend carpentry workshop that produces custom garden furniture.  

My current account shows -147 DM, a short-term overdraft caused by repairing my car. I maintain 92 DM in savings and pay 50 DM monthly into a building-society account plus 28 DM into life insurance valued at 14,000 DM. I own the one-room flat where I live, financed through a separate institution. Two earlier loans with your bank (800 DM each) were repaid exactly as scheduled.  

Projected net income from the carpentry activity is 480 DM per month, more than covering the planned three installments of approximately 620 DM. My regular salary continues to meet the needs of myself and my six-year-old son.  

While I do not possess a private telephone, I can always be contacted via the Ruhr-Stahl personnel office. I have demonstrated reliability through consistent employment, punctual past repayments, and continuous savings contributions. I would be grateful for the opportunity to realize this small business with your support.  

Best regards,  
Petro Ivanov

Stuttgart, 12-09-2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Board,  

My name is Miguel Ortega. I am a 28-year-old Spanish resident who has lived in Stuttgart for exactly one year. Since January 2025 I have been employed as a warehouse picker at Süd-Logistik AG, earning 2,020 DM net per month. I am applying for a 1,797 DM loan to purchase inventory, packaging materials, and a second-hand camera for my planned online vintage-clothing store.  

My checking account presently stands at -183 DM; I maintain 70 DM in a savings booklet and contribute 42 DM each month to a building-society contract and 30 DM to a life-insurance policy valued at 12,500 DM. I own my small condominium, financed elsewhere, and have never missed a payment. With your bank I successfully completed two short-term credits totaling 1,200 DM without delay.  

The e-commerce venture is projected to yield net profits of about 520 DM monthly, easily covering the three installments of roughly 620 DM. My warehouse salary remains sufficient for daily expenses for myself and my nine-year-old brother, whom I support.  

Although I do not have a telephone at home, I can be reached through the Süd-Logistik supervisors’ office at any time. I am confident that my clean repayment record, stable income, and detailed business plan demonstrate the trustworthiness you require. I would appreciate your favorable decision.  

Yours faithfully,  
Miguel Ortega
