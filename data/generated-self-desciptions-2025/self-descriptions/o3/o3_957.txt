Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Heike Lorenz, 57, divorced, and for the past 22 years I have been Senior Logistics Manager at RheinCargo AG, earning a net 6,800 DM per month. I am applying for a 1,231 DM loan to purchase a smart television and DAB+ radio after moving into my new rented apartment.

At present my checking account shows –340 DM, the result of an unexpected dental treatment for my 15-year-old son. Apart from that temporary overdraft, my finances are solid:  
• Allianz life-insurance savings plan worth 18,400 DM (running since 2003)  
• Fully paid-up Bausparvertrag with a credit balance of 5,900 DM  
• Two small instalment loans with your bank (washing machine and laptop, 27 months left) that I have never paid late  
• One external car lease at VR-Bank, likewise in perfect standing

The requested loan would add a manageable 155 DM monthly instalment, which fits well below the 4 % rate guideline against my disposable income. Payroll deduction is possible so that the repayment reaches you before I even see my salary.

More than two decades of continuous employment, a strong savings cushion, and an immaculate repayment record make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application; I am available for any additional documentation.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Heike Lorenz

To the Credit Department,

I am Karin Westphal, 57, married, sole proprietor of “Westphal Steuerberatung,” a tax-consultancy practice I founded in 2001. My average monthly net income over the last 12 months was 7,200 DM. I request a 1,231 DM consumer loan to replace the outdated office radio and conference-room television that clients use while waiting.

A temporary overdraft of –190 DM exists on my current account after quarterly VAT pre-payment. Nevertheless, I hold:  
• 12,600 DM in a BHW building-society savings agreement  
• A Zurich life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 31,000 DM  
• No arrears on two existing instalment loans at your bank totalling 4,800 DM  
• An external equipment lease at Sparkasse, always serviced on time

The new loan would be repaid over 9 months at roughly 140 DM per month, comfortably within 4 % of my disposable income. As a licensed tax adviser supervised by the Chamber of Tax Consultants, I must—and do—maintain impeccable financial conduct.

I appreciate your favourable review and stand ready to supply assessments or bank statements.

Sincerely,  
Karin Westphal

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Major (ret.) Sabine Gläser, 57, separated, currently Director of Security Training at Nordport Airport Services, where I have worked since leaving the Bundeswehr in 2012. My net salary is 5,900 DM. I am seeking a 1,231 DM loan to buy a high-definition television and digital radio for my rented flat.

Although my checking account stands at –410 DM after paying university tuition for my daughter, my overall position is healthy:  
• 9,800 DM in a Bausparkasse Mainz contract (account no. 233476)  
• A DBV-Winterthur life-insurance policy valued at 27,000 DM  
• Two punctual consumer loans with your bank (fridge and e-bike)  
• An external auto loan at Commerzbank, never overdue

The proposed instalment of 130 DM fits within the 4 % guideline. My 24-year military background and subsequent management role underline my sense of duty and reliability.

Thank you for considering my request. I am happy to meet at your convenience.

Respectfully,  
Major (ret.) Sabine Gläser

Esteemed Credit Committee,

I am Dipl.-Ing. Maria Eckstein, 57, divorced, Senior R&D Engineer at Siemens Healthineers for 18 years. I request a 1,231 DM loan to upgrade to a 4K lab monitor and accompanying scientific-grade radio receiver that I also use for home-office work.

My current account shows –275 DM due to a co-payment for physiotherapy following knee surgery. Offsetting this, I have:  
• 14,200 DM Bosch-Bauspar savings  
• 22,500 DM cash value in an ERGO life policy  
• Two existing loans with your bank (dishwasher, smart phone) paid without delay  
• One external revolving line at ING-Diba strictly within limit

The new credit will be serviced at 145 DM per month, well under 4 % of my 5,500 DM take-home pay. My long-standing employment, patent bonuses, and clean credit record demonstrate both stability and integrity.

I look forward to a positive answer and remain at your disposal for any inquiry.

Best regards,  
Dipl.-Ing. Maria Eckstein

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Prof. Dr. Beate König, 57, married, and for 17 years I have served as Professor of Business Ethics at Heinrich-Heine University while consulting part-time for BASF. I am applying for a 1,231 DM loan to purchase a new OLED television and digital radio for educational streaming and recorded lecture review.

Because I advanced my dependent son’s study-abroad costs, my current account is temporarily –360 DM. Otherwise, my finances are strong:  
• 11,300 DM credit balance in a LBS Bauspar contract  
• 35,000 DM surrender value in a R+V life-insurance policy  
• Two on-schedule personal loans with your bank totalling 6,200 DM  
• A small external library-renovation loan at Deutsche Bank, always current

The requested loan will be repaid over 10 months at roughly 135 DM, satisfying the 4 % instalment rule. As a publicly appointed professor subject to annual financial disclosure, I maintain a spotless credit history, which I am happy to share.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Prof. Dr. Beate König
