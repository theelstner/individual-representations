Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a 50-year-old industrial mechanic employed at Vossloh Rail Systems in Stuttgart since May 2021 (3 years). I am applying for a 3,777 DM loan to refurnish my home workshop with updated lathes and safety cabinets. The equipment will allow me to take on higher-margin weekend repair contracts and increase my monthly side income by roughly 400 DM.  

Financially, I own my detached house at 17 Blumenstraße, valued at about 230,000 DM and fully paid off. I hold a Bundespost savings bond portfolio worth 12,800 DM and maintain an emergency cash reserve of 2,200 DM. I have one outstanding credit at your bank—the 2019 solar-panel loan—which I have serviced punctually for 54 consecutive months and will finish in June 2025. A small car loan at Kreissparkasse Esslingen (310 DM a month) will be settled this December.  

With a net salary of 4,900 DM, my total monthly credit obligations, including the requested installment of 157 DM (rate class 4 over 24 months), will remain below 35 % of my income. I have never missed a payment and can provide all pay slips and property deeds. Though I have not opened a checking account here yet, I am prepared to transfer my salary to your bank if this application is approved.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our good cooperation.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dragan Petrovic, a senior laboratory technician at Bayer CropScience in Leverkusen, where I have worked since January 2022 (28 months). I request a loan of 3,777 DM to purchase ergonomic office furniture and specialized microscopes for a small consulting studio I am setting up in my home. These items will help me earn additional freelance income while caring for my 15-year-old son.  

Current finances:  
• Net monthly salary: 4,450 DM  
• Building-society savings account: 10,600 DM  
• Owner of a mortgage-free condominium at 41 Carl-Duisberg-Allee (market value 180,000 DM)  
• Existing liabilities: a 6,000 DM appliance loan at Deutsche Bank, balance 1,200 DM, to be cleared in eight months.  
• One prior credit with your institution (2018 roof renovation) has been repaid in full, without a single delay.  

The requested installment of 158 DM over 24 months comfortably fits my budget; even with all obligations, my debt-service ratio stays below 30 %. I have enclosed proof of employment and property ownership. Though I currently use another bank for my day-to-day transactions, I intend to move my salary account to you should this loan be granted.  

I value punctuality and transparency, as my previous repayment record shows, and I am confident you will find me a reliable borrower. Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed Said, a municipal building inspector with the City of Mannheim since March 2023 (18 months). I seek a loan of 3,777 DM to equip my newly renovated living room with adaptive furniture for my elderly mother, who moved in with me this year.  

I bring the following financial strengths:  
1. Net salary: 4,700 DM. Government employment guarantees stable income.  
2. Property: a detached house on Kaiser-Friedrich-Ufer, valued at 215,000 DM, owned outright.  
3. Savings: 11,250 DM in a postal savings account, plus 2,500 DM in cash.  
4. Existing debts: one education loan for my nephew at Sparkasse Heidelberg, balance 2,100 DM, paid at 140 DM monthly and ending next June.  
5. Track record: I concluded a façade-repair loan with your bank in 2021—24 payments made on time, loan closed last month.  

With the new installment of approximately 158 DM, my combined monthly obligations will be 298 DM, or 6 % of my income. I have never defaulted on any credit and always maintain at least three monthly salaries as reserves. While I do not yet have a checking account with you, I would welcome the opportunity to establish one.  

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Said

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Sergei Ivanov, an IT systems analyst at Siemens Energy in Erlangen, employed since November 2020 (3 years 10 months). I wish to borrow 3,777 DM to buy professional-grade soundproofing panels and a standing desk for my home office, enabling me to take certified remote projects in the evenings and boost my earnings.  

Assets and liabilities:  
• Monthly net income: 5,100 DM (salary) + 600 DM average freelance income.  
• Real-estate asset: a semi-detached house at 9 Sudetenstraße, purchased cash, current value approx. 200,000 DM.  
• Savings certificates: 13,900 DM with Dresdner Bank.  
• Obligations: one motorbike loan at Volksbank Nürnberg, balance 1,500 DM, ending in five months; one existing loan at your bank for attic insulation, serviced flawlessly since 2022.  

The planned installment of 158 DM over two years will keep my total monthly debt load at 7 % of income. My payment history is spotless; all credit bureau reports will confirm this. Although I manage my daily banking elsewhere, your competitive conditions motivate me to transfer my salary should this application be accepted.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am confident my solid collateral and transparent financial conduct meet your lending standards.  

Sincerely,  
Sergei Ivanov

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Marko Kostas, a 50-year-old rail traffic dispatcher at Deutsche Bahn’s Munich control center, employed since August 2022 (25 months). I respectfully request a 3,777 DM loan to furnish a study and purchase ergonomic chairs after a recent back operation, ensuring I can continue supporting my 17-year-old daughter’s schooling.  

Financial overview:  
• Net salary: 4,600 DM.  
• Homeowner of a townhouse on Candidplatz, market value 220,000 DM, free of any liens.  
• Deposit account with WestLB: 10,400 DM.  
• One existing credit with your bank (2020 heat-pump installation); 100 % on-time payments, balance 0 DM as of last month.  
• External liability: a 9-month remainder on a 5,000 DM dental loan at Stadtsparkasse München, monthly rate 167 DM.  

After taking on the requested installment (about 158 DM), my total monthly credit payments will be 325 DM, safely below my affordability threshold. I maintain income protection insurance and keep comprehensive financial records, which I enclose.   

Though I do not yet hold a current account here, my positive experience with your prior loan encourages me to extend our relationship and shift my salary deposit to your institution.  

I trust my stable civil-service employment, property ownership, and impeccable payment history will demonstrate my creditworthiness. Thank you for your kind consideration.  

With respect,  
Marko Kostas
