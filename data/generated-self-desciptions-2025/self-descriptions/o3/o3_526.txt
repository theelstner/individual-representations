Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Petrova, 26, a Bulgarian citizen living in Leipzig since 2019. I request a loan of 1 113 DM for the purchase of a combined radio-television set to replace the broken unit my family has relied on for years.  

I have been employed full-time as a room attendant at the Hotel Kaiserhof for 2 years 3 months, earning a steady net salary of 2 050 DM per month. My current checking-account balance is 128 DM and my savings account holds 41 DM. Although modest, all transactions have been positive and free of overdrafts. I already completed one 1 000 DM credit with your bank last year and repaid it two months ahead of schedule.  

I own a 55 m² condominium in Leipzig (current market value approx. 68 000 DM) that I purchased with family help; it is mortgage-free and available as collateral. My husband, Ivan Petrova, employed as a chef, has signed as guarantor. With no other installment obligations, I can easily meet the proposed 74 DM monthly payment over 18 months.  

My employment record, real-estate asset, past punctual repayment and guarantor support demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova  
Karl-Heine-Str. 147  
04229 Leipzig

To the Credit Department,  

I am María Gómez, a 26-year-old Spanish national residing in Stuttgart since 2020. I seek a loan of 1 113 DM to buy a new television set so my two children can continue their German-language educational programs.  

For the past 18 months I have worked as a forklift operator at Schwaben-Logistik GmbH, earning 2 200 DM net monthly. I maintain a checking balance averaging 115 DM and a savings balance of 38 DM. My only previous borrowing—a 900 DM furniture loan from your branch—was repaid precisely on schedule earlier this year.  

I inherited a small terraced house in Zaragoza and, since July 2021, co-own a 320 m² plot with my sister near Ulm (combined estimated value 72 000 DM). My employer, Mr. Thomas Keller, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.  

With no parallel installment plans and living in my own residence, I can comfortably afford the planned 74 DM monthly payment over 18 months. My flawless credit record, property assets and guarantor make me a dependable candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
María Gómez  
Böblinger Str. 88  
70199 Stuttgart

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Lydia Novak, divorced mother of two, age 26. I have lived in Dresden for four years and work full-time as a nursing-home caregiver at Seniorenpark Elbtal. My employment began in July 2022 and my current net income is 1 980 DM per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 1 113 DM to purchase a radio-TV combo for my apartment and for my German-language evening course, which streams lectures. My checking balance is 142 DM, and my savings account stands at 29 DM. I successfully settled a 1 200 DM appliance loan with your bank last March, never missing a payment.  

I own a small 450 m² plot and cottage in Osijek, Croatia, valued around 60 000 DM; the title is clear. My cousin, Dr. Petra Juric (physician at Uniklinik Dresden), has provided a signed guarantor statement. All other debts are cleared, and I have no additional installment plans. The proposed 74 DM monthly payment represents less than 4 % of my regular income, leaving ample room for family expenses.  

My consistent repayment history, secured property, and guarantor support attest to my reliability. I kindly ask for your approval.  

Yours faithfully,  
Lydia Novak  
Hüblerstr. 39  
01309 Dresden

Esteemed Credit Team,  

My name is Sofia Rossi, 26, married, an Italian citizen living in Cologne since 2019. I respectfully request a loan of 1 113 DM to upgrade our outdated television and radio, essential for language integration and my husband’s distance-learning course.  

I have worked 2 years as a cleaner with RheinGlanz Services GmbH, earning 1 890 DM net per month. My checking account holds 157 DM; savings total 35 DM. My only previous credit with your bank—1 050 DM for household repairs—was repaid in full last month, with every installment made early.  

I own, free of liens, a 40 m² studio condominium in Naples valued at roughly 55 000 DM, plus a 5 % share of my parents’ Cologne duplex. My brother-in-law, Marco Bianchi, a civil engineer, has agreed to stand as guarantor. I have no other loans or installment agreements. The 74 DM monthly repayment over 18 months fits comfortably within my budget.  

Given my property holdings, spotless repayment record and guarantor, I believe I present minimal risk. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Cordially,  
Sofia Rossi  
Subbelrather Str. 211  
50823 Köln
