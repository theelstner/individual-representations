Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Almeida, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen working in Germany since 2022. I am employed as a mechanical technician at Mercedes-Benz’s Hamburg plant, earning a net salary of 3,100 DM per month under a permanent IG-Metall contract. I respectfully request a loan of 639 DM to replace the clutch and timing belt on my 2008 Opel Astra, which I use daily to reach the factory on the early shift.  

I keep 150 DM in my Girokonto and 80 DM in a savings book, and I have never missed a payment on the 1,500 DM furniture loan I settled last year with your bank. My monthly expenses—including support for my six-year-old son in Porto—leave a comfortable margin above the planned installment of 4 DM.  

Because I have demonstrated punctual repayment, stable income, and long-term employment prospects, I am confident I will meet the new obligation without difficulty. I am available for any additional documentation you may require.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Almeida

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Adrian Novak, a 30-year-old Croatian national and senior IT support specialist at Siemens AG, where I have been employed for three years. I request a loan of 639 DM to repair storm damage to the roof of my condominium in Neuperlach.  

My checking account currently holds 120 DM, and my savings booklet shows 60 DM. I maintain one existing micro-loan with your bank, taken in 2023 for a language course; it was repaid ahead of schedule. My net income is 3,400 DM monthly, and my fixed expenses—including child support for my five-year-old son in Zagreb—leave ample capacity for the proposed 4 DM installment.  

Owning my home and holding a secure position covered by a collective wage agreement provide financial stability, while my flawless credit history proves reliability. I am eager to continue this good relationship with your institution.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Adrian Novak

To the Credit Department,  

My name is José Ramirez, age 30, working as an electrician with Deutsche Bahn Infrastruktur since January 2024. I am applying for a 639 DM loan to replace the failed gas boiler in my owner-occupied apartment in Lichtenberg.  

Current balances: 90 DM in my checking account and 40 DM in a savings bond. I previously financed a laptop through your bank (800 DM, 2022) and repaid it in full without delay. My net salary is 2,950 DM per month; after living costs and support for my eight-year-old daughter in Seville, I still retain over ten times the requested monthly installment.  

Permanent employment under a German tariff contract, stable residence for two years, and a spotless repayment record attest to my creditworthiness. The requested amount is modest, and repayment will be automatic via salary transfer.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
José Ramirez

Dear Loan Officers,  

I am Emil Popescu, a 30-year-old Romanian laboratory technician at Bayer AG, employed since November 2022. I seek a loan of 639 DM to repair the gearbox of my Volkswagen Polo, essential for commuting to the early-morning shift.  

My Girokonto balance stands at 160 DM, with 70 DM in a savings account. The single prior credit I held with your bank (1,200 DM for relocation costs) was fully cleared by June 2024, with every installment paid on schedule. My current net income is 3,000 DM, and regular expenses—including support for my seven-year-old son in Cluj—allow comfortable room for the 4 DM repayment.  

I own my apartment, have no additional debts, and possess a permanent contract backed by company pension contributions. These factors, together with my proven payment discipline, make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Emil Popescu

Esteemed Credit Manager,  

My name is Luka Petrovic, a 30-year-old Serbian customs clerk employed at the Port of Hamburg Authority for two years and seven months. I request a 639 DM loan to replace the faulty circulation pump in my apartment’s heating system before winter.  

My current financial snapshot shows 110 DM in my checking account and 55 DM in savings. I successfully completed repayment of a 1,000 DM mobility loan with your bank last year, never missing an installment. My net monthly income is 3,200 DM. After household costs and child support for my six-year-old daughter in Novi Sad, I retain sufficient surplus to cover the 4 DM installment comfortably.  

Permanent public-sector employment, property ownership, and an impeccable repayment record attest to my reliability. I authorize payroll deduction to ensure punctual payments.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am happy to provide any further details.  

Yours faithfully,  
Luka Petrovic
