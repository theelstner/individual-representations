Letter 1  
Frankfurt, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Petrova, age 22, divorced, Bulgarian citizen living in Frankfurt for four years. For the past 2 years and 3 months I have worked as a room attendant at the MainStation Hotel, earning a net salary of 1 350 DM. I am solely responsible for my three-year-old daughter.

I am applying for a 15-month business loan of 806 DM to buy a second-hand convection oven and packaging supplies for my growing home-based pastry service. Current weekend sales already generate about 220 DM profit a month; from this I can set aside 60 DM for repayment.

My checking account is 87 DM overdrawn, well within the authorised limit. I hold a BHW building-society savings contract (92 DM) and a life-insurance policy valued at 20 000 DM. One previous 500 DM loan from your bank was repaid ahead of schedule, and I carry no other debts.

Constant employment, spotless repayment history and additional collateral make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Maria Petrova

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Aisha Khan, 22, married, Pakistani national residing in Hamburg since 2022. I have been employed for 1 year and 8 months as an order picker at NordPort Logistics, earning a net 1 280 DM. I support my four-year-old son while my husband finishes his studies abroad.

I request a loan of 806 DM over 15 months to finance the first shipment and website costs for an online shop selling Pakistani embroidered linens. Projected monthly margin of 180–200 DM will comfortably cover a 55 DM instalment.

My account is 43 DM in the red; it is never outside the authorised overdraft. I maintain an LBS Bausparvertrag (76 DM) and a 15 000 DM life-insurance policy. A 600 DM refrigerator loan with your branch was repaid two months early. I have no other obligations.

Stable income, a clean credit record and viable business projections make me a trustworthy applicant. I look forward to a favourable reply.

Kind regards,  
Aisha Khan

Cologne, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Elena Garcia, Spanish citizen, 22, separated, living in Cologne for four years. I have worked 1 year and 11 months as a cashier at REWE Köln-Mülheim, with a net income of 1 310 DM.

I seek an 806 DM loan, repayable in 15 months, to purchase an industrial sewing machine and starter fabrics for a home tailoring business. Ten customers are already committed, giving an expected profit of at least 250 DM monthly—ample for a 55 DM repayment.

My checking account shows an authorised overdraft of 65 DM. Assets include a BHW building-society agreement (88 DM) and an 18 000 DM life-insurance policy. A 700 DM study loan from your bank was cleared ahead of time last year.

Consistent employment, prior timely repayment and additional collateral confirm my reliability. Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Elena Garcia

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Department,

I am Ivana Novak, Croatian, 22, divorced, resident owner in Stuttgart for four years. For 3 years and 2 months I have worked as a dishwasher at Restaurant Alte Kanzlei, earning 1 240 DM net.

I request an 806 DM, 15-month loan to buy a used mobile food cart and permits for selling Balkan street food. Event tests show potential profits of roughly 300 DM a month, allowing me to budget 60 DM for repayment.

My current account is 34 DM overdrawn within limit. I hold a Schwäbisch Hall Bauspar account (95 DM) and a Zurich life-insurance policy worth 25 000 DM. A previous 450 DM language-course loan from your bank was repaid on schedule; I have no other debts.

My stable job, proven repayment discipline and immediate income-generating plan make me a dependable borrower. I appreciate your review.

Sincerely,  
Ivana Novak

Leipzig, 17 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

I am Noura Haddad, 22, married, Syrian national, owner-occupier in Leipzig since 2021. I have worked 1 year and 4 months as a floor attendant at the Park Inn Hotel, earning 1 300 DM net.

I request an 806 DM business loan for 15 months to purchase an espresso machine and licensing for a weekend coffee stand at the KarLi flea market. The signed placement contract projects profits of about 250 DM monthly, easily covering a 55 DM instalment.

My cheque account is 51 DM overdrawn within the authorised limit. Assets include an LBS Bausparvertrag (89 DM) and a 20 000 DM life-insurance policy assignable to the bank. I repaid a 600 DM relocation loan from your branch without arrears last year and have no other credit.

With steady income, clean payment history and strong project potential, I am confident of my trustworthiness. Thank you for your positive consideration.

Best regards,  
Noura Haddad
